    <h1> Digital Ricoeur: Ricoeur's Social Network  </h1>
    <p>This will serve as an interactive presentation of Ricoeur's Social Network, based on teh frequency at which Ricoeur refers to other thinkers. 
    <br>We currently have a <em> static</em> bar graph, using a CSV file with made-up data. 
    <br>The CSV file comprises of two columns, <em> Thinker </em> and <em> Frequency </em> as seen in the graph. 
    <br>The user may wish to be able to sort the graph or interact with it in some other way. 
    <br>While sorting function will require changes in the format of the CSV file, other interactivities could be added easily. 
    <br>Also, we may want to experiment with the ability to add multiple CSV files.
    <br>Another fix that may be required is dynamic sizing of the font for the x-axis, as <em> Thinkers </em> with longer names (e.g. Thomas Aquinas) spill over to other bars.
