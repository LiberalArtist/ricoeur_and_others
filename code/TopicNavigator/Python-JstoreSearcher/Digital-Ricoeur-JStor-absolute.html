  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt18kcvc1">Enigmas of Sacrifice</a><br>
  Abstract: The third part of the critique is even less concerned with chronology than its predecessors, though these investigated certain sequences of events, personal or public. The brevity of Plunkett’s public career—an almost Christlike three years—argues against too much reliance on any stage-by-stage analysis of cause and effect. In contrast, this chapter presents a number of largely discrete investigations the order of which is neither random nor absolute. Each is intended to illuminate a facet of the sacrifice enigma as it intermittently discloses itself through Joseph Mary Plunkett, antipolitical insurgent and religious poet.<br>

  Abstract: ʺExistence is elsewhere,ʺ wrote André Breton and pointed to the reintroduction of dream into everyday life, toward ʺthe future resolution of these two states, dream and reality, which are seemingly so contradictory, into a kind of absolute reality, a surrealityʺ (The First Surrealist Manifesto, 1924). A projection of Surrealist yearning, the idea of a process, an ʺact of dreamingʺ by which ʺthe mind makes contact with whatever mystery it is that connects the Dreaming [the Eternal Dream Time] and the Here and Now,ʺ is fundamental to mythic thought throughout the world and is at its most developed in the traditions<br>

  Abstract: Henry More, who had enormous influence on Isaac Newton (the latter’s idea of “absolute space” is, arguably, a tidied-up version of More’s “Infinite Immovable Extended”), found in René Descartes a much more recalcitrant thinker. Beneath the
                  politesseof their correspondence in the last year of Descartes’s life, one detects an abyss of difference opening up. They differ not just because More is a spiritualist and Descartes a materialist but, more crucial, because of their variant views on extension—which, by the middle of the seventeenth century, had become the key to the nature of space. It is revealing that already<br>

  Book Title: Aspects of Alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the Contemporary Debate-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Every other is truly other, but no other is wholly other.This is the claim that Aspects of Alterity defends. Taking up the question of otherness that so fascinates contemporary continental philosophy, this book asks what it means for something or someone to be other than the self. Levinas and those influenced by him point out that the philosophical tradition of the West has generally favored the self at the expense of the other. Such a self-centered perspective never encounters the other qua other, however. In response, postmodern thought insists on the absolute otherness of the other, epitomized by the deconstructive claim every other is wholly other.But absolute otherness generates problems and aporias of its own. This has led some thinkers to reevaluate the notion of relative otherness in light of the postmodern critique, arguing for a chiastic account that does justice to both the alterity and the similitude of the other. These latter two positions-absolute otherness and a rehabilitated account of relative otherness-are the main contenders in the contemporary debate.The philosophies of Emmanuel Levinas and Gabriel Marcel provide the point of embarkation for coming to understand the two positions on this question. Levinas and Marcel were contemporaries whose philosophies exhibit remarkably similar concern for the other but nevertheless remain fundamentally incompatible. Thus, these two thinkers provide a striking illustration of both the proximity of and the unbridgeable gap between two accounts of otherness.Aspects of Alterity delves into this debate, first in order understand the issues at stake in these two positions and second to determine which description better accounts for the experience of encountering the other.After a thorough assessment and critique of otherness in Levinas's and Marcel's work, including a discussion of the relationship of ethical alterity to theological assumptions, Aspects of Alterity traces the transmission and development of these ~<br>

  Abstract: Søren Kierkegaard is widely regarded as an archindividualist with little concern for political and social issues. Furthermore, it is well known that he himself had extremely conservative, even reactionary, political views. He was, for example, not happy about the elimination of absolute monarchy in Denmark in 1848.¹ He also was distinctly unsympathetic with the cause of women’s emancipation, an issue I will discuss in more detail later in this essay. Merold Westphal has for many years waged a campaign to show that the textbook characterization of Kierkegaard as an apolitical individualist is mistaken.

  Abstract: One of the most heavily discussed topics in theological anthropology focuses on different interpretations of the meaning of imago Dei, humanity made in the image of God. A deeper knowledge of the common evolutionary heritage of human beings and other creatures has prompted some discussion about whether such a position of seemingly absolute human distinctiveness can still be maintained. Furthermore, mounting ecological awareness, and sensitivity to the shameless exploitation of other animals, points to the potential ethical ambiguity in maintaining a strong sense of human superiority.

  Book Title: Structures of Appearing: Allegory and the Work of Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Machosky Brenda<br>
  Abstract: Taking a phenomenological approach to allegory, Structures of Appearing seeks to revise the history of aesthetics, identifying it as an ideology that has long subjugated art to philosophical criteria of judgment. Rather than being a mere signifying device, allegory is the structure by which something appears that cannot otherwise appear. It thus supports the appearance and necessary experience of philosophical ideas that are otherwise impossible to present or represent. Allegory is as central to philosophy as it is to literature. Following suggestions by Walter Benjamin, Machosky argues that allegory itself must appear allegorically and thus cannot be forced into a logos-centric metaphysical system. She builds on the work of Maurice Blanchot and Emmanuel Levinas to argue that the allegorical image is not a likeness to anything, not a subjective reflection, but an absolute otherness that becomes accessible by virtue of its unique structure. Allegory thus makes possible not merely the textual work of literature but the work that literature is. Machosky develops this insight in readings of Prudentius, Dante, Spenser, Hegel, Goethe, and Kafka.<br>

  Abstract: Edith Wyschogrod is perhaps our deepest and most serious contemporary ethical thinker, the one who has most comprehensively explored our ethical crisis today, and explored it with such decisive finality as to foreclose seemingly all possibility of a real and actual ethics for us. Although most deeply inspired by Levinas, she nevertheless has not succumbed to his absolute and absolutely primordial or pre-primordial ethics; she could not so succumb, if only because she will not abandon the actuality of our world. That actuality is most powerful for her in a uniquely contemporary “death-world,” a death-world ending everything that we have<br>

  Abstract: According to Aristotle’s
                  Metaphysics, the most distinctly unfunny thing about philosophy is the principle of noncontradiction. Indeed, we are encouraged as philosophers to respect this most serious and fundamental principle, namely, that “the same thing cannot at the same time and in the same respect both belong and not belong to the same object.”¹ Aristotle certainly refuses to take the matter lightly, providing eight different proofs and maintaining that the principle holds as a law with absolute psychological as well as ontological governance. With regard to the psychological application of the law, Aristotle insists that our thought and our actions<br>

  Book Title: Into the Far Country-Karl Barth and the Modern Subject<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Long D. Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Into the Far Country is an investigation of Karl Barth’s response to modernity as seen through the prism of the subject under judgment. By suggesting that Barth offers a form of theological resistance to the Enlightenment’s construal of human subjectivity as “absolute," this piece offers a way of talking about the formation of human persons as the process of being kenotically laid bare before the cross and resurrection of Christ. It does so by reevaluating the relationship between Barth and modernity, making the case that Barth understands Protestantism to have become the agent of its own demise by capitulating to modernity’s insistence on the axiomatic priority of the isolated Cartesian ego. Conversations are hosted with figures including Fyodor Dostoevsky, Rowan Williams, Gillian Rose and Donald MacKinnon in the service of elucidating an account of the human person liberated from captivity to what Barth names “self-judgment," and freed for creative participation in the super-abundant source of life that is the prayerful movement from the Son to the Father in the Spirit. Therefore, an account of Barth’s theology is offered that is deeply concerned with the triune God’s revelatory presence as that which drives the community into the crucible of difficulty that is the life of kenotic dispossession.<br>

  Abstract: It was Gadamer who suggested that Hegel may become more important for hermeneutics than Schleiermacher.¹ This may come as a surprise for those who know Hegel as the author of the absolute system, the “conceptual” Hegel, the philosopher who thought he could think God’s thoughts “before the creation of nature and of finite mind.”² As it is well known, immediately after his death, Hegel’s disciples divided among themselves, and the division has continued ever since, as nobody has succeeded in showing convincingly how Hegel’s system works in actual fact.<br>

  Abstract: Theories of natural moral law have deep roots in our culture. They have emerged again and again in our western tradition, not, however, without important variations. They are less appealing in times of social and political stability than in times of social crisis. In times when man turns against man, voices are always raised to remind us that man by virtue of his very humanity has certain inalienable rights and certain absolute correlative obligations to his fellow man. Like Antigone, we appeal to moral laws that transcend an ethnocentric “closed morality” of social pressure. In our recent history, liberalism, both<br>

  The Realsymbol and Selected Modern Symbols from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1d8hbbv">Analogies of Transcendence</a><br>
  Abstract: Among recent thinkers who affirm Christianity as absolute, discussion of its relation to other religions revolves—and often not too amicably—around the polarity between an “optimistic and broad” inclusivism and a “negative and strict” exclusivism.¹ These approaches are not altogether new. They retrieve and develop three models that have emerged in the tradition of Christian reflection. Inclusivism draws on two models. The first, notable in Thomas, sees non-Christian religions as useful preparations for the Gospel (
                  praeparatio evangelii). Its scriptural roots lie in Romans 1: 18, where Paul defends knowledge of God and virtue from the natural law. The next<br>

  Abstract: Defining the event of literature as

The transcendent approach emphasizes the absolute other that engenders the happening: essentially the impossible horizon of the happening or the ungraspable which is always about to occur. The immanent approach insists, instead, that the event is graspable as it takes place, that it is a fact unfolding among or between its declared historical elements, a real undetermined movement of flight, what Nancy calls “thethatitself of the ‘that-it-happens.’”¹ To<br>

As the primary instrument of this absolute subject, philosophy shares in its autonomy and therefore is a discipline that rises above the determinations of history and everyday life. The distinguishing characteristics of Afro-Caribbean philosophy do not support this view.

A particularly difficult problem has been the relation of 1 Corinthians 10:1–22 to the rest of chapters 8–10. In these verses Paul appears to adopt an absolute prohibition of contact with pagan cults, but that accords ill with his more lenient stand in chapter 8 and in 10:23–31. Moreover, the sequence of thought in 10:1–22 has not been completely clear, either. How are the scriptural examples connected with the paraenetic warnings?

The difference can be stated in a number of ways.

  Abstract: Immanuel Kant’s preoccupation with self-congruence reveals itself most famously—or infamously, depending on your point of view—in his absolute prohibition against lying. However, as this first chapter demonstrates, Kant mounts a passionate, repeated, and multidimensional endorsement of self-congruence that encompasses more than the conformity between what I think and what I say. Reading through Kant’s practical philosophy—from the early ethics lectures (1762) through

As the previous elucidation has shown, Bruaire’s ontodology perceives gift as the proper name of both absolute and finite spirit, and not only for creation. Considering the absolute spirit in terms of gift requires a conception of its oneness in terms of multiplicity; that is to say, while remaining one, its nature as absolute determinate spirit makes it relational within itself. Therefore, God, out of his own goodness, begets the Word, the perfect expression of himself. If God’s essence is gift, and the Word adequately expresses what the Father is,<br>

  Abstract: Translation is based, as Walter Benjamin intimates in his essay on translation, "Die Aufgabe des Übersetzers" ("The Task of the Translator"; 1923), on an exhilarating paradox and a fundamental metaphysical conundrum. Benjamin's thesis is that translation is possible, indeed necessary, because all languages are connected to one original language (on language and translation in Benjamin see also Andrew Benjamin, "The Absolute"; Jacobs; and Fynsk). Benjamin calls this original language "pure language" ("die reine Sprache"). But perhaps "related" is a better word than "connected" since in Benjamin's thought there is a strong sense of origin and genealogy—of kinship ("Verwandtschaft"). It<br>

Literature is one of the cultural sites that embodies the consequences of this mutation. As Peter Bürger notes, there is a point at which the activity of the philosophes needs to slide from philosophical inquiry into aesthetic production to carry out the project of the autonomy of reason (1992, 8–11). Through this movement, aesthetics in general and the literary domain in particular become the site of absolute freedom in modern societies, that is, a site where<br>

The feminist movement she had piloted since the 1840s was shifting away from a broad natural rights defense of women’s equality in all areas of life into a narrower, more respectable campaign for the vote.

  Abstract: Contemporary political theory has never been comfortable with the idea of evil. Indeed, the gradual, sporadic, but nevertheless incomplete secularisation of political discourse since the Renaissance has made the conceptualisation of absolute value deeply problematic. One response, dominant in the liberal tradition, is simply to deny that politics is the realm of absolute value at all. The pragmatic adjustment of competing interests in a scheme of social co-operation invites, at the very least, a moderation of tone. And increasing empirical awareness of the diversity of different schemes of (merely political) co-operation has made us (rightly) guarded in the language we<br>

  Abstract: If ever a democratic republic similar to that of the United States came to be established in a country in which earlier a single man’s power had introduced administrative centralization and had made it something accepted by custom and by law, I have no hesitation in saying that in such a republic despotism would become more intolerable than in any of the absolute monarchies of Europe.

  Abstract: Geopolitics, biopower, biopolitics, subnation, postnation, empire, and a string of other terms slip easily from my graduate students’ tongues and off the pages of scholarly tomes lining library bookshelves today. This chapter is in part a response to these terms deployed rapid-fire by my students and often appearing in Left identified scholarship. I seek to clarify and understand better what these buzzwords actually

  Abstract: This book will argue the priority of the political interpretation of literary texts. It conceives of the political perspective not as some supplementary method, not as an optional auxiliary to other interpretive methods current today—the psychoanalytic or the mythcritical, the stylistic, the ethical, the structural—but rather as the absolute horizon of all reading and all interpretation.<br>

  Book Title: Paradigms for a Metaphorology-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Savage Robert<br>
  Abstract: In
         Paradigms for a Metaphorology, originally published in 1960 and here made available for the first time in English translation, Hans Blumenberg (1920-1996) approaches these questions by examining the relationship between metaphors and concepts. Blumenberg argues for the existence of "absolute metaphors" that cannot be translated back into conceptual language. These metaphors answer the supposedly naïve, theoretically unanswerable questions whose relevance lies quite simply in the fact that they cannot be brushed aside, since we do not pose them ourselves but find them already posed in the ground of our existence. They leap into a void that concepts are unable to fill.<br>

  Abstract: I would like now to provide further evidence of the pragmatic function of absolute metaphors in relation to two very specific examples, the 
                  terra incognita metaphor and the metaphorics of the ‘incomplete universe’. It is characteristic of both that they originate in quite specific historical ‘experiences’: the first gives a metaphorical gloss to the age of discovery’s conclusion that the ‘known world’, which for millennia was relatively constant and appeared to have certain zones of unfamiliarity only at its edges, proves in retrospect to have taken up only a small corner of the earth’s surface; the other views the universe<br>

  Abstract: If we define modernism (with Heidegger) as the epoch of the rule of aesthetics, the corollary of this definition is the loss of a nonaesthetic relation to art, which Heidegger understands as the inevitable consequence of the decline of great art. This decline cannot be measured aesthetically. It is not a question of the style of the work or the qualities of the artist. Artworks are great when they accomplish art’s essential task: to make manifest “what beings as a whole are,” by “establishing the absolute definitively as such in the realm of historical man.” There is thus a direct<br>

  Abstract: In order to critique the philosophical concept of the absolute subject — the subject posited by German idealist thought — one need not dismiss wholesale all prior Western metaphysics, as did Heidegger. For his part, Kleist made narratives of such critiques. Casting a critical eye upon contemporary philosophical systems, he relentlessly denied absolution to the characters in his texts. His explorations of the fundamentally fragmentary nature of subjectivity implicated him in the same Romantic philosophical dilemma that I have been describing throughout. If an abyss can be said to have opened around 1800, Kleist fell into it. In this chapter<br>

  Abstract: These words, written by Novalis, declare that philosophy begins in an act of self-destruction, or more precisely formulated: all properly philosophical acts aim to destroy the self. This demand is not as mysterious as it might seem. A self, by definition, is differentiated and limited, and thus represents one of the most palpable impediments to that which romantic philosophy seeks, namely, the absolute,
                  das Unbedingte, that which is without condition and without limit. A truly philosophical act must efface the horizon of limitations and differences that constitutes selfhood:Selbsttödtung, self-annihilation. The proper name for this act is not suicide,<br>

  Book Title: Rethinking Hanslick-Music, Formalism, and Expression<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Marx Wolfgang<br>
  Abstract: Rethinking Hanslick: Music, Formalism, and Expression' is the first extensive English-language study devoted to Eduard Hanslick--a seminal figure in nineteenth-century musical life. Bringing together eminent scholars from several disciplines, this volume examines Hanslick's contribution to the aesthetics and philosophy of music and looks anew at his literary interests. The essays embrace ways of thinking about Hanslick's writings that go beyond the polarities that have long marked discussion of his work such as form/expression, absolute/program music, objectivity/subjectivity, and formalist/hermeneutic criticism. This approach takes into consideration both Hanslick's important 'On the Musically Beautiful' and his critical and autobiographical writings, demonstrating Hanslick's rich insights into the context in which a musical work is composed, performed, and received. 'Rethinking Hanslick' serves as an invaluable companion to Hanslick's prodigious scholarship and criticism, deepening our understanding of the major themes and ideas of one of the most influential music critics of the nineteenth century.

  Abstract: It could be argued that the poetry of Johannes Bobrowski (1917–1965) tends towards absolute moral polarities, with Germans generally bad, and their Jewish, Polish, and other victims equally good, rather than exploring the complexities of individuals, ethnic communities, and their relations. This does not apply in the same way to the prose fiction he increasingly turned to in the 1960s. Several of his narrative texts show a German soldier with positive character traits, partly representing the author’s own experience, while pointing to the insufficiency of these traits in the historical context.

  Book Title: Dialogic Aspects in the Cuban Novel of the 1990s-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): DORADO-OTERO ÁNGELA<br>
  Abstract: This book examines six Cuban novels published between 1991 and 1999, all part of the new "boom" of the Cuban novel in the 1990s. It analyses how in undermining monolithic representations of reality these texts employ discursive techniques that question absolute truths, defy established boundaries of literary genres and challenge concepts of national, gender and individual identity. The authors studied in this book---Reinaldo Arenas, Leonardo Padura Fuentes, Abilio Estévez, Daína Chaviano, Yanitzia Canetti, and Zoé Valdés---are placed beyond the dichotomy of outside and inside Cuba in order to focus on the fluidity and heterogeneity of Cuban culture displayed in its literature. This study establishes similarities and differences in the way these authors create polyphonic texts that question whether notions of country and nation coincide in novels that respond to economic hardship, political and social changes, issues of cubanía, and exile.

The increased diversity refers not only to changes in the absolute number of working hours, as many workers work more hours per week and many others work fewer hours, but also to which hours and days they are working and how much flexibility they have in determining which hours they work. The so-called “standard shift”—thirty-five to forty hours per week, nine to five, Monday through Friday—has increasingly become the exception rather than the standard, since fewer<br>

Abstract: For a long line of Whig historians the revolution and civil war of the 1630s and 1640s was the particular responsibility of the Stuarts, who in significant ways broke with the constitutional precedents established by the Tudors. Elizabeth especially was conventionally represented as a defender of English liberties and Protestantism. Neal counters this narrative and shows that the arbitrary principles of Charles and his father followed directly from the example of Elizabeth: “She had high notions of the sovereign authority of Princes, and of her own absolute Supremacy in Church Affairs: and being of Opinion that Methods of Severity were lawful to bring her Subjects to an outward Uniformity, she countenanced all the Engines of Persecution, such as Spiritual Courts, High Commission, and Star‐Chamber, and stretched her prerogative to support them beyond the Laws, and against the Sense of the Nation.”
      30Neal detailed actions on the part of the queen that, he pointedly remarks, “cost one of her Successors his Crown and Life.”31It was Elizabeth’s active persecution of the Puritans that began the divisions that were to culminate on a scaffold outside Inigo Jones’s Banquetting House on Whitehall in 1649. As Neal put it, in an image that Hume was later to appropriate into hisHistory of England, “The breach might easily have been made up at first, but it widened by degrees; the passions of the contending parties increased, till the fire, which for some years was burning under ground, broke out into a civil war, and with unspeakable fury destroyed the Constitution both of Church and State.”32<br>

Abstract: The seeds of religious pluralism in the contemporary theological situation have the potential to transform traditional Christian theology from within. According to Paul Knitter, the pluralistic situation demands a conception of the relations between the world’s faiths that is radically new. Knitter’s proposal of a “unitive pluralism of religions” suggests a sort of kaleidoscopic vision of religious interpenetration in which every religion is present in the self‐understanding of every other without, however, the religions becoming confused.
      4Our awareness of the sociology of knowledge, however, gives us reason to suspect that there are intrinsic limits to this kind of religious interpenetration. The dependence of religious ideas on specific social processes for their plausibility limits the flow of these ideas.5More often than is usually acknowledged, religious doctrines are formed in response to specific questions arising out of religious practice.6A tradition’s intellectual beliefs regarding the nature of reality are correlated to its particular way of life in such a way that the former make sense only in the context of the latter. A community’s cognitive beliefs are therefore apt to leave an outsider—one who does not share that community’s distinctive way of life—with an impression of otherness, even if the dependence of these beliefs on alien modes of social interaction is rarely so absolute as to render them unintelligible. The situation with respect to religious ideas stands in contrast to the propagation of scientific knowledge, which, by virtue of its relative independence from specific social/practical contexts,7has the ability to pass through sociological barriers with relative ease. For this reason, one would not expect the theological revisions called forth by the new pluralism, as substantial as these are likely to be, to be quite as thoroughgoing as those undergone by the tradition in meeting the challenge of modernity.<br>

Abstract: In an interesting argument for analogy as a vehicle for a cross‐cultural epistemology, Stafford writes, “Analogizing has the virtue of making distant peoples, other periods, and even diverse contemporary contexts part of our world. Only by making the past or the remote or the foreign proximate can we hope to make it intelligible to us” (
         1999, 51). While Stafford is right in suggesting that analogizing creates a familiarization of otherness, a familiarization we might well argue is preferable to the absolute difference postulated in colonial discourse, we also need to ask who is doing the analogizing and to what purposes. Whose “our world” and “us” is Stafford referring to? Should we (nonindigenous peoples), for instance, be able to understand Native American concepts of land through analogies from Euro‐American Lockean individualism and capitalist relations? Should we (Westerners) be entitled to interpret subject formation within, say, Indian joint families through familiar Western Oedipal narratives?3I suggest that the analogizing move within white feminist theory, working similarly through assimilation and the incorporation of racial difference, may constitute a neocolonial moment more dangerous than the earlier absence of race and, thus, may need close scrutiny.<br>

Abstract: The studies following the trichotomy of exclusivism, inclusivism, and pluralism all recapitulate the arguments for and against the first two models and weigh the pros and cons. However, the third model, pluralism, is not evaluated in terms of positive and negative aspects but mainly in comparison with the other two models, while attracting a flood of criticism. There is no point dealing with this in detail—one can read it anywhere. Let me merely sum up the gist of it. A cardinal objection is the cultural and religious relativism allegedly evinced by the model of pluralism: Christianity and the other religions are all just vehicles of knowledge about, and devotion to, God, contextually confined as they are both temporally and spatially. The cultural relativism evident in this view inevitably leads to religious relativism, which is incompatible with Christianity’s claims, not merely to universality but also to uniqueness and absoluteness. Christianity not only has a universal message for all peoples in all ages; that message also contains the unique truth, transmitted to us only through the unique, divine person of Jesus the Christ; and this truth is also absolute, not to be experienced by any other religion. That, in a nutshell, is the critique of pluralism in the Vatican document

Abstract: There were more weighty and convincing arguments revolving around aesthetic and functional considerations. The controversial but popular mayor of Sofia, Stefan Sofiyanski, rightly accused the BSP of having neglected its own symbol. He pointed out that it had been the ruling party several times and that between 1993 and the end of 1996 it had an absolute parliamentary majority. Yet never once did it come up with a plan for the future of the mausoleum, which could have easily gathered support. Sofiyanski's objections to the mausoleum were based on what he characterized as its illegal construction, because it had been built on land donated almost a century earlier for a garden. He recognized the nostalgic value of the mausoleum for a great number of people but, in yet another analogy to Germany, noted that the destruction of the Berlin wall also had its opponents: “Yet its destruction became, in its turn, the symbol for the unification not only of Germany but also of Europe.”

Abstract: My argument is that, in an analogous way to women’s and environmental studies, childhood studies should not only apply existing theological methods and norms but also challenge and transform them. It should do so in new and distinctive ways. In analogy to terms like feminism and environmentalism I call this approach “childism.” Christian ethics in particular has a long history of this kind of child‐centered self‐reflection: such as Jesus’s placing a child “in the midst” of his disciples to explain the kingdom of heaven, the early church fathers using childhood to describe the ideal human image of God, Augustine’s beginning his groundbreaking
      Confessionsthrough his original sin in infancy and youth, and Friedrich Schleiermacher’s exploration of the “feeling of absolute dependence” in relation to the notion of the child as gift.2The difference today is both a changed situation for children around the world and the possibility for greater empirical sophistication about the nature of childhood and its relations to families and society. The question for theological ethics is how to respond to the complex lives of children in the contemporary world in as sufficiently attentive and meaningful a way as to enrich, in turn, theological ethical understanding itself.<br>

Abstract: Indeed, as Hannah Arendt has pointed out, “Goodness in an absolute sense, as distinguished from the good‐for’ or the excellent’ in Greek and Roman antiquity, became known in our civilization only with the rise of Christianity” (Hannah Arendt,
            The Human Condition[Chicago, 1958], p. 73). The analysis of Goodness provided inThe Human Conditionand in which Arendt highlights the constitutive secrecy of good works, which must remain hidden even to the one who performs them—a good deed being good only on condition that it is forgotten at the moment it is done—as well as Goodness’s intrinsic hostility toward the public realm, converges in many respects with what Patočka—a reader of Arendt—says about this notion, as well as with all the implications that Derrida draws in systematic fashion from this conception inThe Gift of Death.<br>

Abstract: If, as Koselleck has envisaged, history was elevated as the subject of its own absolute self‐knowledge—history itself a unified history of humanity, imperially gathering up all special histories into the unifying realm of the collective singular—it was also empowered by what Ricoeur calls a “hidden form of the same claim” that could act against its untenable status as self‐knowledge and singular time (
         MHF,p. 305). The historical present, now established as the perspective for all temporal formations, is centered as an absolute. Once the collective singular is discredited in its impossible universalizing mission to singularize the history of humanity, it turns to the singular historical moment, which is the now of the historical present. Even today, it insists on the developmental imperative and its familiar claim of a totalizing history; the “vocables of world history” and the imposition of odious comparisons promote programs of catching up with the parade of the historical present attained by modern Euro‐America (MHF,p. 305). The here and now is henceforth distinguished from times past, to be sure, but also from those different temporalities that exist immanently in the modern present but are hidden from it, as in the there and the then, since it is our time that provides both perspective and tribunal. The here and now of actual experience, our modernity, is our history, our time, and never theirs. The distancing of expectation from past experiences thus becomes the condition of asserting the difference of our self‐valorizing and self‐referring modernity and its superiority over both its antecedents and others. But the decision to shift the concept of modernity to the register of an absolute historical present eventually required misrecognizing the apparent contradiction that our time and place is characterized by its unique difference from others. Moreover, the change of index directs attention instead to generalizing the values our modernity embodies an~<br>

Article Title: Translating Time: The Nature and Function of Joseph Smith’s Narrative Canon<br>

Abstract: Smith’s redaction of Genesis continues to emphasize that choice is manifest and freedom is—temporally at least—absolute. Therefore, the terms under which Adam and Eve occupy the garden differ in the JST. While they are commanded not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they are told also, in contrast to the KJV: “Nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but remember that I forbid it.”
         55As with all narratives, this dialogue requires interpretation and at least two conclusions are possible. One is legalistic. If they “may” choose, then to choose is not disobedient, even when told not to choose. In the larger context of the operation of agency in Smith’s cosmology, it is more likely that the “may” refers to a necessary condition of Adam and Eve’s existence, not a license to do other than what they had been commanded. This view is supported by the fact that the story of the premortal council, with its emphasis on agency, is inserted in the narrative after God’s instruction not to eat the fruit and, as indicated, prior to the serpent’s offer of an alternative. Adam and Eve have a choice, but they have also been instructed in the right choice and given an example of the dangers of a wrong choice. Smith’s Book of Abraham speaks more obliquely but to the same point and more broadly applied. There God says to the premortal assembly: “Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the Son of Man. … And another answered. … And the Lord said: I will send the first. And the second was angry and kept not his first estate; and, at that day, many followed after him.”56<br>

Abstract: See n. 77 above. For an argument similar to Rao’s, see D. M. Datta, “Some Realistic Aspects of the Philosophy of Śaṅkara,” in
            Recent Indian Philosophy, ed. Kalidas Bhattacharya (Calcutta: Progressive, 1963); concerning the denial of substantial change, see esp. 347, 349. Note that Hegel’s critique of the concept ofmāyāeasily accommodates an acknowledgment of the substantial identity between the world and the absolute. The presence of the divine being in all finite things still “does not secure them in their finite individuality, nor is the finite a real factor in or for the infinite. On the contrary, the abstract self‐identity of the finite existences, which identifies them with the abstract absolute, is incompatible with their concrete individual identity” (Halbfass,India and Europe, 90).<br>

Abstract: Wayne A. Wiegand [
            29], in his analysis of the conflicted history of the origins of the Dewey Decimal Classification scheme, addresses the issue of truth as part of a worldview held by Melvil Dewey resulting from his education at Amherst College. The Amherst curriculum during the last quarter of the nineteenth century reflected the school’s strong ties to orthodox Christianity. The purpose of teaching, therefore, was to communicate already known and unquestioned universal truths to students. The result, as Wiegand argues, is that Dewey’s development of a decimal classification scheme arose from a worldview that “looked upon the world reflected in this curriculum as objective and absolute” [29, pp. 183–84].<br>

Abstract: Overriding the detective prototype, such is the courtship novel in its most attenuated and dilatory form. Failing all lived cultural totality, failing even a structural unity capable of being mapped back onto the rendered world, the violence of this Dickensian ending is to settle for individual union at all costs, whatever unethical deceits must be prolonged, whatever truth must be deferred. Need it be said? The obvious alternative in the case of
         Little Dorritwould clearly have been less manageable by plot or genre. For Clennam to come to the marriage altar (as ethical reward for selfless devotion) to find it a symbolic baptismal font as well (the epistemological redemption of the abused child by a corrected parentage) would not have made for a readily stabilized closure in the marriage-plot mode. Rather, it would have left the hero with too much on his mind: an entirely reconstituted subjectivity, in fact, to be actively grappled with and rethought, rather than just a depleted self to be sunk gratefully in another. The failure of dialectical resolution is absolute. Forget social totality. Forget even formal unity. To stave off all further worry over the hero's status as son, his union, its figured prospects feminized, is reduced to the unitary.<br>

Abstract: Another way to put this point is that the ethics of war presumes a psychology and sociology.
         8Given the powerful emotions that animate a common life, it would seem necessary for just‐war doctrine to function self‐reflexively vis‐à‐vis the shared desires and values to which it is attached. In the moral life generally and during war in particular, it is vital to determine whether our desires are indeed desirable. War excites passion, and passion sometimes undermines practical reason. This means that moral judgment guided by the just‐war tradition is precarious. Moral discourse about war can slip from functioning as a critical, reflective idiom to an idiom of rationalization regarding political decisions and military practices in war. The ethics of war thus requires a kind of moral steadiness in relation to the feelings that enliven the political community and the institutions that serve human needs and aspirations. It must affirm the good of community while resisting the temptation to assign that good absolute value lest it fall prey to political expedience or self‐righteousness, along with their penchant for cost‐benefit analysis and instrumental reason “in the interests of the state.”9<br>

Abstract: The tensions between remembrance and love that are etched into our mortality and our vitality and that structure social worlds are the hermeneutical key for the thoughts that follow. They enable us to ponder the double entendre of my title because these tensions link humanism and reflection on the religions. The following pages seek to unfold these tensions on the way to showing the importance responsibility and also the integrity of life have for current theological ethics. Yet at this juncture please note that we have also isolated a possible danger buried in our university’s motto. Is the quest for and pretense of ever‐increasing knowledge actually aimed at overcoming finite limits, the triumph of the will to power, under the dream of absolute knowledge? Is this motto, ironically, a slogan of bondage to illusion and futility? Can it be seen otherwise within a vision and hope of renewed life and responsible freedom? I shall take up those questions at the conclusion of this lecture since they open constructive reflection on the purpose of humanistic inquiry and religious studies.<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: Now, Derrida holds that Marion has elided the distinction between praise and prayer, which represent two nominally separable traits. For Derrida, the only language that truly respects distance is, in a formulation that recalls Kant, pure prayer, or the “act of addressing oneself to the other as other.”
         57However, praise, or encomium—even “praise as”—violates the purity of this first trait by compromising the absolute alterity of the Other and bringing reference to bear across address. Thus, “the encomium qualifies God, anddeterminesprayer,determinesthe other.”58Marion held that “praise as” did not attempt to qualify or determine God, but Derrida argues that it “entails a predicative aim, however foreign it may be the ‘normal’ ontological predication.”59However, there is no real question of being able to pray without encomium, for “there would be no prayer … [without] writing, the code, repetition.”60The letter of the prayer, as in Kant, is always impure: how do you address the Other without determining who the addressee is? True prayer is actually impossible. As Hent de Vries puts it, “Prayer is from the outset and forever divided in and against itself.”61<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: Franke first defines apocalyptic discourse as “the unveiling of an ultimate, absolute and transcendent destiny or dimension of existence” (3). As a legacy of the Enlightenment, traditionally understood, we have grown accustomed to rejecting or avoiding such discourse as rationally intractable, and critical theory exposes absolutist discourse as idolatrous, exclusionary, and all too human. It is idolatrous to presume that we can represent the transcendent, and all too often absolutist discourse functions as a will to power that marginalizes or subjugates others in an imperialistic manner. However, Franke insists that apocalypse is not the problem but the solution to this dilemma because apocalyptic discourse paradoxically reveals a transcendent dimension that no language can ever express. Therefore, apocalypse is always both an unveiling and a reveiling that humbles us, deconstructs our idols, and opens us toward a new and different future. If we call this mystery God, then we first discover that we are not God, thereby enabling a self‐transcendence that is the precondition of any meaningful dialogue with others.<br>

Abstract: Similar illustrations of immanent dispossession abounded during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. While Fénelon's censure in 1699 appeared to neutralize the threat posed by mysticism, Christian apologists turned from this victory to confront attacks on human agency stemming from Spinozist and materialist circles. A key battle in this polemic was fought over the status of free will as a property of the thinking subject, whether human or divine. Spinoza aimed to demonstrate that God acts
         asnature, notonnature, and out of sheer necessity. Created beings operated under a similar compulsion. The distinction between subject and object, famously associated with Descartes, was thereby dissolved. To cite theEthics(1677): “When we say that the human mind perceives this or that thing, we say nothing else than that God possesses this or that idea.”46In other words, the subject's thoughts are not its own, unique to itself, but are the manifestation of God thinking in the world and through the mind. It followed from this premise that “there is no absolute or free will,” a conclusion that undermined the possibility of transcendence for any being.47Spinoza therefore understood the highest form of wisdom, which he called the “intellectual love of God,” to be the recognition of the determined character of our existence. We are, he asserted, “part of the whole of nature, whose order we follow.”48In consequence, true liberty “is to be and to remain chained by the bonds of [God's] love.”49And this love, Spinoza claimed, was not directed toward the individual human person. It was, on the contrary, “part of the infinite love with which God loves Himself.”50For Spinoza, then, intellectual love is radically self-referential—not to the human subject, but to divine substance. The beatified self exists merely as an effect of God/Nature's immanent presence and totalizing force. At the same time, Spinoza extended dispossession beyond what Fénelon's Christian beliefs would permit~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: This concept of potentiality in being promised does not rest on a self‐contained or self‐giving gift. If we inscribe the promise in place of the ordinary gift in Agamben’s translation of
         epidosis, we find that the stranger still intrudes on the constituted and ordinary political situation but not in the aporetic way Agamben has demonstrated. Rather, the promise is a gift that addresses another, taking the stranger as neighbor, to serve and dispossesses itself to the neighbor. The agonistic gift is competitive and challenges the other; the pure gift shocks, interrupts, or haunts the other. Derrida’s construction of the stranger, as well as the way the stranger demands an absolute hospitality in the manner of the pure gift, both retain a chasm or equivocity between self and stranger, between home and exile.44Being promised can address this fundamental chasm, as an analogical approach might, by its dispossession and address.<br>

Article Title: Literary Unrest: Blanchot, Lévinas, and the Proximity of Judaism<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: Unlike Lévinas, Blanchot's concern for Judaism is not motivated by the practical concerns of reviving the tradition in the postwar context. He is free of the necessities of community leadership, free from any pragmatics concerning the tradition. For Blanchot, Judaism is a concept, one he has discovered through reading Lévinas along with Edmond Jabès and Franz Kafka. Its message is encapsulated in the commandment to Abraham in Genesis 12:
         Lech Lecha, “Go forth from your father's house.” Blanchot reads this commandment as a prohibition against putting down roots, not only in a particular place but also in any statement of the truth. Like Lévinas, Blanchot sees this counsel of dispersion as having fundamental importance in the post-World War II world, an importance that has little to do with the lived tradition and everything to do with developing a political position antithetical to fascism. Blanchot accepts Lévinas's depiction of Judaism and takes the idea a step further by reading Lévinas's principle of moral deracination as advocating absolute disappropriation. He writes inThe Infinite Conversation,
               
         there is a truth of exile and there is a vocation of exile; and if being Jewish is being destined to dispersion—just as it is a call to a sojourn without place, just as it ruins every fixed relation of force with
            oneindividual,onegroup, oronestate—it is because dispersion, faced with the exigency of the whole, also clears the way for a different exigency and finally forbids the temptation of Unity-Identity.24<br>

Abstract: If we wish to express the principle of temporality in
         Ulyssesin terms of a formal concept, we could say with Augustine: within the continuous flux of unarticulated consciousness, everything is only to the extent that it is present; the past aspraesens de praeteritis[the present of the past], the present aspraesens de praesentibus[the present of the present], the future aspraesens de futuris[the present of the future]. All [manifestations of] time [alle Zeiten] are subjected to the movement, never to come to rest, of the actual flux of consciousness and are to flow into each other uninterruptedly: the past without any distance, modified and often also deformed, as a mere mirror; the present in a state of absolute contingency, a-causal and without any specificity (without any reference to a hierarchy of meanings), as mere perception; the future entirely as empty projection, in the mode of expectation, of mere intention or of passive desire, but never in the guise of a causal act of the will that would create a future for itself.

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: Even to consider these questions, let alone to feel stirred or moved by them, is, it seems, to begin to doubt the goodness of God.
      38And to doubt the goodness of God, even if you still believe in his existence, is to slide into what was generally understood in the period as atheism.39Perhaps that is why Prynne accused acting companies of “prophanely” playing the history of Faustus despite the fact that the play stages the orthodoxy of the unrepentant magician's damnation. Or perhaps something else was at stake in Prynne's sense that the play was profane. Insofar as Faustus is compelling as a tragic character, his play will reveal the inexorable negativity at the heart of Protestant Christianity; it will lay bare not that damnation is predestined but that salvation itself entails self-obliteration into the absolute otherness of an inscrutable God. From a humanist perspective such Christianity is fundamentally tragic because the life that it offers universalizes all sensuous particularity, all subjectivity signified or even felt in the material embodiment of persons and texts. But the ultimate effect of Marlowe's play is not simply for the audience to doubt whether they should continue to desire God and salvation; rather, it is for the audience terrifyingly to feel that God is watching them doubt and, bending down his “ireful brows,” judging their thoughts and feelings and condemning them to the damnation that they are compelled to contemplate. And in a context where magic was a theatrical show created by the devil but permitted by God so he could see whether his subjects would, as Perkins put it, cleave to him or to the devil and his wicked instruments, to cleave in compassion to Faustus was to sense yourself entering into alliance with the devil, alienated from the inscrutable source of your immortal soul.<br>

Author(s): LaCocque André<br>
Abstract: This observation reveals some divergence between the biblical answer to Babel and the more universal discussion of LaCocque’s analysis. The critique of Babel’s hubris leads to the covenant of Genesis 12, the “great exception, the miraculous ‘otherness’ that is both judgment and relief for ‘all the families of the earth’” (100). But questions remain. For J, the answer to the loss of innocence in Eden and Babel is the covenant, but in LaCocque’s reading, the text affirms rather the indeterminacy and perennial suspicion of structure more characteristic of postmodern thinkers. In his reading, the tower claims a presence, but “deconstructionism shows the absence of such absolute presence” (154). Such a reading is justified in part by the fact that “authorial intent never exhausts the text’s meanings” (93). While there may be little to regret over the deterioration of Babel’s collapse, the same kind of deconstructive move could be made against the theology of J. The understated theologies of J and LaCocque run suggestively through
      The Captivity of Innocence, but much more could be said about them and how they are related.<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: This ambiguity is raised to an ultimate degree in Stroeken’s (
         2010) work on the moral power of witchcraft and healing among the Sukuma of Tanzania. Here the witch is in fact “hyper-moral” and partakes of the same entitlement as the ancestor: “Both witch and cursing ancestor are thought to feel neglected, jealous of the other’s good fortune. Both have moral power in relation to the victim” (x). This moral power, derived from the dark side of kinship, operates according to a rationality specifying that because of some offense or neglect “the witch must be entitled to the victim’s life” (15). Hence the witch can override and pervert ancestral protection in order to “eat” the accursed victim. Witches are both socially marginal and intimately connected to their victims, such that “The absolute outside furnishes power; the absolute inside furnishes morality. Together they constitute the moral power the witch draws on … It is a type of power beyond domestication” (124). In this context the radical reality is that accused witches are in fact killed remarkably often, and at the same time an outcome of healing is often “to leave participants with a feeling kept largely unspoken: ‘Aren’t we all witches?’” (31).<br>

Abstract: In the instant before his heart breaks, Lear gives us reason to believe he is sincerely answering his ordination, and our hope that this is so attests to the play’s success in impressing upon us its exacting ethical vision. The king’s attentiveness to Cordelia’s inert form, as Michael Holahan has shown, is an exquisite example of ethical perception and responsiveness.
      
            And it is true, as Maynard Mack affirms, that Lear dies with no regard for himself. He draws his last breath “with his whole being launched toward another.”45
         
            Yet this altruistic posture is undermined by several of Lear’s last lines, some of which signal delusion (“This feather stirs. She lives” [5.3.239]), others indifference (“Prithee, away” [5.3.242]), and others wrath (“A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all” [5.3.243]). The play drives toward an ideal of ethical interrelation and absolute responsibility, but how close does the king come? After all is said and done, what we have witnessed remains enigmatic. Like the irreducible other, the tragedy resists our efforts to thematize its content or comprehend its meaning.46

Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: In Badiouan ontology, the role of the absolute infinite (divine) has been taken by “the void” conceived of as the “errant ‘place’ where each situation is sutured to its being
            quapure multiplicity or inconsistency.”
                  In other words, “the fundamental ontological characteristic of an event is to inscribe, to name the situated void of that for which it is an event.”95
               
                  According to Welborn, that explains why Paul is seen by Badiou as a foundational figure and the first great theoretician of universal truth: “Unlike effective truth-procedures which aim at the production of a universal in the domains of science, art, politics, and love, there occurs with Paul a powerful break … which deserves to be called ‘theoretical,’96
               
                  because the situated void which Paul’s proclamation inscribes and names is nothing other than death itself. Paul’s declaration ‘Christ is resurrected’ blasts open the continuum constructed around death.”97
               
                  Reynhout, in turn, in his attempt to appropriate Badiou’s thought theologically, comes to the conclusion that allows him to ultimately identify this nameless void with God, thus falling back on Tillich’s designations of God as “being-itself” or the “ground of being.”98
               
                  Depoortere depicts the analogy pointedly: “Just as zero or the empty set cannot be deduced, but has to be decided upon axiomatically, the being of God cannot be demonstrated, but has to be declared.”99

Abstract: Peperzak is concerned with the relation between philosophy and faith, more than any other topic, however. Following his phenomenology of philosophical conversation, he claims, “The encounter with God is somewhat comparable to a face-to-face relationship that stretches me when I look up to a human person who loves me. Since God is infinite, however, faith and love toward God encompass the universe of all that exists. … Faith thus mobilizes and orients the entirety of one’s existence from top to bottom” (120–21). Peperzak regards faith as a fundamental Desire that orients us in an encounter with the absolute. As such, there is no clean separation of faith and philosophy. All thinking emerges from some sort of faith, and while philosophy has a universality that can engender conversation across differences of faith orientation, its autonomy is a relative and limited one. Moreover, Peperzak associates the infinity of God encountered as Other with the Platonic Good that illuminates all thinking and being, while itself escaping thematization: “the
      phila(love) ofphilosophiareaches out toward a wisdom (sophia) that implies … a sense of the difference between this cosmos and the ultimately desired but ungiven Good. … By longing, Eros reaches further than any theory” (159).<br>

Article Title: The First Evil Will Must Be Incomprehensible: A Critique of Augustine<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263713<br>
Date: 9 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Teselle Robert F.<br>
Abstract: The thesis of this paper is that an absolute origin of evil, arising from the free will of a creature, must be incomprehensible. Although Augustine occasionally acknowledges this point, nevertheless in a number of better-known passages (chiefly in The City of God) he attempts to give a causal account of the fall of Adam and/or Satan. Much of the subsequent Christian tradition has unfortunately followed his lead, and major recent commentators routinely ignore or passively approve of his conceptual error. Augustine offers three unacceptable explanations of the fall, which conflict variously with his own doctrines of divine omnipotence, the goodness of creation, and creaturely free will and responsibility, as well as violating the canons of sound argumentation and explanation. First, his contention that free creatures made "out of nothing" inevitably fall makes the fall seem ontologically necessary (unfree) and thereby lays the ultimate responsibility for it on the Creator. Second, the appeal to pride as an explanation is a spurious causal account, for "pride" is only a synonym for "fallenness" itself and not a possible antecedent condition in a being created good and not yet fallen. Finally, his assertion that the first sin is intrinsically comprehensible, but not comprehensible to us because we are fallen, is an obfuscation masquerading as an explanation, for we have no warrant for supposing that this assertion is true or even meaningful. Instead of seeking causal explanation Augustine should have stayed with his own wiser observation that an evil will has no efficient cause. Theology of the Augustinian sort (which comprises much of the Christian tradition) ought to concede that the fall as a work of genuine freedom is an absurd "fact," an incomprehensible given which steadfastly and in principle resists causal explanation. The concluding section of the paper draws upon Ricoeur's insights to tell why the narrative structure of the "Adamic myth" (which has important p~<br>

Abstract: Gaston Berger, le fondateur des Études philosophiques (1926), a joué un rôle décisif dans l'introduction intellectuelle, mais aussi matérielle et institutionnelle, de la phénoménologie de Husserl en France. À partir de documents inédits et d'une lecture, dès lors renouvelée, de la thèse sur Le cogito dans la philosophie de Husserl, cette étude montre l'originalité de l'interprétation que donne Berger de la phénoménologie husserlienne, ainsi que les réserves qu'il formule à l'égard de certains thèmes: le moi absolu, la tension entre l'intention et l'intuition, sans oublier la réappropriation de la réduction phénoménologique sous le mode d'un détachement. En ce sens, il apparaît, d'une part, que Berger est un représentant typique de la première génération française des « disciples » de Husserl et que, d'autre part, la réception qu'il en fait est déjà révélatrice de problématiques propres à certains phénoménologues contemporains. Gaston Berger, the founder of Études philosophiques (1926), played a decisive role in the intellectual and also material and institutional introduction of Husserl's phenomenology into France. Based on unpublished documents permitting a new reading of his thesis Le cogito dans la philosophie de Husserl, this study shows the originality of Berger's interpretation of Husserlian phenomenology, as well as the reservations he developed with regard to certain themes: the absolute ego, the tension between intention and intuition, not to mention the reappropriation of the phenomenological reduction by means of a detachment. In this sense, it appears, on the one hand, that Berger is a typical representative of the first French generation of « disciples » of Husserl and, on the other hand, that the reception he offered is itself revealing as to the problematics of certain contemporary phenomenologists.<br>

Abstract: Freud's metapsychology, although it is not identical with the whole field of psychoanalytic psychology, originated under the controlling influence of a questionable positivistic model of science. The analysis begun in a previous study (Gregorianum, 61 [1980] 97-136) continues in this study of the relationship in Freud's thought between theory and empirical observation. We also treat the attempts by Freud and by the later neopositivist schools of classical ego-theory to articulate psychoanalytic insights about the person in terms taken from neurophysiology, biology, and classical mechanics. Such terms pervade the terminology used to express the metapsychological viewpoints, albeit in disharmonious juxtaposition with more specifically psychological terms. Freud's whole work was affected by his desire to propose psychoanalysis as a natural science on the model of the positivistic outlook of late nineteenth century Viennese physicalism. Opposition arose in the 1950s and 1960s to understanding psychoanalysis as a natural science, especially because of problems of conceptual definition, language, and verification or validation. Orthodox Freudians themselves were troubled by the problem of psychic energy and the discussion finally led to critical doubts about Freud's whole metapsychology. One reason was the dependence on a physical and mechanical model of science and on a neurophysiology no longer tenable. Other frames of reference in the exact sciences were sought, such as cybernetics and information theory, in an attempt to remain to some extent in harmony with the original epistemological ideology. There are those today who remain convinced that psychoanalysis is an exact science, and who in turn reject the different psychologies of understanding and the hermeneutical sciences. In the context of a basic-level discussion, this contribution explores, in their context, the principles of the worldview found at the most theoretical level of metapsychology. Among these, the p~<br>

Abstract: Today, bioethical themes are no longer the exclusive patrimony of university classrooms. Everyone is talking about them; "secular" and "catholics" alike. Catholics are often accused of imposing a "confessional" point of view. This article wishes to clarify this point given its importance in themes regarding the life and death of man, such as: artificial fecundation, abortion, cloning, brain death, organ transplants, and euthanasia. The article is based on a philosophical reflection starting with anthropological considerations. The extensive number of themes does not allow taking all of them into consideration. Thus the article adheres to the following outline: 1. Establish the epistemological bases for a rational discourse based on universal premises, with particular reference to artificial fecundation and the nature of human sexuality. 2. Analize the "human nature" condition of the embryo, of the physically and mentally disabled, of the terminally ill, and their status as "human persons"; this discourse is founded on the ontological status of the human body. 3. Present the value of the human body as a psycho-biological unity, which constitutes man's substantial unity. 4. We call this psycho-biological unity "person": "corpore et anima unus"; an individual subject with a rational nature, with its own singularity and oneness. The person has an absolute value, therefore cloning, even for "therapeutic reasons", is contrary to its ontological status. 5. From the consideration that a "person is", while a "personality becomes", we can explain how the person develops and matures his biological and spiritual capacities, without incurring changes in his ontological status. 6. The psycho-biological unity of the human person (corpore et anima unus) is at the basis of death in man, a unique reality. In analysing "human death" we should avoid two reductions: a biological reduction which curtails death to physical-biological processes and events (medical diagnosis of brain death)~<br>

Abstract: O filme Diamante de Sangue [Blood Diamond] de Edward Zwick oferece a possibilidade de uma reflexão à volta de três aspetos da noção de testemunho no âmbito da Filosofia da Religião: 1) a ideia de que o testemunho (absoluto), enquanto matriz das culturas humanas, sustenta a atividade jornalística e a sociedade da informação possibilitando não apenas a sua desconstrução como também a (re-)atualização de uma dimensão testemunhal do jornalismo; 2) as condições de possibilidade da conversão da consciência, isto é, da rutura com o estado de má-fé (auto-engano) necessária à consciência testemunhal e religiosa; 3) a indissociabilidade da experiência testemunhal e da doação, correlativas da experiência religiosa entendida como "fundação mútua" do divino e da testemunha (constituinte), experiência religiosa da qual surge o testemunho. Acrescentaremos ainda a ideia de que a experiência testemunhal ganha sentido à luz da metafísica do tempo do projeto. The film Blood Diamond from Edward Zwick offers the possibility of a reflection concerning three aspects of the concept of testimony within the Philosophy of Religion: 1) the idea that the testimony (absolute), while source of human cultures, supports the journalistic activity and gives information to the society; not only in its deconstruction but also in (re-)updating the testimonial dimension of journalism, 2) the conditions of possibility of the consciousness conversion, meaning, the rupture with the state of bad faith (self-deception) will required to the testimonial and religious consciousness, 3) the inseparability of the testimonial experience and donation, correlates in the religious experience, understood as “mutual foundation” of the divine and the witness (constituent), religious experience from which comes the testimony. We add further the idea that the testimonial experience makes sense in light of the metaphysics of time of project.<br>

Kindes - sei es nun archetypisch fundiert oder nicht - in seiner formalen Genese verständlich.

Abstract: The story of the Fall inscribes the myth of a fallen language as the absolute other of the original sacred. Hence the dualistic scheme between a fallen materiality and a metaphysical God. This article explores how the death of this God is not merely a secular turn, but the opening of a different, anti-theological, or fallen religiosity that allows us to trace the sacred in unexpected places—also within fallen language. Translation and literature will be explored as instances where language performs its own fallenness— its materiality, arbitrariness and difference—and thereby releases a sacred expression.

Abstract: The philosopher as the tormented individual trying to grasp the truth is the topic of Giordano Bruno's Eroici furori. This paper offers a reading that assumes that Ignatius of Loyola's Spiritual Exercises were part of its cultural background. Both texts have some features in common: the individual struggles for contemplation of the absolute; the strife is a circular movement within the human condition; Ignatius and Bruno suggest to employ the lower realms of reality and the lower faculties of the soul for the sake of their overcoming in truth. Consequently, dialogue, imagery, and emblematic contraptions of multiple senses are specifically apt to educate the individual. Bruno addresses systematically the epistemological and metaphysical problems that accompany the Exercises.<br>

Abstract: In Romania, the fall of the Communist regime and the loss of referents that followed have inspired a revival in a "tradition of the nation" whose foundation was laid during the 19th century, associating a representation of identity based on ethnicity with a unitary and centralized conception of the state. The sudden opening up to the outside world, pressures from an internationalized economy and Western institutions – specifically, NATO and the European Union, which Romania hopes to join – have led some to modify this tradition, while others have attempted to render it an absolute in order to better resist what are deemed destabilizing changes. These two tendencies can be identified in the way in which Romanians represent their pre-Communist and Communist past, as well as their manner of apprehending the tension between unity and plurality (ethnic, regional) at the heart of the nation-state.<br>

Abstract: It is true that Gadamer places 'absolute' in quotation marks, but it seems to me that this is
only because of the contingency of language. He continues: 'It transcends all the relativity of
the positing of being, because it embraces alle being-in-itself, in whatever relationships (rela-
tivities) it appears.' (Sie übersteigt alle Relativitaten von Seinssetzung, weil sie alles
Ansichsein umfasst, in welchen Beziehungen (Relativitaten) immer es sich zeigt) (TM: 408;

Abstract: Dooyeweerd does indeed speak of actual transcending of cosmic time. In the well-known
note in NC I, 31-32, in reaction to the Divergentierapport I' written by Vollenhoven and
circulating among board members of the Association for Calvinistic Philosophy, he writes:
" (...) Some seek the concentration-point of human existence in time and suppose, that this
religious centre must certainly be pre-functional but not supra-temporal. But, at least within
the horizon of cosmic time we have no single experience of something 'pre-functional', i.e.
of anything that would transcend the modal diversity of the aspects. We gain this
experience only in the religious concentration of the radix of our existence upon the
absolute Origin. In this concentration we transcend cosmic time. How could man direct
himself toward eternal things, if eternity were not 'set in his heart'? Even the idolatrous
absolutizing of the temporal cannot be explained from the temporal horizon of human
existence. For the latter nowhere provides a point of contact for an idea of the absolute,
unless it be related apriori to the supra-temporal. This act of concentration presupposes a
supra-temporal starting-point in our consciousness.
This, however, is not to say that the religious centre of human existence is found in a rigid
and static immobility. That is a metaphysical-Greek idea of supra-temporality."
Reading this passage we should realize that Dooyeweerd's notion of time refers to cosmic time,
which is related to modal diversity (and coherence) rather than transience. This is the reason
why Dooyeweerd cannot but say that the unity of existence can only be grasped by
transcending temporal diversity. So, we can conclude that the difference between Dooyeweerd
and Vollenhoven with respect to the supra-temporality of the heart depends on different views
on time and the cosmic time order. Vollenhoven's rejection of the notion of cosmic time order
and his exclusion of numerical and spatial modal qualifications fr~<br>

Publisher: University of North Carolina Press<br>
Issue: i344318<br>
Date: 6 1, 1973<br>
Author(s): Williame Herman<br>
Abstract: The opposition between phenomenological sociology and Durkeimian sociology is not as absolute as it is often presented. The various ways in which Durkheim's work has been read by phenomenological authors throughout the last fifty years testify to a development toward greater proximity, implying changes in phenomenologists' interpretation of Durkheim as well as in their own starting points. Beginning with an exposition of one of the most antithetical stands towards Durkheim, the article points out different phases of the aforementioned development: (1) A more or less total opposition; (2) A positive view of the challenged that phenomenologists can find a Durkheim's work and an attempt to incorporate it into their own viewpoints without really changing the latter; (3) A simultaneous reinterpretation of Durkheim's sociologism and the pehnomenological notions of subjectivity and intentionality, on the common basis of a renewed insight into the corporeal character of human social phenomena.<br>

Abstract: This article analyzes the ways in which Polish migrants in Ireland negotiate prevalent Polish discourses on migrant identity. The author emphasizes the complexity of migrant identity transgressions first, in order to displace a belief in a fixed homogeneity of the Polish migrant community, and secondly, to illustrate the problematics of young Polish migrants' relations with politically and culturally endorsed notions of Polishness, and, finally, to stress the need to engage migrant voices into the discussion on issues of Polish cultural and national identity. To that end the author analyzes two narratives of Polish migrants in Ireland which not only engage in contestation and negotiation of fixed identities but also emphasize the value of migration in shaping ideas about identity that transgress the idea of the nation as an absolute.<br>

Abstract: From the perspective of Gabriel Marcel’s juvenile writings, most notably
         Fragments Philosophiques(1909-1914) andJournal Métaphysique(1914-1923), this study discuss the first theoretical statute of the experience of God. This reflexive movement, strictly speaking, phenomenological-existential is based (as background) on the critique of absolute knowledge (modern idealism and scientism) which, according to Marcel, is an unavoidable contradiction: at the same time, it affirms the being, it denies the being. What draws attention is the fact that such explanatory model is transposed and, therefore, applied using the classical formulation of the so-called problem of the existence of God, of which theodicy has one of the most eloquent and emblematic metaphysical discourses. For the young French thinker, God cannot be verified or justified as an ontological proof: God is the Inverifiable Absolute, since it has to be experienced in the act of faith, in the expression of love and grace.<br>

The democratic method of logical argumentation was not feasible in dis-

Abstract: Sociology of religion and more specifically of ideologies is governed by the opposition between a certain tradition which considers religion as an instrument of communication and learning, i.e. as a structured and structuring system, and another tradition which emphasizes the political function of religious ideology. In fact, it is through its logical function of prescribing its structure to the mind, that religion fulfils the political function of maintaining the eternity of structures, i.e. the absolute of the relative and the legitimacy of the arbitrary and thus the domestication of the dominated. /// Se halla dominada la sociología de la religión (y más generalmente la de las ideologiás) por la oposición entre la tradición que trata la religión como instrumento de communicación y de conocimiento, es decir como sistema estructurado y estructurante, y la tradición que insiste en las funciones políticas de la ideología religiosa. En realidad, es precisamente porque cumple una función lógica, imponiendo sus estructuras al pensamiento, que la religión desempeña el papel político de eternización de las estructuras, es decir de absolutización del relativo y de legitimación del arbitrario y, con eso, de domesticación de los dominados. /// Die Soziologie der Religion und - allgemein gesehen die Soziologie der Ideologien - wird beherrscht vom Gegensatz einerseits zwischen der Tradition, die die Religion als ein Kommunikations- und Wissensinstrument ansieht - das heisst, als ein strukturiertes und strukturierendes System - und anderseits der Tradition, die die politischen Funktionen der religiösen Ideologie unterstreicht. In Wirklichkeit erfüllt die Religion nur insofern eine politische Funktion der Verewigung der Strukturen - das heisst die Absolutisierung des Relativen und die Legitimation des Willkürlichen und dadurch die Zähmung der Beherrschten - als sie eine logische Funktion erfüllt, indem sie dem Denken ihre Strukturen auferlegt. /// Социология религии (и вообще вс~<br>

Abstract: Aun cuando el pormenor de este ensayo se centra principalmente en los cambios de acento que experimenta la obra de Karl Mannheim en los años veinte, cuando éste se consagró resueltamente a la sociología, el autor quiere contribuir a explicitar las razones que justifican la plena actualidad de su figura intelectual y de su obra. Sostiene que la obra de Mannheim está vertebrada con inequívoca unidad de intención y procura fijar el sentido preciso de la misma. Mannheim fue un pensador del cambio y del conflicto que consagró toda su energía intelectual a interpretar y a afrontar la crisis de orientación y participación que mina la organización de las sociedades de nuestro tiempo. Concebía la sociología como la ciencia de integración necesaria para orientar la convivencia humana en una situación cultural disgregada y altamente polarizada y compleja. Su visión de la misma apela con claridad a la condición interdependiente e intersubjetiva de la existencia y es congruente con el empeño de quienes, para superar la crisis de la ciencia de la sociedad, tratan de armonizar la sociología equilibrando los excesos estructuralistas con un adecuado tratamiento de la dimensión comunicativa de la vida social. /// Althought this essay focuses mainly on the variations in emphasis suffered by Karl Mannheim's works 1920's, when he devoted himself determinaly to Sociology, it is the author's propose to help highlight the reasons justifying the absolute topicality of both his intellectual dimention and thought. It is defended that Mannheim's works are organized with a clear oneness of intention and an attemp is made to explain its meaning. Mannheim was a thinker of change and conflicit who dedicated his entire intellectual energy to interpreting and facing the crisis of orientation and participation undermining contemporary societies. Sociology was for him considered to be the science of integration, needed for orientation of human coexistence in a desintegrated, complex and highly polariz~<br>

Abstract: O sentido da intersubjectividade em Marcel liga-se à intenção de "restituir à experiência humana o seu peso ontológico", o que obriga à recusa do racionalismo contemporaneo, caracterizado pelos principios de inerencia e de objectividade, adoptando uma epistemologia pluralista e relativista em que o universal se degrada em colectivo e o necessário em repetível. O conhecimento válido para todos reduz-se ao verificável, tudo o mais é apenas objecto de crença, da ordem do subjectivo. Esta concepção situa-se no ambito do problemático, isto é, do objectivo, do posto completamente em face de mim. O mundo actual situa-se a esse nivel, corresponde à esfera do ter e a análise desse mundo mostra que ha na experiéncia humana como tal aspectos que transcendem o problemático, pertencendo ao dominio do mistério, que diz respeito à esfera do ser. Para, alcançar o que Marcel designa por mistério ontólogico analisamse, fora do registo lógico, certos dados propriamente espirituais, como a fidelidade, o amor, a esperança, que nos conduzem a um eu, subjectividade livre, que é experimentado com referencia a um tu. O compromisso entre eu e tu traduz-se em disponibilidade e apelo e estabelece uma relagao que é o nós, um co-esse, uma intimidade espiritual. Dentro da economia do pensamento marceliano ever é conceder crédito a um tu. No limite, se o tu for absolute, o credito deverá ser também absoluto. O tu absoluto, Deus, é existente suprapessoal e nunca pode ser tratado como objecto e, portanto, demonstrado, mas está presente à invocação. Afim da crença temos a esperanga que, no significado auténtico, se situa num contexto de provação. Distingue-se do optimismo e do desejo, transcende toda a técnica, não se desenvolve sobre um saber. É própria dos seres desarmados e nisso reside, misteriosamente, a sua eficácia. Consiste num esperar em, experiéncia absoluta no piano do mistério e certeza de transcender o que se encontra em perigo na provação, e participação numa realidade absoluta que me e~<br>

Abstract: O estudo visa apresentar os supostos teóricos e as tensões essenciais da tematização da ideia de Quinto Império na Defesa Perante o Tribunal do Santo Ofício, do P.e António Vieira. A visão profética de Vieira assume o contraste entre um tempo de inautenticidade na relação teândrica, subsidiário da Queda adâmica e objectivado na sucessão dos quatro impérios (cf. Daniel, 2, 27-45), e a novidade absoluta do acontecimento de Cristo, que se espera vir a manifestar-se na pacificação terrena do processo histórico e na constituição duma comunidade universal segundo o Espírito. A tese, que só um estudo ulterior poderá demonstrar, é a de que a perspectiva do Quinto Império, em Vieira, será, ainda subsidiária das categorias dominantes no tempo dos quatro impérios, em que a experiência escatológica se refracta antropocentricamente pelas finalidades, e relações de poder, político-civilizacionais. /// Cette étude presente les présupposés théoriques et les tensions essentielles de Ia thématisation de Tidée de Cinquième Empire dans Ia Défense Auprès du Tribunal du Saint-Office, du P.

Abstract: L'infini de la volonté voulante n'exclut pas la finitude de l'homme; il l'accentue plutôt dans la mesure où l'homme est incapable de saturer son désir et de s'achever par lui-même. Cette finitude apparaît comme disproportion ontologique dans l'écart du savoir, du pouvoir et du faire, comme faillite de la volonté voulue dans l'expérience de la faute meurtrière. L'ultime tentative de l'autosuffisance humaine consiste à borner le désir et à l'investir dans un fini absolutisé, comme en témoignage l'action superstitieuse. Dans le cas de l'option positive, qui est de "vouloir l'infini" , peut-on concevoir l'achèvement de l'action comme "divinisation" de l'homme? Oui, a condition de ne pas en faire un donné de nature, ni un acquis de l'homme, mais un accueil du don surnaturel qui exige l'aveu de l'insuffisance. /// O infinito da vontade profunda "voulante" não exclui a finitude do homem; antes a acentua na medida em que o homem é incapaz de saturar o seu desejo e de se completar por si mesmo. Esta finitude aparece como desproporção ontológica no distanciamento do saber, do poder e do fazer, como falência (faillite) da vontade concreta "voulue" na experiência da falta mortífera. A ùltima tentativa da autosuficiência humana consiste em limitar o desejo e em investir num finito absolutizado, como o testemunha a acção supersticiosa. No caso da opção positiva, que é de "querer o infinito", pode conceber-se o acabamento da acção como "divinizacao" do homem? Sim, se não se fizer disso urn dado da natureza, nem uma aquisição do homem, mas urn acolhimento do dom sobrenatural que exige a confissão da insuficiência. /// The infinity of the "willing will" ("volonté voulante") does not exclude man's finiteness. It rather stresses it, by the fact that man is unable to completely satisfy his desire, and to fulfil himself on his own. This finiteness appears as ontological disproportion far from both knowledge, power and acting, and as deficiency ("faillite") of the "willed will" ("volonté~<br>

Abstract: The article deals with constructivist versions of biographical research and its specific strengths and weaknesses. By switching its focus from what-and why-questions to how-questions, contructivism has been able to demonstrate how biographical accounts are staged and presented independently from their specific contents. Constructivism emphasises the irreconcilable difference between an event and the presentation of an event, as any account of biographical events is necessarily selective. The article wants to show, however, that making this difference for an absolute would make social research fundamentally impossible. It is in its central interests that biographical research clashes with the blindness for the historical formation of constructions and the leaving aside of their specific contents that are often typical of constructivist studies. Fritz Schuetz's 'Narrative Interview' and Ulrich Oevermann's 'Objective Hermeneutics' are suggested as two concepts of research that allow to reconstruct the selectivity of biographical accounts from the structural problems of acting in a specific biographical situation. Finally, the constructivist turn of the debate is illustrated by biographical accounts of conversion, and an alternative concept is suggested which adopts some constructivist elements but avoids their anti-realist consequences.<br>

Abstract: To see, to speak, to think : these are the three main topics of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, tragically interrupted in 1961. He intended to write two works on The Origin of Truth. To understand the relationship between Merleau-Ponty I and Merleau-Ponty II it is a good lead to pay attention to the relationship between seeing, speaking and thinking. In a central passage of Phenomenology of Perception (p. 451) this relationship is called Fundierung. Merleau-Ponty conceives it as a two way relationship, which excludes every possibility of reducing one term (thinking, reason) to another (perception, language). Yet, at that time he is not able to point out clearly the originality of thinking. L'Oeil et l'Esprit and Le Visible et l'Invisible provide a first outline of l'Origine de la Vérité. The 'second' Merleau-Ponty wants to 'reassume' his whole philosophy in what he calls : fundamental thinking. Painting opens the way to the mystery of seeing : something visible begins to see. Subject and object are no longer opposed to one another ; not even related by intentionality. The new key-word is Ineinander (interrelatedness, to be in one another, chiasm). 'La chair' (the flesh) is a new notion, broader and more fundamental than the body. The sensible reflects upon itself. This 're-flection' (reflexivity or reversibility) is a work of Being. The visible can be seen in principle. Philosophy should accompany the coming-to-see of the visible. In this perspective the transition to thinking (or ideality) must be seen as a new case of 'reversibilité'. The generality of the visible opens up to the 'invisible', that which in principle cannot be seen, but is 'the other side' of the visible. The basic phenomenon of expression is central here. Language is not an absolute starting point. Language is rather a new and more subtile form of coporeity, a new instance of the same basic reversibility, which already contains the seeds of ideality (logos endiathetor). The idea is of the word (logos ~<br>

Abstract: Em Portugal, o enquadramento sócio-político da droga constitui-se enquanto um «campo» especializado que se legitima através de um interdito absoluto. Neste artigo analisam-se os resultados de urna investigação sobre representações sociais da droga junto de párocos e médicos, relacionando-os com a forma pela qual os agentes políticos e médicos formulam simbolicamente o interdito. Este é apresentado em três planos cognitivos. Assim, analisa-se criticamente (a) o espaço semântico em que a droga é inscrita e que objectiva o seu consumidor como urna não-pessoa, (b) um dos princípios mais estruturantes do pensar e do agir em relaçâo à droga: a escalada farmacológica, e (c) a crença de que «a droga causa crime». Au Portugal, l'encadrement socio-politique de la drogue s'est constitué en un «champ» spécialisé qui est légitimé au travers d'un interdit absolu. Dans cet article, on analyse les résultats d'une recherche portant sur les représentations sociales de la drogue auprès de prêtres et de médecins. Ces résultats sont mis en relation avec le mode de formulation symbolique de l'interdit par les agents politiques et les médecins. Cet interdit est présenté selon trois plans cognitifs. Ainsi, analyse-t-on de façon critique (a) l'espace sémantique dans lequel est inscrit la drogue, et qui objective son consommateur comme une non-personne, (b) un principe de pensée et d'action parmi les plus structurants en matière de drogue: l'échelle pharmacologique, (c) la croyance que la «drogue provoque le crime». The socio-political framework of drugs in Portugal is that of a specialised «field», legitimised through an absolute prohibition. This article analyses the results of an investigation on the social representations of drugs as seen by parish-priests and doctors, subsequently relating them to the way in which political agents and doctors symbolically formulate the prohibition. The latter is presented in three cognitive plans, all critically analysed: (a) the semantic space in which~<br>

Abstract: Si la personnalité philosophique de Michel Henry est saluée, son œuvre continue, quarante ans apres L'essence de la manifestation, à ne pas être reçue, ou à ne l'être que sur la base de malentendus. Pourquoi ? Les raisons alléguées peuvent sembler faibles (le ton absolu de Michel Henry, l'indifférence politique ou la sensibilité de droite qu'on lui prête, etc.), elles renvoient (la reconnaissance généralement faite de la « puissance » de sa pensée, ce qui est pressenti avec ce terme, plaident en ce sens) à une autre, plus décisive : la réception n'est pas la réception dans le monde mais la reception dans la vie, de la vie par elle-même – ce qui néanmoins serait la condition d'une politique pour notre temps. If Michel Henry's philosophical personality is indeed hailed, his work goes on, forty years after The Essence of Manifestation, not being received but on the basis of misunderstandings. Why ? The alleged reasons may seem rather weak (e.g. Michel Henry's absolute tone, his so-called political indifference, or his right-winged sensitiveness) ; they refer to another, more decisive, one (what is usually acknowledged as a potency of thought) : reception does not mean reception in this very world, but in life, which nonetheless would be the condition of a new politics of our time.<br>

Abstract: Nombreux sont les versets coraniques qui insistent sur la toute-puissance de Dieu : en maître absolu du Bien et du Mal, il fait ce que bon lui semble, égarant et sauvant qui II veut. Pris au pied de la lettre, ces versets ont inspiré une vision déterministe et fataliste dé l'homme et du monde qui exclut toute possibilité de fonder une éthique rationnelle : le bien et le mal sont entièrement déterminés par la seule volonté de Dieu et l'islam se résume alors à une soumission aveugle aux décrets divins. Tenue pour responsable de l'ankylose de la pensée musulmane, voire des dérives obscurantistes de l'islamisme radical, cette position, qui résulte du triomphe de l'as'arisme dans le sunnisme postclassique, est de nos jours sévèrement critiquée par des théologiens soucieux de promouvoir un islam éclairé. Ceux-ci renouent souvent avec des doctrines mu'tazilites visant à atténuer, d'une façon ou d'une autre, la puissance divine et à reconnaître en Dieu une certaine « impuissance », afin de créer un espace pour l'homme. L'article retrace l'historique de ce débat, qui remonte aux origines mêmes de la théologie musulmane. Many verses in the Koran insist on God's omnipotence: as the absolute Master of Good and Evil, He does whatever he likes, condemning or saving whomever He decides. Understood literally, those verses have inspired a deterministic and fatalistic vision of man and the world, one which excludes any possibility of grounding a rational ethics. Both Good and Evil are totally determined by the will of God alone, and Islam may be summed up as a blind submission to divine decrees. This position, which results from the triumph of as'arism in post-classical sunnism, has been held responsible for the stagnation of Muslim thought, indeed for the obscurantist excesses of radical Islamism and is today severely criticized by some theologians concerned to promote an enlightened Islam. These scholars have often revived mu'tazilist doctrines whose aim is to weaken one way or ano~<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo propõe uma interpretação do fenômeno Chico Xavier na cultura e na sociedade brasileira. A partir do reconhecimento da importância cruciai de seu modelo mítico de espírita exemplar, o lugar de absolute destaque ocupado pelo médium mineiro na história do kardecismo brasileiro será interpretado à luz de urn código cultural articulado em sua biografia, que busca sintetizar os personagens paradigmáticos do "santo" e do "caxias". Desdobrado na unidade de sua obra mediúnica e trajetória pública, o tipo de espiritismo construído em Chico Xavier evidencia a proposta kardecista dominante ao longo do século XX, enquanto modelo de cidadania, prática religiosa e projeto nacional. The present article is a reading of the place of the phenomenon Chico Xavier in the Brazilian culture and society. Starting from the recognition of his crucial importance as a mythical model of exemplary spiritualist, the absolute prominence of the medium in the history of the Brazilian spiritualism will be interpreted in the light of a cultural code articulated in his biography, that synthesizes the Brazilian mythical characters of the "saint" and of the "caxias". Unfolded from his life and works the model of spiritualism built by Chico Xavier evidences the kardecismo's dominant religious point of view along the 20th Century, while citizenship model, religious practice and national project.<br>

Deste modo, procuramos mostrar que a vivência estética comporta um "impulso" que a lança na demanda de uma radicalidade que configura um horizonte de "absoluto", superando a imanência. The present text signals the itinerary from phenomenology to metaphysics, mediated by aesthetic experience, as we interpret it in Mikel Dufrennes work. Thus, we intend to show that aesthetic experience encompasses an impulse leading it on the demand of a radicality, which constitutes an horizon of absolute, overcoming the immanence.<br>

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Article Title: Catachresis and the Romantic Will: The Imagination's Usurpation in Wordsworth's "Prelude", Book 6<br>
Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113399<br>
Date: 4 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Haney David P.<br>
Abstract: In the apostrophe to "Imagination" in The Prelude, Book 6, a multileveled usurpation occurs which challenges the rhetorical foundation of Wordsworth's poem. The force of will exhibited in this passage is a paradoxical combination of actively exerted power and effortlessness, forced interruption and passively suffered usurpation, in which both the agent and the object of usurpation are put into question. The essential trope in this gesture is the anomalous figure of catachresis, whose uneasy place in eighteenth-century rhetorical classifications resulted from its combination of absolute propriety and absolute impropriety. For Wordsworth, this trope reveals the paradoxical connection between the powerful ground of the imagination's proper being and the abyss of loss and impropriety which threatens the imaginative will.<br>

Abstract: La critique phénoménologique de la métaphysique a opposé « l'intuition » à la « représentation », et le débat philosophique contemporain une phénoménologie « minimaliste » à une phénoménologie « maximaliste ». Face à ces alternatives, l'approfondissement weilien de l'expérience n'oppose ni la présence et l'absence, ni le fini et l'absolu, mais cherche à éprouver et penser le lien qui les unit, à partir de la structure trinitaire du don de l'être. À distance d'une médiation extériorisante comme d'une immanence pure, le processus de révélation n'est jamais négateur du mystère, mais en manifeste au contraire la profondeur. Ainsi, depuis la perception jusqu'à l'amour surnaturel, « évidence » et « mystère » vont toujours de pair, ce qui permet de ne rejeter aucun des niveaux de l'être et de l'expérience. The phenomenological critique of metaphysics opposed intuition and representation as contemporary debates in philosophy opposed minimalist and maximalist phenomenologies. Confronted with these alternatives the Weilean thought of experience neither opposes presence and absence, nor finite and absolute, but it tries to verify and think what unites them - based on the Trinitarian structure of the giving of being. Standing apart from exteriorizing mediation as from pure immanence, the revelation process never makes ineffective the mystery but expresses its depth. Thus, from perception to supernatural love, 'obviousness' and 'mystery' go together, which allows not to reject any levels of being and experience.<br>

Abstract: Que veut-on dire lorsqu'on parle aujourd'hui de valeur de travail ? Une libre réflexion de philosophie économique sur la notion de valeur et sur sa famille - valeur absolue, valeur relative, valeur d'usage, valeur d'échange, évaluation, valorisation, etc. tente d'apporter ici une réponse. Avec, pour exemple privilégié, la doctrine de Marx sur le travail dans le capitalisme et dans la société communiste. What do we mean when we speak about the value of work? This article tries to provide an answer to this question by analysing the notions of value and its different forms: absolute and relative value, use value and exchange value, evaluation and the creation of value. It draws especially on Marx's doctrine of work in capitalism and the communist society.<br>

Abstract: The text aims at considering from various points of view the presence of the value of truth in the work of art. The first step is a phenomenological analysis of epistemológical, ontological and aesthetic phenomena connected with perception of the work of art. Its conclusion is the statement that truth belongs to the characteristics of both creation (contents, structure) and reception (cognition of various aspects) of the work. The very fact that the aesthetic value of the object claiming to be beautiful can be discussed proves the presence of the object on the rational-veritable plane. The next aspect undertaken in the article is concerned with the epistemological and methodological criticism of the view (represented here by R. Ingarden) that there is a radical difference between the objective domains of science and art. An attempt is made to show that the view is rooted rather in ideologically understood scientism and neo-positivism than in a realistic conception of cognition through art. In a completely realistic attitude the borderline between 'what is rationally cognised' and 'what is beautiful' (the sphere of quasi in Ingarden's meaning) is not an absolute borderline. The domain of the work of art also contains cognitive elements, often existentially and morally essential for man's life. As it appears, a similar position can be found in G. B. Vico's texts that proclaim the unity of poetic and metaphysical perspective in ancient beginnings of anthropological thought about the human world. Nowadays a methodological tendency is observed on the philosophical plane that allows joining the veritable and aesthetic aspects, and hence exploring the objective domain of art in the cognitive aspect. This is expressed today, among others, in the increase of the significance of art in social, cultural and scientific life.<br>

Author(s): THURN DAVID H.<br>
Abstract: Tamburlaine's insistence on making his audience see his sovereign power is a means by which he can organize and control alterity by fixing himself in specular relation to his objects. As the palpable reflections of his identity, Tamburlaine's sights of power produce effects of dramatic literalization by which he can maintain his unified and stable position as sole emperor: the play orders its field of vision by constructing an imaginary subject in fixed relation to its objects. The play, to the extent that it posits stable links between a subject and its images, and between signifiers and signifieds generally, creates a delusional space in which absolute sovereignty becomes possible. The effects of sovereignty, however, continue to define not only the theatrical space of the play, but the space of interpretation as well: critics have tried to account for the contest between aspiration and limitation in Tamburlaine by invoking concepts of theme, genre, character, and author in order to make sense of and therefore stabilize the play's conflicting gestures. Like Tamburlaine, the critic constructs an imaginary space by creating objects in relation to which he can confirm his own unity and power. Tamburlaine thus becomes a figure for the claims of sovereignty that mark all acts of interpretation.<br>

Abstract: One of the acute problems of the early church was the tension between the absolute promise of Jesus and the fact that worthy prayers were not answered. Two types of solution developed. The more popular, drawing on Jewish precedent in the Old Testament, took the easy option, and blamed the petitioner for various forms of inadequacy. The other recognized the incarnational character of grace, and thus saw Christians as the hands and ears of God. When they listened to the needs of others and responded God heard and acted. Un des problèmes brûlants qui préoccupaient l'Église primitive était l'extrême tension entre la promesse absolue de Jésus et le fait que des prières apparemment dignes d'être exaucées restaient sans réponse. Deux types de solution se développèrent. L'explication la plus populaire, qui s'inspirait d'un précédent juif attesté dans l'Ancien Testament, choisit la solution facile : c'est l'orant qu'il fallait blâmer : sa prière avait été insuffisante. L'autre solution reconnaissait le caractère incarné de la grâce : les chrétiens étaient les mains et les oreilles de Dieu. Quand ils étaient attentifs aux besoins des autres et y répondaient, Dieu les écoutait et agissait.<br>

Abstract: La transition vers l'État de droit et la démocratie qui a eu lieu dans de nombreux pays (Argentine, Chili, Afrique du Sud, Haïti, pour n'en citer que quelques-uns) au cours de ces dernières décennies a remis à l'ordre du jour le problème de l'amnistie. Doit-on, au nom de la réconciliation et de la paix civile, renoncer à traduire en justice les anciens bourreaux ? Ou bien doiton, au nom de la justice due aux victimes, les traduire en justice ? Poser la question de cette façon, c'est suggérer qu'il existe une opposition absolue entre l'amnistie et la justice. Dans notre contribution, nous voudrions montrer que cette opposition n'est pas aussi absolue qu'on le pense et que l'amnistie peut aussi parfois être nécessaire pour préserver ou réinstaurer les conditions de possibilité de la justice. The transition towards a state of law and democracy which has taken place in many countries in the last decades (Argentina, Chili, South Africa, Haïti, to mention just a few) brings up again the problem of amnisty. In the name of reconciliation and civil peace, should former torturers and hangmen be released from justice? Or, to do justice to victims, should they be brought to trial? Put that way, the question suggests an absolute opposition between amnisty and justice. In this article we want to show that this opposition is not so absolute as one might think and that amnisty is sometimes necessary to preserve or to re-instate the condititions for the possibility of justice.<br>

Abstract: Le projet de Pierre Thévenaz d'une «philosophie sans absolu» est le fruit de la rencontre entre la raison philosophique et l'expérience-choc de l'annonce chrétienne, qui restitue à l'humain sa dimension uniquement et radicalement humaine. Le monde d'ici-bas devient ainsi le lieu de l'homme dans son histori cité. La méthode de cette conversion à l'en deçà est celle d'une radicalisation de la philosophie reflexive. Si désormais «la raison c'est l'homme», la tâche d'une «philosophie sans absolu» devient l'herméneutique de la condition humaine. P. Thévenaz' project for a "philosophy without an absolute" is the fruit of the meeting of philosophical Reason with the shock-experience of the Christian message which restored to humankind its unique and radically human dimension. The earthly world thus becomes the place of humankind in its historicity. The method of converting to this side is a radicalisation of reflexive philosophy. If henceforth "reason is mankind", then the work of a "philosophy without an absolute" becomes the hermeneutics of the human condition.<br>

Abstract: Quelques questions philosophiques suggérées par la lecture du livre de J.-P. Jossua Lectures en écho. Journal théologique I, Paris 1976. Le recours à l'« expérience » devant la faillite des divers dogmatismes permet-il de donner un sens au témoignage de l'absolu? Le refus d'appuyer le christianisme à la culpabilité doit-il aboutir nécessairement à une revendication d'innocence sans intégrer l'apport des analyses de la flnitude et thématiser la condition de créature, inséparablement innocente et coupable? Penser que l'écriture est le lieu privilégié de manifestation du « je », n'est-ce pas recourir au postulat ontologique de la vérité comme fusion de la parole, du sens, du vécu, de la présence de l'homme et de sa vie? Some philosophical questions which arose from reading the book of J.-P. Jossua, Lectures en écho. Journal théologique I, Paris 1976. When faced with the failure of various dogmatisms, would not the recourse to "experience" by its very nature prevent "witness" from being an affirmation of the Absolute? By refusing to let Christianity lean on culpability, would one necessarily end up in a claim of innocence which would not integrate the contribution of analyses of limitedness and which would not come to grips with the condition of a creature which is inseparably innocent and culpable? By thinking that writing is the privileged place for the manifestation of the "ego", is one not resorting to the ontological postulate of truth as an amalgamation of word, sens, existence of man and life?<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de P. Ricœur laisse envisager une articulation spécifique entre la structure métaphysique de l'existence, caractérisée comme réflexion décentrée, et le mode propre selon lequel le religieux fait sens. En son principe, le religieux est coextensif au mouvement même de la réflexion, dont l'herméneutique constitue à la fois la vérité et la méthode: tension temporelle du soi entre son acte propre et les signes qu'il produit (Nabert), au sein du sens qui le précède. Sans jamais combler spéculativement la faille entre le soi et l'absolu, le religieux présente à l'imagination (au sens kantien) le scheme de l'accomplissement de l'existence. The work of P. Ricœur allows one to envisage the possibility of a specific link between the metaphysical nature of existence, depicted as eccentric reflection, and the standart view which gives religion its direction. In its principle, the 'religious' factor is co-extensive with the flow of reflection, whose hermeneutic constitutes not only the truth, but also the method: a temporal tension in the Self as between one's own actions and the effects they produce (J. Nabert), in the context of the intention which precedes them. While never spcculativcly overloading the fissure between the Self and the Absolute, religiosity affords to the imagination (in the sense used by Kant) a pattern for the fulfilment of existence.<br>

Abstract: La relation entre spiritualisme et philosophie réflexive peut donner lieu à deux lectures inverses : ou bien la méthode reflexive trouve son fondement dans la reconnaissance de la réalité de l'esprit, ou bien c'est la pratique réflexive qui autorise et au besoin contrôle la portée des affirmations spiritualistes. L'article se situe dans cette seconde lignée. La précession de l'être par l'être qui définit la condition de la conscience ne légitime aucune intuition de l'Absolu, mais bien une affirmation ontologique originaire. L'âme, c'est la passion d'intériorité de cette auto-affirmation manifestante. Quant à l'Esprit, troisième dimension de l'être, c'est un Advenir éthique qui n'est en acte qu'à travers le monde des êtres, dans la rencontre réflexive multilatérale des consciences. The relationship between spiritualism and philosophical reflexivity can be seen in one of two ways: either a recognition of the reality of the spirit gave rise to the reflexive concept, or the practice of reflexivity came first and widened the scope of spiritual affirmations, controlling them when necessary. The article favours the latter view. The ability of a being to form a judgment about itself, and thus create a conscience, does not justify any conclusion about an Absolute, being on the contrary one of the basic statements of ontology. The soul is the result of this active self-judgment emerging from its seclusion. As for the spirit, the third component of the being, this is an ethical by-product which only comes into play through the world of beings, in the multilateral reflexive meeting of consciences.<br>

Abstract: Yves Bonnefoy est plus reconnu encore par sa réflexion sur la poésie que par son œuvre même. À partir de l'analyse d'un texte de 1959, on étudie cette conception, dont les mots-clés sont : finaude, présence, espoir, ici et maintenant, absolu; les références décisives : Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Léopardi. On complète grâce à des écrits ultérieurs, qui témoignent contre l'univers des notions, l'occultisme surréaliste, la clôture linguistique, et insistent sur la forme, le son de la poésie. Yves Bonnefoy is better known for his reflections on poetry than for his own works. Here based on an analysis of a text from 1959, the author studies Bonnefoy's perspective of which the key-words are perfection, presence, hope, the here and the now, the absolute; the principal influences are : Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Leopardi The study concludes with a consideration of his later works, which testify against the universe of notions, surrealist occultism, linguistic boxs, while insisting on form and sound of poetry.<br>

Abstract: Northrop Frye's recent criticism confronts the contemporary problem raised most powerfully by the Vietnam War-can we find a telos or definition of man on which we can ground our moral reactions and our visions of human development. Frye establishes this telos by an analysis of origins. Contained in a civilization's statements of "concern," in its imaginative treatments of its own condition, one can find an underlying structure of desire which defines the ends of man. This structure and the recurrent images it produces then can serve as the middle terms people use to justify and value their actions. Frye shares his treatment of mediation with contemporary Hegelians like Sartre, Lukács, and Ricoeur, but grounds his absolute in tradition rather than in ideal absolutes or posited evolutionary patterns. Frye's idea of mediation also provides an ethical model for literary criticism: the critic tries to combine literature as product and as cultural possession by interpreting his materials as projections of imaginative desire. Furthermore, we can use Frye to criticize the relativist denial of origins in structuralist critics like Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.<br>

Abstract: One such recurring motif is the use of flowers in general and pink roses in particular. They connect the reader's experiences from the first part with the second part in a way that he, perhaps subconsciously, is reminded of that first experience and the happiness of that textual memory. Langman writes that this motif functions “as a simple unifying device, reminding us of one scene as we read another” (43). There are several rose motifs in the opening of the novel. The first that attracts Nick's attention at the Buchanans’ home is the rose garden: “a half acre of deep pungent roses.” Later, Nick and Tom enter “into a bright rosy-colored space” (7); they look through “a rosy-colored porch” (11); and Daisy (herself named after a flower) calls Nick “a rose, an absolute rose” (14).<br>

Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Is philosophy, perhaps all philosophy, ultimately founded on the absolute certainty of death, that we are all, in one way or another, sentenced to death? Derrida demonstrates philosophy's bind to death and the death penality. Yet, in his last seminar, while powerfully calling into question the meaning of death and who can die, Derrida also appeals to the fact that every living being dies as perhaps the ultimate ethical bind. Has death, then, as the absolute and only equalizer, replaced the absolute authority of God, whether Kant's rational one or Levinas's Other one? The death penalty as executed in this country makes clear that both ethics and politics demand that we think through our own death drive rather than bank on the fantasy of equality through death, the fantasy of instant death, or the fantasy of death as the final and absolute resting place. To do so covers over the differences between deaths and death penalties—to be blunt, between so many ways of dying and so many ways of being executed, assassinated, or killed.<br>

Abstract: Brentano concedes that we do not grasp the substance of our self merely in general as anything whatsoever but specified as a mental substance and adds that “we do not grasp this substance as individuated by ultimate substantial differences.”
            
                  However, in an effort to account for how it is that each I is de facto aware of himself as being a determinate individual and as the one individual substance underlying all psychical or mental activities—and we are aware innerly of this with the absolute certitude of inner perception—Brentano has recourse to a kind of transcendental argument: Something can have such immediate evidence not through perceiving another thing but only because it is identical with itself—“now a thing can have immediate evidence only of that which15
               is identicalwith it.”

Abstract: Marx led me to critical theory. If one were to reconstruct the beginning from my perspective, exhibit number one would be the special issue on hermeneutics and critical theory published as volume 2, number 4, of the journal
            Cultural Hermeneutics(February 1975), which I founded in 1973. I organized a conference featuring the old Hans-Georg Gadamer (my new colleague) and the young Rüdiger Bubner, which attempted to construct a dialogue between the two philosophical disciplines, hermeneutics and critical theory. Gadamer's essay “Hermeneutics and Social Sciences,” given as a talk without a written text (later it was the target of a summer's work by me and some of my graduate students, who made it into a text), was, I am told, one of the first things by Gadamer to appear in English. Looking back, Gadamer was eloquent in his characterization of the critique that critical theory made of his hermeneutic position. He, of course, although we didn't give him credit for it at the time, knew well what defined the difference between critical theory and hermeneutics, having hired Habermas just at the timeWarheit und Methodewas published. Habermas's review began the debate. Gadamer attacked the notion of “emancipatory reflection,” which he defined as “a critique of the process of self-illumination which is supposed to bring about a social discourse free from force.” According to Gadamer, such a claim is impossible because there can be “no reflection at all without a prior basis of common agreement.” The weakness of critical theory is that it takes over the program of “critique of ideology,” which falsely presumes that it can “enthrone its own norms and ideals as self-evident and absolute.” Hermeneutics, on the contrary, offers us the possibility of a return to “practical reason,” freeing us from the “domination of technology.”
                  Gadamer received a kind of standard criticism from Bubner and others, who claimed that going back to the tradition of practical~<br>

Abstract: Such a transfer is a matter of habit for Derrida. Thus, he writes, “Language has started without us, in us and before us. This is what theology calls God.”
            
                  Or again, Derrida speaks of “the absolute singularity of the other, whose name here is God” (GD 66).21
               
                  Or once again, “God is the name of the possibility I have of keeping a secret that is visible from the interior but not from the exterior” (GD 108). When such human characteristics or capacities as language, singularity, and interiority are given as the meaning of “God,” we have, once again, Feuerbachian atheism.22<br>

Author(s): Steinbock Anthony<br>
Abstract: The first of these four sections, entitled “Radicalizing Phenomenology,” consists of three articles, each of which pushes phenomenology beyond itself into exciting new directions. Frédéric Seyler's “Fichte in 1804: A Radical Phenomenology of Life?” compares two thinkers who stand at the ends of the chronological spectrum of the phenomenological movement—Fichte and Michel Henry—but who nevertheless share the common aim of offering a phenomenology of life. Seyler argues that this aim leads them to confront an unsurpassable limit, inasmuch as a phenomenology of life attempts to grasp something that is strictly invisible or ineffable: the absolute as life that lies beyond or underneath the subject/object split. Crina Gschwandtner's article, “Revealing the Invisible: Henry and Marion on Aesthetic Experience,” also discusses Henry and considers him in relation to Jean-Luc Marion, with a focus not on the religious implications of their work but, rather, on their aesthetics. Concentrating on the relationship between the visible and invisible and on the way that each thinker privileges the phenomenon of art, Gschwandtner uncovers parallels between and also critically interrogates Henry's and Marion's theories of art and the artist. Finally, in “Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's
      Phenomenology ‘Wide Open,’” Scott Davidson stages a critical engagement between Dominique Janicaud and Paul Ricoeur, arguing both that Janicaud's attempt to distance himself from hermeneutic phenomenology is unsuccessful and that the true significance of his minimal phenomenology has yet to be fully appreciated. Davidson further argues that reflecting on the relationship between minimal and hermeneutic phenomenology reveals important new possibilities for phenomenological reflection today.<br>

Abstract: For, if phenomenology renounces its search for the absolute and for foundations, then it must give up seeing itself as a single and self-contained discourse. The minimal phenomenologist renounces monolinguism and is no longer the master of only one discourse. Instead, he or she must practice a mixed discourse. To do this is to practice diglossia, to become a code-switcher. In its ordinary sense, the practice of code-switching refers to the passage from one language or dialect to another one in the course of a single conversation, for instance, when the conversation moves from an informal to a formal setting or when it moves from one topic to another. But in the phenomenological context, this would involve the ability to shift from a phenomenological discourse to its “others,” whether they might be Freudian energetics, Deleuzian aspects, Badiouan events, and so on. This practice of translation or code-switching has perhaps always been the role of the phenomenologist, if it is accepted that phenomenological reflection does not begin from itself but is nourished by a life that precedes it and gives rise to it.<br>

Abstract: At its heighthyperbole, the absolute opening, the uneconomic expenditure, is always reembraced by aneconomyand is overcome by economy. The relationship between reason, madness, and death is an economy, a structure of deferral whose irreducible originality must be respected. This attempt-to-say-the-demonic-hyperbole is not an attempt among others; it is not an attempt which would occasionally and eventually be completed by the saying of it, or by its object, the direct object of a willful subjectivity. This attempt to say, which is not, moreover, the antagonism of silence, but rather the condition for it, is the original profundity of will in general. (1978, 61–62)<br>

Author(s): Einsohn Howard Ira<br>
Abstract: Like Ricoeur, Shaw invests his ethical capital in enhancing life, not in obeying rules. In the celebrated dream sequence of
         Man and Superman, Shaw includes duty as one of the seven deadly virtues that cause more detriment than benefit. For him, there is no act, however heinous, that some well-intentioned individual has not justified under the rubric of duty. The road to hell, Shaw said famously, is paved with the good intentions of those who in the aftermath of disastrous results defended themselves by claiming that duty compelled them to do what they did. For this reason, his recording angel is not keenly interested in what Kantian precepts individuals have or have not followed. What counts for the celestial Shavian bookkeeper is whether actions make the world better or worse, whether they reduce suffering and increase happiness—with happiness defined as the joy, the wellness, that comes from serving a purpose greater than narrow self-interest. “[C]onduct,” Shaw writes, “must justify itself by its effect upon life and not by its conformity to any rule or ideal.”
               And effecting life, in the sense Shaw understands it, is not a matter of dutifully genuflecting before conventional morality but of asserting the autonomous will, even if it engenders charges of immorality. “[L]ife,” he continues, “consists in the fulfilment of will”33
            
               and not in, as he reiterates in34
            The Sanity of Art, “the fulfilment of a moral law or of the deductions of reason.”
               Even so, Shaw makes it very clear that in crowning the will sovereign he is not championing anarchy. For every sanctioned principle his visionaries disavow, they honor nine. Shaw does not condone recklessness or wild abandon. Before the will sets events in motion, prudence and deliberative judgment, he believes, should prepare the way. He is well aware that we cannot dispense with tradition entirely and reasonably expect society to remain stable. Rat~<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Ruth Levitas has suggested that “in the move beyond modernism, the Utopian method needs to be seen as provisional … dialogic … and … reflexive.”
         
               Joyce himself makes this move: his work does not engage in the theoretical absolutism of so much classical modernism—an absolute faith in the transcendental authority of theoretical ideals that so often led toward a political fundamentalism of the Left or of the Right. By contrast, Joyce's writing operates from a heteroglossic perspective that parallels Bakhtin and preempts postmodernist pluralism. Unlike Orwell or Huxley, Joyce demonstrates that a democratic literary response to absolutist Utopianism need not take the form of a cautionary dystopianism. Joyce instead offers an affirmatory and comedic set of possibilities.167<br>

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: While there is real value in considering the associations between architecture and Utopia, an argument for architecture
      asUtopia is less promising. If architecturemustembody the four elements introduced above to be called a Utopia (which is the assertion here), then identifying any individual work of architecture or larger urban ensemble as a Utopia would be all but impossible. But shifting the scale somewhat, so that a requirement fortotal application(as is associated with Utopia in its blueprint form) is surrendered, conceptualizing Utopia as ever unfinished—and acceptably so—becomes possible. Thinking of architecture as havingutopian potential, or autopian dimension, enables a more productive way to consider how Utopia could enrich architecture. Rather than requiring an absolute embodiment of the four elements of Utopia introduced above, some persuasive admixture of them that renders a work convincinglyutopianwould be acceptable, even at the level of a single building, as apartial Utopia. Even so, detailed description of the proposed transformation, particularly its social dimension, and how this would ostensibly improve conditions, is requisite.
