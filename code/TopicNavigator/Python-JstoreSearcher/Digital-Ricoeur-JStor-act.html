  Book Title: The Political Style of Conspiracy-Chase, Summer, and Lincoln<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Pfau Michael William<br>
  Abstract: The turbulent history of the United States has provided a fertile ground for conspiracies, both real and imagined. From the American Revolution to the present day, conspiracy discourse-linguistic and symbolic practices and artifacts revolving around themes, claims, or accusations of conspiracy-has been a staple of political rhetoric. Some conspiracy theories never catch on with the public, while others achieve widespread popularity. Whether successful or not, the means by which particular conspiracy theories spread is a rhetorical process, a process in which persuasive language, symbolism, and arguments act upon individual minds within concrete historical and political settings.Conspiracy rhetoric was a driving force in the evolution of antebellum political culture, contributing to the rise and fall of the great parties in the nineteenth century. One conspiracy theory in particular-the "slave power" conspiracy-was instrumental in facilitating the growth of the young Republican Party's membership and ideology.
      The Political Style of Conspiracyanalyzes the concept and reality of the "slave power" in the rhetorical discourse of the mid-nineteenth-century, in particular the speeches and writing of politicians Salmon P. Chase, Charles Sumner, and Abraham Lincoln. By examining their mainstream texts, Pfau reveals that, in addition to the "paranoid style" of conspiracy rhetoric that inhabits the margins of political life, Lincoln, Chase, and Sumner also engaged in a distinctive form of conspiracy rhetoric that is often found at the center of mainstream American society and politics.<br>

  Abstract: Our globalized world of today brings with it a unity of humankind such as never experienced before. Opportunities to fi ght hunger and poverty on a worldwide level and to act globally against the threats of climate change have come within the reach of humankind. Globalization, however, also brings with it terrorist threats and related apocalyptic dangers. Concerning religion, the world of today faces two important challenges. We need to overcome an all too simple secularism that reduces religion to a solely private matter, and we have to acknowledge the plurality of religions at the local as well as at<br>

  Author(s) Graham Tyler<br>
  Abstract: The groundwork for my encounter with the work of René Girard was laid early in my life. I grew up in a tumultuous era that sensitized me to violence. Trips with my parents through the U.S. South enabled me to observe the persistence of Jim Crow in “colored” and “white” schools. Even as a child, I saw and felt that race-based disparities in educational opportunity constituted a reprehensible act of violence. The Vietnam War shaped my experience in high school and college. Especially in college, I brought the resources of my liberal education to bear upon the violence around me.<br>

  Abstract: Hispanos in northern New Mexico commemorate the death of a loved one with a written narrative referred to as a recuerdo (a remembrance). These narratives (or ballads) share many characteristics of the corrido and its forerunner, the Spanish romance. The romance, a popular form of epic poetry, and the corrido depict events in the lives of heroic, historical, and common folk. Both reflect historical events, describe injustices, depict social values, and present moral teachings elicited from catastrophic social events, for example, a tragic murder, a sentence of death, or imprisonment for a heinous act.

  Abstract: The vicissitudes of authorship revisited in chapter 6 point to a larger issue. Since around 2000 there has been a lot of musicological effort lavished on the “workconcept” and the competing claims of the fixed, authoritative musical work and the creative act of performance, mostly to the detriment of the work. Like most such binary quarrels, this one reveals a little and obscures a lot. It certainly oversimplifies the historical situation, which is full of complex instances in which the roles of the work—as inscription, conception, or instruction—and of performance—as animation, interpretation, or reproduction—meet, mix, and<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pns1h">Imagining Karma</a><br>
  Abstract: In this final chapter I want to further explore a theme that pervades much of this work, that even radical religious innovation must occur within the frame of preexisting structures of thought, which can on occasion act as “prisons of the

The innocence of the scapegoated lamb of God is transferred to us. Our own deeds of justice, our own good works, our own holiness, do not make us just in the sight of God. Our justice is rather an alien justice, one that comes to us from without but one that becomes our own through an act of God’s grace. Our justification is a gift.<br>

In doing so, Marion would claim, any autarchic subjectivity (whether transcendental or existential) is dethroned and dismantled in one and the same act that givenness (

  Book Title: A Scholar's Tale: Intellectual Journey of a Displaced Child of Europe-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): HARTMAN GEOFFREY<br>
  Abstract: For more than fifty years, Geoffrey Hartman has been a pivotal figure in the humanities. In his first book, in 1954, he helped establish the study of Romanticism as key to the problems of modernity. Later, his writings were crucial to the explosive developments in literary theory in the late seventies, and he was a pioneer in Jewish studies, trauma studies, and studies of the Holocaust. At Yale, he was a founder of its Judaic Studies program, as well as of the first major video archive for Holocaust testimonies.Generations of students have benefited from Hartman's generosity, his penetrating and incisive questioning, the wizardry of his close reading, and his sense that the work of a literary scholar, no less than that of an artist, is a creative act. All these qualities shine forth in this intellectual memoir, which will stand as his autobiography. Hartman describes his early education, uncanny sense of vocation, and development as a literary scholar and cultural critic. He looks back at how his career was influenced by his experience, at the age of nine, of being a refugee from Nazi Germany in the Kindertransport. He spent the next six years at school in England, where he developed his love of English literature and the English countryside, before leaving to join his mother in America.Hartman treats us to a biobibliographyof his engagements with the major trends in literary criticism. He covers the exciting period at Yale handled so controversially by the media and gives us vivid portraits, in particular, of Harold Bloom, Paul de Man, and Jacques Derrida.SEND GEOFFREY COVER COPY All this is set in the context of his gradual self-awareness of what scholarship implies and how his personal displacements strengthened his calling to mediate between European and American literary cultures. Anyone looking for a rich, intelligible account of the last half-century of combative literary studies will want to read Geoffrey Hartman's unapologetic scholar's tale.<br>

  Book Title: Malicious Objects, Anger Management, and the Question of Modern Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kreienbrock Jörg<br>
  Abstract: Why do humans get angry with objects? Why is it that a malfunctioning computer, a broken tool, or a fallen glass causes an outbreak of fury? How is it possible to speak of an inanimate object's recalcitrance, obstinacy, or even malice? When things assume a will of their own and seem to act out against human desires and wishes rather than disappear into automatic, unconscious functionality, the breakdown is experienced not as something neutral but affectively--as rage or as outbursts of laughter. Such emotions are always psychosocial: public, rhetorically performed, and therefore irreducible to a "private" feeling. By investigating the minutest details of life among dysfunctional household items through the discourses of philosophy and science, as well as in literary works by Laurence Sterne, Jean Paul, Friedrich Theodor Vischer, and Heimito von Doderer, Kreienbrock reconsiders the modern bourgeois poetics that render things the way we know and suffer them.<br>

Is not an ethics always already written from the standpoint of God, as it were? “Do Thou examine the motives upon which thy actions shall be based and act upon a maxim that thou would’st will to become a universal law.” Or, “Assess the outcomes of thy actions and comport thyself accordingly.” More modestly stated, in writing an ethics, one creates a macro, it would seem, a system of keystrokes that is entered into the memory of one’s computer, and then orders, “Execute.” Baudrillard might say playfully that<br>

  Abstract: Contemporary literary criticism is guided by the belief that a human act is best understood by considering the space and time in which it emerges. This idea is powerful in its simplicity, appealing to the notion that more background information is always better. It is less clear whether the assumption of a fundamental connection, if not an outright identity, between origin and purpose is sound for all social or aesthetic phenomena. Can and must the study of

  Abstract: For some economists, institutional theories offer an attractive alternative, or perhaps better put, attractive supplements, to conservative approaches based on the work of free-market theorists such as Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, as well as liberal theories based on the work of John Maynard Keynes, which taken together form the central doctrines of what has been called the “neoclassical synthesis.”¹ According to one noted conservative economist, neoclassical economic theory is based on several fundamental assumptions, including the following: “1. People have rational preferences among outcomes. 2. Individuals maximize utility and firms maximize profits. 3. People act independently on the basis<br>

  Abstract: Johan Huizinga’s work has received renewed attention with the emergence and expansion of Game Studies. An important aspect of Huizinga’s explication of play is its bounded nature. Like other cultural artefacts Huizinga describes in
                  Homo ludens(1955), the act of game playing requires the crossing of a boundary that marks the game from the ordinary world. The crossing of this boundary into game-space implies a shift in the players’ identity that takes them from their everyday, “ordinary” selves, into their ludic selves. Suits has described this as the “lusory attitude” (1978, 52); a disposition one enters into when interacting with<br>

To act properly as a mayor of a city, a chief of a police department, a head of a large corporation, or a commander of an engaged military unit, one must have morally dirty hands.

  Book Title: The Executed God-The Way of the Cross in Lockdown America<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Taylor Mark Lewis<br>
  Abstract: The new edition of Mark Lewis Taylor’s award-winning The Executed God is both a searing indictment of the structures of “Lockdown America" and a visionary statement of hope. It is also a call for action to Jesus followers to resist US imperial projects and power. Outlining a “theatrics of state terror," Taylor identifies and analyzes its instruments—mass incarceration, militarized police tactics, surveillance, torture, immigrant repression, and capital punishment—through which a racist and corporatized Lockdown America enforces in the US a global neoliberal economic and political imperialism. Against this, The Executed God proposes a “counter-theatrics to state terror," a declamation of the way of the cross for Jesus followers that unmasks the powers of US state domination and enacts an adversarial politics of resistance, artful dramatic actions, and the building of peoples’ movements. These are all intrinsic to a Christian politics of remembrance of the Jesus executed by empire. Heralded in its first edition, this new edition is thoroughly revised, updated, and expanded, offering a demanding rethinking and recreating of what being a Christian is and of how Christianity should dream, hope, mobilize, and act to bring about what Taylor terms “a liberating material spirituality" to unseat the state that kills.<br>

  Book Title: Acceptable words-Essays on the poetry of Geoffrey Hill<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): WAINWRIGHT JEFFREY<br>
  Abstract: Geoffrey Hill has said that some great poetry 'recognises that words fail us'. These essays explore Hill's struggle over fifty years with the recalcitrance of language. This book seeks to show how all his work is marked by the quest for the right pitch of utterance whether it is sorrowing, angry, satiric or erotic. It shows how Hill's words are never lightly 'acceptable' but an ethical act, how he seeks out words he can stand by - words that are 'getting it right'. This book is the most comprehensive and up-to-date critical work on Geoffrey Hill so far, covering all his work up to ‘Scenes from Comus’ (2005), as well as some poems yet to appear in book form. It aims to contribute something to the understanding of his poetry among those who have followed it for many years and students and other readers encountering this major poet for the first time.<br>

To perceive the landscape is therefore to carry out an act of remembrance, and remembering is not so much a matter of calling up an internal image, stored in the mind, as of engaging perceptually with an environment that is itself pregnant with the past (Ingold, 1993, p. 152).<br>

In 2001, a truth and reconciliation commission, or Comisión de la Verdad y Reconciliación (CVR), was established by the transitional government of Valentín Paniagua to examine atrocities committed during the 1980s and 1990s, when Peru was plagued by the worst violence in its history. The CVR was given a two-year term to produce a rigorous research on the violence. The final report was completed and published in 2003.<br>

  Abstract: Sacrifice has been a widely practiced human act, various in its details, variously understood by those who have sought to explain it, and now almost unknown as an actual practice in developed countries. Most of those who have written on the subject would agree that sacrifice “means something” or “accomplishes something” beyond what is strictly observed, though most primary texts on sacrifice focus on what is
                  done, not on what itmeans.J. H. M. Beattie wrote in 1980, “sacrificial ritual, like other rites, is a form of art, a drama, which is believed by its performers … to work.<br>

  Abstract: Luther seems to have many faces—in part, for external reasons. He lived in a turbulent time of profound transformations in all sectors: in culture, economy, social and political order, religion, and in morality. Luther never had the privilege or the misfortune of being able to reflect with an inner or outer distance on the historical process in upheaval. Not only was he forced to think, speak, and act in the middle of events; the facts themselves, so to speak, rained down on him, while others barreled him over.

Central to these debates are its supposed merits and shortcomings regarding its representation of sensitive political issues.

  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): Murray-Román Jeannine<br>
  Abstract: Focusing on the literary representation of performance practices in anglophone, francophone, and hispanophone Caribbean literature, Jeannine Murray-Román shows how a shared regional aesthetic emerges from the descriptions of music, dance, and oral storytelling events. Because the historical circumstances that led to the development of performance traditions supersede the geopolitical and linguistic divisions of colonialism, the literary uses of these traditions resonate across the linguistic boundaries of the region. The author thus identifies the aesthetic that emerges from the act of writing about live arts and moving bodies as a practice that is grounded in the historically, geographically, and culturally specific features of the Caribbean itself.<br>

Working backward, from this we can posit, still speaking analogically, that God’s act of creation generated the myth or concept of creation that is involved in the process and results of literary writing. Such a myth of creation should be understood in at least two senses: first, myth as an originary tale (récit) of foundation that has come down to us via the Judeo-Christian tradition (Genesis), and second, myth in<br>

  Book Title: Contextual Theology-The Drama of Our Times<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Matheny Paul Duane<br>
  Abstract: For centuries, the global understanding of Church has been shaped by Western theological imperatives. Yet today, the decline of institutional religion in the West, and the extraordinary growth of the Church of the global South mean that a radical movement beyond such theologies is required. In this book, Paul Matheny argues that the Church would benefit by becoming more contextualized and less Western. Contextual Theology is an attempt to address that issue and to examine how a reassessment of the relationship of the Gospel to cultural context can advance this critical and necessary development. Through an accessible and critical approach, Matheny considers the historical background to contextual theology.

  Author(s) Haddorff David<br>
  Abstract: In the last chapter, we saw how Barth, in his early writings, responded theologically and practically to the events around him during 1910s and 1920s. Reversing the dominant structure of modern ethics, which attempts to secure human freedom by separating humanity from God, Barth saw clearly that human freedom depends upon God’s freedom to act
                  in relatio. Thus, his task, in these early writings, was not to simply contrast God’s action and our action as the way to preserve human autonomy, but instead attempts to demonstrate how divine agency establishes, rather than negates, human agency. This theme more fully emerges<br>

  Abstract: The response of wonder before God’s communication of esse deepens when we become aware that God gives the human person, along with the capacity to stand on his own, the capacity to act out of his own being (
                  autexousia).¹ When God gives, he gives because he wants to share his giving. In fact, it would not be a real giving if God did not allow the concrete singular being to participate in his capacity to give, in his own freedom. The divine creating act goes so far that Aquinas claims that the human person is the cause of himself.² Gregory<br>

  Abstract: On first read, Vanhoozer and de Lubac would seem a most unfit choice of dialogue partners of the topic of God’s use of Scripture. Vanhoozer insists on the sufficiency of the literal sense, while de Lubac insists on the indispensability of the spiritual sense. Vanhoozer develops an elaborate proposal for God’s authorship based on speech-act theory, while de Lubac largely ignores divine authorship and instead focuses attention on God’s sacramental presence in Scripture. Vanhoozer focuses on Scripture’s determinate meaning, while de Lubac focuses on Scripture’s infinite meaning. Yet what the two have in common is their persistent emphasis on God’s<br>

  Book Title: Forms of Life-Character and Moral Imagination in the Novel<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): PRICE MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Martin Price writes here about ways in which character has been conceived and presented in the novels of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Beginning with chapters that cogently argue the artistic value of character, Price then deals with the different forms character has taken in individual novels. His first discussions center on authors-Jane Austen, Stendhal, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, and Leo Tolstoy-who define individuals by their adherence or opposition to social norms. The next chapters deal with novelists for whom the moral world is largely internalized. The characters of Henry James, Joseph Conrad, D.H. Lawrence, and E.M. Forster live in society and act upon it, but the authors are particularly concerned with the confusions, terrors, and heroism that lie within consciousness. The last chapter uses novels about the artist by James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Thomas Mann in order to apprehend the process by which experience is transformed into art.<br>

Does such acting necessarily entail fatherly and obedient approach of a dependent within and outside of the church? How is Christian acting interconnected with Christian freedom and equality?

  Abstract: The Cartesian-Kantian anthropomorphic subject represents a state of continual immanence in terms of its indefinite and infinite possibilities. The linguistic turn takes an anthropocentric form that has been embedded in the Cartesian-Kantian metaphysics of presence. Wittgenstein, especially, takes language as an enactable rule-governed activity, thereby making it immanent to the ‘lived experiences’ of the users of language. Heidegger introduces a comprehensive embeddedness of being in language and viceversa, thereby assigning it a hermeneutical closure. In such anthropomorphic and anthropocentric moves, what is lost is the very ground of reality on which language must act. A project of recovery of the<br>

  Book Title: Seamus Heaney as Aesthetic Thinker-A Study of the Prose<br>
  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): MacKillop James<br>
  Abstract: Seamus Heaney’s unexpected death in August 2013 brought to completion his body of work, and scholars are only now coming to understand the full scale and importance of this extraordinary career. The Nobel Prize–winning poet, translator, and playwright from the North of Ireland is considered the most important Irish poet after Yeats and, at the time of his death, arguably the most famous living poet. For this reason, much of the scholarship to date on Heaney has understandably focused on his poetry. O’Brien’s new work, however, focuses on Heaney’s essays, book chapters, and lectures as it seeks to understand how Heaney explored the poet’s role in the world. By examining Heaney’s prose, O’Brien teases out a clearer understanding of Heaney’s sense of the function of poetry as an act of public intellectual and ethical inquiry. In doing so, O’Brien reads Heaney as an aesthetic thinker in the European tradition, considering him alongside Heidegger, Derrida, Lacan, and Adorno. Studying Heaney within this theoretical and philosophical tradition sheds new and useful light on one of the greatest creative minds of the twentieth century.<br>

  Abstract: In contemporary anthropology, much is made of the ways in which meaning is constructed by a culture’s members. The interpretive act by which sense is asserted, such as in the interpretation of art or dreams or language, is a moment m which such constructions of meaning become particularly clear. It seems therefore a particularly vital point at which to observe a culture’s workings. The meeting of individuals and events that interpretation implies is a reapplication of principles, occasionally a revision, rarely, in Java at least, a radical reconsideration of them.

  Abstract: In a sense, the history of living organisms may be summed up by their remarkable ability to find solutions that avoid the world's complexity by imposing on it their own rules and functions. Evolution has resolved the problem of complexity not by simplifying but by finding solutions whose processes-though they can sometimes be complex-allow us to act in the midst of complexity and of uncertainty. Nature can inspire us by making us realize that simplification is never simple and requires instead that we choose, refuse, connect, and imagine, in order to act in the best possible manner. Such solutions are already being applied in design and engineering and are significant in biology, medicine, economics, and the behavioral sciences.<br>

  Abstract: Walking has played a fundamental role in all animal species throughout evolution. When aquatic life gave way to terrestrial life, a whole set of problems had to be resolved, beginning with integrating the four elements of walking: posture, locomotor rhythm, gaze, and gesture. To the reader who might think that we are about to launch into a question of restricted and basic motor physiology, that is, far removed from cognitive function, I would say that posture is none other than “preparation to act,”¹ and locomotion is not only about making successive steps but also navigating in space. Indeed, some clinicians<br>

  Abstract: Since its emergence in the field of art history in the 1980s, visuality – a notion that refers to the visible condition of art, to the fact that art is, partially at least, a matter of vision (in its production, exhibition, circulation, and reception) – has been key to the decentring of both the artist and the viewing subject in its relation to the image. Vision came to be systematically understood as an act conditioned by culture, social class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, and geography.

  Book Title: Textual Silence-Unreadability and the Holocaust<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): LANG JESSICA<br>
  Abstract: There are thousands of books that represent the Holocaust, but can, and should, the act of reading these works convey the events of genocide to those who did not experience it? In
      Textual Silence, literary scholar Jessica Lang asserts that language itself is a barrier between the author and the reader in Holocaust texts-and that this barrier is not a lack of substance, but a defining characteristic of the genre.Holocaust texts, which encompass works as diverse as memoirs, novels, poems, and diaries, are traditionally characterized by silences the authors place throughout the text, both deliberately and unconsciously. While a reader may have the desire and will to comprehend the Holocaust, the presence of "textual silence" is a force that removes the experience of genocide from the reader's analysis and imaginative recourse. Lang defines silences as omissions that take many forms, including the use of italics and quotation marks, ellipses and blank pages in poetry, and the presence of unreliable narrators in fiction. While this limits the reader's ability to read in any conventional sense, these silences are not flaws. They are instead a critical presence that forces readers to acknowledge how words and meaning can diverge in the face of events as unimaginable as those of the Holocaust.<br>

  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): PICKETT HOWARD<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on the writings of Immanuel Kant, Søren Kierkegaard, and Emmanuel Levinas, Howard Pickett presents a vivid defense of "virtuous hypocrisy." Our fetish for transparency tends to allow us to forget that the self may not be worthy of expression, and may become unethically narcissistic in the act of expression. Alert to this ambivalence, these great thinkers advocate incongruent ways of being.
      Rethinking Sincerity and Authenticityoffers an engaging new appraisal not only of the ethics of theatricality but of the theatricality of ethics, contending that pursuit of one's ideal self entails a relational and ironic performance of identity that lies beyond the pure notion of expressive individualism.<br>

  Abstract: This book singles out translation as a way of talking about literary history and theory, philosophy, and interpretation. Vladimir Nabokov is its case study. The advantage of making Nabokov a case study for an investigation of questions of translation is obvious. It is hard to separate Vladimir Nabokov from the act of translation, in all senses of the word—ranging from “moving across” geographical borders and cultural and linguistic boundaries to the transposing of the split between “here” and “there” and “then” and “now” (the essential elements of exile, components of every émigré experience) onto a metaphysical plane sometimes suggested<br>

  Book Title: Trauma in First Person-Diary Writing during the Holocaust<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): GREENBERG AVNER<br>
  Abstract: What are the effects of radical oppression on the human psyche? What happens to the inner self of the powerless and traumatized victim, especially during times of widespread horror? In this bold and deeply penetrating book, Amos Goldberg addresses diary writing by Jews under Nazi persecution. Throughout Europe, in towns, villages, ghettos, forests, hideouts, concentration and labor camps, and even in extermination camps, Jews of all ages and of all cultural backgrounds described in writing what befell them. Goldberg claims that diary and memoir writing was perhaps the most important literary genre for Jews during World War II. Goldberg considers the act of writing in radical situations as he looks at diaries from little-known victims as well as from brilliant diarists such as Chaim Kaplan and Victor Klemperer. Goldberg contends that only against the background of powerlessness and inner destruction can Jewish responses and resistance during the Holocaust gain their proper meaning.<br>

  Book Title: In Praise of Heteronomy-Making Room for Revelation<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
  Abstract: Recognizing the essential heteronomy of postmodern philosophy of religion, Merold Westphal argues against the assumption that human reason is universal, neutral, and devoid of presupposition. Instead, Westphal contends that any philosophy is a matter of faith and the philosophical encounter with theology arises from the very act of thinking. Relying on the work of Spinoza, Kant, and Hegel, Westphal discovers that their theologies render them mutually incompatible and their claims to be the voice of autonomous and universal reason look dubious. Westphal grapples with this plural nature of human thought in the philosophy of religion and he forwards the idea that any appeal to the divine must rest on a historical and phenomenological analysis.<br>

Literature on theNakbarepresents a salient effort to serve the Palestinian people’s struggle for their natural rights. While this focus on the injustices perpetrated against the Palestinians and the need for restitution is tempting, it leaves little room for critical reflection on the experience itself.

  Abstract: It is often interesting to free-associate about the titles chosen for conferences. My free association about the title of this conference – “Architecture, Ethics and Technology: An Interdisciplinary Symposium” – led me to wonder whether ethics was perhaps the ham in the sandwich, squeezed perfectly flat by architecture, on the one side, and technology, on the other. This image, in turn, brought to mind what has been called a “thin” or minimalist concept of ethics. According to this concept, persons act ethically as long as they do not breach the law, and the law should enshrine only those requirements on<br>

But before giving a detailed account of Wojtyła’s mature theory of human efficacy, it is necessary to present the main principles of his theory of consciousness.<br>

  Book Title: Blood in the Sand-Imperial Fantasies, Right-Wing Ambitions, and the Erosion of American Democracy<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Bronner Stephen Eric<br>
  Abstract: Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, clouds of ash blackened the skies over New York City, Washington, D.C., and rural Pennsylvania. In the wake of the destruction, the United States seemingly entered a new era marked by radical changes in the nation's discourse and in the policies of the Bush administration. With the toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the invasion of Iraq, and saber rattling elsewhere, America's global war on terror began to take shape. Lofty rhetoric about expanding democracy and defending freedom filled the halls of elite power and dominated mainstream media coverage of American politics. Blood in the Sand offers both an incisive analysis and a confrontational critique of America's recent international pursuits and its dominant political culture. Stephen Eric Bronner challenges the notion that everything changed in the aftermath of 9/11. He shows instead how a criminal act served to legitimize political manipulation and invigorate traditional nationalistic enthusiasms for militarism and imperial expansion. Employing his own experiences in the Middle East, Bronner acknowledges -- but refuses to overstate -- recent progressive developments in the region. He criticizes the neo-conservative penchant for unilateral military aggression and debunks the dubious notion of fostering democracy at gunpoint. While Bronner analyzes authoritarian repression, human rights violations, shrinking civil liberties, and severe socioeconomic inequalities, Blood in the Sand is neither a narrow political diatribe nor a futile exercise in anti-American negativism. The author honors America by condemning the betrayal of the nation's finest ideals by so many of those who, hypocritically or naively, invoke those ideals the most. Bronner sheds new light on those who insist on publicly waving the flag while privately subverting that for which it stands. Blood in the Sand sounds a clarion call for revitalizing the American polity and reshaping foreign policy along ~<br>

  Book Title: Christianity in Evolution-An Exploration<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): MAHONEY JACK<br>
  Abstract: Evolution has provided a new understanding of reality, with revolutionary consequences for Christianity. In an evolutionary perspective the incarnation involved God entering the evolving human species to help it imitate the trinitarian altruism in whose image it was created and counter its tendency to self-absorption. Primarily, however, the evolutionary achievement of Jesus was to confront and overcome death in an act of cosmic significance, ushering humanity into the culminating stage of its evolutionary destiny, the full sharing of God's inner life. Previously such doctrines as original sin, the fall, sacrifice, and atonement stemmed from viewing death as the penalty for sin and are shown not only to have serious difficulties in themselves, but also to emerge from a Jewish culture preoccupied with sin and sacrifice that could not otherwise account for death. The death of Jesus on the cross is now seen as saving humanity, not from sin, but from individual extinction and meaninglessness. Death is now seen as a normal process that affect all living things and the religious doctrines connected with explaining it in humans are no longer required or justified. Similar evolutionary implications are explored affecting other subjects of Christian belief, including the Church, the Eucharist, priesthood, and moral behavior.<br>

  Book Title: The Sexual Person-Toward a Renewed Catholic Anthropology<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lawler Michael G.<br>
  Abstract: Two principles capture the essence of the official Catholic position on the morality of sexuality: first, that any human genital act must occur within the framework of heterosexual marriage; second, each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life. In this comprehensive overview of Catholicism and sexuality, theologians Todd A. Salzman and Michael G. Lawler examine and challenge these principles. Remaining firmly within the Catholic tradition, they contend that the church is being inconsistent in its teaching by adopting a dynamic, historically conscious anthropology and worldview on social ethics and the interpretation of scripture while adopting a static, classicist anthropology and worldview on sexual ethics. While some documents from Vatican II, like
      Gaudium et spes("the marital act promotes self-giving by which spouses enrich each other"), gave hope for a renewed understanding of sexuality, the church has not carried out the full implications of this approach. In short, say Salzman and Lawler: emphasize relationships, not acts, and recognize Christianity's historically and culturally conditioned understanding of human sexuality.The Sexual Persondraws historically, methodologically, and anthropologically from the best of Catholic tradition and provides a context for current theological debates between traditionalists and revisionists regarding marriage, cohabitation, homosexuality, reproductive technologies, and what it means to be human. This daring and potentially revolutionary book will be sure to provoke constructive dialogue among theologians, and between theologians and the Magisterium.<br>

  Abstract: Throughout this book we have argued that Catholic sexual morality is institutionalized within the confines of marriage and procreation, and we have examined the foundations of two principles that articulate the essence of that Catholic morality. The first principle states that “any human genital act whatsoever may be placed only within the confines of marriage”;¹ the second states that “each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life.”² In contemporary Catholic moral theology, two approaches to understanding these principles demarcate two schools of Catholic moral theology.

  Book Title: Overcoming Our Evil-Human Nature and Spiritual Exercises in Xunzi and Augustine<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stalnaker Aaron<br>
  Abstract: Can people ever really change? Do they ever become more ethical, and if so, how?
      Overcoming Our Evilfocuses on the way ethical and religious commitments are conceived and nurtured through the methodical practices that Pierre Hadot has called "spiritual exercises." These practices engage thought, imagination, and sensibility, and have a significant ethical component, yet aim for a broader transformation of the whole personality. Going beyond recent philosophical and historical work that has focused on ancient Greco-Roman philosophy, Stalnaker broadens ethical inquiry into spiritual exercises by examining East Asian as well as classical Christian sources, and taking religious and seemingly "aesthetic" practices such as prayer, ritual, and music more seriously as objects of study. More specifically,Overcoming Our Evilexamines and compares the thought and practice of the early Christian Augustine of Hippo, and the early Confucian Xunzi. Both have sophisticated and insightful accounts of spiritual exercises, and both make such ethical work central to their religious thought and practice. Yet to understand the two thinkers' recommendations for cultivating virtue we must first understand some important differences. Here Stalnaker disentangles the competing aspects of Augustine and Xunxi's ideas of "human nature." His groundbreaking comparison of their ethical vocabularies also drives a substantive analysis of fundamental issues in moral psychology, especially regarding emotion and the complex idea of "the will," to examine how our dispositions to feel, think, and act might be slowly transformed over time. The comparison meticulously constructs vivid portraits of both thinkers demonstrating where they connect and where they diverge, making the case that both have been misunderstood and misinterpreted. In throwing light on these seemingly disparate ancient figures in unexpected ways, Stalnaker redirects recent debate regarding practices of personal formation, and more ~<br>

  Author(s) HAUERWAS STANLEY<br>
  Abstract: The close connection between rhetoric and religion has profound consequences for the possibility of unity within social and religious communities. Earlier Marjorie O’Rourke Boyle noted that the Renaissance humanists appreciated the “unitive power” of religion and rhetoric, “the bond of society, the integration of self, and communion with God,” drawing on the classical orators for whom speech was a socializing and civilizing act. In a similar way, Kathy Eden’s thoughtful study links adages, commonly held formulations of belief that unify both discursive practice and social relationships, to secular and Christian conceptions and practices of friendship, love, and community.

  Book Title: Dreams of Fiery Stars-The Transformations of Native American Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Rainwater Catherine<br>
  Abstract: Selected by
      Choicemagazine as an Outstanding Academic Book for 1999 Since the 1968 publication of N. Scott Momaday'sHouse Made of Dawn, a new generation of Native American storytellers has chosen writing over oral traditions. While their works have found an audience by observing many of the conventions of the mainstream novel, Native American written narrative has emerged as something distinct from the postmodern novel with which it is often compared. InDreams of Fiery Stars, Catherine Rainwater examines the novels of writers such as Momaday, Linda Hogan, Leslie Marmon Silko, Gerald Vizenor, and Louise Erdrich and contends that the very act of writing narrative imposes constraints upon these authors that are foreign to Native American tradition. Their works amount to a break with-and a transformation of-American Indian storytelling. The book focuses on the agenda of social and cultural regeneration encoded in contemporary Native American narrative, and addresses key questions about how these works achieve their overtly stated political and revisionary aims. Rainwater explores the ways in which the writers "create" readers who understand the connection between storytelling and personal and social transformation; considers how contemporary Native American narrative rewrites Western notions of space and time; examines the existence of intertextual connections between Native American works; and looks at the vital role of Native American literature in mainstream society today.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter focuses on literature and the reading act as a nodal point, a relay station, in the dissemination (in space) and transmission (across generations) of cultural memory. In doing so, it draws attention to three interrelated problem areas: 1) the currency of literature is principally shaped by the language of its expression, whereas the currency of memories is principally shaped in societal or political frameworks; 2) the social and political frameworks (i.e. states and institutions) in which cultural memories are current can be less durable and more fluid than the canonicity of certain literary texts; 3) the literary evocation<br>

  Author(s) Musser Charles<br>
  Abstract: Writing in 1922, flushed with the excitement of seeing Abel Gance’s La Roue, Fernand Léger tried to define something of the radical possibilities of the cinema. The potential of the new art did not lie in “imitating the movements of nature” or in “the mistaken path” of its resemblance to theater. Its unique power was a “matter of
                     making images seen.”¹ It is precisely this harnessing of visibility, this act of showing and exhibition, which I feel cinema before 1906 displays most intensely. [Its] inspiration for the avant-garde of the early decades of this century needs to be re-explored.<br>

  Abstract: The popular defense of processing children under eighteen in the adult criminal justice system instead of the juvenile justice system turns on the nature of the offense: children who commit adult crimes should do adult time. This position highlights the ways in which American cultural constructions of the child are not exclusively child based. That is to say, adult constructions of the child often do not correspond to what children themselves say and do. Paradoxically, children can lose their child status when they do not act

  Abstract: The idea of moral evil has always held a special place in philosophical and theological systems of thought because the existence of evil has implications for the dignity with which and the limits within which we act. Moral culpability is made possible by our ability to choose to do terrible things or to refrain from doing good things. Philosophically, the categories of moral praiseworthiness and blameworthiness depend on the prospect of our being able to act or not act one way when we have the capacity to act otherwise.

On the one hand, it indicates difference as distinction, inequality, or discernibility; on the other, it expresses the interposition of delay, the interval of aspacingandtemporalizingthat puts off until “later” what is presently denied, the possible that is presently impossible. Sometimes thedifferentand sometimes thedeferredcorrespond [in French] to the verb “to differ.” This correlation, however, is not simply one between act and object, cause and effect, or primordial and derived.<br>

  Abstract: Given his desire to know the street map with his feet, it is unsurprising that the act of walking should play such a prominent role in Carson’s writing. Indeed, his is a distinctively peripatetic aesthetic. Time and again walking serves not only as a means of registering urban experience, the medium through which all manner of encounters, associations, and sidelong observations are made; it also functions as a figure for the meandering, digressive nature of Carson’s narratives, in which ‘one thing leads to another’ (

  Abstract: Any artistic production inevitably involves an act of translation, a transference of a form, commodity, or idea across a boundary, be that boundary one of time, space, language, or cultural medium. Shakespeare and his works are among the most durable and flexible of translated media, and seem unlikely to be easily exhausted. Particularly interesting are the ways in which ‘Shakespeare’ operates both as an enabling medium and as an object who is himself translated. Within the economy of translation, the facilitating medium is a common point of reference, a shared experience which first makes conceivable the possibility and desirability of<br>

But I attempt this act of location by attention to the tone of voice and shifts of register within the poetry, and to its differing rhetorical appeals.

  Abstract: G. F. Handel’s oratorios were a development of the later years of his career, being written during the period 1732–1752. Most of the oratorios were “sacred dramas,” that is, operatic versions of Old Testament narratives, and they often had political as well as theological resonances. The oratorios were a chance development, having their origin in a piece written initially by Handel in 1718 or thereabouts for private performance at Cannons, the country seat of James Brydges (later duke of Chandos). The piece in question was

Theories of writing about history become more problematic in light of the ephemeral nature of what theater historian Joseph Roach calls the “transcendental signified”; the act of performance.¹ Because dance history is both enacted and<br>

A relevant secondary meaning is the action of making (something) similar (to something else) by integration or absorption. This meaning has existed in physiology since 1495. Around 1840, the concept was related to social processes for the first time, as the act of assimilating persons and peoples; the process through which these persons, these peoples, assimilate (themselves).

  Abstract: The act of interpretation occurs in nearly every area of the arts and sciences. That ubiquity serves as the inspiration for the fourteen essays of this volume, covering many of the domains in which interpretive practices are found. Individual topics include: the general nature of interpretation and its forms; comparing and contrasting interpretation and hermeneutics; culture as interpretation seen through Hegel's aesthetics; interpreting philosophical texts; methodologies for interpreting human action; interpretation in medical practice focusing on manifestations as indicators of disease; the brain and its interpretative, structured, learning and storage processes; interpreting hybrid wines and cognitive preconceptions of novel objects; and the importance of sensory perception as means of interpreting in the case of dry German Rieslings.In an interesting turn, Nicholas Rescher writes on the interpretation of philosophical texts.

  Abstract: A further question about self-accounts that is worth raising concerns the importance of narrative discourse for self-accounts. This question takes two forms. The first and more particular form is whether or not giving a self-account requires narrative. Does the act of telling you who I am and narrative discourse have a natural or necessary interdependence? The second form of the question, which arises from the first, is the cultural standing of narrated self-accounts. Are they, for example, specific to our own culture, or can they be thought of as constituting a more general human phenomenon?<br>

To read sociological commentators in the early 1930s, addressing southern agriculture, is to hear black tenants described as “virtual slaves,” held “in thrall,” subjected to “almost complete dependence” and “incapable of ever achieving but a modicum of self direction.”¹ Although the Civil War had freed the slave, it had done so only for southern landowners to bind him again in an alternative form of “dependency”: for chattel slavery read debt<br>

  Abstract: Circles Disturbedbrings together important thinkers in mathematics, history, and philosophy to explore the relationship between mathematics and narrative. The book's title recalls the last words of the great Greek mathematician Archimedes before he was slain by a Roman soldier--"Don't disturb my circles"--words that seem to refer to two radically different concerns: that of the practical person living in the concrete world of reality, and that of the theoretician lost in a world of abstraction. Stories and theorems are, in a sense, the natural languages of these two worlds--stories representing the way we act and interact, and theorems giving us pure thought, distilled from the hustle and bustle of reality. Yet, though the voices of stories and theorems seem totally different, they share profound connections and similarities.<br>

  Abstract: How is it to act rationally as a mathematician? For much of the Anglo-American philosophy of mathematics this question is answered in terms of what mathematicians most obviously produce—journal papers. From this perspective, the mathematician’s work is taken to be of interest solely insofar as in consists in deducing the consequences of various axioms and definitions. This view of the discipline, with its strong focus on aspects of mathematics that do not feature largely elsewhere—its use of deductive proof, its supposed capacity to be captured by some formal calculus, the abstractness of the objects it studies—isolates the<br>

We are free to use the scale of bad, good, better, best—but this language seems more suited to judgments of exclusively personal interest, where benefits and disadvantages are simpler to weigh. For public matters a scale based on “just” suits better than one based on “good,” for justice connotes the distribution of good(s) across the commonwealth.

  Abstract: Investigating autobiographical writing of Mary McCarthy, Henry James, Jean-Paul Sartre, Saul Friedlander, and Maxine Hong Kingston, this book argues that autobiographical truth is not a fixed but an evolving content in a process of self-creation. Further, Paul John Eakin contends, the self at the center of all autobiography is necessarily fictive. Professor Eakin shows that the autobiographical impulse is simply a special form of reflexive consciousness: from a developmental viewpoint, the autobiographical act is a mode of self-invention always practiced first in living and only eventually, and occasionally, in writing.<br>

As a result, she developed a poetic voice that was immediate, down-to-earth, and always caught in the act of offering up a good story. Her distinctive gesture is the direct address of the talking lyric, calling a community of readers into narrative filiation and response-ability.

  Abstract: SACRIFICE IS THE OLDEST FORM of religious action.¹ If a person wished to draw near to the gods, as the priest Chryses did with Apollo or as Hektor and Odysseus did with Zeus, he could do so only after he had “burnt many thigh-pieces of bulls” (
                  Il. T.40, 22.170;Od. I.66). Ancient piety rested on a foundation of killing, death, and eating. The victim’s end coincided with a ritual scream at a point, between the knife and the altar, where the community and the Awesome were gathered.² By going through this “irreversible act,” life was affirmed through direct confrontation with<br>

  Abstract: Gianni Vattimo wants philosophy to continue. This obvious statement appears at first sight to be vacuous, almost nonsensical, when employed to begin writing about a philosopher. After all, does not every philosopher by the act of philosophizing engage de facto in the continuation of philosophy? The apparent emptiness of this statement quickly disappears, though, when, as in the case of Vattimo’s philosophical project, there is an announcement of the end of philosophy such that there is indeed a question not actually of whether philosophy is to continue but of the way in which it is able to continue.

  Abstract: Phenomenological philosophy, in Merleau-Ponty's conception, consists as we have seen in “re-learning to look at the world”, attempting to get behind the theoretical constructions that we erect on the basis of our immediate experience of the world in order to describe that experience itself. In so doing, he says, we do not simply reflect a pre-existing truth: philosophy is, “like art, the act of bringing truth into being”.¹ The analogy between phenomenology and art, especially the visual arts, runs through Merleau-Ponty's writings, sometimes as asides to a general philosophical discussion, and sometimes in the form of extended essays on particular<br>

  Abstract: It is a matter of common understanding nowadays that with all respect to the grandiose achievements of modern science and cosmology in particular, scientific discourse in general, being efficient in interpreting the most nonhuman aspects of reality, feels helpless in advancing the understanding of the mystery of human persons who are those agencies that make the universe palpable and act as its voice. This hidden predicament lies in the fact that cosmology is being constructed from within the

This book argues that it is again appropriate to bring "the human" to the fore, to reclaim the singularity of the word as central to the anthropological endeavor, not on the basis of thesubstanceof a human nature - "To be human is to act like this and react like this, to feel this and want this" - but in terms of species-widecapacities: capabilities for action and imagination, liabilities for suffering and cruelty. The contributors approach "the human" with an awareness of these complexities and particularities, rendering this volume unique in its ability to build on anthropology's ethnographic expertise.<br>

This lively account transcends ethnographic particularity and offers a wide-reaching perspective on the nature of being human. Inverting the analytic logic of her previous work, which sought to uncover what social structures concealed, Josephides focuses instead on the cultural understandings that people make explicit in their actions and speech. Using approaches from philosophy and anthropology, she examines elicitation (how people create their selves and their worlds in the act of making explicit) and mimesis (how anthropologists produce ethnographies), to arrive at an unexpected conclusion: that knowledge of self and other alike derives from self-externalization rather than self-introspection.<br>

Whereas, generally, it has recognized its power to review the conformity of a legislative act approving a treaty with the Constitution, it also deploys these treaties, and more broadly European law as enshrined in treaties and other instruments, to decide upon the constitutionality of other laws. Especially in reviews that rely upon the constitutional principle of non-discrimination, European law can play an important role, providing content to that principle.<br>

She had to review books across a variety of fields to cull any references to women’s contributions in previous societies.

  Author(s) Rabinow Paul<br>
  Abstract: What is the relationship between Foucault’s concept of biopower and Deleuze’s concept of control? Despite the similarities between these two concepts, there is not a single scholarly article that solely thematizes this question, nor a comparative survey of the answers given so far. This essay aims to fill this lacuna. Despite the lack of a full-length interrogation of this question, scholars have taken up several different positions on the relationship between these two concepts. While some distinguish the two concepts based on the content of what they act on (biopower on life vs control on economics), others distinguish them based<br>

  Author(s) Bowie Andrew<br>
  Abstract: They want to put metaphysics in motion, in action. They want to make it act and make it carry out immediate acts. It is not enough, therefore, for them to propose a new representation of movement; representation is already mediation. Rather, it is a question of producing within the work a movement capable of affecting the mind outside of all representation; it is a question of making movement itself a work … (Deleuze [1968] 1994: 8)<br>

  Abstract: Thomas A. Clark’s
                  The Path to the Seacontains several poems, or sequences of poems, most of which were published separately as pamphlets. Clark’s poems reflect on and are also made by perceptions of an environment, one that is given scale and significance by the quotidian yet metaphysically rich act of walking. This interest in walking, in measuring the environment by human and poetic modes of perception, places Clark close to other poets who figure in this book, such as Wordsworth and Creeley. These are long-standing concerns for Clark: earlier sequences such as ‘Through White Villages’ and ‘From Sea to<br>

  Author(s) Critchley Simon<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter, I follow the path of a dislocation. When Levinas reads Derrida, he renounces the ‘ridiculous ambition of “improving”’ (
                     NP89) a true philosopher. Levinas is content to cross Derrida’s path in order to engage him in a philosophical encounter. I shall report this encounter by following the reading that Levinas gives of Derrida, a reading which, while continually transgressing the order of commentary, remains faithful, I believe, to the ultimate ethical orientation of the thinking under discussion. At stake here is the perverse fidelity of a dislocation in the act of reading.<br>

  Abstract: Within much contemporary analytic philosophy of mind desires are conceived of primarily as the inner states which provide us, together with beliefs, with reasons for forming intentions and consequently acting. When linked with beliefs, such desires then cause us to act in appropriate ways. Desires therefore have a role both in providing premises for practical reasoning and a causal, functional role in terms of the agent’s behaviour. Weaving these two roles together has been one of the challenges of contemporary materialism. Within standard accounts of practical reasoning the agent derives an intention or proceeds to action on the basis of<br>

  Abstract: Gadamer’s reconstruction of aesthetic experience as a participatory act offers a new valence to the part–whole relationship within hermeneutics. The emphasis given to experiential movement and transformational understanding implies participation in a part–whole nexus. In traditional literary hermeneutics, the part–whole relationship is deployed by the knowing subject as a contextualising procedure of understanding: a section of a text is explained by being set into an exposition of the whole. For Gadamer, however, the part–whole structure is not a fixed epistemological device utilised by the interpreter to set a work into a given context but an ontological<br>

Even the most adamant realist in, say, engineering presupposes a cultural conception of how scientific cognition proceeds.

  Book Title: The Habermas Handbook-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): LAFONT CRISTINA<br>
  Abstract: Jürgen Habermas is one of the most influential philosophers of our time. His diagnoses of contemporary society and concepts such as the public sphere, communicative rationality, and cosmopolitanism have influenced virtually all academic disciplines, spurred political debates, and shaped intellectual life in Germany and beyond for more than fifty years. In
      The
            Habermas Handbook, leading Habermas scholars elucidate his thought, providing essential insight into his key concepts, the breadth of his work, and his influence across politics, law, the social sciences, and public life.This volume offers a comprehensive overview and an in-depth analysis of Habermas's work in its entirety. After examining his intellectual biography, it goes on to illuminate the social and intellectual context of Habermasian thought, such as the Frankfurt School, speech-act theory, and contending theories of democracy. TheHandbookprovides an extensive account of Habermas's texts, ranging from his dissertation on Schelling to his most recent writing about Europe. It illustrates the development of his thought and its frequently controversial reception while elaborating the central ideas of his work. The book also provides a glossary of key terms and concepts, making the complexity of Habermas's thought accessible to a broad readership.<br>

  Abstract: Cosmopolitanism is an attempt to realize the imperative of universalism—to grasp the human world as one and ourselves as, to at least some extent, connected to, and therefore at least to some degree responsible for, all of it.¹ Cosmopolitics, as I will use the term, is the attempt to act politically in the world on the basis of this understanding. Our present interest in cosmopolitanism derives from the renaissance it enjoyed in the 1990s, when, in a way only partially anticipated in the high Enlightenment or after the Second World War, it struck many observers as imperative to “re-imagine<br>

  Abstract: Evoking the hot, dust-filled Harmattan winds that blow from the Sahara to the Gulf of Guinea, this book creatively explores what it means to be buffeted by the unforeseen and the unknown. Celebrating the life-giving potential of people, places, and powers that lie beyond our established worlds,
      Harmattanconnects existential vitality to the act of resisting prescribed customs and questioning received notions of truth. At the book's heart is the fictional story of Tom Lannon, a graduate student from Cambridge University, who remains ambivalent about pursuing a conventional life. After traveling to Sierra Leone in the aftermath of its devastating civil war, Tom meets a writer who helps him explore the possibilities of renewal. Illustrating the fact that certain aspects of human existence are common to all people regardless of culture and history,Harmattanremakes the distinction between home and world and the relationship between knowledge and life.<br>

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Allen Amy<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on Immanuel Kant's and Hannah Arendt's ideas about reflective judgment, Lara argues that narrative plays a key role in helping societies acknowledge their pasts. Particular stories haunt our consciousness and lead to a kind of examination and dialogue that shape notions of morality. A powerful description of a crime can act as a filter, helping us to draw conclusions about what constitutes a moral wrong, and public debates over these narratives allow us to construct a more accurate picture of historical truth, leading to a better understanding of why such actions are possible.<br>

  Book Title: The Deed of Reading-Literature * Writing * Language * Philosophy<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): STEWART GARRETT<br>
  Abstract: To take the measure of literary writing,
         The Deed of Readingconvenes diverse philosophic commentary on the linguistics of literature, with stress on the complementary work of Stanley Cavell and Giorgio Agamben. Sympathetic to recent ventures in form-attentive analysis but resisting an emphasis on so-called surface reading, Stewart explores not some new formalism but the internal pressures of language in formation, registering the verbal infrastructure of literary prose as well as verse. In this mode of "contextual" reading, the context is language itself. Literary phrasing, tapping the speech act's own generative pulse, emerges as a latent philosophy of language in its own right, whereby human subjects, finding no secure place to situate themselves within language, settle for its taking place in, through, and between them.<br>

To decipher these contingent features, imbricated as they are in a medieval or humanist culture long since past, great erudition is usually demanded. Yet to grasp next the meaning of the work’s symbolic values, interpretation becomes mostly an intuitive act. This is because iconology tends to regard the individual<br>

  Author(s): Terry Fiona<br>
  Abstract: Humanitarian groups have failed, Fiona Terry believes, to face up to the core paradox of their activity: humanitarian action aims to alleviate suffering, but by inadvertently sustaining conflict it potentially prolongs suffering. In
         Condemned to Repeat?, Terry examines the side-effects of intervention by aid organizations and points out the need to acknowledge the political consequences of the choice to give aid. The author makes the controversial claim that aid agencies act as though the initial decision to supply aid satisfies any need for ethical discussion and are often blind to the moral quandaries of aid. Terry focuses on four historically relevant cases: Rwandan camps in Zaire, Afghan camps in Pakistan, Salvadoran and Nicaraguan camps in Honduras, and Cambodian camps in Thailand.<br>

  Abstract: Unlike any other medium, literature has the ability to employ the reader’s imagination in the construction of bodies. When a narrator communicates information about a text’s characters, the reader completes the act of constructing bodies by imagining their contours, postures, and gestures. A character’s gender is thus dependent upon both the narrator’s speech—his/her use of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives—and the reader’s expectations regarding gender. If the narrator omits information about the character’s gender, the reader finds clues in the text—social cues, behaviors, and actions—to fill in that information and assign one. Such moments activate literature’s potential<br>

For the clergy of the alternative Synod, the canonization was a move that, for the first time, propelled their activities out of the heretofore exclusively political field, and into the cultural field. Was this a deliberately calculated and carefully staged act intended to exploit a powerful<br>

Abstract: Patten presents a detailed explication and defense of Hegel’s conception of freedom as rational self‐determination. On such a view, inherited from Kant, being free involves more than the absence of coercion or being able to do as one pleases. Freedom requires actors to self‐legislate their behavior such that the good reasons motivating them override their contingent desires and inclinations. Given standard objections to Kant’s idea of autonomy, and Hegel’s own statements of those objections, Patten carefully analyzes Hegel to demonstrate both that he does in fact hold a related view, and that his view does not fall prey to the same problems as Kant’s. Central to Patten’s interpretation of Hegel is the idea that free agents will be ones who act in ways harmonious with those features of modern life and the modern state that establish the conditions Hegel thinks are necessary for the realization and sustenance of individual freedom.<br>

Abstract: The organization of lectures in
      The Justfollows Ricoeur’s earlier book,Oneself as Another(trans. Kathleen Blamey [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992]) and reflects the dimensions of what he calls the moral constitution of action. He understands this constitution in terms of a horizontal and vertical axis. The horizontal axis embeds the individual in both face‐to‐face interactions with others and more distanced interactions mediated by institutions. The vertical axis involves different levels of analysis that indicate the place, for Ricoeur, of both teleological and deontological theories of justice as well as of references to practical reason. Moral action has a teleological dimension, he thinks, insofar as it is rooted in the human desire for personal fulfillment and friendship within just institutions. His lectures suggest that it is this dimension that grounds the bonds of political community. But moral action possesses a deontological dimension as well because the impartiality necessary to just institutions requires a procedural account of justice. Finally, moral action involves an element of practical reason in the moment at which the subject must judge and act in one way or another.<br>

Abstract: The fullest and most remarkable speculations on the subject are to be found in the work of the Genevan naturalist and philosopher Charles Bonnet.
         107Author of important investigations in natural history and of a philosophical system that combines Lockian sensationism with Leibnizian metaphysics, Bonnet gave the problem of resurrection a central place in his thinking and life (fig. 3).108His argument can be summarized in the following way: Humans are composed of body and soul; they can therefore survive only as mixed beings.109Personal identity depends on memory (Locke’s theory), and memory is based in the brain. It follows that, if man is to keep his identity in the afterlife, his soul must remain united to some indestructible organ, perhaps the same that functions as the seat of the soul.110Bonnet describes it as a “little ethereal machine” and as an “indestructible brain” encased in the brains of our terrestrial bodies. In addition to being the seat of the soul, the little machine is the germ of resurrected bodies.111It will therefore act in truly embryological fashion, producing bodies in accordance with the preformationistemboîtementtheory of generation.

Abstract: One could investigate culture in interaction in other kinds of civic groups, as well. For example, the very act of participating in a nongovernmental organization—the Red Cross, for example—might carry different meanings in different times and places that one could not guess by knowing the organization’s stated mission and institutional form. The concept of culture in interaction would give researchers a way to grasp those differences. Similarly, a history of the category of “the volunteer” over time and in different places could focus on the culture in interaction—the ways styles of group membership filter collective representations of compassion or a good society.<br>

Abstract: By unfolding itself and making itself visible through the machine, Hawking’s flesh‐and‐blood body calls into question that which constitutes the primacy of the body itself, distinguishing it definitively from other objects. The body can’t be “a mere object of which he is conscious as he is of every other ‘thing’ in the world.” If so, he would have “embraced the position of the ‘pure subject’ who is a
         spectatorbefore the world and also before his own body which he considers as part of the world of objects.”55Because “in so far as it sees or touches the world, my body can therefore be neither seen nor touched. What prevents its ever being an object, ever being ‘completely constituted’ is that it is that by which there are objects. It is neither tangible nor visible in so far as it is that which sees and touches.”56Indeed, “I am not in front of my body, I am in it, or rather I am it.”57In other words, the perceiving body is always behind the perceived object, which is why my body “offers itself obstinately ‘from the same side’ without my being able to go around it.”58In a way we can say that Hawking’s flesh‐and‐blood body is registering in the same text as his speech; they both appear on the screen in front of him. Without this work of objectification of the body, Hawking cannot be his body. The body is felt but also represented as an exterior thing before it can do anything. With him the distinction between body‐object and body‐subject disappears. The human body conceived as a body‐object, that is, which “allows between its parts or between itself and other objects only external or mechanical relations” has become his own body or the body‐subject, that is, “‘his’ body as the center of ‘his’ existence, as the power both to act and to perceive and as a means for the subject to be part of the world.”59We thus see the movement of a certain form of absence‐presence that characterizes the body as Leder described it, but in another form. For Leder, the body is alway~<br>

Abstract: But are there not objections to be made? For example, following Heidegger, one could assimilate the biblical definition according to image and likeness to the Greek definition according to the possession of λόγος in order to understand both as imposing upon man the mode of Being “im Sinne des Vorhandensein” (“in the sense of subsistence [occurring and Being‐present‐at‐hand]”).
         40But what proof does Heidegger give of the equivalence between these two definitions? If necessary, the definition by λόγος could fall under reproach; but does the definition according to the image of God not exclude, precisely, anything having to do, in God and thus in man, with Being as subsistence (vorhanden)? Unless, that is, Heidegger includes neither definition in the division of finite being from infinite being.41But there too, does he not take up, as if it goes without saying, the metaphysical distinction par excellence of theensintofinitumandinfinitum, introduced by Duns Scotus through to Suarez, without seeing that this distinction doubtless contradicts the incomprehensibility of the image and likeness? Does he simply want, in the end, to deny theology the right to tackle the question of man’s status, just as he denies it that of responding to the question, “Why is there something rather than nothing?” by holding that “anyone for whom the Bible is divine revelation and truth already has the answer to the question … before it is asked: beings, with the exception of God Himself, are created by Him. God Himself ‘is’ as the uncreated Creator.” This remains, Heidegger believes, unacceptable, because “one who holds on to such faith as a basis can, perhaps, emulate and participate in the asking of our question in a certain way, but he cannot authentically question. … He can act only ‘as if’ [nun so tun `as ob'] … in the beginning God created heaven and earth, etc.’”42This argument presupposes in its turn that, by invoking creation, the believer confidently knows and thus comprehen~<br>

Abstract: The reassertion of a literary norm within the field of informational writing seemed to respond to a perceived decline in the communicative effectiveness of writing that paced the explosion of information and media. The tension between clarity, which posits a hypothetical general reader, and technicity, which assumes a specialized addressee, has never been resolved. The failure of modern writing to achieve clarity brings technicity into disrepute; but technicity is an inescapable requisite of modern writing and is not, in itself, incompatible with clarity or communication. An analysis of informational writing that fails to recognize the complex relation between clarity and technicity is unlikely to yield a composition pedagogy adequate to the demands upon writing in modernity. The reassertion of clarity by the literary professoriate, like the reassertion of brevity, forgets the inaugural act of information genres, forgets the forgetting of rhetoric.<br>

Ricoeur appeals to the concept of distantiation in order to recognize a critical element in the interpretive act, thereby mediating between Gadamer’s hermeneutics of tradition and Habermas’s critique of ideology. Here we put the distantiation concept to quite a different use, namely, to shed light on the problem of cross‐cultural religious understanding.<br>

We act on that question from the perspective of our position in history and culture, that is, from within the circle of interpretation, which can be construed as a world of action with temporality in the form of traditions, and ongoing practices in the form of fields of action [15].<br>

Abstract: I say “reconfigured strategically” to avoid the impression that my attempt to reconfigure the dialectic of comparative theology and theology of religions as a politically liberating praxis excludes the more elite discourses of the religious traditions involved (such as those of India’s Brahmins and China’s Confucian elites), which are in many cases both hegemonic (within a particular cultural framework) and marginalized (within a larger or global context). The solidary praxis of restoring and enabling subaltern religious representations is aimed at establishing participatory parity as a political reality in which both subaltern and elite representations could take part as decentered centers that are all other to one another and no longer as subaltern or elite in terms of sociopolitical and cultural hegemony. To bring into being such a politically level playing field, in which the more elite discourses find themselves also liberated and with a new voice, I think it is strategically necessary to emphasize first an act of solidarity with the oppressed. I thank the anonymous reviewer of my essay for raising the question of my thesis’s possible exclusion of elite religious discourses.<br>

Abstract: Agaffino Solaro,

In the third part of theSumma(q. 54, art. 3, 338), broaching the central problem of “The Quality of the Resurrecting Christ,” Thomas had contended that all the blood oozed out of Christ’s body, since it pertained to his human nature and had resurrected with his body. Therefore, Thomas adds, the blood coming out of the relics present in some churches does not derive from Christ’s open side, but rather from images of Christ thanks to some miraculous act (miraculose). Solaro disagrees both with Thomas, who had not seen the shroud, and with Francisco Suarez, who inCommentaria ac disputationes in tertiam partem D. Thomae(inOpera Omnia[Paris: Vivès, 1860], vol. 19, pt. 2, q. 54, art. 4, 826) had contended that the drops of blood present in relics are “accidents of color” and not substance of Christ’s blood.<br>

Abstract: The particularly distinctive element of Christian typology is its ascription of titles, actions, and qualities to Jesus.
         47This pattern of reading, while at work throughout the Gospels, is particularly intense in Christ’s resurrection. Frei reads Luke 24:13–35, where Jesus meets the disciples on the road to Emmaus, as central to Christian reading.48In Jesus’s interpretation of the scriptures with respect to himself—ascriptively—the narrative pattern of interpretation emerges from within the Gospel narrative itself. “He, the unsubstitutable Jesus, now makes the stylized titles his own. He claims them for himself in his very identity of Jesus of Nazareth.”49To recognize that Jesus’s self‐identification as the Son of God is actualized in the resurrection, emerging contingently within the story, makes the Christian naming of Jesus as the Son of God dependent upon engagement with the narrative sense. To engage in narrative interpretation, then, is tofollowJesus’s act of self‐ascription—or, really, to obey his obedience. One ascribes this name to Jesus, because God, through Jesus’s action, ascribes it to him in the resurrection. Ascription, then, is, first, Jesus’s own practice, second, the practice of the Gospel writers, and, third, the practice of reading constitutive of the Christian community.50Ascription thus constitutes a particular form of “double‐dialogue,” as the text brings together the divine act of reading by Jesus and the community’s act of reading in response.51<br>

Abstract: The more polemical, the more passionate the essay, the more likely it will generate critical responses and rejoinders—a trademark feature of the journal—accompanied by footnotes. And, so, when Richard Stern published his private dialogue with himself about the physical appearance of certain writers at the 1986 International PEN conference, Joyce Carol Oates insisted on not only an angry rebuttal—punctuated by constant page referencing to Stern’s “pig‐souled sexism”—but photographic evidence—a kind of footnote in itself—dismissing his physical characterization of her.
      4When Susan Gubar published “What Ails Feminist Criticism?” her essay provoked an immediate, critical, and heavily documented response from Robyn Weigman, several letters to the editor, and Gubar’s own footnoted rejoinder. Jane Gallop’s defense of a sexual act she engaged in with one of her students and Paul de Man’s controversial writings in a Belgian newspaper in the thirties (which, incidentally, resulted in a marked decline in the number of times he was cited in our pages) generated similar feelings of anger, disgust, and betrayal, all accompanied by footnotes.5This journal, in fact, argues that passion is not diminished when it is superscripted. It is a further mark of its complex nature that although submissions have been rejected for not being passionate enough, and they have been rejected because of a lack of necessary citation and documentation, not one essay in our memories has ever been rejected because it did contain footnotes.<br>

Abstract: In sum, the various Christian frameworks for understanding 9/11 that circulated in Mrs. Barrett’s classroom raised a host of troubling implications. The events of 9/11 were perpetrated by human hands, such that the deaths experienced were brutal, and the bodies of those lost, ugly. Those who were “saved,” however, suffered less and died more beautifully, by allowing God to “use” them toward his greater good. God allowed these events to occur in order to widen his presence in the public (secular) sphere and to encourage Americans to embrace Christianity. While God directs history and answers individuals’ prayers, then, God nonetheless enables atrocities like the Holocaust and the attacks on 9/11 to happen. And since all events in history, including 9/11, follow God’s logic and imply God’s approval, whether to act in this world to further the good is an open question rather than an obvious choice for most of the students in Mrs. Barrett’s classroom.<br>

Author(s): van der Ven Johannes A.<br>
Abstract: By way of summary: in this article I have argued that interreligious interaction, first of all, should be approached from an observer perspective and, hence, should be placed in an intercivilization context in which human rights can function as a directive for the application of the principles of human dignity, freedom, and equality—all principles that relate to respect and tolerance. This links up with the notion of pluralism in theology of religions. In this context interreligious dialogue can fulfil an important function if it meets three conditions: information exchange in the form of mutual witnessing; perspective exchange, with all the attendant problems; and perspective coordination. Close analysis of this kind of interreligious dialogue reveals two kinds of perspective exchange: that of self‐perspective and other perspective, and that of observer and participant perspective.

This is my attempt at explaining why young people, in test samples of empirical theological research done on different continents, assign pluralism priority over all other approaches, including interreligious dialogue.<br>

Abstract: The act of the destroyers was based on a somewhat passé theory of memory. It presumed that by erasing the artifact, recall is prevented because there is no direct image—except, of course, for the generation where the image has left a trace. But the recall, as new research demonstrates, need not be produced by a literal trace; recall itself, prompted by a context—a book, a discussion, a thought—can produce an image.
         106What is even more essential is the emotional component. In the absence of specific imagery, it is feelings that become essential in reliving the past. “So, while memory does not consist in a memory image, the existence of a complex interplay of image and affect in the processes of recall is important to the cluster of ideas brought together under memory.”107<br>

Abstract: On these grounds, theological ethics may make at least two important forms of critique of the recent social science emphasis on children’s agency. First, one can argue for a more complex view of children in and of themselves. As full human beings, children do not simply act on their world but rather interact in a passive‐active way with a world that itself shapes and influences their interpretations of their experiences. As well as conditions such as history, culture, power, and community, children also face the moral condition of having to learn to respond in an active‐passive way to others. Respecting children’s full humanity involves recognizing their fullest dimensions as both actively participating in and passively belonging to larger moral worlds. Indeed, few adults would, in the end, welcome being treated one‐dimensionally as agents alone. Overemphasizing children’s agency is just as simplistic and therefore dehumanizing as overemphasizing their need to be molded and socialized.<br>

Abstract: At the same time, however, the image of the Creator still beckons from within; the Creator’s voice can still be heard. The possibility for the imitation of Creation is not altogether lost but hidden and now indirect. This ambiguity can be illustrated by Adam and Eve’s joint invention of clothing, their very first postfall act. The loincloths, hastily stitched together, cover over human generative difference. But at the same time, they indicate humanity’s persisting if corrupted capability, in the imitation of God, for creating together with one another something altogether new. Clothing is (symbolically speaking) a creative solution to humanity’s shame at social difference. The moral tension that each of us actually experiences with others and in society is not only all too inevitably divisive and destructive but also, and ultimately, the grounds for the promise and hope of social relations that are radically new.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: The problem that Ricoeur relentlessly puts forth in his final chapter is that of the asymmetry of agents in the process of recognition. Like the making of a promise, one party is in debt, while the other is in demand. And contrary to appearances, neither the act of recognizing nor the act of promising end once the demand or the promise is fulfilled. Ricoeur insists on the moral motivations that bring together the recognizing and the recognized party. At the end of the book, these moral motivations are analyzed under the triple heading of states of peace, gift exchange, and mutual recognition. Here, recognition takes the form of “gratitude,” as exemplified by festive undertakings of recognition. The virtues of giving and of receiving are real, and they express, in the eyes of Ricoeur, the limits of an always asymmetrical recognition bounded by peace and gratitude.<br>

Issue: lq.2006.76.issue-3<br>

Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: One practical and normative standard according to which the profession can act publicly relates to political speech. If a work of any sort (book, video, or Web site) expresses a political opinion regarding anything of public concern, it can be included in a library’s collection. Furthermore, challenges to the presence of the work in the collection should be resisted on clear First Amendment grounds. This standard should be uncontroversial, but its application requires that we ourselves (i.e., every one of us who claims to be a professional) accept that it applies to all discourse. Whitney Davison‐Turley reports that her public expression of disagreement to some resolutions proposed at an ALA annual conference met with derision and insult [
         33, p. 33]. Her account, if accurate, points to some logically and ethically faulty reasoning used in response to her position. It is incumbent upon us as public professionals to adhere fully to any normative ethical position that has not been shown to be fallible; otherwise, any ethical argument we may make can be subject to refutation on the grounds of inconsistency and selective application. Another way to look at the proposed standard is that it is a positive right—the right of people to engage in free public political speech.<br>

Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: In addition to acknowledging with Plato and Husserl that the possibility of responsibility is based on knowledge and on rendering accounts, Derrida thus recognizes another equally compelling demand without which responsibility is not possible. The Christian paradigm exemplifies this further condition of possibility of responsibility. According to this new conception, responsibility requires a break with established or sanctified dogmas (including the most convincing and convinced
      doxa). Rather than seeking conformity, one may have to set oneself apart from what is publicly or commonly accepted. In other words, responsibility is tied here to heresy in all the senses of the term—particularly, as is the case with Patočka, to a “departure from a doctrine, difference within and difference from the officially and publicly stated doctrine and the institutional community that is governed by it” (GD,p. 26). Heresy is not only “an essential condition of responsibility,” it “also destines responsibility to the resistance or dissidence of a type of secrecy. It keeps responsibility apart … and in secret. And responsibilitydepends on[tient à] what is apart and secret” (GD,p. 26; trans. mod.). Indeed, if knowledge remains only on the threshold of a responsible decision, if a decision is a decision on the condition that it exceeds simple consciousness and simple theoretical determination, the responsible self must, in principle, be unable—that is, run the risk of not being able—to fully account for the singular act constitutive of a responsible decision. It follows from this that responsibility is necessarily linked to the secret—not, of course, in the form of withholding knowledge regarding a specific decision but in the form of an essential inability to ultimately make the reasons for one’s actions fully transparent. According to this essential Christian conception of responsibility (which is also, for essential reasons, heretical), decision making without secrecy remains u~<br>

Abstract: What Simmel was to point to at the turn of the century in
         The Philosophy of Money,his important cultural supplement to Marx’sCapital,was the establishment of a cultural formation no longer constrained by enforcing periodicity in order to satisfy individual emotions and wants. It was now possible, at any given moment, to buy anything for money. Such a culture was able to overcome the limits set by space and time and thus the need to delineate definite periods compelling the determination of a framework for action. In Simmel’s reckoning, all that was necessary, under the circumstances of this vision of a lived, endless present, was the will and capacity of the individual to act upon objective conditions. For those who possess the means to carry out this desire, the present will always appear as indistinguishable from the future; for others, the present can only mean uncertainty and offer hope for a better future. Moreover, it was the absence of periodicity demanded by capitalism that rendered invisible the coexistence of multiple temporalities in the present and their claims on both the past and future. Yet Simmel never explained the historical conditions that might account for the interruption of a concern for periodicity in the present; he had decided in advance to remain silent on the formation of capitalist society. Moreover, he was looking at the absence of periodicity from the perspective of consumption and consumers, not production, workers, and wages, which would have demanded instituting a framework determined by temporal markers. The sudden manifestation or awareness of the importance of periodicity would in fact reflect the punctual, cyclical crises produced by capitalist accumulation itself, as it would undermine the capacity to buy anything, anytime, especially for those whose future was always the day after. In this regard, the manifestation or awareness of the demand for periodicity at certain moments would signify a symptom of critical instabi~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: With respect to academic arguments over the New Testament’s historicity, philosopher Mary Warnock has argued that the debates “show a failure to understand the full part that imagination plays not only in religion but in literature, history and in life itself, lived as it is through time, yet demanding a constant effort to make sense of time, to turn events into stories.”
         94Analogously, it can be said that the nature and function of Smith’s texts can best be understood not in terms of historical veracity but as a means to “make sense of time,” specifically biblical time. Or, in terms of narrative theory, Smith’s mythmaking may be best understood in terms of its capacity to make “human time,” that combination of what is already (our past) with what is anticipated (our future) to comprise the reality out of which we act in the present.95Thus, by maintaining the narrative function of the Bible in his own writings, Smith made more than a claim to history. He gave his believing readers a sense of what was experientially real, not merely philosophically true. Wittgenstein’s observation about Christianity is equally true of Mormonism. “Christianity is not,” he said, “based on a historical truth; rather it offers us a (historical) narrative and says: now believe! But not, believe this narrative with the belief appropriate to historical narrative, rather … make a quite different place in your life for it.”96Attention to narrative function furthers Wittgenstein’s point by positing that the believing reader’s commitment is not partial. The reader does not make “a place” for the narrative but enters—takes his or her life experience—into the narrative as a world of possibility.<br>

Abstract: What disqualifies
         pra
            dhānafrom consideration as the world’s cause are Upaniṣadic passages such as Chāndogya 6.2.3 and Aitareya 1.1.1–2 that speak of an act of visualization (īkṣā) preceding creation (īkṣāpūr
            vikām sṛṣṭim). Here Śaṅkara’s commentary closely follows theBrahma‐sūtra.40Although such passages are well attested in the major Upaniṣads, it would be naive to deny that an interest in refuting Sāṃkhya played a crucial role in lifting up these passages for special attention. After all, it is well known that even interpreters sincerely committed to following scriptural texts have many interpretive stratagems at their disposal in order to get around passages that interfere with their interpretive interests. Here exegetical considerations are inextricably bound up with apologetic ones.<br>

Author(s): Plate Liedeke<br>
Abstract: As Rich defines it, “re‐vision … is an act of survival” because it leads to autonomy and self‐determination. By identifying sources of oppression and charting their mechanics of reproduction, re‐vision was meant to retrieve an authentic sense of self that was not defined by patriarchal society. To reveal that there is nothing natural about the stories that sustain social organization and its gendered division of labor was to rescue women from the confines of domesticity. Indeed, revealing that they are stories to begin with, myths that are passed off as timeless truths but that can be told differently, was considered the first step in the process of emancipation that was to lead, through the stages of consciousness‐raising and political action, to the radical transformation of the public sphere. French feminist Hélène Cixous voices views similar to Rich’s when she asks what would happen if the myths that sustain the patriarchal order were to be demystified and claims, “Then all the stories would have to be told differently, the future would be incalculable, the historical forces would, will, change hands, bodies; another thinking as yet not thinkable will transform the functioning of all society” (
         1981, 93). Gesturing toward all those women re‐writers re‐visioning the great narratives of the West while resonating intertextually with Rich’s words, Cixous adds:
               
         Well, we are living through this very period when the conceptual foundation of a millennial culture is in process of being undermined by millions of a species of mole as yet not recognized.

Abstract: The second theory of truth is the coherence theory. This theory of truth has often been espoused by idealists who are not necessarily concerned with the external world. The coherence theory states that some proposition is true if and only if it does not contradict or is not contrary to any propositions already held to be true. The best way for librarians to analyze this theory of truth is to consider the sum of knowledge that is already before the public. We can interpret this sum of knowledge as consisting of all the books, journals, and other materials, regardless of format, that constitute a well‐regulated academic library. Suppose that a new monograph is acquired that totally contradicts many of the propositions of science and common reasoning already established to be true. In times past, such books would likely have been censored, if not destroyed. The act of censorship could be perpetrated by political or religious establishments, or even from professional and academic organizations. There have been many instances in history where this has happened—just consider Galileo’s
         Dialogues Concerning the Two New Sciencesor Freud’s papers pertaining to infantile sexuality.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: As it happens, and for no other good reason than the parallelism, it is the divided Flora herself who appears on the arm of the last of these halved subjects in the novel's final illustration for the wedding party. There beside her is another two-faced social agent, Mr. Pancks, but one caught this time in the throes of his normalization. Half raging insurgent, half patient and mild-mannered friend, this is the character whose own eccentric surname spells out by perfect phonetic anagram that primal violence of humiliation in
         spank.Certainly with no pangs whatever, the actual retribution he exacts is to have molested his archenemy in public, assaulted and mocked him. In full view of the local populace in Bleeding Heart Yard, Pancks shears the locks of his hypocrite boss, the false patriarch Casby. Here is an act of pseudorevolutionary, and entirely local, defiance that nonetheless comes as close as the slum dwellers of the novel will ever get to that running of blood in the streets across the channel. No proletarian revolution for England, only the unrest that fuels the plot of ambition itself: a correction from within of the middle-class system.<br>

Abstract: The second important difference is that attention in Edelman displays itself in the mere guise of a utilitarian attending to individual goals, analogous with Bergson’s animalistic, instinctive “attention to life”; in other words, Edelman confines the act of attention to one’s self‐serving reaction to nonconscious neuroactivity. By contrast, attention in Augustine displays itself in multiple guises, each of them correspondent to a different stage in the perfectibility of the individual self. When focused on using what is to be used (
         utendis uti) in order to achieve a goal or obtain a result, attention coincides with the most instrumental or rationalistic configuration of individual will. When focused on the fruition of things, goals, or results that are an end in themselves (fruendis frui), attention coincides with desire (De diversis quaestionibus ad Simpl.qq. 83, q. 30)—withintelligentdesire, one could say, keeping in mind’s Augustine’s distinction betweenratioandintelligentia. When focused on intimacy with God as the ultimate object of desire, attention coincides with love (De Trinitate11.2.4‐5;De musica6.8.21).19<br>

Abstract: The virtues to which I have alluded thus possess radical implications for citizens considering the morality of war and, in particular, whether to join a standing army or to agree to conscription in military service. If I am correct about the role of the virtues for just‐war morality, then individual citizens have a duty to settle matters of the
         jus ad bellumduring times of conflict or impending conflict. Citizens cannot merely rely on a connection between patriotism and political obedience but should act on the notion that patriotism informed by a sense of justice requires moral reflection about the merits of a polity’s demands on an individual’s conscience. That notion implies higher expectations of moral assessment than has typically been the case in just‐war theorizing and might require citizens to refuse participation or conscription in war. Put differently, citizens who fail to engage in such reflection and who enter into an unjust war may be judged culpably negligent for choosing to be made into soldiers. To be sure, the social, political, economic, legal, and cultural forces that bear on an individual’s decision are complex, making personal agency and moral deliberation in war an extremely complex matter.72But just‐war morality, properly understood, involves dispositions to resist sources of fear and to exercise courage and independence of mind regarding the merits of a polity’s cause.<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: This emphasis—for example, one “must act in order to receive” (N5554, fol. 11v), and God as a “prior actuality” (N4816)—brings Coleridge far closer to Marion’s analysis than to Derrida’s, insofar as prayer responds to an always already present effect, claim, gift, or call. Marion presents prayer as language directed at a requisite (
         aition, or cause) from whom beings “receive themselves … as requestants.”64This is why he later argues that Derrida’s objections hold only if naming God is seen as attempting to overcome a lack or deficiency in one’s intuition of God. Marion insists that the intuition is, by contrast, present as an excess—a saturated phenomenon—that demands a proliferation of names: father, love, beauty, holiness, and so on.65Naming, in this infinitely multiplying sense, would thus be not a determination of God but a way of guarding against the illusion that any one name of God is determinative.66Yet if prayer responds and bears witness to a certain call already made on the subject, Marion arguably renders prayer too easy. After all, it is only a minor shift from the human experience of loving to praising God as love.67<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: Gauchet's is a decidedly “political history of religion” that attaches paramount importance to the state. The rise of this “sacral transforming agent” imposed the otherness that once characterized the gods of the first religions on and in society. As a result, the divine appeared ever more remote as an “organizing principle,” and humans were left in a position to “reappropriate” the world. This theologico-political transformation ushered in a long procession of events culminating in the emergence of Christianity, the religion that functioned as a theological conduit for departing from religion. The final act of Gauchet's passion play of the sacred unfolds during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with the Protestant and Catholic Reformations and the rise of political absolutism; the former enshrined the freedom of the conscience, while the latter completed the process of cleaving the terrestrial from the divine sphere. Ultimately, individuals came to assert themselves in the void left by a transcendent divinity: “God's greatness, taken to the highest level, puts humans on an equal footing with the mystery of creation and validates their independence as cognitive subjects.” The appearance of the modern individual and the modern state signaled the completion of what Gauchet calls a “revolution in transcendence,” predicated on human reoccupation of the space once entirely controlled by the divine. Nevertheless, the self's past alienation from its origins was not simply overcome but instead transferred to psychological, social, and political dualities that persist both within and among individual selves. As Gauchet observes, “Leaving religion is not like waking from a dream. We originated in religion, we continue to explain ourselves through it, and always will.”

Abstract: One apparent goal of the last night’s instructions was to saturate the mission with selected images from the foundations of Islamic cultural experience, inducing the ritual actors to perform, and a certain audience to recognize, an iconic analogue of a primordial act. If the instructions are to be taken as sincere, the ritual injunctions encourage the ritual actor to envision his identity as undergoing a structural metaphorical switch, from a contemporary man to a seventh‐century hero. This is because the instructions repeatedly enlist domains of experience from sanctified history and persuade him to imagine his mission in terms of heroic models.<br>

Article Title: Critique and Promise in Paul Tillich’s Political Theology: Engaging Giorgio Agamben on Sovereignty and Possibility<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: The decisive question remains: what is promised? What offered gift can we take as the token‐as‐promise among the wealth of signs and givens that wash through the world? Owing to his view of prophetic criticism, Tillich claimed that yesterday’s prophetic act may be in need of revision and criticism today. This means that few or no signs may be taken as offered tokens. However, it would not be the case, he thinks, that Protestantism simply would carry out a sort of semiotic iconoclasm, wringing its hands, worried that every sign in the world is always a failing. Interestingly, at the end of his essay he turns to the congregation, and there we may find some ways to construe the prophetic as sign of the cross. Tillich does not develop what he calls the protestant form of grace, a chastened form that would dissent in his view from the objectification of what he calls Catholicism. Of course, this is a severely limited judgment on Tillich’s part, since there are many vibrant accounts of the Eucharist—Catholic and Protestant—together with their practical and political significance that are deeply marked by the same engagements and imperatives that Tillich raised.
         46These senses of Eucharist still would benefit from reflection on promise, and its local form in the congregation makes better sense when it is framed by the Eucharist as site of promise, gift, exchange, and free reciprocity. Eucharist, briefly, invokes the character of promise as the offering of Jesus’s testament as well as a mutual action that is both communion as exchange between God and creation as well as in and amid creation. It would not take much to think through the Eucharist as the liturgical action and embodiment of promise, to reconsider it and its practice toward being otherwise than sovereign, as I have written here. Suffice it to note that the Eucharist is a meal of betrayal, as theVerbaalways announce: “On the night in which he was betrayed.”<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: This notion of literature develops from Blanchot's reading of Mallarmé as well as his encounter with the Hegelian description of comprehension. Drawing from Kojève's seminars, Blanchot begins with the notion that language involves the absence (the annihilation or death) of the object, such that for one to possess the idea of cat, one must annihilate the uniquely real cat in its existence.
         35“Common language,” Blanchot writes, recognizes this operation as unproblematic or at least productive. For in killing the real cat, I have gained something much more secure, the idea of cat, which cannot die. Literary language differs from common language not in the act itself, for by the very fact that it is language it must also enact a negation of the object. “But literary language,” Blanchot suggests, “is made of uneasiness” (“L,” p. 315; “LRD,” p. 325). Literary language draws attention back to the negativity of the operation, focusing on the fact that the word expresses the nonexistence of the cat and that what it has given us as a replacement is a word. Literature dramatizes the operation of replacement by offering “an endless sliding of ‘turns of phrase' which do not lead anywhere. Thus is born,” Blanchot writes, “the image that does not designate the thing but, rather, what the thing is not” (“L,” p. 315; “LRD,” p. 326). The mark of the literary is the mark of the trope, a turn. A figure of speech is a turn that multiplies the absence between the object and the word, for now what we have is a word that refers not to the object but to another word.<br>

Abstract: Kafka himself brings up yet another corollary: “An appendix to this story has also been handed down. Ulysses, it is said, was so full of guile, was such a fox, that not even the goddess of fate could penetrate his inner self. Perhaps he had really noticed, although it is beyond human understanding, that the Sirens were silent and perhaps somehow opposed them and the gods using the aforementioned sham as a shield.”
   
            Why not? Why should it not be the case that, ultimately, Augustine, while confessing uninterruptedly, has succeeded in having his Confessee not penetrate his heart? Who can tell? Once in the grasp of the seductive act of24
         confessioas inextricably linked to the moment the confession is made and to the everlasting Confessee hovering over it, who indeed can tell? An angel to an angel? Yet this question regards the fullness of sound: “Only you can be asked, only you can be begged, only on your door can we knock. Yes, indeed, that is how it is received, how it is found, how the door is opened.”

Abstract: Although this account is promising, I see three problems or issues needing clarification in it. First, while insisting that their function is not cognitive, Larmore describes such avowals as “an exercise of practical reflection” (128). This suggests that it is by a kind of thought that someone deliberately commits herself or takes “responsibility for what she is doing” (63). It would be clearer to say that this is a process of will that sets new final ends or shores up motivation to follow intentions already formed. Luther may have performed an act of practical reflection in “expressing his resolution to pursue the path on which he had set out” (63), but the resolution in which he took his stand and set his personal policies was not itself constituted by the reflective expression of them. Larmore’s account misses what I have called the “projective motivation” function of willing that Ricoeur at least implicitly recognizes. He does such a good job of arguing that the constitutive self-relation is not a “cognitive” or knowledge-aimed relationship (131) that he does not draw key distinctions between different practical or “performative” operations of mind (134). However, perhaps the problem is simply that Larmore’s terminology reflects his aversion to any “acts of will” distinct from beliefs and desires, as we saw above. For, in arguing that the object of practical reflecting is “in no way cognitive,” he briefly distinguishes it from
      practical reasoningin which we “conclude that certain actions are obligatory, permissible, or prudent” (70). While practical reasoning is cognitive and aims at objective correctness in judgment, practical reflection instead aims at “an explicit intention to do this or that” (71)—which sounds like Aristotle’s concept ofprohairesis(usually translated as rational “choice”). Why not then recognize that such an intention-forming process normally mediates between belief-desire sets and the intentions that express them?<br>

Abstract: As is often the case, when a scholar who is trained as a descriptivist (in disciplines such as history, sociology, and ethnography) attempts to take on theoretical issues they become theoretically parochial. They understand what works for their predefined area of expertise. However, theory takes place in constituting the domains for research, prior to the act of description, not in the applying individual concepts to preexistent object-domains. As Paul Ricoeur put it, “to delimit a domain of application is a hermeneutical act,” an act “that calls for reflection in terms of a general theory of interpretation” (
      Figuring the Sacred[Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress Press, 1995] 304). This kind of reflection, in my view as a scholar trained in theory, is completely lacking in Vásquez’s choice of criterion, despite his long sections of exegesis of theoretical texts. Rigorous exegesis is not the same thing as rigorous theoretical thinking. Rather, in Vásquez’s choices we find a predetermined view in search of a theory. The book becomes a justification of his choices, not a critical, reflexive, hermeneutical act. Theory happens before the explication of theory begins, and awareness of this fact is absent from this text.<br>

Abstract: Beyond this sampling of monographic treatments of witchcraft, I can only briefly allude to the tenor in relation to evil in a limited selection of edited collections. The volume edited by Kapferer (
         2002) stands firmly on the shoulders of Evans-Pritchard in beginning with and moving beyond the problem of rationality. One direction of this movement is emphasis on the “human-centric, person-centered and social nature of witchcraft’s practical reason that gives prime force to human agency” (7), and the assertion that “Sorcery fetishizes human agency, often one which it magically enhances, as the key mediating factor affecting the course or direction of human life-chances” (105).
               Another is the conjunction of witchcraft and sorcery with the conditions of modernism, postmodernism, the state, and postcoloniality, pushing analysis toward mythopoesis, metacosmology, and the imaginary rather than toward morality, while yet acknowledging their inherent violence and the monstrosity of their symbolism and practice. In contrast to this approach, the volume edited by Whitehead and Wright (13
            2004) on witchcraft and sorcery practiced by “dark shamans” in Amazonia directly confronts both the lethal violence and socio-cosmological centrality of these practices. This strategy avoids playing into either a renewal of irrationalizing colonial demonization in the name of suppression or romanticizing contemporary rehabilitation in the name of cultural diversity. Thus, Amazonian shamanism is a “predatory animism,” and in this sense its key symbol of the jaguar should be understood not as an endangered species but as a dangerous predator (Fausto2004:171). The witch or dark shaman is “the embodiment of evil in the world” because they “lack empathy for other humans and act for purely personal motives” (Heckenberger2004:179). For the Arara people there are explicit connections among morality, sorcery, and banishment with respect to people who forgo generosit~<br>

Abstract: Act 3’s “Off, off, you lendings! Come, unbutton here” is revisited in act 5 when Lear asks of an attendant, “Pray you, undo this button. Thank you, sir” (5.2.84). Making the same basic request, but in a much calmer register, the king signals a shift in his character. This shift is even more significant if we take Lear to be making the request for Cordelia, rather than himself. In most productions, the king tugs at his own constricting collar when he speaks these lines, but he could be fumbling with Cordelia’s. He is, after all, trying to resuscitate her, and undoing a button at her neckline would be commensurate with this. If staged like this, the scene would show a subtle yet striking reversal. The man who once tried to “unbutton” to escape his answerability now unbuttons to administer aid to another.<br>

Abstract: There are alternatives to textual narrative, even if such narrative is crucial and probably indispensable for the generation of a concept of time and historical consciousness (see Ricoeur,
         Time and Narrative). Ritual can be an important way to dramatically act out the past, in a mode of memorizing or re-presentation. Images can focus on constellations and scenes, pointing to and systematizing previous narratives, or even gain narrative powers. On narrative sequences in ancient reliefs, see Mario Torelli,Typology and Structure of Roman Historical Reliefs(Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1982); Holger Hussy,“Die Epiphanie und Erneurung der Macht Gottes”: Szenen des täglichen Kultbildrituals in den ägyptische Tempeln der griechisch-römischen Epoche(Dettelbach: Röll, 2007).<br>

Abstract: But what about the poet who also speaks these words? Does he too desire to lose himself completely in that original utterance? Fish’s claim asks us to consider the contradictory nature of “originality” in Milton’s work. On the one hand, it signifies all that Milton does when he boldly rewrites the epic tradition, pursuing “things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.” On the other hand, it means what Fish describes, something perilously close to “unoriginality”—the act of reiterating the words of another, until the quotation marks fall away and the speaker disappears entirely into what is spoken. It is a contrast we can register visually when we look at some of George Herbert’s poems. What we often see is a short italicized scriptural phrase (
      My God, my King; Thou art still my God) that the speaker wishes desperately he could just repeat—to quote without embellishment. But these little quotations are always embellished, surrounded by a kind of permanent poetic scaffolding. In the same way, Milton’s voice cannot finally be identified either with his “lovely enchanting language” or with those pure scriptural words that he wishes he could repeat, simply and selflessly.
               The divine poet is pulled back and forth between the work of creation and the work of quotation, drawing poetry out of the impossible desire to be at once innovative and inspiredly unoriginal.45<br>

Abstract: The meaning of
         catharsisin Aristotle’sPoeticsis heavily debated, with most interpretations clustering around three key translations: purgation, purification, and clarification. In his 1599 treatise on tragicomedy, Giambattista Guarini likened catharsis to the medical procedure of purging, as neither seeks eradication of the target element but instead restoration of balance (The Compendium of Tragicomic Poetry (1599), inLiterary Criticism: Plato to Dryden, ed. Allan H. Gilbert [Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1962], 517–20; see also O. B. Hardison Jr., “Three Types of Renaissance Catharsis,” inPoetics and Praxis, Understanding and Imagination: The Collected Essays of O. B. Hardison, Jr.[Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1997], 78–94). Martha C. Nussbaum has characterized catharsis as a “clearing up” or “cleaning up” of emotions (“Tragedy and Self-Sufficiency: Plato and Aristotle on Fear and Pity,” inEssays on Aristotle’sPoetics, ed. Amélie Oksenberg Rorty [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1992], 280), and Gerald F. Else has argued that catharsis is a purification of the act of the character rather than a purgation of the emotions of the audience (Aristotle’s Poetics: The Argument[Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1963], 230–31, 422–40). John P. Anton, critiquing Nietzsche’s reading of Aristotle’sPoetics, argues that Nietzsche was incorrect in construing catharsis as a purge of emotions, also claiming that it is a clarification of events (“Nietzsche’s Critique of Aristotle’s Theory of Tragic Emotions,” inTragedy and Philosophy, ed. N. Georgopoulos [New York: St. Martin’s, 1993], 19–38). In light of this ongoing debate about the meaning of a single Greek word, several critics have suggested other language and models through which to examine the phenomenon of audience response to tragedy—a useful critical strategy for discussing how modern audiences might conceptualize their own reaction to what they see on stage.

Abstract: Also worth mentioning is the way Pound explains this poetic charge in terms of precise relationships between elements of language employing an electromagnetic simile: “Let us imagine that words are like great hollow cones of steel of different dullness and acuteness; I say great because I want them not too easy to move; they must be of different sizes. Let us imagine them charged with a force like electricity, or, rather, radiating a force from their apexes—some radiating, some sucking in.…Some of these kinds of force neutralize each other, some augment; but the only way any two cones can be got to act without waste is for them to be so placed that their apexes and a line of surface meet exactly. When this conjunction occurs let us say their force is not added one’s to the other’s, but multiplied the one’s by the other’s; thus three or four words in exact juxtaposition are capable of radiating this energy at a very high potentiality” (
               Pound 1973, 34).<br>

Abstract: Research on identity suggests that a critical factor in identity concerns presentation or the behaviors actors perform in order to convince others of their identity. Yet identity also involves the attributions others make on the basis of these behaviors. In this paper, I argue that all acts do not fare equally in the process of attribution. Rather, individuals making attributions engage in a process of mental weighing as a way to determine which acts “count” toward identity and to what extent. While various components of the act contribute to its social weight—its presence or absence, markedness, frequency, context, and the manner in which it is performed—the lens through which the attributer views the act also influences the weighing process.<br>

Issue: i259998<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur Steven D.<br>
Abstract: Methods of studying religion can be divided into those which help the investigator "understand" religion from the believer's standpoint and those which "explain" religion in the terms of the sciences. Yet despite the contemporary polemics, these methods need not be alienated from one another. Applying the hermeneutic theory of Paul Ricoeur we can see that the study of religion involves us in an act of interpretation which necessarily requires both methods of understanding and explanation. Ricoeur's theory is employed to show how these methods can be systematically used in tandem so that the most adequate interpretation of the religious world is produced.<br>

Article Title: Toward a Generic Analysis of a Classic of the Social Gospel: An Essay-Review of Walter Rauschenbusch<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263714<br>
Date: 12 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Rauschenbusch Walter<br>
Abstract: Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis, viewed by many as the masterpiece of the social gospel movement, has been confined to the dusty shelves of the library. Can we catch no glimpse of what astounded its massive reading public, no glimmer of Rauschenbusch's own sense of the work as a "dangerous book" written in fear and trembling? This article suggests that a generic analysis of Christianity and the Social Crisis might lead to surprising disclosures. Any generic analysis involves the discussion of a group of texts. Consequently this study proceeds via a comparison of the structure of Christianity and the Social Crisis with those of other works of a similar type which were produced between 1890 and 1915. The genre is isolated by utilizing the techniques of Tzvetan Todorov. Certain negative traits are specified which separate the genre from its neighbors. The positive leitmotif of a dual crisis-a crisis affecting society as a whole and the ramifications of that crisis within the Christian churches-is specified as the decisive trait of the genre. To deal with this leitmotif a specific structure was generated by the works under consideration. They provided-to pirate the words of Clifford Geertz in his landmark essay on modern ideologies-"maps of problematic reality" and "matrices for the creation of collective conscience." In designing their maps of problematic reality our authors worked along two separate but related vectors. The first of these vectors was constituted by a historical analysis of the origins of the present crisis, while the second consisted of a systemic analysis of the present social order. Each of these elements of the genre is examined in turn. The mapping of problematic reality by means of a historical and a structural analysis was geared towards provoking as well as defining the crisis. Crisis, once defined, demanded decision. Nevertheless the "permanent basis for action" which Rauschenbusch and others sought could not be groun~<br>

Article Title: Generic Studies: Their Renewed Importance in Religious and Literary Interpretation<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263709<br>

Author(s): Wiggins Mary<br>
Abstract: In recent years, the need for a critique of "reader" as rigorous as that which has been developed for "text" and for "author" has become increasingly acute. Whether in the study of religion as story and biography or in interpretative reading in general, a critical notion of reader is essential if the act of reading is to be anything other than mere consumption of texts. Some new way of understanding the hermeneutical circle is required to avert the narcissism latent in the Anselmian model. The notion of "genre" as developed by four recent theorists is helpful in the task of constructing a critique of "reader." E. D. Hirsch, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Tzvetán Todorov, and Paul Ricoeur have each surpassed the idealist notion of genre as a classificatory device and developed in its place the notion of genre as a generative pinciple. Todorov, for example, illustrates how "form" is a theoretical, as distinct from a descriptive or explanatory, issue. According to both Hirsch and Todorov, somewhere between empirical details and metaphysical thematizations lie generic formulations which can assist the reader to organize his/her response to the text and to recognize the probable understanding toward which the conventions of the text are directed. In Gadamer's theory of interpretation, the notion of genre acquires historicity. After Gadamer, genres can no longer be regarded as timeless a priori categories. Rather, because they are constituted by historical reflections, their rise and decline are intrinsic to text-interpretation. Finally, in Ricoeur's theory that generic considerations are correlative principles of production and interpretation, we find a basis for understanding genre as praxis. If we understand reading to be isomorphic to authoring, it becomes clear that the reader can no longer be regarded as the self-evident recipient of text-signification. Genre, in Ricoeur's theory, transforms "speech" into a "work" and points toward a new notion of "reader" as one whose reconst~<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303101<br>
Date: 7 1, 1938<br>
Author(s): Al-Zayyat Israel<br>
Abstract: This paper is an attempt to rethink the much-discussed topic of the so-called crisis of orientation among, or shift of, Egyptian intellectuals who turned to Islamic subjects in the 1930s. Those intellectuals who, during the 1920s, had adhered to the principles of Westernization and secularization were said to have abandoned these principles to embrace Islam and Arabism a decade later. The commonly ventured historical account of this shift attempted to describe and explain it from the "top down," that is, from the perspective of the intellectual producers, either on the basis of content analysis of their texts or through the reconstruction of authorial intentions. It was assumed that the impact of this shift on the culture and politics of contemporary society could be extracted from the meanings invested by the authors in their texts or from the context of the act of writing. This paper approaches the subject from a different perspective, namely, from the "bottom up." While not ignoring authorial intentions or the meanings with which authors invested their texts, I emphasize the ways in which readers reinterpreted intellectual literature on Islam as they consumed it and argue that a proper understanding of the social and political impact of literary products cannot be attained without also understanding the reception of these products. I concentrate especially on one of the major representative texts of this shift, Muhammad Husayn Haykal's biography of the Prophet, and reconstruct the different interpretations of this work's major communities of contemporary readers in the discursive context of their different "horizons of expectations." Through recontextualizing the "crisis of orientation" debate in the paradigm of reader-response criticism and reception theory, the paper is intended to show that each community of readers produces an autonomous interpretation, "another reading." Despite differences among the various reading communities, some common features emerge f~<br>

Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
Abstract: The first part of the essay explore's three features of Wolterstorff's account of God as a performer of speech acts: (1) the claim that God literally speaks, suggesting that this claim needs something like a Thomistic theory of analogy as an alternative to univocity and mere metaphor; (2) the claim that speaking is not reducible to revealing; and (3) the political implications of these claims, especially in relation to Habermasian theory. The second part focuses on the theory of double discourse, which seeks to make sense of the notion that God speaks to us through the human voices of prophets, apostles, and especially of Scripture, and seeks to show that a fuller account of the speech act by which God deputizes or appropriates human speech is needed. The final section suggests that Ricoeur and Derrida are not the threat to his theory that Wolterstorff takes them to be and that their emphasis on the text, rather than the author, makes sense in contexts where we have only the text to consult.<br>

Abstract: In this introduction to a selection of case studies on the theme "the past in music" I offer a few thoughts on the nature of the past and the role of memory in constructing historical narrative, with reference to the way in which these concepts have been theorized by historians, archaeologists, anthropologists and ethnomusicologists. In reviewing the different ways in which echoes of the past can still be heard in the music of the present, I consider the capacity of music to evoke, embody and transform the past and, by so doing, to act as a medium for history and its interpretation.<br>

Date: 11 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Iguchi Kawori<br>
Abstract: This article seeks to explore the act of reading as an essential element of notated musical practices and of the construction of knowledge about them. By examining how musical notations affect their reader-performers (and vice versa) in two different musical contexts in Japan--the Kyoto Gion festival and amateur lessons on the nohkan flute--the article draws attention to the ways in which the act of reading notation is central to the construction of knowledge about such musical practices. With reference to Etienne Wenger's notion of learning as a process of alignment, and to debates in the anthropology of reading, it then argues that, for learners of these musics, reading notations is a practice of reverse tracing towards the bodily practices of the accomplished. In discussing the musicians' concern for the efficacy of reading as a means of achieving a relevant state of understanding, the article also addresses questions on the role of reading as a method of becoming knowledgeable in the practice of anthropological inquiry.<br>

Publisher: Society for Utopian Studies<br>
Issue: i20719896<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Jenson Michael<br>
Abstract: A recurrent misconception about the concept of utopia fails to realize fully that its essential endeavor constitutes a speculative act involving the distribution of power and resources. Consequently, utopian desire is closely linked to structures of power and can be manipulated by interests in positions of influence within these structures. It is these connections to the machinations of power that bring utopian visions their potential for social/political influence. However, these same types of links also provide avenues for these conceptions to be cynically influenced in ways that can usurp individual autonomy. The role of power and utopia can be analyzed in the formative process of a specific social structure as well as in their contribution to the conception of a common heritage or history. The "historical perspective" often serves as the foundation for the production of propaganda seeking to capture the imagination of a populace either to instigate positive social change or to legitimize an oppressive regime. Through the lens of Collingwood's philosophy of history, this article investigates the connection that the "historical consciousness" has to the attributes of power and utopia as well as the role that this relationship plays in the formation of a collective mentality. In short, it studies the essential characteristics of the bond between individuals that allows a community or collective to perpetuate itself. It also explores how the attributes of power and utopia can use latent historical perceptions to strengthen the process of ideological integration that underlies any social action or formal structure of authority.<br>

Abstract: En considérant la théâtralité moins comme l'essence du théâtre, lui-même haut lieu de la mimésis, que comme sa condition d'émergence, nous voulons mettre en évidence ce qui pourrait la révéler par-delà le texte et la scène: altérité, imprésentabilité, féminité. Bien que liée intimement au lieu et au jeu de la représentation, impliquant acteurs, spectateurs et décors, la théâtralité se présentera plus comme un lieu de créativité, un espace transitionnel où se joue (de) la vérité. On en en mesurera l'enjeu à travers une relecture intertextuelle de La naissance de la tragédie et de fragments posthumes de la même période, en interrogeant la légitimité d'un instinct théâtral qui serait l'une des formes essentielles du Kunsttrieb dont le destin est de procéder à une métaphorisation de « Dionysos agissant » et à une poétisation dévoilante de la vérité dont l'acteur deviendra finalement l'interprète en cela même qu'il en joue sur le mode de l'absence et qu'il ouvre un texte vers cet autre qui ne s'y présente jamais comme tel. Considering theatrality less as the essence of theatre, which is the high place for Mimesis, than the condition of its emergence, we would like to bring to force what could express it above text and performance: alterity, impresentability, feminity. Even if it seems closely related to place and acting of the representation, including the actors, the spectator and the setting, theatrality will prove to be a place for creativity, a transitional space in which truth can be performed. We will assess its stakes through a second intertextual reading of The Birth of Tragedy and of posthumous extracts from the same period; we can at the same time wonder over the legitimacy of a theatral instinct which would be one of the essential forms of the « Kunstriels »; its fate is to act as a metaphor of an « acting Dionysos » and to a revealing poetisation of truth for which the actor eventually turns out to be the interpret in so far as he plays on it on being absent ~<br>

Article Title: A COHESIVE SHAMBLES: THE CLASH'S `LONDON CALLING' AND THE NORMALIZATION OF PUNK<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23013006<br>

Abstract: The Clash's London Calling was released just at the moment when the British punk movement seemed to be imploding. From the earliest reviews, it was received as a musical masterpiece that drew on many styles while still managing to be `punk' in some sense. This article argues that London Calling normalized punk, allowing it to be more than an event: punk could henceforth be assimilated into traditional musical discourse and aesthetics. As a careful balancing act between punk street-cred and mainstream musical values, London Calling allowed a double reading. Punk fans could find in it what they sought: anti-establishment anger and at times a messy, disdainful approach to conventional musicianship. At the same time critics and listeners who had come since the late sixties to assimilate rock into a Romantic (or post-Romantic) system of `art' values could find in it what they sought: stylistic growth, organic coherence, originality, and even a `universal' narrative of struggle, triumph, and redemption played out across the album. It is possible to isolate not only a story, but musical connections between the songs (keys, recurrent motifs, and topoi) all laid out in a logical manner. However, unlike concept albums in the seventies' progressive rock style against which punk reacted, London Calling often calls attention away from its musical coherence, and even its textual coherence, rather than towards it—such as by the last-minute addition of a bonus track that disrupts the narrative and key schemes established earlier. The ease with which the album can be praised in established musical language should not completely obscure its potential (and the general potential of punk) to undercut and confront conventional musical discourse.<br>

Abstract: In today's globalized world, we need to communicate values clearly and constructively across cultures and religions to avoid misunderstanding and conflict and to find shared solutions to the issues affecting human communities across the world. This communication is not easy to implement and requires a considerable amount of commitment and empathy. To be effective, intercultural and interreligious dialogues on ethics demand, first of all, an accommodation of different epistemologies coupled with a sincere respect for their richness and internal coherence. Furthermore, our values are so closely rooted in our identity that expressing them becomes a cultural act—even an act of faith in the case of interreligious dialogue. In this paper, I argue that we need to reiterate or embrace this act of faith in the other's values if we are to properly understand them. How is this possible? The answer calls for a theoretical discussion of the hermeneutics of interreligious dialogue. When applied to intercultural and interreligious dialogues, I contend that the theory of hermeneutics needs a specific epistemological dimension—namely that of "appropriation"—that entails that we borrow the other's epistemological outlook, adopt the other's ad hoc modes of communication or transmission of values, and integrate the other's values into the constellation of our sources of meaning.<br>

Abstract: How does a generation without personal memory begin to grapple with its urban past in a nation that has silenced its memories? Moreover, how are symbolic sites of memory recovered and represented by such a generation? Much recent scholarship on post-war Lebanon has studied the memory culture of the decades following the declared end of civil war in 1990. This scholarship deals with the implications of Lebanon's 'amnesiac' political culture on the social and political landscape. In the meantime, Lebanon—and especially Beirut's—urban landscape has been altered beyond recognition by post-war reconstruction, mostly by private real estate holding companies, the most notorious of which is Solidere. In the early 2000s, as Solidere's activity picked up speed, a slew of historical novels about Lebanon and especially Beirut was published in both Arabic and French. In this article, I will focus exclusively on the strategies of urban commemoration in Rabīʿ Jābir's trilogy. I argue that the genre of historical fiction is used in these novels to re-create the downtown life of Beirut in and around Martyrs' Square from the 19th and early 20th century, a commemoration of a cityscape and an urban lifestyle that its author recreates using the tools of the archive (documents, bibliographies, etc.). This post-memorial fiction—here, I use Marianne Hirsch's definition of postmemory as "second-generation memories of cultural and collective traumas and experience" (22)—attempts to recover Beirut's repressed Ottoman urban history, and to re-write Solidere's narrative of the city center. By intertwining downtown Beirut's past with its present, in a clever back-and-forth palimpsestic act that superimposes the historical city upon the present city—site of capitalist consumption—Jābir's novels map out the old upon the new, and thus refuses the erasure of the ancient city by its newest urbanists. In Jābir's novels, a new, contestatory commemorative narrative of Beirut's history and—more significa~<br>

Abstract: Cet article cherche à préciser, à partir de la foi, dans quelle mesure le Christ peut être dit Norme de notre vie et de l'Histoire. L'auteur articule sa réponse à partir de la théologie de la grâce de Von Balthasar, de la morale théonome de Tillich et de la réflexion de Ricoeur sur le rapport à autrui. L'auteur soutient qu'il est possible de comprendre l'agapè comme un impératif catégorique non seulement formel, mais également concret. L'acte de la rencontre du Christ, universalisé dans et par l'Esprit, est tout à la fois la forme et le contenu de l'impératif catégorique. Sous cet aspect la norme n'est plus imposition, mais interpellation eschatologique à laquelle le croyant répondra par une configuration de sa vie au Christ. The paper seeks to understand how Christ can be said to be the living Norm of our life and of our History. The author build his reply upon Von Balthasar theology of grace, Tillich's concept of theonomy and Ricoeur's concept of solicitude. He sustain that it is possible to understand the love of agape not only as a formal but also a concrete categorical imperative. The encounter, the very act of meeting Christ, universally broaden by the Spirit, is at the same time the form and the contend of the categorical imperative. Under this view, the norm is not anymore imposed to the believer as an obligation, but urged upon him as an eschatological invitation to love.<br>

Abstract: History is not neutral. It is rendered ideological by the very act of being conveyed in a narrative form, for language is both the purveyor of meaning and the principle locus of ideology. This paper explores the idea of history as discourse, and its deployment in the cultural-symbolic construction of the Singapore nation. To this end, I have chosen to analyse a key moment for Singapore history, the years 1963-65, when Singapore was first merged with the nation of Malaysia, and then separated from it. The way that these events are described in official histories is used by the government of Singapore to justify its policy of multiracialism, which also serves as a legitimating device confirming the state in its political and ideological hegemony. I have examined the events through analysis of local newspapers, The Straits Times and Berita Harían, to see in what ways their reporting may have helped to mould popular understandings of what was happening.<br>

Author(s): ZIRK-SADOWSKI MAREK<br>
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to indicate that it is impossible to describe the difference betweeen logical sentences and norms on the level of the structure of the language but it has to be done only on the level of the use of the language, viz. the act of speech. The author stresses specificity of the natural language in which every legal norm is formulated. He emphasizes the difference between extensional and intensional language stating that the natural language should be ranked among the latter. La tâche de l'article est de démontrer que la différence entre les phrases logiques et les normes ne peut pas être décrite sur le niveau de la structure de la langue, mais seulements sur le niveau de son usage, c'est-à-dire sur le niveau d'un acte de la parole. L'auteur souligne la specificité de la langue naturelle dans laquelle de chaque norme juridique est formulée. Il met l'accent sur la différence entre le langues extensionelles et intensionelles et constate que la langue naturelle est la langue intensionelle. Dieser Artikel bezweckt, nachzuweisen, daß man den Unterschied zwischen logischen Sätzen und Normen auf der Strukturstufe der Sprache nicht beschreiben kann, sondern nur auf der pragmatischen Gebrauchsstufe der Sprache, d.h. des Sprechaktes. Der Autor betont einen spezifischen Charakter der Umgangssprache, in welcher jede Rechtsnorm formuliert ist. Er akzentuiert den Unterschied zwischen extensionalen und intensionalen Sprachen und stellt fest, daß die Umgangssprache eine intensionale Sprache ist.<br>

Abstract: This article aims at explaining, on the one hand, the inadequacy of the formalist positivist method in answering the essential questions of constitutional Law, such as the validity of the constitutional norm, the sovereignty of the people which comes before the original constitutional act and the effects of a theory of values on the limitation of the revision power. On the other hand, it proposes an onto-axiological approach, which refers to the Philosophy of Law. A relevant methodology of constitutional science of Liberty helps the specialists to follow the progress of knowledge. It puts forward means for approaching the subject matter of science (the norm), the constitutional environment and the theoretical basis of the norm. Following this proposed method would help not only in describing the norms but also in checking their validity, their justification and their imperfection when compared with their aims. These thought processes are a never ending search, that is to say a characteristic of science itself.<br>

Abstract: Quentin Skinner's methodological project contains a fundamental imprecision that is rarely mentioned by the secondary literature: the assumption, present in several of his methodological texts, that a theory designed for the analysis of oral communication (speech act theory) can be unreservedly used for interpreting text. In this article I will use some of Paul Ricoeur's phenomenological insights on the difference between textual and oral communication in order to advance a systematic critique of Skinner's project and to suggest new methodological possibilities for the history of political thought and related disciplines. This procedure will also allow me to organize some of the criticism raised against Skinner's Collingwoodean approach since its inception.<br>

Abstract: This article attempts to refine the understanding of translation, thus contributing to evaluate its role in reception theory and in the history of ideas. A discussion of on the character, theories, and practices of translation in early-modern times is its entry point of analysis. During this period, what mattered in the first place was not the extent to which the translated text succeeded or failed in making the source text and its "original" ideas accessible in the target language, but rather the extent and the way in which the source text was instrumental in pursuing the agenda set by the translator or others in compliance with specific contexts. Such a perspective on translation seems also appropriate to current modes of inquiry for which translation is not an instance of inter-cultural communication, aiming to penetrate the Other in its fullness and make it intelligible in its otherness, but a communicative act whose purposes are predominantly intra-cultural and consist in supporting domestic agendas to which the translated text looks instrumental.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917944<br>
Date: 3 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Ward Graham<br>
Abstract: Having defined how 'secular' is to be understood in this context, this essay explores two sets of observations. The first concerns the relationship between religion and literature as cultural products of a specific cultural imaginary. Both are fundamentally associated with narrative, which, as even contemporary neuroscience demonstrates, continually attempts to make sense of the world. Both are narratives in which there is a reflection upon, and a performance of, creativity. Since the cultural imaginary has been shaped historically by the religious, then all reflections upon creating are coloured by the sacred. The second set of observations issues from the first and concerns the relationship between authorial standpoint and literary creation. The essay examines authorial intention, the nature of language and the operation of the imagination as each relates to the cultural imaginary and the act of 'making believe'. The two sets of observations and their examination demonstrate the ways in which literature continually resists secularity.<br>

Abstract: Currently, epistemological debates on the formation of concepts in the field of history are close to nonexistent. For that reason alone, this book written by philosopher of history Doris Gerber - with which she earned her habilitation degree at the University of Tübingen - is a welcome addition to the literature in the field. In this work, Gerber addresses the metaphysical question of what "history" really is. In this study, she considers approaches typically adopted within the field of history, and questions whether the intention to act is essential in writing history, or whether it is even required in the first place. The findings of the four reviewers that follow are diverse in their opinion of this provocative study.<br>

Abstract: The article calls attention to the role and function of exemplary "models", defined as evoking signs that move people to reflect their own values and orientations. It was Albert Bandura who first showed that human learning generally has the form of learning from models. Recent insights of neuroscience confirm and explain Bandura's theories: The human brain as a neuronal network estimates things according to similarities of their entire structure. Thus it can be called a "machine estimating structural connections". These insights can inspire moral theology: A concrete model can show the wide range of possibilities christian faith can open to believers. Christian tradition has always maintained this idea by understanding christian life as imitatio Christi. However, "imitatio" must be understood as the free and creative act of an autonomous subject.<br>

In this paper I will argue that Nagel's insight is important for understanding the value placed on patient autonomy in medical ethics. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience brings with it the necessity for an epistemological humility with respect to the lives of others and what can be said to be "right" for them. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience lies at the heart of empathy and our capacity to make decisions that genuinely reflect respect for the patient's autonomy. Through the example of a case involving extreme medical intervention, I identify some impediments to the proper recognition of autonomy. These kind of cases highlight the significance of affective responses with respect to the subjective character of experience, and, by extension, to our capacity to imagine and act in accordance with another's perspective. I argue that affective responses are appropriate and needed considerations in the case where one must attempt to assume another's perspective in order to respect autonomy. I conclude that understanding that experience has an irreducibly subjective character is essential to respecting patient autonomy.<br>

Abstract: An initial awareness is needed of the debates regarding the choice of research approaches in sociology and the diversity and specificity of methods currently being used in the domain of textual data analysis in France. In general the influence of the French socio-linguistic tradition looms large, including, on the one hand, the older works of Michel Pécheux on the "discursive formations" and his A.A.D. (Analyse Automatique du Discours, 1969), and on the other hand, two main perspectives of the "Ecole Française d'Analyse du/de Discours" - which refer to the "speech act" concept and to the problematics of enunciation, and emphasizes the processes and "sociodiscursive practices" between socially-located speakers. Such theoretical conceptions and specific requirements lead to build on methodologies different from the classic, theme-based content analysis, though not yet translated into an operational software. Then the main software developments currently having an impact (at least potential) on practices of computer-aided sociological analysis of textual data, in France, are classified : from the lexicometric using procedures of "French Data Analysis" ('Analyse Factorielle des Correspondances' of Benzecri, and so on...), to a set of "expert-systems" working on specific theoretical frameworks, through more classical methods of content analysis and coding-sorting-retrieving socio-semantic procedures, eventually with various statistical methods. L'auteur expose d'abord quelques considèrations épistémologiques générales sur les présupposés implicites des méthodes de recherche sociologique, abusivement séparées en qualitatives et quantitatives, et des interrogations spécifiques sur le statut des corpus textuels et des pratiques socio-discursives dans différents domaines et selon divers types de problématique en sociologie. Puis, après un résumé des problématiques sociolinguistiques de l'"énonciation", propres aux courants de l'Analyse de Discours à la française", il propose~<br>

Abstract: The concept Deckerinnerung (en. screen-memory), which appeared in Freud's work in 1899, points towards the important epistemological question about the possibility of adequation or coincidence (Deckung) between past experience and the current act that is being presentified. This can take the form of remembering as such or be conceived as fantasy. In order to clarify the differences between fantasy and memory, or rather their interconnection in the Deckerinnerung, they need to be looked at phenomenologically, and in doing so various aspects should be analysed, such as: the character of positional and neutralised acts of presentification; the interference of conscious attention and the phenomenon of inhibition in the act of presentification; the state of memories in the unconscious and the possibilities of their association between themselves or modification by other current acts. While Freud introduces the subject without further analysing it, Husserl's theories offer a valuable contribution here. In this context, there is first a need to outline the way in which Husserl's investigations into memory come close to Freud's discourse, in the sense that they lead to a "Phenomenology of the Unconscious" (Hua XI; Mat. VIII).<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i24441733<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): VIDAL CLÉMENT<br>
Abstract: Philosophy lacks criteria to evaluate its philosophical theories. To fill this gap, this essay introduces nine criteria to compare worldviews, classified in three broad categories: objective criteria (objective consistency, scientificity, scope), subjective criteria (subjective consistency, personal utility, emotionality), and intersubjective criteria (intersubjective consistency, collective utility, narrativity). The essay first defines what a worldview is and exposes the heuristic used in the quest for criteria. After describing each criterion individually, it shows what happens when each of them is violated. From the criteria, it derives assessment tests to compare and improve different worldviews. These include the is-ought, ought-act, and is-act first-order tests; the critical and dialectical second-order tests; the mixed-questions and first-second-order third-order tests; and the we-I, we-it, and it-I tests. The essay then applies these criteria and tests to a concrete example, comparing the Flying Spaghetti Monster deity with Intelligent Design. For another application, it draws more general fruitful suggestions for the dialogue between science and religion.<br>

Abstract: Les monuments voués à la guerre abondent en Russie, comme dans de nombreux autres pays. Ils font partie du paysage, tout en le caractérisant. Ces monuments font appel au passé et aux souvenirs. Ce faisant, ils définissent l'appartenance. Et tout en remémorant le passé, ils cherchent également à déterminer l'avenir. Le fait de se souvenir d'une guerre est un acte politique en soi. On se souvient, et en se souvenant on se définit au sein de sa communauté, de son pays et du monde. À tout le moins, c'est le cas dans l'Europe de l'Est et la Russie. Le territoire a été envahi maintes fois au cours des derniers siècles et cela a entrainé le développement d'une mémoire sélective, une « curation » de la nation. Nous étudions ici les souvenirs de la Russie afin de démontrer comment les monuments et les musées de guerre définissent non seulement le passé, mais également le présent et les rêves que l'on forge pour l'avenir. War monuments are abundant in Russia; they are part of the landscape, while defining the terrain. Calling to the past and bringing forth memories, they define belonging, commemorating the past while shaping the future. Remembering a war is a political act and, in remembering, we define our place in our community, country and the world. Such is the case in Eastern Europe and Russia whose territories have been invaded many times over the centuries, which has led to development of a selective memory, the "curation" of the nation. This article explores memories of Russia to demonstrate how monuments and museums of war define the past, present and dreams for the future.<br>

Publisher: ARMAND COLIN<br>

Date: 6 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): SEIGNAN Gérard<br>
Abstract: Au début du XIXe siècle, la philosophie de l'âme fournit des arguments aux psychologues qui, à la fin de ce siècle, réfléchissent sur les faits de conscience. Ils mettent alors en évidence les caractéristiques psychophysiologiques de l' « effort volontaire », force psychique qu'ils insèrent dans une phénoménologie de l'agir. Dans la première moitié du XXe siècle, de nouveaux discours reformulent la trame conceptuelle élaborée au siècle précédent et les psychologues, attentifs aux procédures adaptatives de l'énergétique humaine, livrent un autre mode de lisibilité de l'effort quand celui-ci représente, avant tout, un combat pour (sur)vivre. Early 19th-century philosophy of the mind or soul would provide arguments for psychologists who, at the end of this century, inquired into the facts of consciousness. They in turn highlighted the psychophysiologic characteristics of « voluntary effort », a psychic force that they placed within a phenomenology of the act. In the first half of the 20th century new discourses reformulated the elaborate conceptual framework of the previous century, and the psychologists attentive to the adaptive procedure of human energetics, offered a different reading of what effort means when it represents above all a struggle for survival.<br>

Publisher: Wiley Periodicals, Inc.<br>
Issue: i24542986<br>
Date: 10 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Grethlein Jonas<br>
Abstract: This book examines Greek engagements with the past as articulations of memory formulated against the contingency of chance associated with temporality. Based on a phenomenological understanding of temporality, it identifies four memorializing strategies: continuity (tradition), regularity (exemplarity), development, and acceptance of chance. This framework serves in pursuing a twofold aim: to reconstruct the literary field of memory in fifth-century BCE Greece; and to interpret Greek historiography as a memorializing mode. The key contention advanced by this approach is that acts of memory entailed an "idea of history" that was articulated not only in historiography, but also in epinician poetry, elegy, tragedy, and oratory. The book offers a rich account of poetic conventions and contexts through which each of these genres counterbalanced contingency through the use of exemplary and traditional modes of memory. This fine analysis highlights the grip of the present on the past as a significant feature of both historiographical and nonhistoriographical genres. The essay argues that this work fills a disciplinary gap by extending the reflection on memory to a new period, Greek antiquity. The retrospective positioning of this period at the outset of Western historical thought brings Grethlein's investigation to the center of debates about memory, temporality, and the meaning history. In engaging with the book's argument, the essay suggests that historiographical memory emerged in Greece not as a first-order encounter with time, but as a second-order encounter with forgetting. This confrontation marked a certain separation of historiography from other memorializing genres. Whereas poetic and rhetorical memories were posited against contingency, historiography sought to retrieve those aspects of the past that may otherwise have been irretrievably lost and forgotten. In doing so, it formulated the historiographical imperative as a negation of forgetting that problematized~<br>

Abstract: This essay looks at how Ricoeur's hermeneutics functions as both philosophy of translation and philosophy as translation. It starts with a overview of Ricoeur's theories in the light of the history of the philosophy of translation and shows how he, following in the footsteps of Gadamer, understands the act of translation as an art of negotiating and mediating between Self and Other. It then goes on to explore the hermeneutic model of translation, advanced in Ricoeur's later work, in terms of three main paradigms: linguistic, ontological and ethical. The essay concludes with a discussion of the crucial role played by translation in hospitality, pluralism and pardon.<br>

Abstract: In this context, Dooyeweerd's reading of Stoker seems misleading. When Stoker suggests
that his concept of substance gives a better expression to "the autonomous being and value of
the cosmos with respect to God" {die eien zijn en die eienwaarde van die kosmos teenover God),
Dooyeweerd fears that the radical biblical view of the dependence of all creation upon God is
somehow being threatened (NC, III, 71). But this overlooks precisely the point Stoker is
affirming: namely, the real difference instituted between the Creator and His creation by the
very act of creating. Accordingly, creation is not self-sufficient; but it is not nothing; it is
something. (Cf. Zigterman, op.cit., pp. 129,132,136.)<br>

Abstract: There is a certain order here: character is a set of dispositions at the level of the act-
structure; temperament is the ensemble of dispositions that is anchored in the psychical sub-
strncture; typical tendencies in motor behaviourand bodily expression are related to the biotic
and physical substnicture. It is interesting that the distinction between character and tem-
perament, after having become obsolete at the end of the fifties and after decades of absence
in the scientific literatnre on personality and personality development, has re-emerged some
15 years ago and has begnn a second life.<br>

Author(s): Glas Gerrit<br>
Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: Auch wenn vielerorts von der Vernachlässigung der Kirchengeschichte im Religionsunterricht gesprochen und ein mangelndes Geschichtsbewusstsein beklagt wird, sind Schülerinnen und Schüler durchaus für Geschichte und auch Kirchengeschichte ansprechbar. Die Herausforderung besteht heute jedoch darin, sie dazu zu befähigen, mit dem Wissen über Geschichte umzugehen, ihr Leben mit Geschichte sinnbringend und verantwortungsvoll zu gestalten. Gerade hierfür stellt die jüdisch-christliche Tradition wertvolle Ressourcen bereit. Ausgehend von der jüdisch-christlichen Tradition und im Diskurs mit der Geschichtsphilosophie möchte ich dazu anregen, mit Schülerinnen und Schülern im Religionsunterricht eine Form des Eingedenkens in der Perspektive der Hoffung zu entwickeln. Hierbei wird eine Gedächtnishaltung intendiert, die nicht in der Idee einer reinen Fortschrittsgeschichte aufgeht, sondern zurückblickt, sich den Tiefen und Ambivalenzen vergangenen Leids stellt und die Toten in die Vision einer besseren Gesellschaft einbezieht. Dabei bleibt das Gedächtnis stets dem Leben und der Zukunft zugewandt und gibt ethische Impulse für die Gegenwart. Gerade im Religionsunterricht können Schülerinnen und Schüler befähigt werden, zu „Redenden und Handelnden“ der Geschichte zu werden, auch indem der Frage Raum gegeben wird, woraus Kraft für Erinnerungsarbeit geschöpft werden kann und welche Hoffnungsperspektiven bestehen. Even if neglect of Church History in Religious Education is widely criticised and complaints are heard about a lack of historical consciousness, pupils -female and male – are often found to be quite open to history and church history. The challenge today consists in helping them to deal with their knowledge of history, to create a relationship, or life, with history in a way that makes sense and is actually responsible. For this purpose the Jewish-Christian tradition offers valuable resources. Based on the Jewish-Christian tradition, and in discourse with the philosophy of~<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to discuss rival views of business and business ethics in terms of narrative. I want to show that we can tell various stories about business, and that our worldview narratives shape our accounts of business. These narratives not only involve description, but contain normative ramifications. We can only act within the world that we perceive. To evaluate competing narratives, I suggest dialectical comparison of the narratives with important values. The second part of the paper discusses five distinct genres of worldview narratives and their implications for business: homo economicus, libertarian, conservative, liberal, and religio-philosophical.<br>

Abstract: On September 11, 2001, the passengers and crew members aboard Flight 93 responded to the hijacking of their airplane by organizing a counterattack against the hijackers. The airplane crashed into an unpopulated field, causing no damage to human lives or national landmarks beyond the lives of those aboard the airplane. We draw on this story of courageous collective action to explore the question of what makes this kind of action possible. We propose that to take courageous collective action, people need three narratives-a personal narrative that helps them understand who they are beyond the immediate situation and manage the intense emotions that accompany duress, a narrative that explains the duress that has been imposed upon them sufficiently to make moral and practical judgments about how to act, and a narrative of collective action-and the resources that make the creation of these narratives feasible. We also consider how the creation of these narratives is relevant to courageous collective action in more common organizational circumstances, and identify how this analysis suggests new insights into our understanding of the core framing tasks of social movements, ways in which social movement actors draw on social infrastructure, the role of discourse and morality in social movements, the formation of collective identity, and resource mobilization.<br>

Abstract: La réflexion offerte dans cet essai s'inscrit dans une entreprise d'approfondissement de la compréhension générale que nous avons de l'activité politique (parler, écrire, revendiquer, mettre en scène), et particulièrement de la relation que cette activité entretient avec l'idée de l'émancipation. Plus précisément, il s'agit de prendre pour objet d'exploration théorique le fait de parole, défini en termes d'articulation performative des espaces-temps humains, et d'en faire le paradigme de toute action politique. L'analyse de ce paradigme, au terme, permettra de pointer vers une matière utopique qui se qualifie à la fois comme événement et comme permanence du commun. /// In this article, the author seeks a better understanding of the modalities of political action (speaking, writing, claming, staging), and more specifically of the relation between political action and the idea of emancipation. To do so, the author proposes that the speech act, comprehended as the performed articulation of lived space/time, is to be taken as the paradigm of political action. Further analysis of this paradigm, as developed in the article, compels the manifestation of a philosophical object which qualifies both as event and as the manifestation of the perennially of the common.<br>

Article Title: Mathematics and Mathematics Education as Triadic Communication? A Semiotic Framework Exemplified<br>
Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i25472056<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Ongstad Sigmund<br>
Abstract: The article investigates in the first part critically dyadic and essentialist understanding of signs and utterances in mathematics and mathematics education as opposed to a triadic view. However even Peircean semiotics, giving priority to triadic, dynamic sign may face challenges, such as explaining the sign as a pragmatic act and how signs are related to context. To meet these and other hurdles an explicit communicational, pragmatic and triadic view, found in parts of the works of Bühler, Bakhtin, Habermas, and Halliday, is developed. Two basic principles are combined and established in a theoretical framework. Firstly, whenever uttering, there will exist in any semiotic sign system, dynamic reciprocity and simultaneity between expressing through form, referring to content, and addressing as an act. Secondly, meaning will be created by the dynamics between given and new in utterances and between utterances and contextual genres. The latter principle explains how meaning merge in communication dynamically and create the basis for a discursive understanding of semiosis and hence even learning at large. The second part exemplifies each of the three main aspects and the dynamics of utterance and genre and given and new by excerpts from a textbook in mathematics education. The concept 'positioning', in use for operationalisation, is explained in relation to main principles of the framework. The article ends focusing crucial implications for validation when moving from a dyadic to a triadic understanding of mathematics and mathematics education.<br>

Article Title: Success, Truth, and Modernism in Holocaust Historiography: Reading Saul Friedländer Thirty-Five Years after the Publication of "Metahistory"<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i25478832<br>
Date: 5 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Kansteiner Wulf<br>
Abstract: This essay provides a close reading of Saul Friedländer's exceptionally successful comprehensive history of the Holocaust from the theoretical perspective of Hayden White's philosophy of history. Friedländer's The Years of Extermination has been celebrated as the first synthetic history of the "Final Solution" that acknowledges the experiences of the victims of Nazi genocide. But Friedländer has not simply added the voices of the victims to a conventional historical account of the Holocaust. Instead, by displacing linear notions of time and space and subtly deconstructing conventional concepts of causality, he has invented a new type of historical prose that performs rather than analyzes the victims' point of view. Friedländer's innovation has particularly radical consequences for the construction of historical explanations. On the one hand, Friedländer explicitly argues that anti-Semitism was the single most important cause of the Holocaust. On the other hand, his transnational, multifaceted history of the "Final Solution" provides a wealth of data that escapes the conceptual grasp of his explicit model of causation. Friedländer chooses this radically self-reflexive strategy of historical representation to impress on the reader the existential sense of disbelief with which the victims experienced Nazi persecution. To Friedländer, that sense of disbelief constitutes the most appropriate ethical response to the Holocaust. Thus the narratological analysis of The Years of Extermination reveals that the exceptional quality of the book, as well as presumably its success, is the result of an extraordinarily creative act of narrative imagination. Or, put into terms developed by White, who shares Friedländer's appreciation of modernist forms of writing, The Years of Extermination is the first modernist history of the Holocaust that captures, through literary figuration, an important and long neglected reality of the "Final Solution."<br>

Abstract: Lerner's interpretation is that as a result of the Fall, "humanity, in this act of
acquiring a higher level of 'knowing,' assumes the burden of distinguishing between good
and evil and of choosing the good in order to be saved"; but so far as humanity's newly-won
knowledge is, in part, sexual knowledge, the burden falls more heavily on the woman,
because God forbids her the "free and open sexuality of the fertility-goddess," symbolized,
at the time Genesis was written, by the serpent (The Creation of Patriarchy [New York: Oxford
UP, 1986] 196-97).<br>

Abstract: Agamben on the function of the pronoun in medieval grammatical thought:
"Inasmuch as it contains both a particular mode of signification and an indicative act, the
pronoun is that part of speech in which the passage from signifying to demonstrating is
enacted: pure being, the substantia indeterminata that it signifies and that, as such, is not in
itself signifiable or definable, becomes signifiable and determinable through an act of 'indi-
cation'" (31/22).<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i25619787<br>
Date: 8 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Cody Francis<br>
Abstract: This essay examines how activists in rural southern India have sought to reshape the field of political communication by encouraging lower-caste women to submit written, signed petitions to district-level government offices, and so represent themselves to the state. I argue that contradictions between democratic recognition and the will to development that inhere to the political structure of contemporary governance in rural India correspond to tensions within the semiotic structure of signature itself, between constative representation and performative creation. Governmentality and the forms of communication that it requires often rest on the notion that written self-representation constitutes an act of political agency. But the limits of a governmental communicative reason that would conflate written subject and agent become especially clear in postcolonial contexts where the construction of those citizens that would be represented is in fact a product of the very act of representation. It is the narrative of development-as-pedagogy that holds out the promise of a future alignment of communicative frameworks, technologies, and participant roles, allowing for the transparent self-representation of an already-constituted citizen. By tracking the ambivalent experience of one group of women in particular, this account focuses on how the logic of signature as self-representation has served to recontextualize the marginality of petitioners as something within the state's broader field of power.<br>

in which Nietzsche (rightly) says, 'There are no facts, only interpretations.' By interpre-
tation, I mean here a conscious act of the mind which illustrates a certain code, certain
'rules' of interpretation" (5) ["Bien sur, je ne parle pas de l'interpretation dans son sens
general, a propos duquel Nietzsche dit (tres justement), Tl n'y a pas de faits, il n'y a que des
interpretations.' Par interpretation, j'entends ici un acte conscient de l'esprit qui illustre
un certain code, certaines 'regies' d'interpretation."]). L'interpretation du recit selon la
pensee chinoise qui est proposee ici s'entend dans le sens general du terme, comme lec-
ture possible, et non comme stricte grille hermeneutique.<br>

Abstract: Starting by the distinction made by Henrique Cláudio de Lima Vaz between the democratic ideal and real democracy, and to assume that we will only be able to build a true democratic community if we act within that same community as authentic persons, we defend in this article that being a person is constituted as a call to hope. We will divide the article into three parts. In the first part, we will explain in what sense the personalism is constituted as an option for hope. Then we indicate what it means to be a person for Lima Vaz. Finally, we show how we can become a person and what are the difficulties to this accomplishment. Only when we exist as authentical people we will be able to establish the right relationship between the democratic ideal and real democracy.<br>

Abstract: From the perspective of Gabriel Marcel’s juvenile writings, most notably
         Fragments Philosophiques(1909-1914) andJournal Métaphysique(1914-1923), this study discuss the first theoretical statute of the experience of God. This reflexive movement, strictly speaking, phenomenological-existential is based (as background) on the critique of absolute knowledge (modern idealism and scientism) which, according to Marcel, is an unavoidable contradiction: at the same time, it affirms the being, it denies the being. What draws attention is the fact that such explanatory model is transposed and, therefore, applied using the classical formulation of the so-called problem of the existence of God, of which theodicy has one of the most eloquent and emblematic metaphysical discourses. For the young French thinker, God cannot be verified or justified as an ontological proof: God is the Inverifiable Absolute, since it has to be experienced in the act of faith, in the expression of love and grace.<br>

Abstract: Dans le cadre du séminaire Bonheur et Travail qui a débouché sur une enquête de l'Insee, Céline Bessière et Frédérique Houseaux ont pu « suivre des enquêteurs » et tirer de leurs observations de terrain quelques conclusions sur la production de données statistiques. Une passation mouvementée du questionnaire auprès d'un salariéagricole agricole montre l'importance de la situation d'enquête ainsi que celle des malentendus sur les mots utilisés. Les auteurs proposent de s'appuyer sur ces «ratés» de la relation d'enquête pour mettre en lumière le rôle souvent oublié de l'enquêteur. Elles suggèrent enfin de rapprocher enquêteurs et concepteurs et d'utiliser les données produites en gardant à l'esprit le travail de traduction qui a présidé à leur fabrication. Christian Baudelot et Michel Gollac en tirent la conclusion qu'il faut «faire avec» et refusent de renoncer aux gains de connaissance qu'apportent les enquêtes statistiques. Ils plaident qu'à condition de ne pas s'y enfermer, on peut les utiliser pour combattre l'ethnocentrisme même qui a pu présider à leur recueil. Florence Weber s'interroge sur la nature de l'interaction entre enquêteur Insee et enquêté: «relation anonyme et formulaire d'enquête» se conjuguent pour la rapprocher des relations qu'entretiennent d'autres agents subalternes de l'État avec les administrés. En jouant sur la nature des questions posées, on déplace simplement le lieu où se produisent les malentendus, à la fois instructifs et constructifs. Enfin, Alain Desrosières se demande «à quoi sert une enquête». Si les mêmes critiques, formulées depuis des décennies, n'ont jamais fait obstacle à la répétition des enquêtes statistiques, c'est que leur enjeu n'est pas seulement cognitif mais aussi politique. Il faut donc restituer la visée d'usage des enquêtes et les moyens sociaux des produits et des énoncés statistiques. Within the scope of the Happiness and Work seminar that led to an Insee survey, Céline Bessière and Frédérique Houseaux were able t~<br>

Abstract: Albert Camus's political philosophy of rebellion and limits is ultimately grounded in an aesthetic theory, which in turn is dependent on a broader understanding of the nature of symbols. In his essays and notes. Camus develops a theory of symbols in which he insists that human beings are symbolic creatures and that human experience and symbolization are interdependent realities. Camus felt that art, in particular the philosophical novel, played a significant role in the rearticulation of symbols. The basis of the recollection or the creation of symbols is the consciousness of the community, particularly the shared consciousness of the human condition. Symbols act as mediations between the empirical world and the world of imagination. They are not literal descriptions of that empirical reality, nor are they simply flights of fancy. Symbols are necessarily bound and free. So, too, Camus argues, must be the politics on which they are based.<br>

Abstract: This paper argues against causalism about reasons in three stages. First, the paper investigates Professor Davidson's sophisticated version of the claim that we must understand reason-explanations as a kind of causal explanation to highlight the fact that this move does no explanatory work in telling us how we determine for which reasons we act. Second, the paper considers Davidson's true motivation for regarding reasons-explanations as causal which connects with his claim that reasons are causes. He advocates anomalous monism in order to solve the mysterious connection problem. In assessing his proposed solution to this problem, the paper examines his `extension reply' to the charge that his token identity theory ultimately results in epiphenomenalism. The paper argues that only a reading of this reply makes for a stable anomalous monism but for this reason Davidson's compatiblist metaphysics is unfit for the task of solving the mysterious connection problem. Given that reductive accounts are incompatible with the special features of reasons explanations, the paper concludes that we must reverse the orthodoxy once again and eschew causalism about reasons and reason-explanations. Finally, the paper considers a possible way of recasting our understanding of causation so that the mysterious connection problem disappears.<br>

Abstract: The article focuses on autobiographical reflection in relation to the subjective interpretation of contemporary history in written and edited autobiographies. It initially assumes that autobiographical writing and its interpretation are a sociocommunicative act as addressed to an "implied reader". Autobiographies therefore need to be observed from the perspective of the contemporary background. Against the background of literary criticism which questions the principles of the autobiographical genre, the described sociological assumption is theoretically disputed and related to history and memory building. Thus the article asks how contemporary history is constructed within a narrative and shaped by individual experiences in terms of temporary discourse. From this perspective, autobiographies are a result of contemporary history merging with the authors' personal viewpoints.<br>

Publisher: Irish University Review<br>

Date: 12 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Lin Yu-chen<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the drama of selfhood and the attendant problem of ethics in Brian Friel's Faith Healer. Drawing from the tenets of Freudian psychoanalysis, I scrutinize the protagonist's narrative identity through fissures created by the discrepancy between his story and the other two characters' versions. These crevices register the protagonist's post-traumatic affects for an uncanny home, which, intertwined with his equally uncanny talent to become the place of trauma, compels him to return time and again instead of acknowledging its loss. Symptomatically, in his fixation on an uncanny home in order to disavow its loss, the protagonist sutures his privation, to such an extent that he not only bars memory exchange with other characters, but appropriates them into a master narrative. Given the fact that the three characters' stories are addressed to invisible auditors who converge with the play's actual audience, the healer's final act of authority is limited as long as it is subject to the audience's interpretation of his memory narrative. In its appeal to the audience's decision on ethical justice for the healer's narrative imagination among multiple proposals, this play is an exercise of poetical ethics of memory.<br>

Author(s): Gordon Peter Eli<br>
Abstract: Habermas eloquently summarizes Cassirer's view: "The position of human being
in the world is defined by a form-giving power which transforms sense impressions into
meaningful structures. Human beings master the forces of nature which rush in upon them
through symbols which spring from the productive imagination. Thus they gain a distance
from the immediate pressure of nature. Of course, they pay for this emancipation with their
mental dependence on a semanticized nature, which returns in the spellbindingforce of myth-
ical images. That first act of distantiation must therefore be repeated in the course of cultural
development."<br>

Author(s): Wogenstein Sebastian<br>
Abstract: The question how to situate Dea Loher's drama Manhattan Medea in the Medea reception serves as a point of departure for a discussion of imitation, originality, and the act of copying. In their dialogues, the characters Medea, as in Euripides' tragedy a refugee, and Velazquez, a security guard, reflect on originality and imitation. The article explores the theoretical and self-referential aspects evoked by these discussions and links them with a more general inquiry into the dimensions of interpretation in the arts. The question of originality and appropriation is expanded and problematized through focusing on radical social criticism voiced among others by the drag queen Deaf Daisy. In this context the article also examines the potential of performative signification encountered in Medea's deadly bridal gift, especially in light of Marjorie Garber's remark that "[w]hat gets married is a dress." Transgressive in its form too, Manhattan Medea combines tragic elements and those characteristic of comedy.<br>

Publisher: University of Alberta<br>
Issue: i275834<br>
Date: 4 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Zola Tanya<br>
Abstract: This paper does not intend to empirically establish whether Disability Studies is old or new; instead, it aims to uncover what the gloss "new" means in relation to mainstream sociology's rejection of such a claim and the repetitive articulation of it by Disability Studies. Conceptions of disability found in traditional sociological studies of disability-as-deviance are explored, turning first to the work of Goffman and then to a mainstream deviance text book. The paper then uncovers the values and assumptions that lie behind the social act of conceiving Disability Studies as a "new" field of inquiry. Thus, "new" is symbolic of an affirmation of inquiry into ablebodiedness as itself a culture in need of critical engagement. It is also a way to articulate the standpoint of disability as a means to provoke such inquiry. Further, "new" is a rhetorical device to highlight that many Disability Studies researchers are now challenging the mainstream approaches to the study of disability. /// Le but de cet article n'est pas d'établir empiriquement si les études de la condition des personnes handicapées ("Disability Studies") constituent un nouveau ou un vieux champ de recherche. Plutôt, cet article examine la signification du mot "nouveau" dans le contexte de la discussion de l'incapacité dans la sociologie contemporaine. Bien que la sociologie traditionnelle refuse de reconnaître que "Disability Studies" constitue une spécialisation nouvelle, les chercheurs dans ce domaine soulignent que le sujet est nouveau. Cet article examine alors les conceptions de l'incapacité trouvées dans les études traditionnelles, études où l'incapacité est comprise en tant que déviance. D'abord on examine la recherche de Goffman et l'analyse de l'incapacité présentée dans un des manuels standards sur la déviance. Ensuite, cet article découvre les valeurs et les suppositions qui se trouvent derrière l'acte social de concevoir "Disability Studies" comme un "nouveau" champ de recherche. Ainsi, on vo~<br>

Abstract: "Forgetting" plays an important role in the lives of individuals and communities. Although a few Holocaust scholars have begun to take forgetting more seriously in relation to the task of remembering--in popular parlance as well as in academic discourse on the Holocaust--forgetting is usually perceived as a negative force. In the decades following 1945, the terms remembering and forgetting have often been used antithetically, with the communities of victims insisting on the duty to remember and a society of perpetrators desiring to forget. Thus, the discourse on Holocaust memory has become entrenched on this issue. This essay counters the swift rejection of forgetting and its labeling as a reprehensible act. It calls attention to two issues: first, it offers a critical argument for different forms of forgetting; second, it concludes with suggestions of how deliberate performative practices of forgetting might benefit communities affected by a genocidal past. Is it possible to conceive of forgetting not as the ugly twin of remembering but as its necessary companion?<br>

Abstract: During the German Kaiserreich, urban expansion and social segregation fostered new mechanisms of indirect and delegated gift-exchange in which the mediations between donors and recipients became increasingly important. In urban societies, mediators were in greater demand than ever before to act as System builders in forging connections between civil society, the municipality, and the State, coordinating private philanthropic initiatives and institutionalizing the resources available for patronage. This paper draws on theories of gift exchange and of social recognition in order to overcome the false dichotomy of interest v. morality in philanthropic action. The cases of failed patrons, competing mediators of culture and disregarded outsiders may illustrate why the history of philanthropy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries cannot simply be regarded as a success story of middle-class civil society.<br>

Issue: i40014414<br>
Date: 12 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Morujão Alexandre Fradique<br>
Abstract: O sentido da intersubjectividade em Marcel liga-se à intenção de "restituir à experiência humana o seu peso ontológico", o que obriga à recusa do racionalismo contemporaneo, caracterizado pelos principios de inerencia e de objectividade, adoptando uma epistemologia pluralista e relativista em que o universal se degrada em colectivo e o necessário em repetível. O conhecimento válido para todos reduz-se ao verificável, tudo o mais é apenas objecto de crença, da ordem do subjectivo. Esta concepção situa-se no ambito do problemático, isto é, do objectivo, do posto completamente em face de mim. O mundo actual situa-se a esse nivel, corresponde à esfera do ter e a análise desse mundo mostra que ha na experiéncia humana como tal aspectos que transcendem o problemático, pertencendo ao dominio do mistério, que diz respeito à esfera do ser. Para, alcançar o que Marcel designa por mistério ontólogico analisamse, fora do registo lógico, certos dados propriamente espirituais, como a fidelidade, o amor, a esperança, que nos conduzem a um eu, subjectividade livre, que é experimentado com referencia a um tu. O compromisso entre eu e tu traduz-se em disponibilidade e apelo e estabelece uma relagao que é o nós, um co-esse, uma intimidade espiritual. Dentro da economia do pensamento marceliano ever é conceder crédito a um tu. No limite, se o tu for absolute, o credito deverá ser também absoluto. O tu absoluto, Deus, é existente suprapessoal e nunca pode ser tratado como objecto e, portanto, demonstrado, mas está presente à invocação. Afim da crença temos a esperanga que, no significado auténtico, se situa num contexto de provação. Distingue-se do optimismo e do desejo, transcende toda a técnica, não se desenvolve sobre um saber. É própria dos seres desarmados e nisso reside, misteriosamente, a sua eficácia. Consiste num esperar em, experiéncia absoluta no piano do mistério e certeza de transcender o que se encontra em perigo na provação, e participação numa realidade absoluta que me e~<br>

Abstract: Com este texto o autor procura uma resposta para a seguinte pergunta: "Que tipo de método poderá confirmar ou infirmar a hipótese segundo a qual o acto educativo é, no seu núcleo e na sua origem entitativa, confrontação violenta entre duas consciências?". Depois de esclarecer que esta hipótese inter-pretativa da educação tem em mira, não explicar ou descrever a realidade educacional na sua positividade, mas compreender o seu eidos ou essência constitutiva, o autor decide-se, na esteira de Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Duméry, Dufrenne, Levinas e Derrida, pelo método fenomenológico. Para efectuar a exploração filosófica que essa pergunta impõe, o método instituído por Husserl faculta, ao invés dos métodos positivistas e analíticos, uma visão global do fenómeno educativo numa intuição que se atinge depois de realizada uma redução eidética. Além disso, o método fenomenológico é entendido como o mais adequado para desvelar uma realidade cuja textura é tecida por relações intersubjectivas. Todo o texto desenvolve uma sequência argumentativa tendente a mostrar e a demonstrar quer a natureza, quer as potencialidades heurísticas do método fenomenológico aplicado à educação. Só este método poderá evidenciar a estrutura universal e necessária da educação: uma relação violenta entre duas consciências. /// Dans son texte l'auteur cherche une réponse pour la question suivante: "que type de méthode pourra confirmer ou infirmer l'hypothèse selon laquelle l'acte éducatif est en son centre et en son origine confrontation violente entre deux consciences"?

Abstract: Partindo de alguns pressupostos que explicitam a questão nuclear da "instância do sujeito" na obra de Ricoeur (anteriores ou contemporâneos ao debate com o estruturalismo), e que tipificam a via filosófica ricoeuriana, e partindo também da articulação axial do pensamento de Lévi-Strauss (relacionada com esse debate), são depois propostos os tópicos dessa controvérsia. Tais tópicos, que se desenvolvem em torno dos elementos já considerados, gravitam à volta da inteligibilidade do sentido e do sentido da inteligibilidade, da complementaridade dos métodos, e dos níveis semiológico e semântico, este último estabelecido mediante a pregnância da frase na linguagem, e da palavra (mot) como operador entre a estrutura e o acontecimento. /// La présente analyse commence par mettre en relief quelques présupposés qui explicitent la question nucléaire de "l'instance du sajet" dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur (présupposés antérieurs ou contemporains du débat avec le structuralisme) et qui caractérisent le chemin philosophique de celui-ci; on prend également pour point de départ l'articulation centrale de la pensée de Lévi-Strauss relative à ce débat, afin de proposer ensuite les lignes mai-tresses de cette controverse. Ces lignes maitresses, qui se développent autour des éléments déjà mentionnés, gravitent autour de l'intelligibilité du sens et du sens de l'intelligibilité, de la complémentarité des méthodes et des niveaux sémiologique et sémantique, en établissant ce dernier niveau par le biais de la prégnance de la phrase dans le langage, et du mot comme opérateur entre la structure et l'événement. /// After presenting the presuppositions which underlie a question which is central to Ricoeur's work, "the subject as act, as instance", and which exemplify Ricoeur's way of doing philosophy, as well as presenting Lévi-Strauss' thought concerning this question, the article proposes the fundamental topics which define the controversy.

Author(s): da Veiga Manuel Alte<br>
Abstract: Na la meditação «em que se pretende não falar de valor», o autor esforça-se por manter um discurso linear sobre o interesse humano de pensar e agir relativamente a um tema tão fundamental, que parece quase impossivel evitar a «petitio principii». Pode-se sintetizar a primeira meditação nestas duas alíneas: (a) O desejo de felicidade é o grande motor da busca de meios para uma vida sempre melhor; (b) O ser humano estrutura a sua ideia de felicidade, vida, meios adequados, objectivos de graus diversos, em função dos conhecimentos de que disōpe. A 2 a meditação reconhece que a neutralidade de discurso da 1a meditação não teve éxito. As palavras são extremamente analógicas e pressupōem um «pensamento e discurso ocultos» , coniventes com o conceito de valor, que se pretendia evitar. O desejo de plenitude da qualidade de vida implica o acto, por vezes inconsciente, de valorização. /// The 1.st meditation aims to maintain a discourse independent of the concept of value. Like in an « Impossible mission», we face a project that easily forces the adventurer to return over his lost pathways in a desert. I. e., falling in a «petitio principii». The result of that l. st meditation could be synthesized as it follows: (a) The desire of hapiness is what forces us to search a better and better quality of life; (b) Human beings structure their idea of hapiness. life, adequate means to various kinds of objectives, according to their available knowledge. The 2. nd meditation recognizes the failure of the searched neutral discourse in the l. st meditation: its words and concepts exemplify a very deep analogy and reveal an occult system of thought and discourse, where the notion of value is unmistakably implicated. The desire of a quality of life in all its richness implies, although some times unconsciously, the act of evaluation.<br>

Abstract: For over twenty years, Richard Kearney has insisted that theology must not follow traditional metaphysical itineraries along paths that offer perspectives on God as Being Itself, or as Pure Act, or as causa sui. Instead, it should chart avenues that lead through the poetics of imagination, past the synthesizing dynamics of narrative, and toward the destination of God as a God that privileges potentiality over actuality. In constant dialogue with deconstructive and postmodern theories, Kearney has developed an "onto-eschatological hermeneutics" of the "God Who May Be" that presents a post--metaphysical, perhaps even more biblical, interpretation of God as divine possibility. This paper investigates Kearney's "onto-eschatological" poetics of God as it relates to his imaginative theological method and to the Pauline notion of kenosis as the risk of divine love. It concludes by associating Kearney's theopoetics with Kierkegaard's idea of repetition as a cipher for understanding the kinetics of the God Who May be as an alternative to the traditional metaphysical structures of God as a static "I Am Who I Am." /// Desde há mais de vinte anos que Richard Kearney vem insistindo em que a teologia deveria deixar de seguir os itinerdrios metafísicos tradicionais, ou seja, deveria deixar para trás os caminhos metafísicos que oferecem perspectivas sobre Deus enquanto Ser-mesmo, Acto Puro, ou causa sui. Em vez disso, a teologia deveria antes seguir caminhos orientados por uma poética da imaginação, para além da dinâmica sintetizadora da narrativa e em direcção a uma noção de Deus que privilegia a potencialidade sobre a actualidade. Num diálogo constante com as teorias desconstructoras e pós-modernas, Richard Kearney desenvolveu uma "hermenêutica ôntico-escatológica" do "Deus que pode ser", hermenêutica essa que nos oferece uma interpretação pós-metafísica, talvez mesmo mais bíblica, de Deus como divina possibilidade.

Abstract: Partindo do princípio judaico-cristão de que Deus, Ser supremo, criou todas as coisas a partir do nada mediante um acto livre de amor (creatio ex nihilo), o artigo mostra como Santo Agostinho defende que no universo físico, criado e governado por Deus, não há espaço para a desordem ou imperfeição (o mal), mas que a natureza é perfeitamente ordenada e harmoniosa, não havendo, portanto, senão o bem. Desta forma, mostra-se de que modo para Santo Agostinho, existir, ser e Bem são sinónimos. Por outro lado, mostra-se também que o mal físico, ou a imperfeição no universo, não passa de uma ausência ou privação do Bem, que acontece não como ser, mas como não-ser. /// Starting with the Judeo-Christian principle that God, the supreme Being, has created all things from nothing (creatio ex nihilo) by means of a free act of love, the article shows how Saint Augustine defends that in the physical universe, created and governed by God, there is no room for disorderliness or imperfection (evil), but that nature is perfectly ordered and harmonious. Indeed, for Augustine, there exists only the good, so that for him to exist, being and the good are synonymous. On the other hand, the article also shows that physical evil, or the imperfection in the universe, is nothing more than an absence or a privation of the Good, which happens not as being but rather as no-being.<br>

En tanto expresión de la cultura, resultado histórico de la vida social, la ciudad es comparada con la lengua, planteándose en ambos casos el peso relativo del poder político en su constitución y en las hablas o prácticas que propician. La competencia ciudadana indica la capacidad de actuar con eficacia, abrirse camino en el laberinto de signos que la ciudad emite. La ciudad es múltiple y diversa, y propone distintos modos de percepción y apreciación. Da cuenta de la desigualdad social y, en algunos casos, es más explícita que el lenguaje, que a veces carece de palabras para designar aspectos de la vida social. El artículo está referido, sobre todo, a la ciudad de Buenos Aires. Se examinan también aspectos vinculados con la vida urbana en el plano de los espacios de interacción. Se señala que la ciudad ha ido perdiendo condiciones que la tornaban humana y habitable. Fue evolucionando hacia una mayor inseguridad y ello, junto con el desarrollo massmediático y la reducción de espacios públicos propicios, ha contribuido al aislamiento de sus habitantes y la disminución progresiva de la interacción y la participación. Estos aspectos tienen relación con las formas de representación política y la erosión de la condición de ciudadanía. En la última parte (poscriptum) se da cuenta de aspectos de la actual crisis política y económica que, sobre todo a partir de finales del año 2001, han producido una transformación en muchos aspectos de la vida urbana. En especial se observa un cambio notable en las formas de interrelación y uso de los espacios públicos junto con una intensificación de las formas de interpelación, de participación en la vida política y del protagonismo de los habi~<br>

Abstract: En este texto, el autor intenta esclarecer determinados aspectos del imaginario en relación con el Estado, la política, pero también en relación con la violencia y el mal, en un contexto en el que la dialéctica de la identidad y de la alteridad sigue siendo una de las estructuras del imaginario. El imaginario, más allá del ámbito exclusivo de las representaciones, actúa sobre el mundo y sobre la evolución de la historia. Pero el mundo también actúa sobre el imaginario y son los períodos de crisis los que amplían sus manifestaciones, destinadas a "a servir de pantalla contra los temores". En este sentido, la violencia, frente a la cual cabe adoptar actitudes diferentes, se convierte en un elemento simbólico para interpretar nuestras fuerzas. ¿Hasta qué punto estamos presenciando un nuevo modo de funcionamiento de los imaginarios políticos y religiosos? Para responder a esta pregunta, el autor habla de esperanza intercultural "en un mundo donde las voluntades de poder de lo trágico interfieren en los impulsos de lo comunicacional". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles. Imaginarles, beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history. But, the world also acts on imaginarles, and it is the periods of crisis that enlarge their manifestations, destined to "serve as a screen against fears." In this sense, violence, in the face of which different attitudes can be adopted, becomes a symbolic element for interpreting our strengths. To what extent are we witnessing a new way of functioning of political and religious imaginarles? To answer this question, the author discusses intercultural hope "in a world in which the will of the power of the tragic interferes with communicational impulses."<br>

Abstract: L'auteur tente dans ce texte d'éclaircir certains aspects de l'imaginaire en relation avec l'Etat, la politique, mais aussi avec la violence et le mal, dans un contexte où la dialectique de l'identité et de l'altérité reste l'une des structures de l'imaginaire. L'imaginaire, débordant le champ exclusif des représentations, agit sur le monde et sur le mouvement de l'histoire. Mais le monde agit aussi sur l'imaginaire et ce sont les périodes de crise qui amplifient ses manifestations, appelées à "faire écran contre les peurs". C'est dans ce sens que la violence, face à laquelle différentes attitudes sont possibles, devient un élément symbolique pour interpréter nos forces. Jusqu'à quel point est-on en train d'assister à un nouveau mode de fonctionnement des imaginaires politiques et religieux ? Pour répondre à cette question l'auteur parle d'espérance interculturelle "dans un monde où les volontés de puissance du tragique brouillent les élans du communicationnel". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles.

Abstract: Après les nombreuses tentatives menées par les sociologues pour élaborer une analyse permettant de saisir la relation dialectique de la structure sociale et des acteurs A. Giddens propose une « théorie générale » centrée sur la notion de « structuration » . Le postulat fondamental de sa théorie se constitue autour de la notion de « dualité de structure » , en référence à la nature recursive des pratiques sociales. Selon cette thèse, les systèmes sociaux sont produits par des acteurs, qui par leurs activités mêmes contribuent à la constitution et à la reconstruction permanente de ces mêmes systèmes de rapports sociaux. Les agents et les structures ne sont pas considérés comme indépendants, ils se lient dans une relation mutuelle complexe et complémentaire. After the numerous attempts on the part of sociologists to elaborate a theoretical approach that incorporates the duality of structure and human agency, A. Giddens proposes a « general theory » focused on the notion of « structuration ». Rather than seeing action and structure as oppositions within a dualism, he suggests to regard them as the complementary terms of the duality of structure. Every act of production is at the same time an act of reproduction : the structures that render an action possible are, in the performance ofthat action, reproduced.<br>

Abstract: In this paper a distinction is made between two conceptions of the ego in freudian metapsychology. According to the first conception, a conception which Freud never gave up, the ego is conceived as a specific function on the surface of the living organism ; it is the result of a progressive differentiation of the Id ('Es') under the driving power of internal stimuli and external reality. Fitted with specific neutral, i.e. non-conflictual functions as perception, memory, control of the bodily motions and consciousness, the ego has to defend the individual as a biological living organism against the threats from without and within. In this conception the ego is treated as an instance that doesn't take part in the different psychic conflicts. We analyse the philosophical presuppositions and show the metapsychological disadvantages of this hypothesis that has been worked out especially in the American ego-psychology. According to the second conception, that takes into account important clinical pheno mena as identification, idealisation, narcissism, ideal of the ego, the ego is conceived as a metaphorical effect of a specific psychic act. With Lacan, we try to analyse and to interpret this specific act as an act that causes an infinite splitting in the ego : the ego is constituted as a subject that from its origin is separated from itself. Instead of being a biological function that lives in the immediate metonymical prolongiation of the living organism, it rather has to defend a certain representation of himself. This point of view doesn't exclude a purely functional description of the ego ; but the different functions have now to be interpreted differently because the ego is the effect of conflicts in which it takes part (consciousness is interlaced with unconsciousness, perception with denying...). In the last part of our study we show how Freud makes the philosophically important distinction between the ego as an object of the Id and the ego as a subject that has to~<br>

Author(s): Benoist Jocelyn<br>
Abstract: L'auteur met en évidence l'ambiguïté de la théorie phénoménologique de la négation telle qu'elle est soutenue par Husserl. Husserl hésite entre une conception de la négation comme acte et l'incorporation de la négation au sens lui-même : entre une conception illocutionnaire et une conception propositionnelle de la négation. En définitive, il choisit la seconde conception, mais en l'étendant au niveau infrapropositionnel (à la perception). L'auteur traite ce problème comme révélateur de l'ambiguïté de la philosophie phénoménologique, suspendue entre acte et sens, langage et perception. The author shows the ambiguity of the phenomenological theory of negation, such as it is held by Husserl. Husserl hesitates between a conception of negation as an act and of negation belonging to the meaning itself : that is, between an illocutionary and a propositional view of negation. Eventually, he chooses the later, but by extending it to the subpropositional level (i.e. to perception). The author takes this problem to be revealing of the ambiguity of phenomenological philosophy, standing between act and meaning, and between language and perception.<br>

Abstract: In When Species Meet (2008) Donna Haraway proposes that creatures' identities and affinities emerge through their encounters, their relationships. Following Haraway's lead, I attend to how different species sense and apprehend one another, leaving impressions—concrescences of perceptual data, or texture. This essay reports on fieldwork alongside marine biologists and with a population of cup corals (B. elegans) housed at the Long Marine Laboratory, Santa Cruz, California. While I assisted researchers who were studying metabolic rates and reproductive strategies in coral communities, these cup corals simultaneously taught me that being and sensing are inextricably enfolded. We were variously situated—corals generating generations, me interpretations. We met through a material-semiotic apparatus I call "fingeryeyes." As an act of sensuous manifesting, fingeryeyes offers a queer reading of how making sense and sensual meaning are produced through determinable and permeable species boundaries.<br>

Author(s): Raveneau Gilles<br>
Abstract: La plongée sous-marine en milieu naturel est une activité qui modifie l'équilibre et la perception du corps. Les plongeurs – souvent convaincus de pratiquer une activité sans danger – s'exposent pourtant à des risques potentiellement mortels. À partir d'une enquête ethnographique, l'auteur montre qu'en définitive ce sport laisse une place aux transgressions des normes où le risque est progressivement converti en sécurité. Cet arrangement implique d'acquérir la maîtrise des « techniques de neutralisation ­­» du risque, permettant aux plongeurs d'entretenir paradoxalement un système normatif, tout en le « violant ». Il apparaît ainsi que la transgression des normes de sécurité est moins un acte individuel qu'une conduite déterminée par l'organisation sociale de la plongée. Diving in a natural medium modifies the equilibrium and perception of the body. Divers — often convinced to practice a safe activity — expose themselves to potentially mortal risks. On the basis of an ethnographic survey the author shows that this sport leaves room for an infringement of norms where risk is progressively neutralized. This implies that divers master the neutralization techniques that enable them paradoxically to maintain a normative system and to violate it at the same time. Infringement of safety norms thus appears to be an individual act rather than a behaviour determined by the divers' social organization. Der Tauchsport in einem natürlichen Medium verändert das Equilibrium und die Wahrnehmung des Körpers. Die Taucher — die oft davon überzeugt sind, dass sie einen risikolosen Sport treiben — setzen sich potentiell tödlichen Risiken aus. Auf der Basis eiener ethnographischen Studie zeigt der Autor, dass dieser Sport Platz für eine Übertretung der Normen lässt, wo das Risiko allmählich neutralisiert wird. Dies setzt voraus, dass die Taucher die Neutralisationstechniken beherrschen, die sie paradoxerweise ermöglichen, ein normatives System zu erhalten und zur gleicher Zeit zu verletz~<br>

Abstract: Cet article examine le concept de la performativité du don dans une communauté côtière ethniquement diversifiée, composée majoritairement d'autochtones sames et de Norvégiens. Inspirée par Mauss puis par Ricœur, l'auteure avance l'idée que la pratique du don revêt une importance capitale dans ces territoires isolés et peut être vue comme facteur d'émergence d'un sentiment de communauté et d'identité. Le don devient un acte performatif de relations et d'ethnicité, et une manière d'aborder la situation postcoloniale dans la région. This article addresses the performativity of the gift in an ethnically mixed coastal community, the population being predominantly indigenous Saami and Norwegian. Taking inspiration from Mauss and later Ricœur, my argument is that giving is highly important in these remote areas and can be seen as a way of creating community as well as identity. The gift becomes an act of performing relations as well as ethnicity and a way of approaching the postcolonial situation in the region. Das Konzept der Performativität des Gebens innerhalb einer ethnisch gemischten Gemeinschaft (Norweger und Samen) an der Küste Norwegens steht im Mittelpunkt dieses Artikels. Inspiriert durch die Theorien von Mauss und Ricœur verfolgt der Autor die Idee, dass das Geben eine wichtige Funktion in isolierten Gemeinschaften übernimmt und zum Aufkommen eines Gefühls von Gemeinschaft und Identität beiträgt. Das Geben wird zu einem performativen Akt unter den Ethnien und zu einer Mittel mit der postkolonialen Situation der Region umzugehen. Artikkelen adresserer gavens performativitet i etniske sammensatte kystsamfunn bestående av samisk og norsk befolkning. Inspirert av Mauss og Ricœur blir det argumentert for at å gi gaver ; er viktig i disse samfunnene og kan ses som konstituerende i forhold til både fellesskap og identitet. Gavebytte er handlinger som relasjoner gjøres gjennom og adresserer etnisk ambivalens, i tillegg til à være tilnærmingsmåter til den postkoloniale s~<br>

Abstract: Il s'agit d'éclairer plusieurs déplacements qui se sont produits dans les trente dernières années. Tout d'abord la création d'un milieu d'experts intermédiaires entre la politique, l'administration et la recherche. Ensuite un changement du cadre à l'intérieur duquel se situe la réflexion. Il s'agit moins de penser la cohésion d'une société dans un cadre national qu'à la manière dont le pays peut maintenir son rang dans la compétition internationale. Enfin un changement d'orientation politique : le souci de la formation de l'élite redevient primordial même s'il ne s'agit plus de maintenir une tradition culturelle mais de sauvegarder ses parts de marché. Le texte étudie ces évolutions en France en distinguant trois périodes : une période de « politique à l'état gazeux » où la gauche tente de transformer les idéaux libertaires de 1968 en programme de gouvernement ; une tentative de passage à l'état solide avec la loi d'orientation de 1989 et la création de la Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective ; une déstabilisation de ce système par le ministre Claude Allègre qui jette le système éducatif français dans le grand bain de la concurrence internationale. Il s'ensuit une période à la fois « sous influence » et d'incertitude. The idea is to explain several moves that have happened in the last thirty years. First of all, the creation of a body of experts, middlemen between politics, government and research. Then a change in the setting of the thinking process. It is less to think about social cohesion within a national setting than the way the country can live up to its ranking when competing at the international level. Finally, a change in political orientations: teaching the elite becomes a crucial problem again even if it does not mean keeping cultural traditions alive any more but securing market shares. This article studies those changes and defines three periods: firstly, a period of politics in "gaseous-state" in which the left tried to change 1968's liberta~<br>

Abstract: On the U.S.-Mexican border, the label "Mexican" refers simultaneously to both nationality and ethnicity. Playing with the multiple meanings of the word, border actors construct narratives about themselves and Others to deal with a local hegemonic discourse that states that "poverty is Mexican." Thus, while border identities are constructed within a culturally specific system of classification, people also develop a sense of themselves as subjects by imagining themselves as protagonists in stories. To know border narratives is important because people generally act according to how they understand their place in any number of social relations whose meaning is narratively constructed.<br>

Abstract: The philosophical and practical work of M. M. Bakhtin provides an important aid to theoretical grounding with regard to information seeking. In particular, his ideas of dialogic communication suggest a way to engage in the act of information seeking and the accompanying mediation. His work is especially important because of its phenomenological basis, which emphasizes the intentionality of communication, the connection of practice to being, and the relationship between self and other. Bakhtin's thought offers a framework for the rethinking of public services in libraries.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we begin by suggesting an intuitive model of time embodying a notion of temporal distance that we claim is at work in Gadamer's hermeneutics, while it is rejected in Collingwood's theory of interpretation. To show this, after a brief review of the influence of Collingwood on Gadamer and of their disagreement over the possibility of recovering an author's intention, we examine in turn their answers to the problem of transposition, upon which the philosophy of Dilthey supposedly foundered. We show that Gadamer embraced the idea of temporal distance in his solution, which consisted in claiming that the distance between an author from the past and us is filled in by tradition, which opens access to the text for us, while Collingwood considered explanations of the actions of historical agents, and by extension understanding of a text, in intentional or rational terms. Furthermore, he thought that such explanations are not causal, and that the thoughts involved in them do not stand within the flow of physical time, which is involved in any notion of temporal distance. This is why Collingwood felt entitled to anti-relativistic conclusions about the recovery of authorial intentions, conclusions that prompted Gadamer to claim that "the dimension of hermeneutical mediation which is passed through in every act of understanding" escaped him. We then discuss the underlying notions of time at work in both Gadamer and Collingwood, showing that Ricoeur had a better appreciation of the issue, since he saw that Collingwood's moves parallel, up to a point, Heidegger's critique of "vulgar time," albeit with an entirely different result. We also point to the importance in Collingwood's thinking of his notion of "incapsulation."<br>

Abstract: A fierce opponent of the historicist approach to literature that dominated French academe during his lifetime, the essayist and poet Charles Péguy (1873–1914) would theorize an alternative literary method that through the act of faithful and participatory reading could transcend the limitations of historicism. Outlined in his dialogue with History, Clio, Péguy's vision of the literary act is that of an intersubjective operation of mutual understanding between reader and author, in which the living relevance of literary works extends beyond their narrow historical origins; a conception that prefigures the formalist and hermeneutic literary approaches that will arise decades later.<br>

Publisher: American Sociological Association<br>
Issue: i387752<br>
Date: 4 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Zukin Fred<br>
Abstract: To understand the rise of market fundamentalism from the margins of influence to mainstream hegemony, we compare the U.S. 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act and the English 1834 New Poor Law-two episodes in which existing welfare regimes were overturned by market-driven ones. Despite dramatic differences across the cases, both outcomes were mobilized by "the perversity thesis "-a public discourse that reassigned blame for the poor's condition from "poverty to perversity." We use the term "ideational embeddedness" to characterize the power of such ideas to shape, structure, and change market regimes. The success of the perversity thesis is based on the foundations of social naturalism, theoretical realism, and the conversion narrative. In the poverty to perversity conversion narrative, structural blame for poverty is discredited as empiricist appearance while the real problem is attributed to the corrosive effects of welfare's perverse incentives on poor people themselves-they become sexually promiscuous, thrust aside personal responsibility, and develop long-term dependency. This claim enables market fundamentalism to delegitimate existing ideational regimes, to survive disconfirming data, and to change the terms of debate from social problems to the timeless forces of nature and biology. Coupling economic sociology with a sociology of ideas, we argue that ideas count; but not all ideas are created equal. Only some have the capacity to fuel radical transformations in the ideational embeddedness of markets.<br>

Trata-se de pontuar, neste processo, o que está verdadeiramente em jogo, ou seja, o ato de configuração e reconfiguração do tempo que encerra a ação interpretativa em Antropologia. This article brings a reflections about the ethnographic method while encapsulating the identity theme describes by the anthropologist, in special, focusing the moral-ethic problem of the searching of the internal coherence of its ethnographic production through the study of the process of the anthropologic knowledge construction. It is to point, in this process, that is really in the play, or, the act of configuration and reconfiguration of time that stops the interpretative action in anthropology.<br>

Abstract: Can the act of creation itself be considered like an infinite forgiveness that God turns to the earth and to those who live there after having preferred the waters as his place of first existence? The conference "In the beginning it was the forgiveness" held in L'Aquila in the occasion of a pluriconfessional meeting, suggests some hypothesis starting even from some biblical episodes like: the universal deluge, the Amalek's remembering, Giuseppe and his brothers, Isaac's sacrifice, and furthermore with Moses' death, to end with the forgiveness from the original sin through the entrance in the promise land. A suggestive analysis of the forgiveness in the Hebraism, seen too often as a pure religion of the contraposition law to the forgiveness given from the religion of love. The forgiveness in this way is dealt with the inter-religious point of view, and also with the human one that in the relationship between God and man has its top and beginning in the solemnity of Kippur.<br>

Article Title: The Things We Do with Words: Ilongot Speech Acts and Speech Act Theory in Philosophy<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i393665<br>
Date: 8 1, 1973<br>
Author(s): Voloshinov Michelle Z.<br>
Abstract: I begin by introducing the Ilongots and some of their attitudes toward speech. Whereas most modern theorists think of language as a tool designed primarily to "express" or to "refer," Ilongots think of language first in terms of action. They see commands as the exemplary act of speech, displaying less concern for the subjective meanings that an utterance conveys than for the social contexts in which utterances are heard. An ethnographic sketch thus outlines how Ilongots think of words and how their thought relates to aspects of their practice -- providing an external foil for theorists found closer to home. Speech Act Theory is discussed and questioned first on internal grounds, as an approach that recognizes but slights important situational and cultural constraints on forms of language use. A consideration of the application of Searle's taxonomy of acts of speech to Ilongot categories of language use then leads to a clarification of the individualistic and relatively asocial biases of his essentially intra-cultural account. Last, I return to Ilongot directives. A partial analysis of Ilongot acts of speech provides the basis for a statement of the ways in which indigenous categories are related to the forms that actions take, as both of these, in turn, reflect the sociocultural ordering of local worlds.<br>

Abstract: Singing songs in service (kirtan seva) constitutes the primary expression of devotion in the Pushti Marg (Path of Grace) tradition of India. This liturgical practice is singular amongst South Asian, Hindu traditions in its extensive use of rag set to classical poetry. I consider the meaning of this sung liturgy using the ideas of hermeneutic philosophy that concern understanding. I suggest that performing song in service is similar to the act of understanding a work, one in which a self is disclosed in the mode of play. Critically, such continual self-unveilings over a lifetime of service to Krishna afford the practitioner the possibility of the lived liberation promised by founder, Vallabhacharya.<br>

Abstract: The word "end" was not written by Hugo at the end of Toilers of the Sea; this is because his ending, within the precise delimitations suggested here, does not need it, and might even be spoilt by the word. Indeed, it leads narrative desire and characters to an end which, as in music, resonates with the past reading — while at the same time it metaphorises both the act of writing and the act of reading as it comes to its last words.<br>

Abstract: En explicitant le concept linguistique de prédicat et en étendant sa portée, l'auteur introduit et définit celui de « prédicat somatique », responsable de l'expression du sensible dans le langage. Il en illustre la pertinence et en spécifie le contenu analytique à travers trois exemples. La reprise critique de l'analyse du « sein nu » dans Palomar d'I. Calvino par A. J. Greimas (dans De l'imperfection) permet de dégager les propriétés du « corps percevant ». L'analyse d'un énoncé de la mère de Jamel Debbouze dans Télérama fait ressortir l'expression corporelle d'une vérité « refoulée, proscrite, par le langage », un « ça » vrai, expression d'un non-sujet immanent. Enfin, la relation fondamentale entre « l'acte politique » et « le corps parlant » est dégagée à partir de positions exprimées par Jean-Claude Milner et ici analysées dans la perspective du « prédicat somatique », dont trois variétés se trouvent ainsi dégagées au terme de l'article. Developing and extending the validity of the linguistic concept of predicate, the author introduces and defines the notion of "somatic predicate", responsible for expressing in language the experience of the senses. Three examples both show the notion's pertinence and specify its content. A critical reappraisal of A. J. Greimas' analysis of the « naked breast » in Italo Calvino's Palomar (in De l'imperfection) leads to defining me characteristics of the « perceiving body ». The analysis of an utterance of Jamel Debbouze's mother in Télérama stresses the physical, bodily expression of a truth "repressed, prohibited, by language", a true "id", the expression of an immanent non-subject. Finally, the fundamental relation between the "political act" and the "speaking body" is shown through opinions expressed by Jean-Claude Milner which are here analysed from the perspective of a "somatic predicate", three varieties of which have thus been described and defined by the end of the article.<br>

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>

Author(s): Wilson Henrik<br>
Abstract: A theory of the embodiment of action is proposed. Reflections on relations between human intentions, the human body and the notion of agency lead us to argue that phenomenological analysis is not sufficient for such a theory. Our consideration, that the most fundamental level of embodied agency is that of life itself, brings us to the philosophy of biology and the theory of the organism: briefly, certain parts of the natural environment are intrinsic to the constitution of organisms and, in their more sophisticated configuration, as agents. Action is embodied in the sense that certain physiological processes are internal in relation to it and play a constitutive role in its performance. The way in which environment, context and consciousness affect and constitute the nature of agency at personal and sub-personal levels is elaborated. We see that human agents perceive and act upon their world through a complex shifting between those levels. A summary of the ways in which the social sciences can be enriched by this more comprehensive view of human agency provides the basis of justification for claiming Actor-Network Theory (ANT), originally developed by sociologists studying science and technology, as a promising framework for the continuation of this reasoning.<br>

Abstract: Patočka summarized his conception of style in the essay „Umění a čas" [Art and Time] (1966), in which he observes style over historie periods and its increasing departure from a priori, metaphysically ascertained and universally valid meaning. In modern art, style is established by the freedom of the Creative act; its centre of gravity shifts to the level of „signifier". Patočka's essay „O minulém rázu umìění" [Concerning the Former Nature of Art] (written 1965) helped to clarify „aesthetic attitude". In this essay, he develops an interpretational duet: a critique of Hegel's metaphysical starting point, which distances itself from the experience of modern art, and an appraisal of Hegel's interpretation of time, which remains inspirational. In accordance with it, Patočka the phenomenologist considers art the place of „destructive creation", of vivifying revelation, whose source is in man. The next part of the article calls attention to a lecture by Paul Ricoeur „Vyprávění, metafora a teorie interpretace" [Narrative, Metaphor and the Theory of Interpretation] (1987), in which Ricoeur introduced a modern hermeneutic approach to literary studies. What is most relevant here is the concept of the „double reference". The first aspect of reference relates to empirical reality; the second to the „productive reference", which designs a world created by the literary work. Semantic innovation in the narration of a story has a parallel in the semantic innovation of the metaphor. In both cases there emerges „the new, the as yet unsaid, the inexpressible - in language".<br>

Abstract: In the late twentieth century two conceptions of text in a literary work followed from the original distinction between Sinn (smysl, sense) and Bedeutung (význam, reference), which was made by Gottlob Frege in 1892 - namely, those of Wolfgang Iser and Paul Ricoeur. For us, they are interesting for their direct or indirect affinity to Czech Structuralism. The article presents a detailed comparison of the two conceptions: Iser's 'act of reading', culminating in the 'play of the text', and Ricoeur's proposal of 'productive reference', which heads towards the references (Bedeutungen) of a world that is irmagined, without actually being, and announces itself through the creative power of language. The article concludes by returning to the question of the game and reference in the work of Iser and Eugene Fink. Play and art guard the vitality of sense.<br>

Abstract: Defined as "an act of cognition that schematizes two semantic fields and simultaneously effects and denies their rapprochement," metaphor as it appears in Lycidas is subdivided into three types, quantitatively distinguished. Ornamental metaphor is the minimal unit, consisting of a single metaphoric equation. Structural metaphors operate over larger poetic blocks, typically the extended clause. Governing the entire poem, the Lycidas/King metaphor bridges the real and fictitious universes in a metaphoric act characteristic of the pastoral elegy genre. Cutting across this three-tiered classification scheme is another typology based on metaphoric conjunction among the semantic features Human/Non-Human and Abstract/Physical. Accompanying tables present the results of the analysis.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>

Date: 10 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Burgan Mary<br>
Abstract: Despite recent critical denigrations of the representation of temporality as a defining interest in narrative, it is important to reappraise the epiphany as a feature of the short stories of "founding" modernist women writers like Virginia Woolf and Katherine Mansfield. Nevertheless, the association of the epiphanic story with "feminine" writing drove a writer like Doris Lessing to reject the epiphany as an organizing principle in her stories; she chose, instead, the more fabular, allegorical model of a writer like D. H. Lawrence. Finally, however, Lessing, like other women writers of the short story, kept in touch with the intuition of revelation in moments of being whose power act not only as organizers of narrative but also as significations of a kind of feminine sensory apprehension of temporality. This discursive implementation of the moment as the center of modernist women writers' short fiction may be recuperated so as to preserve their achievements from the preference for a decentered écriture féminine.<br>

Abstract: La signe comme expression (Husserl) consiste selon F. de Saussure dans le rapport immotivé signifíant-signifíé, sa valeur signifiante étant déterminée par la place du signifiant dans le système réel de la langue tandis que le signifié-concept (de Saussure) est noème, irréel (Husserl). Inerte tant qu'aucun acte d'expression ou de compréhension ne l'anime (ré-anime), il porte, exprime et induit l'intentionnalité de ces actes; il est conscience hors de soi, intentionnalité sans sujet, visée du signifié différenciée par son signifiant (objet d'une science de faits, la linguistique). Aussi les problèmes du «sujet», de l' «origine», de la «suffisance» du signe adéquat, de l'«insuffisance» du signe qui, en son ouverture, exprime au-delà de lui-même, exigent-ils l'élucidation du champ de signification, notamment des figures métonymiques ou métaphoriques qui y apparaissent. According to F. de Saussure a sign or an expression (Husserl) is constituted by the unmotivated relation between the signifier and the signified, the value of the signifier is determined by the position it occupies in the real system of language, while the signified concept (de Saussure) is a noema, i.e. unreal (Husserl). Inactive, as long as there is no act of expression or understanding to (re) activate it, the concept carries the intentionality of these acts, conveys it and leads us to it. It constitutes a consciousness outside of the self, an intentionality without a subject, a target of the signified, as differentiated by the signifier (the object of a science, the linguistics). In this sense the solution to the problems concerning the «subject», the «origin», the «sufficiency» of an adequate sign, the «insufficiency» of a sign, when it signifies things other than itself, requires the clarification of the idea of a field of meaning, especially the meaning of occurring metonymies and metaphors.

Abstract: À l'encontre d'une école récente d'interprétation qui tend à voir dans les Essais de Montaigne une pensée du renoncement à toute maîtrise de l'action, nous voulons montrer qu'il y a chez lui une authentique pensée de la prudence. Si les références aristotéliciennes et stoïciennes sont sollicitées par Montaigne, il reste que le caractère mouvant et imprévisible de la fortune ainsi que la part de fortuit inscrite dans l'être l'obligent à redéfinir les contours de la notion traditionnelle de prudence. À un premier niveau de prudence qui consiste à savoir agir dans le monde s'ajoute un second niveau, qui consiste à savoir se préserver face aux sollicitations du monde. Montaigne inaugure ainsi une pensée moderne de la prudence, qui trouvera, mutatis mutandis, une expression contemporaine chez Hannah Arendt, Georg Gadamer et Paul Ricœur. Contrary to a recent school of interpretation which aims to see in Montaigne's Essays a thought of renouncement to any control of action, we intend to show the presence of an authentic thought of prudence. If Montaigne refers to aristotelician and stoician texts, the unsettledness and unpredictableness of fortune, as well as the part of fortuitness which is part of the being, require him nevertheless to redefine the outlines of the traditionnal notion of prudence. To a first level of prudence, which consists in knowing how to act in the word, one must add a second level, which consists in knowing how to preserve oneself facing with word's appeals. Montaigne thus inaugurates a modern thought of prudence, which will find, mutatis mutandis, a contemporary expression in Hannah Arendt, Georg Gadamer and Paul Ricœur.<br>

Abstract: Metaphors cannot be studied in abstracto. The use of metaphors is part of the communication process of John's Gospel. Therefore this study starts with a consideration of the Gospel as a communicative act. This means that the author(s) employ(s) various means to alter the listeners'/readers' world view. Perhaps the most important way of achieving this is through the use of metaphors. Metaphors are created by way of unexpected predication through a deliberate category mistake. In this way the possibility is opened to innovative perception (seeing what was not there to see before) as well as to a redescription of reality. By relating the metaphors used in John's Gospel (e g true light, good shepherd, true vine, etc) to their possible communication situation, one can gain insight into the role metaphors play in identifying the Jesus of John.<br>

Abstract: This article reassesses the importance of historical biblical scholarship, but from the perspective of those who views are seldom considered by the academy, namely, poor, working-class and marginalized 'readers' of the Bible. Recognising that these 'readers' of Bible do have an interest in socio-historical matters, both in the present contexts and in the biblical texts, the article goes on to an analysis of how we might go about appropriating socio-historical modes of reading in our work with ordinary 'readers' of the Bible. It is here that the article engages with the historicity of myth and the myth of historicity. First, it is argued that the historically interested socially engaged scholar who works with ordinary 'readers' of the Bible should be overtly aware of the myth of historicity. Such scholars must embody a more nuanced view of history in the very act of imparting historical information in our collaborative work with non-scholars. Second, when biblical narratives are granted mythic significance – that is, they are signified as meaning, powerful and true irrespective of their historical claims – the task of the socially engaged biblical scholar is to respond with critical responsibility to the academy and with social accountability to our context.<br>

Abstract: Are the readings of Luke being proposed in this volume evidence of readers finding in the text what they want? Different readings of the same text can be related to different manifestations of "the reader". Yet a responsible reading of the text implies taking the text as a speech-act functioning in a communicative context. The role of the author and the context therefore becomes important again. The concept of foolproof composition is relevant too ās it implies the exclusion of the possibility of a counterreading of the text. Tlie phenomenon of the inspiration of a sacred text also functions as a constraint.<br>

Abstract: This study, based largely on unpublished material, is an attempt to describe and evaluate how French Protestantism dealt with the German question in the postwar period. A short description of the perception of Germany by French Protestants towards the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century underlines the new approach which characterized the relations between French and German Protestants after the Second World War. In spite of the shattering defeat of the Third Reich, Germany remained in the eyes of many French Protestants a dreadful danger. However, already shortly after the war, some clergymen and laymen, many of whom had been involved in the resistance against the nazi regime, believed that their mission was to act as mediators and peacemakers despite the official hard-line diplomacy of their country. This article provides a selection of quotations of French Protestants' intentions and conceptions regarding the German question, as well as examining the ways and means they thought best to prevent Germany from becoming a new danger to France and Europe. It shows how seriously they debated all aspects of a common future with yesterday's enemy in a Europe of tomorrow, and affords an insight into how some Protestant personalities on both sides of the Rhine played an important role in the process of Franco-German reconciliation during the postwar period.<br>

Abstract: As a Catholic historian, this theme raises particular difficulties for me, since the notion of specific patterns of thought is one I would not use, and the term 'contemporary history' is much too vague. Of course, Catholic scholars, no less than their protestant counterparts, still recognize the need to raise questions about the nature of history and its analysis, despite the various unsuccessful attempts in the past when systematic theologians have failed to come to terms with the reality of historical events, as in the unhistorically conceived 'New Scholasticism'. The concept of 'freedom', for example, is one which requires new conceptualization in our present historical context. If we accept the current view that all rationalist theories of knowledge are in fact based on an act of 'faith', so we have to see that the belief in the primacy of 'Reason' cannot any longer be maintained. Which does not mean that we have to take flight into 'unreason', or abandon rational categories of thought. What we need to find is some manner by which 'faith' can be anchored as a final justification, over and above any transcendental basis. In our present pluralistic world this will have to be to presented in a variety of ways. But at least it calls for a new consideration of how to relate 'faith' and 'knowledge'.<br>

Abstract: This article analyses the difficult relation between anthropology and history. The point, therefore, is to show how anthropology conceptualises the past differently from history as a discipline. Beginning with the differences between anthropology and history in terms of the concept of time, the article highlights that while for history time is concrete, objective and exogenous to human beings, for anthropology it is characterised by its being condensed, collectively subjective and endogenous. By analyzing actual examples, the article shows that the anthropologist is not interested in the past per se, but rather in the past as a dimension of the present. Accordingly, actualised, revised and manipulated history as well as the role of the past in the present need to be taken into account. Consequently, history and the past have their own specific efficiency because they are also a form of knowledge and social resource mobilised by single individuals or groups to find their bearings and act accordingly in the present and likewise to plan the future.<br>

Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138215<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Voelz Johannes<br>
Abstract: Combining a historical with a theoretical perspective, this essay begins by reconstructing Ralph Waldo Emerson's evolving theory of recognition and the central role it played for his concept of 'self-reliance.' Initially having adopted the theorizations of recognition developed by Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, Emerson came to articulate the idea of self-reliance by way of developing an alternative approach to recognition, in which the source allocating recognition is neither society nor an inborn moral sense, but rather the transcendentally conceptualized self. Emerson's shift towards self-recognition poses questions seldom asked in the contemporary debate on recognition. Moving beyond a reconstructive aim, one such question is considered in the article's second part: What role does recognition come to play in the act of reading? Taking Emerson's own essays as a case in point, the author argues that the aesthetic experience afforded by non-fictional texts can be understood as a facilitator of self-recognition—as a continuous process of imaginarily experiencing the enlargement of the self. This process intersects with dynamics of social recognition, producing a 'dual economy of recognition.' The article concludes by challenging the assumption found in currently dominant paradigms of recognition which assumes that recognition can come to successful completion. Conceived as a dual economy, the article argues, recognition is to the contrary constitutively open-ended.<br>

Publisher: Sameeksha Trust<br>
Issue: i402288<br>

Author(s): Cohn Lata<br>
Abstract: Several debates arose in the nineteenth century on the status of women in India in the context of determining an appropriate colonial policy on such matters as "sati" which were seen to mark the depressed position of women in society. The reform of these practices was held to be part of the regenerating mission of colonisation. The most sensational and the first of these debates concerned the outlawing of "sati". The literature on "sati" (and on social reform) of the period has largely adopted the framework of modernisation theory. The paper argues that the characterisation of the official debate as one between 'preservationists' and impatient westerners obscures a number of important issues. For instance, rather than argue for the outlawing of "sati" as a cruel and barbarous act, officials in favour of abolition were at pains to illustrate that the abolition would be consonant with the principle of upholding tradition. By treating the debates on "sati" as a discourse and examining its production the article contests the conclusions on "sati" drawn by colonial officials.<br>

Abstract: Kern Sakamoto's novel The Electrical Field successfully resists a new and insidious form of social amnesia surrounding the Japanese-Canadian internment. Perpetuated by the act of collective remembering and reinforced by the teleological structure of social and literary narratives representing the internment, this communal forgetting is resisted through the novel's use of discourses of hysteria.<br>

Abstract: To discuss the practice of memory and its relations to politics, social scientists rely on three kinds of practices - memorialising, memorising and the act of remembering/forgetting. The commemoration of "1857" is unique in that official celebrations of the event have been instituted even as 1857 continues to refigure in myths and endures as a symbol of popular resistance. The articles in this special issue address the seeming contradictions and complexities that "remembering" 1857 involves, and the tension that prevails between different kinds of recall.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I set out a phenomenology of social transformation, based on an analysis of the distinctively religious form of communication which underlies the trans-generational and trans-cultural transmission of world traditions, taking Confucianism and Christianity as their representatives. A phenomenological analysis of their communicative structure allows the possibility of a better understanding of what can be learnt from them in the context of contemporary debates in both China and the West on the relations between religion, ethics and politics. This analysis suggests that the ethical consistency of belief and act, which is the necessary condition for the engendering of long-term solidarity in religious community, has significant implications for ethics in politics, and especially for the legitimacy of representational leadership as a focal point for change in society. The paper concludes that the historical experience of world religions can offer new insights into the nature of political leadership and representation in today's globalised world and that the appropriate locus for this inquiry is the present negotiation and re-negotiation of relations between China and the West.<br>

Abstract: Se pretende exponer un acercamiento preliminar, mediante las figuras de Aristóteles y Tomás de Aquino, a la metodología que utiliza el crítico literario George Steiner en su lectura asidua de filosofia. Aquino es utilizado como contrapunto del filósofo griego en dos sentidos. Por un lado, se actualiza el potencial estético de su teología bajo el influjo, entre otros, de Gilson y Maritain; mientras que, por otro, el fundamento tomista de la epifania joyceana remite a una conexión entre el Doctor Angélico y Dante Alighieri. El alcance epistemológico de la imitación tomista y las condiciones del acto de la creación poética, incluyendo la relación entre potencia y acto y la procesión entre no-ser y ser, hacen difïcil definir adecuadamente los conceptos en Steiner. El «realismo» steineriano, asociado a su apuesta por la trascendencia del significado, debe ser repensado, desde su dimensión estética, en conflictiva sintonia con una postmodernidad considerada como época epilogal. A preliminary approach to George Steiner's methodology of reading philosophy is attempted through the figures of Aristotle and Thomas of Aquinas. Aquinas is used as the counterpoint of the Greek philosopher in a double way. On the one hand, the aesthetic force of his theology is raised under the influence of Gilson and Maritain, among others; on the other hand, the James Joyces's epiphany is referred to a connection between the Doctor Angelico and Dante Alighieri. The epistemological reach of thomistic imitation and the conditions of the act of the poetical creation, make the concepts in Steiner difficult to be defined accurately. The steinerian «realism», based on the wager on the transcendence of meaning, must be rethought aesthetically, as attuned to a postmodernist epoch of the epilogue.<br>

Abstract: En travaillant sur quelques reprises littéraires des récits de la Passion du Christ, l'article tente de montrer comment la relecture littéraire permet de redécouvrir la manière dont les textes bibliques interpellent leurs lectrices et lecteurs. En particulier, il s'attache à faire apparaître comment certains personnages de ces récits, par la transposition littéraire, deviennent des offres fictives d'identité narrative. Pour ce faire, l'auteur se laisse guider par la théorie de la narrativité de Paul Ricoeur et la conception de l'acte de lecture de Wolfgang her. Using literary renditions of the Passion narratives, this article tries to show how literary rereadings allow us to discover the way biblical texts interpellate the reader. In particular, it seeks to bring out the way certain characters, in the literary transposition of these stories, become fictive overtures of narrative identity. The author is inspired by Paul Ricoeur's theory of narrativity and Wolfgang Iser's idea of the act of reading.<br>

Abstract: L'herméneutique du soi proposée par Paul Ricoeur dans les années quatre vingt-dix fait une large place au récit autobiographique. Elle place ainsi au cœur de la constitution de l'identité personnelle la capacité défaire retour sur soi en termes narratifs. Abordée sous l'angle non seulement de la permanence d'un noyau substantiel – la mêmeté – mais également de celle impliquée dans l'acte de tenir parole – l'ipséité – l'identité est ici conçue comme étant narrative. Seul un sujet capable de se raconter serait ainsi capable du maintien de soi dans la parole donnée. Or, confrontée à l'hypothèse de l'inconscient, cette conception narrative de l'identité fait problème: que ce soit au niveau anthropologique et métapsychologique d'une part, ou au niveau de la méthode et de la clinique psychanalytique d'autre part, le récit autobiographique ne saurait rendre compte de la dimension inconsciente de l'expérience. Elle ne peut en ce sens constituer un concept directeur dans le champ théorico-clinique ouvert par Freud. The hermeneutics of the self proposed by Paul Ricoeur in the 1990's gives a large place to autobiographical narrative. At the heart of what constitutes personal identity, then, is the capacity to reflect on oneself in narrative terms. Seen not only from the angle of the permanence of a substantial core – selfsameness – but also from that implied in the act of discourse – ipseity – identity is conceived of as being narrative. Only a subject capable of telling about itself can maintain the self in what is told. However, when confronted with the hypothesis of the subconscious, this narrative conception of identity is problematic: whether at an anthropological or a meta-psychological level on the one hand, or on the level of method and of clinical psychoanalysis on the other, autobiographical narrative cannot render an account of the unconscious dimension of experience. It cannot in this sense be a directive concept in the clinical theory field opened by Freud.<br>

Abstract: Réponse à l'article publié par G. Lafont: La pertinence théologique de l'histoire, dans la Rev. Sc. ph. th. 63 (1979) 161-202. La discussion doit être épistémologique et théologique. Après avoir rappelé son projet central (penser le monde en faisant droit à la contingence), l'A. propose une réflexion sur le nom. Que le monde soit irrémédiablement pris dans l'historique ne condamne pas à la dissémination: en effet le monde apparaît toujours comme déjà nommé, et le nom est irréductible à l'acte de nomination qui sera toujours réponse (reconnaissance, en acte, d'un nom). Par là, l'A. tente de montrer que son pari théologique ne condamne pas à esquiver le moment nécessaire d'une référence, mais conduit certes à le repenser, à ouvrir une nouvelle ontologie. Pour ce faire, il met à profit certains enseignements de la tradition juive et de l'enseignement psychanalytique. Il signale enfin que loin de rompre avec le passé, son projet ambitionne de renouer en profondeur avec certaines des positions les plus originaires et traditionnelles du christianisme. A response to the article published by G. L. : La pertinence théologique de l'histoire, in Rev. Sc. ph. th. 63 (1979) 161-202. The discussion has to be epistemological and theological. Having recalled his main project (to think the world by giving its place to contingency), the writer is proposing a reflection on the name. That the world cannot but be historical does not condemn it to be disseminated: indeed the world always appears as already named, and the name is irreducible to the nominating act that will always be a response (acknowledgment, in act, of a name). Thus the author tries to demonstrate that his theological bet does not lead to evade the necessary moment of referring, but most certainly to think it over, to work out a new ontology. To bring it about, he makes use of teachings of the Jewish tradition and of the psycho-analytical teaching. Finally he points out that his project not only is far from being a brea~<br>

Abstract: Le jugement de valeur est étudié par Nabert dans les Éléments pour une éthique. Il se situe à l'articulation de la compréhension de soi, de l'affirmation originaire et de la régénération. Pensé comme expression d'un acte originaire et non comme participation à l'être, il permet de lier réflexion, création et pluralité. Cette perspective métaphysique, soutenue par une philosophie réflexive de la conscience, suscite une perspective critique par rapport aux théories substantialistes (Scheler, Spaemann) ou procédurales (Habermas, Renaut) de la valeur. Si la valeur est promotion d'existence, les prédicats négatifs donnent forme à l'acte de protestation contre le mal, l'injustifiable. Jean Nabert studies the judgment of value in his Éléments pour une éthique. He himself is situated at the crossroads of the comprehension of self, original affirmation, and regeneration. Seen as the expression of an originating act and not as a participation in being, it can tie together reflexion, creation and plurality. This metaphysical perspective sustained by a reflexive philosophy of conscience invites a critical perspective in relation to substantialist (Scheler, Spaemann) or procedural (Habermas, Renaut) theories of value. If value is promotion of existence, then negative predicates give form to the act of protest against evil, the unjustifiable.<br>

Abstract: Rompant avec la quasi-unanimité de la philosophie occidentale, de Platon à Marx, laquelle a conçu le pouvoir en termes de pouvoir-sur, de domination de l'homme sur l'homme, H. A. propose de le penser autrement, comme expression de l'aptitude d'un groupe à agir en condition de pluralité de façon concertée, et donc comme pouvoir-en-commun. L'A. différencie soigneusement le pouvoir, qui trouve en lui-même sa propre fin, d'avec la violence, d'ordre instrumental, qui n'est jamais légitime, et d'avec l'autorité, qui présuppose la reconnaissance inconditionnelle et le respect. Elle se demande finalement si tout pouvoir peut se passer du facteur de durabilité qu'est l'autorité d'une fondation. In breaking with the near unanimity of Western Philosophy which, from Plato to Marx, had conceived of power in terms of "power over," of a domination of humans over humans, H. A. proposes instead to think of power as an expression of a group's aptitude to act in a pluralistic environment and in concert, thus as power in common. The A. takes care to distinguish power as an end in itself from violence of an instrumental order which is never legitimate, and from Authority which presupposes unconditional recognition and respect, wondering in the end if all power can do without the durability factor that is the authority of a foundation<br>

Abstract: L'auteur se propose de vérifier l'affirmation de Lavelle selon laquelle l'ouvrage de 1937, De l'Acte, se serait progressivement développé comme une synthèse complète de sa philosophie. Or il existe, à l'état dactylographié, une version antérieure de ce livre, qui permet de comprendre combien l'aisance presque trop grande des analyses de 1937 cache en fait une élaboration lente et un effort continu. La version inédite insiste sur l'intemporalité transcendantale de l'acte, et sur l'impersonnalité de l'acte fondateur de toutes les existences personnelles. Ces thèses seront abandonnées en 1937. On analyse ensuite l'article « Être et Acte » et la conférence de la société française de philosophie sur « Acte créateur et acte réflexif », où est discutée la position de Jean Nabert. Les thèses de De l'Acte montrent une progression de l'identité de l'être et de l'acte (dans l'acte d'être) jusqu'à l'acte en sa forme la plus haute, l'acte d'amour. Situer cette œuvre capitale implique qu'on ait bien compris l'interprétation du sensible comme de la donnée matérielle qui doit être spiritualisée. L'expérience extérieure du sensible s'oppose à l'expérience intérieure de l'esprit. Et l'acte est l'œuvre de l'être spirituel. L'ontologie dynamique de Lavelle est une affirmation de la liberté humaine comme participation à l'acte créateur divin. Divin ou humain, l'être est subjectif parce que libre. Ainsi Lavelle s'inscrit dans la tradition platonicienne moderne, celle d'Avicenne d'abord, celle de Hegel ensuite. The author proposes to verify Lavelle's assertion that the 1937 work, De l'Acte, would be progressively developed as a complete synthesis of his philosophy. Now there exists in typewritten state an earlier version of this book, which allows us to see the extent to which the almost excessive facility of analyses of 1937 in fact conceals a slow development and a continuous effort. The unedited version insists upon the transcendental atemporality of act, and upon the impersonality of ~<br>

Abstract: Alors que le Quatrième Évangile rapportait dialogues et symboles à la communication de la Révélation, la théologie contemporaine les renvoie souvent à une altérité constitutive de toute éthique. Partant de cet écart, irréductible à un simple renversement, l'article cherche à montrer comment le dialogisme et le symbolisme, grâce à leur dissemblance, demeurent aussi essentiels l'un que l'autre à l'accueil de l'Évangile, de la Révélation, du Salut. L'identification du croyant passe aussi bien par un dialogue né d'une séparation que par un symbole ordonné à un rassemblement. Pour parvenir à cette conclusion, l'article doit d'abord définir les conditions requises pour que chacune des deux formations signifiantes ouvre à la fois à un monde et à une communauté : un être et un agir nouveaux. While the Fourth Gospel draws upon dialogues and symbols for the communication of revelation, contemporary theology often relegates them to an otherness constitutive of any ethic. Beginning with this rupture, irreducible to a simple reversal, this paper seeks to show how dialogue and symbolism, thanks to their dissimilarity, remain so essential to each other for the reception of the Gospel, of revelation, of salvation. The identification of the believer passes just as well through a dialogue born of a separation as by a symbol ordered to a gathering. In order to arrive at this conclusion, this paper assumes the task of defining the conditions necessary for each of the two significant formations to open upon a world and a community: a new being and act.<br>

Author(s): Toulmin Paul B.<br>
Abstract: The debate about validity in interpretation has pitted monism against pluralism. Some theorists insist that any literary work has a single, determinate meaning, and others argue that there are no limits to the readings a text allows. Neither view adequately describes the field of conflicting interpretations. Critics can and do have legitimate disagreements about literary works; yet we can also say that some readings are wrong, not simply different. The hermeneutic field is divided among conflicting systems of interpretation, each based on different presuppositions that decide what its procedures will disclose and what they will disguise. But several tests for validity-inclusiveness, efficacy, and intersubjectivity-act as constraints on reading and regulate claims to legitimacy. While these tests have limitations that prevent them from resolving all hermeneutic disagreements, literary criticism is nevertheless a rational, disciplined enterprise-though an inherently pluralistic one.<br>

Abstract: «At the basis of the literary act is a consciousness of language. Whether or not the writer is given to abstract reflexion, there is in literature itself a metaliterary dimension.» In his article on the Evolution of Literary Theory, Tzvetan Todorov examines the relation between the «discourse on Literature» and the object of that discourse: literature. Whereas exegesis concerns itself with the Elucidation and explanation of an historically given object, theory itself constitutes its object. Theory then is in turn seen to be historically informed. From the Poetics of Aristotle, through the medieval hermeneuts, the Renaissance concern with genres, Todorov traces the development of the theoretical discourse which proposes literature as its object. Only in the romantic period is a theory of literature, in the strict sense, elaborated. In the 20th century this theory is further influenced by other emergent disciplines :Marxism, psychoanalysis etc. The final pages of Todorov's paper consider in detail the impact of structuralism, particularly in France, on the literary theoretical discourse. He concludes with reference to the changes taking place currently. According to Todorov, it is in the «idea of genre» that the «transformation will take place.»<br>

Abstract: Recent studies of performance genres suggest that many rituals generate propositional force by manipulating ritual frames and so drawing the audience to reflect upon various levels of performance reality. This article focuses on the fusion of such levels during the performance of a Tibetan opera before an audience of refugee Tibetans living in India, a spectacle wherein the mimetic performance of a mock exorcism became an actual exorcism. The article analyzes this transformation from the combined perspective of theatrical semiosis and speech act theory. [Tibet, performance theory, opera, ritual, theater]<br>

Date: 11 1, 1977<br>
Author(s): Witherspoon Robert<br>
Abstract: An ethnographic study of the words and actions common to a shelter for people considered homeless and mentally ill shows how distinct forms of reasoning and personal agency relate to a set of practical concerns and political exigencies. Whereas the shelter's staff rely on and promote a referential language and direct, active forms of agency, its residents depend on tactical, persuasive uses of language and oblique, reactive forms of agency. Yet because the staff have the upper hand politically, their orientations to language, thought, and action take a more central role in encouraging people to act in sincere and reasonable ways. The residents draw on ideas of sincerity, reason, and personal accountability, but in makeshift ways, with the result that the ideas are caught up in the rhetoric of self-presentation. The article's findings underscore the need for anthropologists to attend to the diverse means, and political, linguistic, and cultural grounds, of human reason and agency.

Abstract: The new information technologies have transformed reading practices in meaningful ways, promoting other skills and competences, and activating new ways of interacting with reading devices. Based on a qualitative study conducted in Mexico City, this article aims to explore how communicational innovations have had an impact on a specific type of reader, whose distinctive feature is to have an intense and/or enjoyable relationship with the act of read: the cultural creators. The analysis of these practices and the reflection as a result of this, allows us to observe that, far from creating isolated readers, the emerging technologies contribute to develop, in other ways,the potential for the sociability of reading, thus stimulating work networks and collaborative projects.<br>

Publisher: Beacon Press<br>
Issue: daat.issue-81<br>

Author(s): Holzer Elie<br>
Abstract: This article examines the literary genre of the written Hasidic homilies of Rabbi Aryeh Leib Alter (1848-1905), known as
         Sfat Emet. The discussion is conducted through the lens of Paul Ricoeur’s concept of “the work of the text.” This concept encompasses the elements of composition and codification of the text as well as the desired effects of the reading process. The analysis identifies the features that are at work in the homilies, along with the type of hermeneutic activity into which the reader is drawn. This activity is designed to cause the reader to become open, in new or renewed ways, toward various dimensions of reality. The article suggests that the Hasidic homily is designed to act upon the reader in and through the very reading process: what the reader learns is not confined to the content of the homily but is first and foremost due to the nature of the reading experience itself.<br>

Abstract: This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of the “(as yet) untold story” to consider the relationship between James Joyce's 1904 short story “Eveline” (in
         Dubliners) and Colm Tóibín's award-winning 2009 novel,Brooklyn. Although Tóibín has denied the influence of Joyce in general, there are many similarities in the storyworlds of the two protagonists, Eveline Hill and Eilis Lacey: Eveline wishes to leave her father's home in Dublin but stays, whilst Eilis would prefer to remain at home but is forced to emigrate. Both act according to their perception of their mother's wishes and the rightness of their decisions has preoccupied readers. Through close analysis of thought and speech presentation, this essay shows that interpretive responses to the actions of Eveline and Eilis are inextricably linked to the formal qualities of each text.<br>

Abstract: “We were born to imitate,” writes Mark McMorris in “Aphrodite of Economy.” His collection
         The Blaze of the Pouiis in complex dialogue with history, the history of language, and the idea of constraint and lacuna. McMorris's poems perform and reflect on the ways in which language bears a political charge:
               
            History chokes on a rag of kerosene
               the fuse is lit down a corridor of echoing images
               and one cannot shuffle the fulgurating words
               to nominate as aesthetics what time calls blood—
            
               
            …
            
               McMorris's fabricated sources underscore the problems inherent in the metaphysics of origin.we were born to imitate, and that's the paradox
               of being from an offshore rock: how to put out
               the wide savagery when you're inside the beast
               that in other legends, as wolf, swallows the community
               in this one has left prints in the form of sugar cane
               that actually broaches a goddess of slave economy.
            
                     
               98
                  Blaze of the Pouifeatures “Fragments: Journal of a Voyage to Undiscovered Lands,” which is accompanied by a short prose piece announcing that the journal was found among Sir Walter Raleigh's affairs, edited some time after 1589, and then encountered again in a used bookshop on Connecticut Avenue in Washington, DC.
               The narrator of the “Journal” is a sixteenth-century explorer who writes of landing on a Caribbean island and meeting its inhabitants, the “Cannibals.” The cannibal reappears throughout McMorris's poems, he notes, “for the same reason I have other colonialist specters, mythical creatures, savages, barbarians—because they define an imaginary terrain and set up zones on the periphery for power to act against.”99

Abstract: No other poem expresses the violence in Liberia as does “An Elegy for the St. Peter's Church Massacred,” from
         The River Is Rising. It is a poem that details the massacre of six hundred men, women, and children at St. Peter's Church, a horrible act that made international news (Reuters). Over two hundred soldiers from the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) forced their way into the church and shot the people who had taken refuge there. For the speaker, the survival of such tragedies is more painful than death, and that is why he believes he is in a worse situation than the victims:
               
         I envy those who were massacred.
               Those who never saw their killers approach
               with heavy bootsteps that made no sound
               in the dark morning hours.<br>

Issue: jafrireli.1.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 2013<br>
Abstract: There was always the temptation to give up the tension created by the difference between the two modes of being in the world. From the side of African and other diaspora communities, there is always the utopian temptation to create a world of meaning only from resources that they define as original or “indigenous.” Such a position would represent a kind of mimicry of the Europeans who think that their cultures have never learned from or been dependent on others. It is furthermore almost impossible to designate any “pure” beginnings in any part of the world. It is at this point that I return to V. Y. Mudimbe's notion of gnosis. He makes it clear that by gnosis he is not referring to an episteme or a science. For me this indicates a lived or performed appearance—in other words, a mode of life where practice is to the fore but the theoretical implications of this practice act as critical principles. These principles allow room for the meaning of the practice to engage in all the implications of creating a world of meaning. This would be close to what goes on in religious communities.<br>

It was an act of rebellion, and if analytic philosophers thought of themselves as revolutionaries, the founders of SPEP were anything but counterrevolutionaries or reactionaries.

Article Title: The Plight of Ethics<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: In the history of moral philosophy culminating in our moment of hyperbolic ethics, our plight has become less familiar and more uncanny, as the notion of duty or obligation increasingly takes on the sense of risk and urgency involved in substituting myself for another in a way that entails danger, even hostage, which, by the way, also has its roots in a Latin word for pledge—
      pledgein the sense of giving oneself over for the other and also in the sense of making a promise or a binding oath, in other words, a speech act, the very possibility of which assumes both other people and the Other of language and culture. Kant's autonomous will gives way to the vulnerability of the face for Levinas or suffering as the uncanny “capacity” for vulnerability for Derrida. The “I can” of moral agency becomes passively subjected to the other upon whom it depends ontologically and biologically for its very existence. Levinas proposes a responsibility that I cannot refuse because there is no I without it. Insofar as I am, I am answerable and responsible to and for the other. Contra Hegel and Sartre, Levinas (1998) maintains that subjectivity is not the in-itself become for-itself but, rather, the in-itself become for-the other. Yet Levinas insists that this hyperethical responsibility operates on a level opposed to the political. Justice, he says, requires a third, whereas the force of our ethical obligation finds its imperative in the face-to-face relation, which cannot be translated into the political realm.<br>

Abstract: If it is true that love and the invocation of the second-personal pronoun target what the other person refers to with “I,” then we may consider that this is likewise not a property or a quality. Indeed this is necessarily so because what “I” refers to is “myself as myself,” and in so doing I achieve the
            per seknowing to which Brentano called attention. But quite in opposition to another strain in his thought, I propose that I need no third-personal, nonindexical, descriptive terms or properties to achieve this knowing. Prior to the achievement of “I” as a reflective intentional act, but also in the reflective indexical achievement of “I,” I am aware uniquely of myself, and I don't have to be aware of anything else but myself to achieve this.

Article Title: Critical Theory<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: The Theory of Communicative Action, the leading tome of the first phase, addressed two things: social theory and analytic philosophy. On the one hand, it attempted to address critical theory's contribution to social theory, particularly in relationship to Weber and Parsons. On the other hand, it embedded critical theory in a full-blown analytic argument, which was designed to address developments in analytic philosophy. In retrospect these were permanent contributions to the reconstruction of critical theory and if anything, kept it alive. As many know I expressed my doubts regarding the universal claims associated with Habermas's reconstruction of speech-act theory.
                  However, it must be admitted that Habermas's reconstruction shaped the subsequent debates. If there are any doubts about that, I suggest that people consult the Sage Masters in Modern Social Thought series volumes on Habermas. An extraordinary amount of material has been produced responding to Habermas. Further, the debate over this contribution has been kept alive by the development of the discourse ethic, which began at a session of the Habermas seminar in spring 1982. Regarding the publication of4
               The Theory of Communicative ActionI recall specifically a four-hour discussion I had with Habermas over his theory of modernity, which in my view was all too willing to undercut archaic experience at the expense of scientific modernity. In retrospect that problem did not go away, and Habermas is now confronting it. A second recollection from that period has to do with Habermas's presentation of the paper that became the basis for the discourse ethic. Ernst Tugentat had written a six-page critique of it, which was circulated among the Habermas seminar group. Looking back it appears that most of the criticisms that were ever made subsequently of that view were made on that day. We were merciless, and when I left the conversation a full eight hours after it began Habermas and T~<br>

Article Title: Ethics and Religion in Continental Philosophy<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: For Levinas, the liberation of God from Being was the definition of “ethics,” which Levinas himself called “metaphysics.” Levinas meant that ethics alone breaks the crust of Being, which he called the sphere of the “same.” The ethical other breaches what we comprehend and pre-have in advance and exposes us to the “wholly other,” by which he meant not God but the “face” of the neighbor or the stranger, which is the “trace” that God leaves behind in withdrawing from the world (Being). Levinas radicalizes the ethics of neighborly love and hospitality in the Jewish Scriptures, by means of which he thought “first philosophy” could be revitalized and ethics returned to center stage in Continental thinking, a project in which he broadly succeeded. Marion's trope, “without Being,” is structurally similar to Levinas's, but Marion really does mean God (the God of the mystical theology of the Christian neo-Platonists), whom he approaches in an ingenious series of three “reductions” in the Husserlian sense: first of transcendental subjectivity (Kant and Husserl), then of existential agency (Dasein), and finally of Being itself. The upshot of reduction is to release the givenness (
            Gegebenheit) of what he calls the “saturated phenomenon.” By this he means the phenomenon untethered from prior limiting conditions, which is free to be given in a flood ofdonationthat overwhelms the conceptual resources of the one to whom it is given (theadonné). Reversing orthodox Husserlianism, the givenness of the saturated phenomenon exceeds the intentional act.<br>

Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: More than a simple and obvious trope, hyperbole is a perspective that allows one to view the world otherwise through the use of excess and exaggeration. It is a mode of thought, a practice of excess, and an act of becoming. It can operate discursively, polemically, prophetically, paradoxically, and philosophically. It is a generator of meaning and being and a lens through which to view the world and the limits of knowledge differently. It is a disruptive force within language that always attempts to move beyond the insufficiency of thought and language while at the same time revealing the errant multiplicity and exorbitance of discourse through the abundance of excess. Hyperbole is a different kind of speech; through it a lie that is not a deception can be employed on the side of truth(s), which is always lacking and unstable, necessitating the abundance of excess.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur, however, does not view the movement from mimesis
      3to mimesis1as arhetoricalmoment. He employs rhetorical terminology as he discusses the techniques that the actual (as opposed to implied) author of a text utilizes in order to conceal “the violence … in the strategy of persuasion” (1988, 3:162). But he abandons this vocabulary when he approaches the reader, opting instead for the language of phenomenology and aesthetics (1988, 3:166–67). In part, he discards the language of the rhetorical tradition because of his limited view of rhetoric's capacity to produce real change in the world. He privileges poetics and philosophy “ontologically” over rhetoric, as Michael Leff has rightly pointed out (1987, 60). Ricoeur valorizes these intellectual traditions according to their ends: poetry results in a cathartic moment that purges old emotions and makes way for new ones, whereas rhetoric results in a persuasive moment that merely crystallizes the preexisting opinions of the audience. According to Ricoeur, these two ends are starkly opposed to one another: “Catharsis must, finally, be opposed to persuasion.” Unlike “all seduction or flattery” (i.e., rhetoric), catharsis stirs the emotions in order to enable “the creative imitation of human action” (1997, 66; see also 1977, 35). However, in the third volume ofTime and Narrative, Ricoeur also admits that the set of effects attached to catharsis is “complex”: “It designates first of all the effect of the work that is more moral than aesthetic: new evaluations, hitherto unheard of norms, are proposed by the work, confronting or shaking current customs” (1988 3:176). Because catharsis possesses a moral component, Ricoeur reasons, it is capable of instructing. Many rhetorical scholars would likely take issue with his assigning such seemingly “persuasive” effects to the realm of poetics rather than rhetoric. Does not Aristotle say that the stirring of emotions is as essential as logical argument to persuasion and judgm~<br>

Journal Title: Shaw<br>
Article Title: Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur<br>

Abstract: Second, like Ricoeur, Shaw posits the poetic imagination, as it reveals itself in religious and other kinds of narrative texts, as the capability best suited for mending the ailing soul and resurrecting the frangible will. The human heart may be deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, as the prophet laments, but for Shaw (and Ricoeur) it is corrigible. Things can and do change; this is the first law of Shavian evolution. And, in Shaw's judgment, there is no more effective catalyst for provoking restorative transformation, for ridding the world of the ignorance that fuels evil, than the making of imaginative art that is aesthetically pleasing. Why is this the case? Because storytelling can break the infernal spell that enthralls the will. Telling stories, Shaw maintains, can deliver the imbecilic will from slavery, thereby restoring enlightened individual autonomy and the untrammeled capacity to act in accordance with higher rather than lower passions.
      
               “Fine art,” he muses, as exemplified for example in his own dramatic works, by implication, “is the only teacher except torture.”50
            
               In this regard, Shaw is very much like the “artist” and “Bohemian” Jesus he commemorates: the sage and commiserative guide who, “when reproached for resorting to the art of fiction when teaching in parables,” justified “himself on the ground that art is the only way in which the people can be taught.”51
            
               Consider the biblical Testaments, once more. Shaw believes they are unreliable historical documents yet nonetheless finds “in their readable parts”—that is, in their tales, fables, and legends—a treasure trove of tropes vital to the species' wellness (the same is true for Ricoeur).52
            
               However, and this is critical, he cautions that “you cannot read the Bible if you have no sense of literary art.”53
            
               Thus, in addition to whatever else they do, insist~<br>

Abstract: To challenge an unexamined critical alignment with Ishmael's limited epistemology in Herman Melville's
         Moby-Dickshows how the placing of confidence in Ishmael as witness to Ahab's monomania leads to a misreading ofMoby-Dick. Ahab lies at the center of a highly developed epistemology that competes with and eludes the narrator's comprehension. The various trophies that appear throughout the text are manifest examples of this other-than-interpretive system of knowing, and Melville uses the act of possessing trophies, particularly the act of eating trophies, to show graphically how such a system works. In other words, Melville has developed a complex epistemological system of ingestion around Ahab to model how language can be materially invested with meaning and how that meaning is performed.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Another way utopian rhetoric might be explained is by reference to the classical rhetorical concept of
      stasis—the stand a rhetor takes in order to form his or her perspective on an issue. This is a concept that implies both place (astatusor stand) and a pervasive act of critical thinking. This theory was introduced during the Roman Republic by Hermagoras and was widely used as a way of defining an issue for legal argumentation. Metaphorically, by viewing a staged event from different locations in the arena surrounding it, the orator may see the situation from multiple points of view and better apprehend the reality of what is at issue. Perhaps the broadest critical thought may be gained by seeking a theoretical stasis, which is metaphorically comparable to the highest ring of seats in the bleachers overlooking any given situation in human affairs. Utopia, then, might be defined as an ethically framed view of what a rhetor imagines or sees from those highest seats.<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>

Abstract: Louis Althusser once invoked “a new philosophy, one which was no longer an
         interpretation, but rather atransformationof the world.”
               Yet Joyce at times reminds us that texts are merely representational and interpretational—they are not literally or fundamentally transformative; they do not in the end build brave new worlds, try though they may. As Roland Barthes would suggest, dominant meanings are privileged in the generation of such connotative semantic structures as literatures and cultures: this process for the most part represents an act of ideological reinforcement, one contained within Orwell's hegemonic whale. At its most radical, therefore, literature may from this perspective advance a work of subversion or deconstruction rather than one of intentional revolutionary construction—the synthesis of a satirical Laputa rather than of a realizable Utopia.138<br>

Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: While Utopias may include all of the qualities associated with
         visionary,visionarylacks those very crucial aspects ofUtopiathat suggest, despite its association with failure and totalitarianism, how it remains a valuable term for describing a constellation of possibility and concerns now normally absent from architecture. The most significant point of distinction between the two terms is that whilevisionaryis bound up withunreality, Utopia's vocation is to act upon reality, at least when it isconcreterather thanabstract(despite its association with impossibility as often constituting the sum total of common understandings of it). The termUtopiamay appear to be too much of a burden, for its bad name and negative associations, to be of much use to the development of enriched methods for inventing more comprehensive architecture and cities; however, no other term captures the dynamic relation between (architectural)formand (social)processas well. Thus, despite its taint, the recuperation ofUtopiaremains a worthwhile project, albeit an apparently quixotic one.<br>

Journal Title: Cultural Critique<br>
Article Title: “Biopolitics: From Surplus Value to Surplus Life.”<br>
Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
Issue: culturalcritique.86.issue-2014<br>
Date: 1 1, 1996<br>
Abstract: Examining Agamben's reception of Hannah Arendt, and especially
         The Human Condition, in his theorization of biopolitics, this essay argues thatHomo Sacer I, by identifying Arendt with a quasi-Straussian “political philosophy,” fails to acknowledge the complexity of her conception of history. Far from simply affirming the normative force of classical political categories, Arendt regards these as emerging from a living power of distinction that thinking, by showing the historical process that brings about the effacement of these distinctions, seeks to bring into view. Nevertheless, Arendt's conception of history is not without contradiction: while arguing that metaphysics went astray by subordinating praxis to poiesis, her very account of history suggests that this subordination is inevitable, since only a “poetic,” indeed violent, act of making a distinction can distinguish praxis from poiesis. Precisely this problem lies at the center of Agamben's early engagement with Arendt inThe Man without Content.<br>
