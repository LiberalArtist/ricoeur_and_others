  Chapter One  The Public and Its Fundamentalists from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt14bs0wp">Superchurch</a><br>
  Abstract: In
                  The Public and Its Problems(1927), John Dewey defended the ideal of strong publics. Challenging Walter Lippmann’s pessimistic assessment that modern states were far too complex to be managed by their citizens, Dewey offered a fluid understanding of democracy and the state that highlighted the critical role of robust “public interests.”¹ Yet, as his title suggests, Dewey’s optimism was tempered by a sense that the modern public was in trouble. In the context of expanding technology, bureaucratization, and a dehumanizing standardization of action and association, the public, he argued, was fragmenting. The problem for Dewey, as Robert Asen argues,<br>

  Chapter Two  The Fundamentals of Revival from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt14bs0wp">Superchurch</a><br>
  Abstract: Revival speech is the foundation of Fundamentalist politics. At the heart of Fundamentalist efforts to remake the public—from abolition and temperance to contemporary struggles against abortion and environmentalism—is a desire to make a world in which the gospel message can be propagated and in which people will be more receptive to revivalist persuasion. For much of Christian history it was assumed that this transformation could only come “in the fullness of time,” which had been preordained by God, but Fundamentalist counterpublicity derives from an emerging belief in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that human actions could affect God’s<br>

  Conclusion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt14bs0wp">Superchurch</a><br>
  Abstract: Fundamentalism is, at its essence, a church movement. By this I mean, as we have explored throughout this study, that Fundamentalist counterpublicity is intimately intertwined with narratives about the survival and status of the Fundamentalist church, a universal idealization of local believing communities. This idealization, in turn, conflates political and spiritual, public and private concerns in Fundamentalist rhetoric. The church marks the boundaries and exclusions of Fundamentalist identity, yet it also builds bridges between private belief and public action. It is in defense and propagation of the Fundamentalist church and the ideal of revivalism that the local church finds its<br>

  INTRODUCTION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt16wd0hf">Invoking the Invisible Hand</a><br>
  Abstract: In this famous passage from
                  The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith employs a powerfully evocative metaphor that bursts through his prose to escape the confines of political economy and obtain the status of a common sense. Resonating across national contexts and historical eras, the metaphor of the “invisible hand” has spoken to many people as an intuitive description of how the world works and an unparalleled prescription for ethical individual action. The invisible hand artfully captures the spirit of a market ethics by insisting that in working for oneself, an individual works for the good of others. The invisible hand<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1tqx76n">To Become an American</a><br>
  Abstract: In his 1915 Flag Day speech, President Wilson argued that the flag was an emblem of the nation’s possibilities. That token reminded citizens that “national life” was created not by abstract ideals, but by the “actual daily endeavors of a great people to do the tasks of the day and live up to the ideals of honesty and righteousness and just conduct.”¹ His words tied behavior to national ideals—an association that heralded the actions of “sober, quiet” citizens, not “swashbuckler[s].”² His goal was to honor the quotidian nature of citizenship, those who did not attract attention to their patriotism<br>

  CHAPTER 4  The House of Labdacus: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt4qt">Intimate Domain</a><br>
  Abstract: Sophocles’s three Theban plays—
                  Antigone, Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus—are not formally a trilogy. Sophocles wrote the plays across the span of his career andAntigone, whose dramatic action comes late in the chronology of Oedipus’s family, was likely written and performed a decade beforeOedipus the Kingand over three decades beforeOedipus at Colonus.¹ As a consequence, the plays that comprise the Theban cycle are most often understood to share a familial narrative drawn from myths rather than a single artistic frame of reference. InOedipus the King, Oedipus fulfills an oracle when he kills his<br>

  CHAPTER 6  Antigone and the Ethics of Intimacy from:

  Abstract: Traumatic violence has caught Oedipus in an ongoing repetition of mimetic rivalry, rooting him in an eternal present. Compellingly demonstrated not only in
                  Oedipus the Kingbut also inOedipus at Colonus, his trauma is visceral. For Oedipus’s suffering is written on his body: his unsightly face, expressed pain, and profound exhaustion offer graphic testimony.¹ Others reflect back to Oedipus their horror: Oedipusisa polluting presence.² Attentive to Oedipus’s distress, in this chapter I examine the representation of trauma as well as actions that promise to break open constraints on Oedipus, permitting the transformation of Oedipus’s memories.³ InOedipus<br>

  Abstract: The father is dead. On this point, Julia Kristeva and René Girard agree. What then can be said any longer of the paternal function? What legacy of the father persists in ongoing economies of sacrifice? And, if the father is not actually dead but only missing in action within the family romance, site of our earliest mimetic rivalries, what role, if any, could a father play in an intimate domain characterized by positive, nonconflictual mimesis? May a father yet live within intimate spaces? Endeavoring to answer these questions, I turn to literature, for Girard and Kristeva agree that literature is<br>

  [II Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Abstract: Critics of realism often point to its impersonality. Realist doctrine presumes an objective world that operates according to natural laws; its first lesson is to look for those constraints on action that will thwart one’s intentions; it culminates in rational analysis. Yet this impersonal model can not be quite right, for it is difficult to think of realism without thinking of realists. Realism is not only a set of precepts but also the personae of Kissinger, Kennan, Niebuhr, Morgenthau, and others. It is both a tradition of political thought and a genealogy of thinkers, each of whom has affected its<br>

  Rethinking Sovereignty from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Author(s) Elshtain Jean Bethke<br>
  Abstract: Sovereignty is the vote. The union card. The insignia of membership in the club. Less exclusive than it once was, the club now encompasses much of the globe and those not members at present continue to seek entry, often utilizing rather impolite methods to that end. Sovereignty remains the “essential qualification for full membership in international society, or, to express the point more comprehensively, the qualification which makes a state eligible for full membership.”¹ Sovereignty names an aspiration; serves as a goad to action; signifies an accomplishment; defines an opposition (state/society); and encodes a legalistic construction (formal sovereignty).<br>

  Metaphors of Prestige and Reputation in American Foreign Policy and American Realism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Author(s) Milliken Jennifer L.<br>
  Abstract: During the Vietnam War, the objectives of American policy toward Vietnam centered not on the strategic importance of the “real estate” involved, but on the effects a defeat in Vietnam would have on the United States’ prestige in the world and its reputation for keeping its commitments.¹ American policy makers spoke often of these considerations. And they measured American actions in Vietnam against them, weighing the costs in lives and resources of deepening intervention against the costs in prestige and reputation of halting that intervention.² If prestige and reputation are, as many claim, the intangible side of power, then in<br>

  [IV Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Abstract: From the perspective of realism, writing policy is the least of the tasks of statecraft. Action, not words, is the credo, and written statements are incidental accoutrements/or means of deception/or the hallmark of institutions that lack the force to back up their pronouncements. Once again, however, the realist is caught unaware. As the essays in this section demonstrate, foreign policy is a mixture of manifold practices of composition. Whether dependent on unacknowledged texts, or extending cultural practices of racial labeling into state action, or rein scribing the general text of modernity on indigenous peoples, or constructing a common narrative through<br>

  Strategic Intelligence and Discursive Realities from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: The realist is right about one thing: Much of the time, international politics boils down to strategy. The calculation of advantage in the game of nations is the first condition, the final necessity, and—not to be underestimated—the continuing attraction for those who presume to be players. Therefore, it is not enough for post-realists to articulate a broader conception of scientific inquiry; if we are to move beyond realism, we shall have to provide decision makers with better instruments for strategic analysis. It may seem that these two objectives are mutually contradictory. For example, the post-realist perspective exemplifies the<br>

  Book Title: The Genesis of Desire-  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Webb Eugene<br>
  Abstract: We seem to be abandoning the codes that told previous generations who they should love. But now that many of us are free to choose whoever we want, nothing is less certain. The proliferation of divorces and separations reveal a dynamic we would rather not see: others sometimes reject us as passionately as we are attracted to them.Our desire makes us sick. The throes of rivalry are at the heart of our attraction to one another. This is the central thesis of Jean-Michel Oughourlian's
      The Genesis of Desire, where the war of the sexes is finally given a scientific explanation. The discovery of mirror neurons corroborates his ideas, clarifying the phenomena of empathy and the mechanisms of violent reciprocity.How can a couple be saved when they have declared war on one another? By helping them realize that desire originates not in the self but in the other. There are strategies that can help, which Dr. Oughourlian has prescribed successfully to his patients. This work, alternating between case studies and more theoretical statements, convincingly defends the possibility that breakups need not be permanent.<br>

  Abstract: What is it that makes for the cohesion of the human race? What can explain the way human beings take such an interest in each other and try to live together? What is it that both draws them together and pushes them apart, unites them and sets them in opposition to one another? These are questions that philosophers, anthropologists, and psychologists have been intrigued by for centuries. Each discipline has been exploring along its own lines the mysterious, universal attraction that human beings exert on each other, and each has tried to find its own answers.

  9  Symbolic Stagnation and Ideological Calcification in Israel from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: The roughly fifteen-year period from Begin’s resignation as prime minister to the election of Benjamin Netanyahu can best be understood as a period of symbolic stagnation. The symbolic equation that had been established in the late 1970s and early 1980s remained firmly in place. Labor’s perspective, especially as enunciated by Shimon Peres, reduced itself to ungrounded pragmatism, what might be called a “Let’s Make a Deal” approach, in which there was no firm ideological principle to guide action. The absence of a grounded perspective on security created a symbolic weakness that became especially obvious in the aftermath of terrorist incidents.<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapters, we have described how the hundred years of conflict between first Zionism and then Israel and the Palestinians has been shaped by the interaction of the symbolic trajectories of Labor and Revisionist Zionism and of the Palestinian people in relation to the events in the world. We now turn to a discussion of their shared symbolic trajectory and an evaluation of their symbolic evolution. At the end of the chapter, we draw implications from the symbolic practices found in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict for Western liberal democratic societies in general and the United States in particular.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt6fv">Christianity and the Mass Media in America</a><br>
  Abstract: I address in this book the relationship between the mass media and Christian ʺtribesʺ in America. At its core this relationship is a dynamic tension between civil generality, on the one hand, and a sectarian particularity, on the other. The Christian metanarrative of transcendence assumes a theistic perspective where God acts in real human history; this God-oriented view of human affairs is never fully in accord with the mainstream mediaʹs own subnarratives of immanence, which morally assume that human action is the beginning and end of history. Nevertheless, religious groups and the media borrow each otherʹs rhetoric both to embrace<br>

  Author(s) Bandera Cesáreo<br>
  Abstract: It happened in the town of East Aurora, in Western New York, where René lived at the time. We had just finished lunch, and he was talking passionately about his work. “I’m convinced,” he said, “I can explain the passage from animal to man.” I will never forget it. My reaction was a bit nervous. I think I told him, only half jokingly, that he should not say such things in public. People might think he was going a little over the edge. But I was impressed by the sheer intellectual power and the scope of what he was explaining<br>

  CHAPTER 1  Phenomenology of Everyday Life: from:

  Abstract: This book is a study of epistemology, which I define as what people know in their daily lives. Becker and Laing are used as starting points for a general depiction of Hispano thought, which includes the study of how language develops an understanding of the world of everyday life. Language usage is the vehicle for understanding how people name events, interactions, attitudes, and values. Understanding how words are used to construct the edifice of everyday life is best accomplished by using concepts from phenomenology.<br>

This chapter discusses a single concept,mortificación,but the method of examination can be used to clarify other terms relating to people’s well-being. What is taken up in these pages is the intentionality of consciousness of the emotion calledmortificación,the experience of being mortified. The consciousness of mortification is experienced in the consciousness of body and in social interaction, what the phenomenologists call intersubjectivity. What is presented in these pages is not new, since it is well known in the<br>

  Book Title: Symposium of the Whole-A Range of Discourse Toward an Ethnopoetics<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Rothenberg Diane<br>
  Abstract: Symposium of the Wholetraces a discourse on poetry and culture that has profoundly influenced the art of our time, with precedents going back two centuries and more. Beginning with a reassertion of the complexity of poetry among peoples long labeled "primitive" and "savage," many recent poets have sought to base a new poetics over the fullest range of human cultures. The attempt to define an ethnopoetics has been significantly connected with the most experimental and future-directed side of Romantic and modern poetry, both in the Western world and, increasingly, outside it. As a visionary poetics and as a politics, this complex redefinition of cultural and intellectual values has involved a rarely acknowledged collaboration between poets and scholars, who together have challenged the narrow view of literature that has excluded so many traditions.In this gathering, the Rothenbergs follow the idea of an ethnopoetics from predecessors such as Vico, Blake, Thoreau, and Tzara to more recent essays and manifestos by poets and social thinkers such as Olson, Eliade, Snyder, Turner, and Baraka. The themes range widely, from the divergence of oral and written cultures to the shaman as proto-poet and the reemergence of suppressed and rejected forms and images: the goddess, the trickster, and the "human universe." The book's three ethnographic sections demonstrate how various poetries are structured and composed, how they reflect meaning and worldview, and how they are performed in cultures where all art may be thought of as art-in-motion.Among the poetries discussed are the language of magic; West African drum language and poetry; the Huichol Indian language of reversals; chance operations in African divination poetry; picture-writings and action-writings from Australia and Africa; and American Indian sacred-clown dramas and traditional trickster narratives. The cumulative effect is a new reading of the poetic past and present-in the editors' words, "a changed paradigm of what poetry was or now could come to be."<br>

  Author(s) DIAMOND STANLEY<br>
  Abstract: At the heart of Diamondʹs engaged and committed anthropology is the image of a ʺsearch for the primitiveʺ—as ʺan attempt to define a primary human potential,ʺ to transcend thereby the ʺprimitive-civilized dichotomyʺ that he traces back to the origins of the political state, with its antagonism to ambivalence and to the concrete instance in favor of a ʺPlatonic abstraction, the essence of civilized modalities of thoughtʺ (Compare Olsonʹs ʺwe have lived long in a generalizing time,ʺ p. 63, above.) More than any contemporary anthropologist of note, with the possible exception of Victor Turner, Diamond insists on an internalized poetics<br>

  Abstract: The conversations between Ogotemmêli, an elder of the Dogon in the Western Sudan, and the ethnographer, Marcel Griaule, took place over thirty-three successive days in October 1946. During that time, according to Griaule, Ogotemmêli ʺlaid bare the framework of a world system: … a cosmogony as rich as that of Hesiod, poet of a dead world, and a metaphysics that has the advantage of being expressed in a thousand rites and actions in the life of a multitude of living beingsʺ (1965: 3).

  Abstract: The interaction between performer and spectator has been an issue of performance theory—Western and other—from Aristotleʹs catharsis to contemporary experiments with participatory theater, etc. (see below, p. 311). In the Papua New Guinea instance following, the projection and expulsion, here of grief and anger, works through a language-centered, basically social and nonmystical exploitation of human feelings—a cathartic geography, a primal poetry of name and place. ʺMoving and violent,ʺ in Schieffelinʹs words, the Gisaro Ceremony is itself part of a larger series of ceremonial events involving ritual exchanges between kinsmen who are living at some distance from each<br>

  Author(s) Hyde Sandra Teresa<br>
  Abstract: When this policeman downplays AIDS, he is not ignoring the emergence of the epidemic; rather, he reflects a recurrent discourse around HIV/AIDS that emphasizes policing and surveillance of China’s border regions.¹ Borders here provide a liminal space where many transactions occur and where the spread of HIV in Sipsongpanna, an autonomous minority prefecture bordering Laos and Burma, symbolizes what Arjun Appadurai (1996) characterizes as late-twentieth-century cross-border migrations. These mass migrations of peoples, goods, services, and now viruses color a moving transnational canvas.

  Abstract: In the preceding chapters I showed that Evangelical religious practice can fit into projects of self-reform among poor Caracas men. But I am yet to address the most difficult question: how can people intentionally adopt a set of religious beliefs and practices in order to confront life problems? The tradition of thought that defines religion and culture in contradistinction to individual rationalistic action can be traced to Durkheim if not earlier. But despite this long-term conceptual trend, the incompatibility of intention and belief has been built on as a presupposition, not established through argument. One exception is the political philosopher<br>

  Book Title: Between One and One Another-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Jackson Michael<br>
  Abstract: Michael Jackson extends his path-breaking work in existential anthropology by focusing on the interplay between two modes of human existence: that of participating in other peoples’ lives and that of turning inward to one’s self. Grounding his discussion in the subtle shifts between being acted upon and taking action, Jackson shows how the historical complexities and particularities found in human interactions reveal the dilemmas, conflicts, cares, and concerns that shape all of our lives. Through portraits of individuals encountered in the course of his travels, including friends and family, and anthropological fieldwork pursued over many years in such places as Sierra Leone and Australia, Jackson explores variations on this theme. As he describes the ways we address and negotiate the vexed relationships between “I” and “we”—the one and the many—he is also led to consider the place of thought in human life.<br>

  Abstract: In the late 1930s, Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead did pioneering ethnographic fieldwork in a Balinese village, using still and movie cameras to capture some of the “intangible aspects” of Balinese culture and everyday life, including trance, eating, gesture, mourning, family interactions, children’s play, art, and shadow-play puppets. In her introductory essay to their 1942 monograph, Mead speaks of a Balinese passion for being part of a noisy, festive crowd. Whether a marketplace, temple court, theatrical event, elaborate carving, or close-packed array of offerings on an altar, “the crowd preference is seen everywhere in Balinese life.¹ Women are said to<br>

  Abstract: Subjectivity is a ″vanishing subject,″ writes Amélie Oksenberg Rorty in this book′s opening chapter. As she traces the history of some of the philosophical insights that have shaped current understandings of subjectivity and the subject, Rorty finds not a progression but various contested movements and fragmentary meanings. Self-awareness has a different philosophical trajectory than individuated perception does; scholars have emphasized a diachronically unified persona and, at times, posed it against a synchronically unified persona; the meanings of emotions, the body, social interactions, and suffering as subjectivity have all been areas of contestation. For example, according to Rorty, ″Where Aristotle finds<br>

  Author(s) DAS RANENDRA K.<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter, we reflect on the meaning and use of diagnostic categories to make illness knowable in the course of social transactions. The ″illness narrative″ has emerged as a classic genre in medical anthropology, and it offers a way of contrasting patient and physician perspectives on illness. The focus on the patient′s construction of her experience is a powerful tool to contest and even reform the power that the expert exercises in clinical encounters. Thus, the emphasis on illness narratives and patients′ ″explanatory models″ serves an important therapeutic purpose: Kleinman (1989) used it with stunning effect in his critique<br>

  Abstract: Science and technology are integral to the definition of reality and to the restructuring of power relations and bodily experience. In
                  The Human Condition, Hannah Arendt argues that in the course of the twentieth century, political action has increasingly focused on the control of natural life and on the fabrication of automatons.¹ Thehomo fabergave way to thehomo laborans—that is, people became ever more involved in mass production and were most concerned with physiological existence. Scientific practices have been central to this transformation. Arendt argues that the experimental process that came to define the natural sciences—″the<br>

  Book Title: After the Massacre-Commemoration and Consolation in Ha My and My Lai<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Faust Drew<br>
  Abstract: Though a generation has passed since the massacre of civilians at My Lai, the legacy of this tragedy continues to reverberate throughout Vietnam and the rest of the world. This engrossing study considers how Vietnamese villagers in My Lai and Ha My-a village where South Korean troops committed an equally appalling, though less well-known, massacre of unarmed civilians-assimilate the catastrophe of these mass deaths into their everyday ritual life. Based on a detailed study of local history and moral practices,
      After the Massacrefocuses on the particular context of domestic life in which the Vietnamese villagers interact with their ancestors on one hand and the ghosts of tragic death on the other. Heonik Kwon explains what intimate ritual actions can tell us about the history of mass violence and the global bipolar politics that caused it. He highlights the aesthetics of Vietnamese commemorative rituals and the morality of their practical actions to liberate the spirits from their grievous history of death.

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pp5kk">A Usable Past</a><br>
  Abstract: The title of this collection is derived from Friedrich Nietzsche’s essay “On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life.”¹ The central argument of this passionate work, judiciously qualified, reflects my own deepest convictions about the value of historical scholarship. Nietzsche opened his essay with a quotation from Goethe: “I hate everything that merely instructs me without augmenting or directly invigorating my activity.” This meant to him that a vital historiography must serve the “life and action” of society. There is, Nietzsche argued, a “natural relationship of an age, a culture, a nation with its history—evoked by hunger, regulated<br>

Over the decades, this book has stimulated philosophical discussion in Germany as no other. Its career is not so much owing to its manifestly hostile stance toward the human sciences, which misunderstand their “understanding” as method; rather, its success can be explained by the relevance of one basic question that Gadamer’s hermeneutics seeks to answer.

  Author(s) BOWIE ANDREW<br>
  Abstract: The contemporary Western philosophical scene can be characterized in terms of divisions and interactions between approaches to philosophy which assume that their task is inextricably linked to the development of the natural sciences and approaches which often regard this assumption with considerable suspicion. Philosophers who adopt the former approach have the obvious advantage that the project of which they see themselves as a part produces more and more results which are in principle—if not in practice—publicly testable and which appear to confirm their underlying assumption that science is converging towards an already constituted reality as it is “in<br>

  Author(s) WARNKE GEORGIA<br>
  Abstract: Richard Posner lists several reasons to think that morality and law are enterprises distinct from literature: the fact that the heinous actions of German lawyers and citizens in the 1930s and 1940s coexisted with Germany’s status as one of the most cultured nations of the world; the circumstance that one of the well-known abilities of many well-read people is to remain insensitive to the suffering of others; the fact that moral atrocities fill the literary canon without affecting either the aesthetic virtues of the work or its reader’s own moral attitudes; and, finally, the distance between the concerns of law<br>

  Chapter 6  A Critique of Gadamer’s Aesthetics from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pp75p">Gadamer’s Repercussions</a><br>
  Author(s) KELLY MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: There are three main critiques through which Hans-Georg Gadamer develops his conception of aesthetics, which has a central role in his philosophical hermeneutics, which in turn is his principal contribution to philosophy in the twentieth century, all of which he amazingly witnessed. He offers a critique of the philosophy of art which regards art as a lie and that denies it is capable of making truth claims; a critique of aesthetic consciousness as an alienated abstraction from the experience of truth in art; and a critique of the subjectivization of modern aesthetics, which he traces back to Immanuel Kant’s

  Book Title: A Problem of Presence-Beyond Scripture in an African Church<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Engelke Matthew<br>
  Abstract: The Friday Masowe apostolics of Zimbabwe refer to themselves as “the Christians who don’t read the Bible.” They claim they do not need the Bible because they receive the Word of God “live and direct” from the Holy Spirit. In this insightful and sensitive historical ethnography, Matthew Engelke documents how this rejection of scripture speaks to longstanding concerns within Christianity over mediation and authority. The Bible, of course, has been a key medium through which Christians have recognized God’s presence. But the apostolics perceive scripture as an unnecessary, even dangerous, mediator. For them, the materiality of the Bible marks a distance from the divine and prohibits the realization of a live and direct faith. Situating the Masowe case within a broad comparative framework, Engelke shows how their rejection of textual authority poses a problem of presence—which is to say, how the religious subject defines, and claims to construct, a relationship with the spiritual world through the semiotic potentials of language, actions, and objects. Written in a lively and accessible style, A Problem of Presence makes important contributions to the anthropology of Christianity, the history of religions in Africa, semiotics, and material culture studies.<br>

  CHAPTER 3  Social Semiotics of Language: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppkdj">Little India</a><br>
  Abstract: Hindu Mauritians make use of a wide repertoire of registers and styles of language in order to construct and inhabit interactional stances and claim ethnic and diasporic identities, which raises the issue of performance and its role in establishing social relationships and distinctions.¹ Building on John Austin’s theory of performance, Judith Butler (1990) has conceptualized social identities as created and reproduced through acts of performance, which in turn depend on the citationality of conventional signs recognized by others. Focusing on these qualities of performance, in this chapter I explore the multiple ways in which Hindu Mauritians both construct and align<br>

  Abstract: In this book I have sought to account for the emergence of diaspora in practical, phenomenological, and ideological terms by analyzing how a sense of being in diaspora is produced by language and its uses among Hindus in Mauritius. In this, I have focused on the indexical and iconic values of linguistic practices whose deployment in everyday social interaction and metapragmatic discourse results in ethnolinguistic forms of belonging pointing to a diasporic homeland. To be meaningful, these practices depend on a whole range of other linguistic practices and valuations among Hindu Mauritians that are not immediately concerned with issues of<br>

  ONE  Anthropology and the Man-Eating Myth from:

  Abstract: As the title of this book,

The “South Seas” of my title is also the product of the European romantic imagination rather than an ethnographic or oceanographic category. In exploring the theme of cannibal talk I am deeply indebted to William Arens’s pioneering work,The Man-Eating Myth: Anthropology and Anthropophagy. Writing many years later and<br>

  Book Title: Late Godard and the Possibilities of Cinema-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Morgan Daniel<br>
  Abstract: With
      Late Godard and the Possibilities of Cinema, Daniel Morgan makes a significant contribution to scholarship on Jean-Luc Godard, especially his films and videos since the late 1980s, some of the most notoriously difficult works in contemporary cinema. Through detailed analyses of extended sequences, technical innovations, and formal experiments, Morgan provides an original interpretation of a series of several internally related films-Soigne ta droite(Keep Your Right Up, 1987),Nouvelle vague(New Wave, 1990), andAllemagne 90 neuf zéro(Germany 90 Nine Zero, 1991)-and the monumental late video work,Histoire(s) du cinéma(1988-1998). Taking up a range of topics, including the role of nature and natural beauty, the relation between history and cinema, and the interactions between film and video, the book provides a distinctive account of the cinematic and intellectual ambitions of Godard's late work. At the same time,Late Godard and the Possibilities of Cinemaprovides a new direction for the fields of film and philosophy by drawing on the idealist and romantic tradition of philosophical aesthetics, which rarely finds an articulation within film studies. In using the tradition of aesthetics to illuminate Godard's late films and videos, Morgan shows that these works transform the basic terms and categories of aesthetics in and for the cinema.<br>

In an exuberant rush of movement and emotion, Surbakti’s (1978:34) account draws the reader into the action as their 1938 Ford coupé convertible speeds back toward the city, loaded now with the disinterred Japanese guns: “Their spirits seethed with joy, as if no power on earth could oppose them.” When a policeman stops the car<br>

At first confined to teaching in his home to a small group of students, he eventually acquired a classroom at the edge of the marketplace (

  Author(s) Hogarth Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Michel Beaujour states his dissatisfaction with the term 'autoportrait' to encapsulate adequately literary endeavours at self-representation.¹ The connection between self-portraiture and painting is evident, and the slippage of the term across mediums leads, in Beaujour's opinion, to deny the specificity of literary works. Yet, referring to works such as Michel de Montaigne's
                  Essais, Michel Leiris'sL'âge d'hommeand Jean-Jacques Rousseau'sRêveries, Beaujour highlights its usefulness as a tool that distinguishes it from autobiographical texts for two fundamental reasons. First, self-portraiture insists upon an absence of continuity, thus defying any clearly arranged order of events that contribute to a personality created<br>

  Author(s) Meneghello Laura<br>
  Abstract: Positivism is normally understood as favoring separation of the humanities and the natural sciences, rather than interaction between them. This is because, around the 1850s, the modern scientific method seemed to provoke a progressive demarcation between the exact sciences and other disciplines. I would like to question this assumption by analyzing the attitude of Jacob Moleschott’s scientific materialism – which has typically been interpreted as one of the most radical movements within Positivism – vis-à-vis the humanities.<br>

  Abstract: Paul’s attempt to resolve factions related to the Lord’s Supper meal at Corinth (1 Cor 11) poses a series of questions. Were the divisions based on ethnic divisions between Judeans and Gentiles, for example, differences in dietary restrictions? Were the factions reflective of social stratification in the Greco-Roman world? Did they mirror tensions in banquet customs in the broader culture? Did the usual living and dining spaces in which Christians gathered contribute to the divisions? What was Paul’s approach for resolving the differences, and was he successful in resolving them?

  Abstract: Many of the difficulties modern readers experience with
                     Paradise Lostare reactions to one character, God the Father. The Father, defending himself and combating Satan, often resembles a flawed human being. Consequently, to presume, as the narrator frequently does, that he manifests supreme goodness seems a mockery of truth. Offended, moderns may retort that, far from being supremely good and deserving worship, the Father deserves to be repudiated as evil. Jung's analytical psychology, however, offers a more refined perception, which promotes a more balanced response.<br>

Meditative and philosophical, often centered on the themes of time and death and on the reactions that these evoke, Brines’s poetry is also marked by the very careful and artistic use of seemingly ordinary language.

  Abstract: “Just as we reject the principle of divorcing faith and works, so we reject the principle and the practice of divorcing the life of faith and the life of study,” wrote Father Leo Ward of the University of Notre Dame in 1961.¹ Describing the ideal for the Catholic school, Ward’s rejection invites reflection on Catholic intellectual life. However, this comment, which might galvanize Catholic professors who perceive themselves as exemplars of the ideal, might also solicit quite a different reaction from those outside the professionally academic arena. The public perception of Catholicism does not always incline toward a scholastic tradition.<br>

  Abstract: This collection of ground-breaking essays considers the many dimensions of prayer: how prayer relates us to the divine; prayer's ability to reveal what is essential about our humanity; the power of prayer to transform human desire and action; and the relation of prayer to cognition. It takes up the meaning of prayer from within a uniquely phenomenological point of view, demonstrating that the phenomenology of prayer is as much about the character and boundaries of phenomenological analysis as it is about the heart of religious life.The contributors: Michael F.

  Abstract: Søren Kierkegaard is widely regarded as an archindividualist with little concern for political and social issues. Furthermore, it is well known that he himself had extremely conservative, even reactionary, political views. He was, for example, not happy about the elimination of absolute monarchy in Denmark in 1848.¹ He also was distinctly unsympathetic with the cause of women’s emancipation, an issue I will discuss in more detail later in this essay.

  Author(s) De Tavernier Johan<br>
  Abstract: The debate about the relevance of biology for ethics dates back to the time of Aristotle. In premodern theologies, nature and personhood have mainly been considered as two complementary notions. On the one hand, the human person was presented as a unique realization of nature; on the other, the human person fulfilled the assumptions that nature had given to him or her by virtue of his or her free will and the possibility for free choice. In other words, nature opens the possibility for free and responsible action. Since Darwin’s

The confessing done under its aegis seems marvelously able to serve as an action of which to be ashamed, and so to provoke more confession. Embarrassment, on the other hand, is tonguetied, an anacoluthon in the grammar of feelings. Where, under influence of timidity, Rousseau manages to blurt something out nonetheless, the effect is not to end the silence but most often to prolong it, rendering the hapless speaker even more incapable of timely speech.

  Abstract: Efforts to develop a phenomenological ethics have until now begun from two altogether different starting points. The first, a tack taken by Max Scheler, Nicolai Hartmann, and others, assumes that values are instantiated in the world and have properties that open them to intuitive grasp. Values are independent in being and accessible to us without being attached to things.¹ The second starts with the embodied existent’s actual encounters with other persons and finds in these transactions an empirical locus for what is prescribed or forbidden in the moral realm.

  Book Title: Interstices of the Sublime: Theology and Psychoanalytic Theory-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Interstices of the Sublime represents a powerful theological engagement with psychoanalytic theory in Freud, Lacan, Kristeva and Zizek, as well as major expressions of contemporary Continental philosophy, including Deleuze, Derrida, Marion, and Badiou. Through creative and constructive psycho-theological readings of topics such as sublimation, schizophrenia, God, and creation ex nihilo, this book contributes to a new form of radical theological thinking that is deeply involved in the world. Here the idea of the Kantian sublime is read into Freud and Lacan, and compared with sublimation. The sublime refers to a conflict of the Kantian faculties of reason and imagination, and involves the attempt to represent what is intrinsically unrepresentable. Sublimation, by contrast, involves the expression and partial satisfaction of primal desires in culturally acceptable terms. The sublime is negatively expressed in sublimation, because it is both the sourceof sublimation as well as that which resists being sublimated. That is, the Freudian sublime is related to the process of sublimation, but it also distorts or disrupts sublimation, and invokes what Lacan calls the Real. The effects of the sublime are not just psychoanalytic but, importantly, theological, because the sublime is the main form that Godtakes in the modern world. A radical postmodern theology attends to the workings of the sublime in our thinking and living, and provides resources to understand the complexity of reality. This book is one of the first sustained theological readings of Lacan in English.<br>

  Author(s) Mugerauer Robert<br>
  Abstract: Among the most challenging issues facing environmental hermeneutics is how to think about person-world relationships in an integrated manner—not by way of conceptually separated natural environments and social spheres—as if there were either some “pure nature” untouched by our interpretations and actions or any human life apart from environmental dynamics. Rather, the interactions of the physiochemical and biological, the individuating and communal dimensions—at all scales—provide our subject matter. For instance, it makes little sense to carry on studying “sense of place” and “identity” as we have been, assuming that these phenomena are stable and that the<br>

  Author(s) Clingerman Forrest<br>
  Abstract: Humans are creatures of the present, and the places that we inhabit oftentimes abet an emphasis on presence. For example, much of our daily interaction occurs in spaces that offer little to discriminate the times of day or season. Artificial lights, heating, air conditioning, walls, and doors maintain a continuous backdrop and regulate the experience of embodiment in space as days and weeks move into the past. Yet we might still find ways to break through mere geometric space, through the anonymity of these situations. In the materiality of these environments, there are fractures and idiosyncrasies that beckon us to<br>

  Abstract: Hildegard of Bingen was deeply engaged with Scripture, and one of the ways to understand her thought is by tracing her treatment of particular figures from the Bible or especially important passages from favored sections of the text. How did she organize her commentaries—written, visual, and sonic? How did she take the common coin of theological understanding and turn it into a practiced, embodied knowing within communal action? These are the questions addressed here, and they are grappled with by focusing primarily upon this theologian/composer/poet’s treatment of the Song of Songs.¹ Hildegard knew the book as a source of<br>

  Abstract: Irreversibility, irrevocability, and imprescriptibility relate to each other as the natural to the ethical to the legal. In a sense, these terms represent a progression of an idea, moving from one category to another, sharpening and narrowing its scope in the procession from nature to ethics to the legal and juridical domains. The idea driving these notions is that of time or, more precisely, the temporal constitution of human affairs. Temporality forms the core of each of these terms individually and in their interrelation. Time is irreversible and subjects all things to its one-way directedness; free will and action take<br>

Superficial though it may be, restlessness is nonetheless also the forerunner of negativity, what he calls elsewhere the “seriousness, the suffering, the patience and work of the negative.”² Finally, for Hegel, this restlessness is the active dimension without which<br>

  Book Title: Divine Enticement: Theological Seductions-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): MACKENDRICK KARMEN<br>
  Abstract: Theology usually appears to us to be dogmatic, judgmental, condescending, maybe therapeutic, or perhaps downright fantastical-but seldom enticing. Divine Enticement takes as its starting point that the meanings of theological concepts are not so much logical, truth-valued propositions-affirmative or negative-as they are provocations and evocations. Thus it argues for the seductiveness of both theology and its subject-for, in fact, infinite seduction and enticement as the very sense of theological query. The divine name is one by which we are drawn toward the limits of thought, language, and flesh. The use of language in such conceptualization calls more than it designates. This is not a flaw or a result of vagueness or imprecision in theological language but rather marks the correspondence of such language to its subject: that which, outside of or at the limit of our thought, draws us as an enticement to desire, not least to intellectual desire. Central to the text is the strange semiotics of divine naming, as a call on that for which there cannot be a standard referent. The entanglement of sign and body, not least in interpretations of the Christian incarnation, both grounds and complicates the theological abstractions. A number of traditional notions in Christian theology are reconceived here as enticements, modes of drawing the desires of both body and mind: faith as "thinking with assent"; sacraments as "visible words" read in community; ethics as responsiveness to beauty; prayer as the language of address; scripture as the story of meaning-making. All of these culminate in a sense of a call to and from the purely possible, the open space into which we can be enticed, within which we can be divinely enticing.<br>

  Book Title: Cathedrals of Bone: The Role of the Body in Contemporary Catholic Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Waldmeir John C.<br>
  Abstract: The metaphor of the Church as a bodyhas shaped Catholic thinking since the Second Vatican Council. Its influence on theological inquiries into Catholic nature and practice is well-known; less obvious is the way it has shaped a generation of Catholic imaginative writers. Cathedrals of Bone is the first full-length study of a cohort of Catholic authors whose art takes seriously the themes of the Council: from novelists such as Mary Gordon, Ron Hansen, Louise Erdrich, and J. F. Powers, to poets such as Annie Dillard, Mary Karr, Lucia Perillo, and Anne Carson, to the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright John Patrick Shanley. Motivated by the inspirational yet thoroughly incarnational rhetoric of Vatican II, each of these writers encourages readers to think about the human body as a site-perhaps the most important site-of interaction between God and human beings. Although they represent the body in different ways, these late-twentieth-century Catholic artists share a sense of its inherent value. Moreover, they use ideas and terminology from the rich tradition of Catholic sacramentality, especially as it was articulated in the documents of Vatican II, to describe that value. In this way they challenge the Church to take its own tradition seriously and to reconsider its relationship to a relatively recent apologetics that has emphasized a narrow view of human reason and a rigid sense of orthodoxy.<br>

  Abstract: It is as clear for the writers to be discussed here as it was for Leo XIII that, when one brings the strongest attributes of imaginative literature to bear directly upon Catholic faith and practice, liturgy becomes the primary site of interaction. Moreover, when that literature is dedicated to representing the body, the possibilities for a sustained and compelling correspondence increase significantly. During the drama of the Mass, individual bodies join symbolically and actually with each other and with the body of Christ. As the novelist Ron Hansen says, Catholics<br>

  Abstract: I wish here to explore the relation between our desire to exist meaningfully through action and the question that this poses for philosophy. My thesis is simple: We are erotic beings. Our Eros, however, is neither divine nor animal. It is distinctively human: We are beings who seek meaning imaginatively through each other, and the locus of this transformative encounter is the community. This model of human nature contrasts with the dominant view in analytic philosophy of humans as “minds” consisting of “states,” as purely “epistemic subjects” whose primary function is thought to lie in generating propositional claims about the<br>

  Abstract: Pragmatism originated as a movement that sought to clarify meaning in terms of action. We recall the phrasing of Peirce’s famous maxim: “Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.”¹ The effort to clarify this maxim might be said to constitute the subsequent history of pragmatism. Whereas there was a tendency in pragmatism to interpret consequentialism in a positivistic sense, it was systematically avoided by its main developers, Peirce, James, Mead, and Dewey, because they<br>

Among the throngs that fill the philosophical bestiary of the twentieth century, Santayana may be the one genuine contemplative of note. The majority of doctrines dominant in the century have been directed either toward the goal of action (Marxism, pragmatism, existentialism) or the problem of knowledge, truth, and meaning (pragmaticism, positivism, analytic philosophy, phenomenology).

  Abstract: According to Aristotle’s

Indeed, we are encouraged as philosophers to respect this most serious and fundamental principle, namely, that “the same thing cannot at the same time and in the same respect both belong and not belong to the same object.”¹ Aristotle certainly refuses to take the matter lightly, providing eight different proofs and maintaining that the principle holds as a law with absolute psychological as well as ontological governance. With regard to the psychological application of the law, Aristotle insists that our thought and our actions<br>

  Book Title: Reading the Allegorical Intertext: Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: Judith H. Anderson conceives the intertext as a relation between or among texts that encompasses both Kristevan intertextuality and traditional relationships of influence, imitation, allusion, and citation. Like the Internet, the intertext is a state, or place, of potential expressed in ways ranging from deliberate emulation to linguistic free play. Relatedly, the intertext is also a convenient fiction that enables examination of individual agency and sociocultural determinism. Anderson's intertext is allegorical because Spenser's Faerie Queene is pivotal to her study and because allegory, understood as continued or moving metaphor, encapsulates, even as it magnifies, the process of signification. Her title signals the variousness of an intertext extending from Chaucer through Shakespeare to Milton and the breadth of allegory itself. Literary allegory, in Anderson's view, is at once a mimetic form and a psychic one-a process thinking that combines mind with matter, emblem with narrative, abstraction with history. Anderson's first section focuses on relations between Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Spenser's The Faerie Queene, including the role of the narrator, the nature of the textual source, the dynamics of influence, and the bearing of allegorical narrative on lyric vision. The second centers on agency and cultural influence in a variety of Spenserian and medieval texts. Allegorical form, a recurrent concern throughout, becomes the pressing issue of section three. This section treats plays and poems of Shakespeare and Milton and includes two intertextually relevant essays on Spenser.How Paradise Lost or Shakespeare's plays participate in allegorical form is controversial. Spenser's experiments with allegory revise its form, and this intervention is largely what Shakespeare and Milton find in his poetry and develop. Anderson's book, the result of decades of teaching and writing about allegory, especially Spenserian allegory, will reorient thinking about fundamental critical issues and the landmark texts in which they play themselves out.<br>

  Abstract: In
                  King LearandOthello, when Shakespeare’s anguished protagonists memorably invoke patience, they do so with an unwitting irony that plays on the linguistic genealogy of this virtue, on its combination of passion and passivity. More than a half century later, Milton’s poetry recalls the centrality and complexity of Shakespeare’s engagement with patience but goes beyond it to render the traditional significance of this virtue dynamic and revisionary. In the unifying insight of the blind poet, patience becomes action, rather than simply giving way to action or being replaced by it.

  Book Title: Edgar Allen Poe: A Phenomenological View-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): HALLIBURTON DAVID<br>
  Abstract: The book begins with a methodological chapter that sets out the assumptions and procedures of the approach. This is followed by analyses of Poe's major works, exploring such special problems as Poe's treatment of the material world, including technology; the interrelation of body and consciousness; poetic voice; attitudes toward women; and the will to affirmation, plenitude, and unity. The center of interest is neither Poe's biography nor environment but always the meaning of Poe's words. Because these works are shaped by a single imagination and because they are experienced in time, as a process, each work has its own "way of going." The aim of the interpretation is to find this way and go along with it; to live each work dynamically, as it "happens," while tracing its interaction with other works.<br>

  Book Title: Muscially Sublime: Indeterminacy, Infinity, Irresolvability-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wurth Kiene Brillenburg<br>
  Abstract: Musically Sublime rewrites musically the history and philosophy of the sublime. Music enables us to reconsider the traditional course of sublime feeling on a track from pain to pleasure. Resisting the notion that there is a single format for sublime feeling, Wurth shows how, from the mid eighteenth century onward, sublime feeling is, instead, constantly rearticulated in a complex interaction with musicality. Wurth takes as her point of departure Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment and Jean-Francois Lyotard's aesthetic writings of the 1980s and 1990s. Kant framed the sublime narratively as an epic of self-transcendence. By contrast, Lyotard sought to substitute open immanence for Kantian transcendence, yet he failed to deconstruct the Kantian epic. The book performs this deconstruction by juxtaposing eighteenth- and nineteenth-century conceptions of the infinite, Sehnsucht, the divided self, and unconscious drives with contemporary readings of instrumental music. Critically assessing Edmund Burke, James Usher, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Novalis, Friedrich Holderlin, Arthur Schopenhauer, Richard Wagner, and Friedrich Nietzsche, this book re-presents the sublime as a feeling that defers resolution and hangs suspended between pain and pleasure. Musically Sublime rewrites the mathematical sublime as differance, while it redresses the dynamical sublime as trauma: unending, undetermined, unresolved. Whereas most musicological studies in this area have focused on traces of the Kantian sublime in Handel, Haydn, and Beethoven, this book calls on the nineteenth-century theorist Arthur Seidl to analyze the sublime of, rather than in, music. It does so by invoking Seidl's concept of formwidrigkeit ("form-contrariness") in juxtaposition with Romantic piano music, (post)modernist musical minimalisms, and Lyotard's postmodern sublime. It presents a sublime of matter, rather than form-performative rather than representational. In doing so, Musically Sublime shows that the binary distinction Lyotard posits between the postmodern and romantic sublime is finally untenable.<br>

  Author(s) Smith Michael B.<br>
  Abstract: Space is not the name of a thing, but of that outside of things thanks to which their distinctness is granted them. Things could not be distinct in nature if they did not also occupy distinct places. If I am taking the tree’s place (and not just “replacing it”), there is neither tree nor human being, but something else: a sylvan divinity, for example. When the distinction of place is hindered or rejected, a crushing, a constriction, and a suffocation is produced. That is what we can see in those geological folds and contractions out of which come igneous fusions,<br>

  Book Title: Missing Link-The Evolution of Metaphor and the Metaphor of Evolution<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): DONALDSON JEFFERY<br>
  Abstract: We look for missing links in the sciences and humanities, but the essential missing link - metaphor - is always in front of us. In Missing Link, Jeffery Donaldson unites literary criticism and evolutionary and cognitive science to show how metaphor has been with us since the beginning of time as a seed in the nature of things. With examples from centuries of poets, critics, philosophers, and scientists, he details how metaphor is a chemistry, an exchange of energies forming and dissolving, and an openness in the spaces between things. He considers the ways in which DNA learns how to liken things that have been, how mutation makes errors and then tries them on, and how evolution is hypothesis - nature's way of "thinking more." The mind is a matrix of relations: neural synapses cascade into ever-changing pathways and patterns. Metaphor is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. It is the unbroken thread between matter and spirit. Whether offering analysis of a turn of phrase or chemical reaction, Missing Link presents a vision of literature that is also a vision of the cosmos, and vice versa. It enters the debate between evolution and religion, and challenges scientists, literary theorists, and religious advocates to rethink the relations between their disciplines.<br>

The former stands for a seemingly autonomous process of globe shrinking or stretching (depending on how you look at it), whereas the latter indicates a self-conscious extraction and movement of profit from some places to others through political domination and coercion more than economic rationality.

  Abstract: Philosophical anthropology. The label conjures up a hybrid few have heard of, and for many of those, a hybrid of questionable viability. Indeed, the words sound a flat thud in the ears of most philosophers and a rude intrusion in the ears of most anthropologists, who hardly want anything to do with it.

Although his critiques of composition and theory seem justified, it is far from clear (1) that the “actor” in theory is analogous to the “performer” in music or that the theorist is thus parallel to a composer, (2) that allowing performers more freedom in playing does what Bell seems to want, and (3) that sociology can do much with an attention to<br>

First, they are historical texts that arose in a particular time and cultural space and that are part of a history of tradition.

  Book Title: The Executed God-The Way of the Cross in Lockdown America<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Taylor Mark Lewis<br>
  Abstract: The new edition of Mark Lewis Taylor’s award-winning The Executed God is both a searing indictment of the structures of “Lockdown America" and a visionary statement of hope. It is also a call for action to Jesus followers to resist US imperial projects and power. Outlining a “theatrics of state terror," Taylor identifies and analyzes its instruments—mass incarceration, militarized police tactics, surveillance, torture, immigrant repression, and capital punishment—through which a racist and corporatized Lockdown America enforces in the US a global neoliberal economic and political imperialism. Against this, The Executed God proposes a “counter-theatrics to state terror," a declamation of the way of the cross for Jesus followers that unmasks the powers of US state domination and enacts an adversarial politics of resistance, artful dramatic actions, and the building of peoples’ movements. These are all intrinsic to a Christian politics of remembrance of the Jesus executed by empire. Heralded in its first edition, this new edition is thoroughly revised, updated, and expanded, offering a demanding rethinking and recreating of what being a Christian is and of how Christianity should dream, hope, mobilize, and act to bring about what Taylor terms “a liberating material spirituality" to unseat the state that kills.<br>

  Abstract: The way of the cross is adversarial, yes, but the embodied expression of that way under conditions of empire is neither violent tactical maneuvering nor passive endurance. Both of these responses may be necessary in certain situations. But the binary of violence/nonviolence is not the most important consideration when weighing how to express an adversarial politics. The greater question is how effective action is possible—action that will, in fact, resist and transform. This chapter turns to the second defining characteristic of Jesus’ way of the cross after its adversarial politics: the forging of dramatic action. It points to the<br>

In a book, perhaps, we can measure ourselves and the needs of our era—exposing, feeling, and thinking through the injuries and pain created by structural violence, “fingering its jagged grain,” as Ralph Ellison is oft-quoted to have said of the blues’ musical impulse.¹ That impulse will be needed if we are<br>

This desert sojourner’s conviction that he was raised in a creedal vacuum, without fixed beliefs – a personal history ‘clean of any ideology’ – is optimistic but, as he suspects, not entirely credible.

The attempt to explain language in representational terms in the empiricist tradition that eventually leads to analytical philosophy, and the understanding of language as a form of social action and as constitutive of the world we inhabit in the hermeneutic tradition give rise to very different conceptions of music. One paradigmatic contrast has emerged in the preceding chapters, which can somewhat crudely be summarised as follows. On the one hand, music can be regarded as a deficient<br>

Interacting with machines, at whatever scale, is therefore, and

Do their first forays into fiction ‘reveal’, as Kuno Schuhmann (2001: 75) puts it, ‘a personality that may be more carefully hidden in later texts? Does the first shaping of themes throw additional light on the later novels?’ In relation to A. S.

  Abstract: The contributors uncover the narratives at the center of their essays through qualitative interviews, ethnographic fieldwork, and written archives, and they scrutinize narrative structure and meaning by analyzing genres, plots, metaphors, and other components of storytelling. In doing so, they reveal the cognitive, ideological, and institutional mechanisms by which narratives promote harmful action. Finally, they consider how offenders' narratives are linked to and emerge from those of conventional society or specific subcultures. Each chapter reveals important insights and elements for the development of a framework of narrative criminology as an important approach for understanding crime and criminal justice. An unprecedented and landmark collection,

Everyday life behind bars has numerous ways of communicating that most basic of the prison’s messages to its prisoners: you are not to be trusted. All forms of interaction in the institution will be structured by prison officers’ professional focus on the worst case, and their multiple efforts to keep it from becoming reality.

  Abstract: Rather than approach offenders’ narratives as a record of events, narrative criminologists see talk as a form of social action (Presser 2009; Sandberg 2010, 2011). Building on Sykes and Matza’s techniques of neutralization, research in this vein has mainly explored narrative in the construction of deviant or desisting identity (Maruna and Copes 2005; see also Copes et al. 2008; Sandberg 2011; Topalli 2005). Although important developments have been made, women offenders’ narratives have been somewhat absent.¹ They arguably warrant special consideration: women’s offending is less common, their offending careers are shorter, and they are less likely to have co-offenders than<br>

  Abstract: It would be easy enough to categorize narrative criminology as an organizational advance, an assembling of research involving stories related to crime, and to pronounce once again the importance of stories as data. But narrative criminology is far more innovative and vital than that, a fact underscored by the studies shared in this book. Narrative criminology conceives of a world where experience is always storied and where action advances or realizes the story. This vision produces new understandings of harm as well as new and difficult questions.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt163t8s9">Between the 'Mysticism of Politics' and the 'Politics of Mysticism'</a><br>
  Abstract: Not only are the terms, ‘the politics of mysticism’ and ‘the mysticism of politics’ saddled with the complexity of defining words, but the historical tendency to view ‘the mystical’ and ‘the political’ as pure dualities also places questions on the dialectic that is being proposed. In these dualities mystical experience and political action are intimated, most often, as in a certain opposition one to the other. In particular, this chapter will identify the following antecedent dualities: Augustine’s ‘two cities’ and Luther’s ‘two kingdoms’; the religious ‘mystical’ and ‘prophetic’ typology of Friedrich Heiler; and the mystical and political divide as found<br>

  Chapter Eight  Innovation, Undecidability and Patience from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt163t981">In-Between God</a><br>
  Abstract: Innovation derives from the Latin
                  innovare, meaning to renew or alter; essentially to bring in or introduce something new. Hence we may speak of novel practices and/or doctrines. It is a controversial feature of the life of the Christian church. Innovation is almost endemic to Christianity. The very nature of the gospel suggests that notions of surprise and novelty belong to the life of discipleship because they first inhere in the very character and action of God. The great surprising act of God in the incarnation and resurrection of the Messiah sets the pattern for the emergence of novelty at<br>

  Rising Sea, Drifting Bones, Dispersing Homes from:

  Abstract: This chapter engages some of the trials with which the rising sea gifts islanders in Oceania, and beyond.¹ Whether climate change or global warming causes the sea to rise, and rise, perpetuated by human action or not, is beyond the focus of this chapter. My concern is with an existential predicament: the sea is rising on the shores of Oceania and this pushes islanders (1) to rethink our beliefs and understandings, (2) to grieve at the unearthing of the remains of ancestors from beach-front graves, and (3) to relocate our understandings of homes and gathering sites because they are no<br>

  Abstract: In

According to Iser, the ‘implied reader’ cannot be located within the text or even outside of the text in actual readers, but must be found in the ‘interaction between text and reader’.² In this interaction, ‘text’ and ‘reader’<br>

  Book Title: Child Sexual Abuse, Society, and the Future of the Church-  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): Regan Hilary D<br>
  Abstract: In November 2012 the Australian federal government announced the establishment of a ‘Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse’. This Royal Commission was set up after many years of reports of sexual abuse in Australia within religious institutions of various Christian churches, some state government inquiries and in the context of inquiries in other countries, most notably Ireland. The Royal Commission began its first hearing in April 2013. It has been forecast that the Commission will be hearing submissions for a number of years from witnesses, both from those who ask to speak to the Royal Commissioners and from those who will be asked to appear before the Commission. At the same time as the establishment of the Royal Commission, the Catholic Church in Australia established a Truth, Justice and healing Council to oversee the Catholic Church’s engagement with the Royal Commission. This collection brings together essays from biblical scholars, a church historian, theologians, ministers of religion from a number of churches, lawyers and a psychologist. They each address the issues of sexual abuse, society and the church in the context of the Australian inquiries. The volume ends with an overview of the processes engaged with by the Catholic Church and the State in the Republic of Ireland and reactions to these inquiries. The volume of essays considers sexual abuse from the perspective of the victims. What is to be done about the mess we are in over clerical sexual abuse? That question is puzzling concerned people today. This diverse collection offers them profitable reading, wherever they are coming from. It has enough useful suggestions and ideas to stimulate the calm, intelligent discussion now demanded by our communities.’ Edmund Campion, Australian Catholic University.<br>

  Author(s) Babie Paul<br>
  Abstract: The 2012 establishment of the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse (‘the Royal Commission’)¹ focuses, for the first time, national attention on the ways in which religious organisations have dealt with matters that involve their interaction with the broader Australian society and its legal structures. The concern, seemingly well-founded, which lies behind the establishment of the Royal Commission, is that many religious organisations acted in ways which at best ignored and at worst actively sought to circumvent and pervert the operation of the law related to the abuse of children and others at the hands of<br>

  Abstract: The beauty of a volume like this for someone like myself, whether collected essays or selected writings, is to see the struggle unfolding over a lifetime with fundamental issues of Christian faith and issues of the Older Testament, driven by the pressure of the biblical text.¹ Perhaps the younger me is best characterised by the reaction of the assembled students of the United Faculty of Theology to my selfdescription as a ‘simple Bible Christian’, a statement that was greeted with a wave of spontaneous laughter.

  Abstract: Something of a paradigm shift has been in the making for a while in biblical studies. A future shape has yet to jell. The old historical-critical analysis has not been generating new life for a long time.¹ Other approaches have not so far struck lasting root. The interaction of developmental (cf diachronic) reading and interpretational (cf synchronic) reading is under way, but far from any agreed integration.

  Form-Criticism’s Future from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt163t9t9">Opening the Bible</a><br>
  Abstract: Form criticism had a meteoric rise in the early part of the twentieth century and fell from favour toward its end. For some, the future of form criticism is not an issue: it has none. But if form criticism embodies an essential insight, it will continue. If it is to continue in the reflective and thinking world of academic scholarship, the attraction that triggered its rise, the flaws that caused its fall, and the aspects that assure its future all need to be analysed. So this article will have three parts: the past—the rise and fall of form criticism;<br>

  Abstract: A part from a detour in defence of Job last year, my contributions to these gatherings have been focused on the appropriateness of the language we use when speaking about God. In 1985, I entered a plea for the right of the human analogy to be given full value as a paradigm for language about God: in a nutshell, it is unlikely to be appropriate or helpful to speak of God’s action upon a human person in ways that could not be applied to the action of another human person. In 1986, I appealed to the story of David and<br>

  Book Title: Redemptive Hope: From the Age of Enlightenment to the Age of Obama-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Timothy C.<br>
  Abstract: This is a book about the need for redemptive narratives to ward off despair and the dangers these same narratives create by raising expectations that are seldom fulfilled. The quasi-messianic expectations produced by the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, and their diminution, were stark reminders of an ongoing struggle between ideals and political realities. Redemptive Hope begins by tracing the tension between theistic thinkers, for whom hope is transcendental, and intellectuals, who have striven to link hopes for redemption to our intersubjective interactions with other human beings. Lerner argues that a vibrant democracy must draw on the best of both religious thought and secular liberal political philosophy. By bringing Richard Rorty's pragmatism into conversation with early-twentieth-century Jewish thinkers, including Martin Buber and Ernst Bloch, Lerner begins the work of building bridges, while insisting on holding crucial differences in dialectical tension. Only such a dialogue, he argues, can prepare the foundations for modes of redemptive thought fit for the twenty-first century.<br>

  Book Title: Thou Shalt Not Kill: A Political and Theological Dialogue-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sitze Adam<br>
  Abstract: In this fascinating and rare little book, a leading Italian feminist philosopher and the Archbishop of Milan face off over the contemporary meaning of the biblical commandment not to kill. The result is a series of erudite and wide-ranging arguments that move from murder and suicide to just war and drone strikes, from bioethics and biopolitics to hermeneutics and philology, from Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer to Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault, from Torah and Scripture to art and literature, from the essence of human dignity and the paradoxes of fratricide to engagements with Levinasian ethics. Less a direct debate than a disputation in the classical sense, Thou Shalt Not Kill proves to be a searching meditation on one of the unstated moral premises shared by otherwise bitterly opposed political factions. It will stimulate the mind of the novice while also reminding more advanced readers of the necessity and desirability of thinking in the present.<br>

  Author(s) Muench Paul<br>
  Abstract: Doing philosophy may be hazardous to your health, resulting in a condition of “absentmindedness” or distraction in which you forget yourself.¹ In such a case, philosophy becomes an activity that positively interferes with the age-old Socratic task of attending to and caring for the self, and may even have the opposite effect of making people “incompetent to act” (CUP, 1:135/SKS 7, 126). If you are the type of person who is drawn to philosophy and perhaps insufficiently aware of its hazards, then what could be more valuable than a book that seeks to alert you to these dangers, and in<br>

As Derrida sees it, this has important connections with mortality, since (following Heidegger)² it is through developing the correct attitude toward my own mortality—and consequently my singularity as this particular individual—that I am able to lead an authentic life. In effect, I take Derrida to be suggesting that pursuing ethical considerations is an attempt to avoid confronting one’s<br>

  Abstract: This chapter draws on fieldwork in an Aboriginal Australian urban radio station in order to explore some experiential aspects of vocal cultural production and the forms of mediatized self-abstraction it entails.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzb9c">Gadamer</a><br>
  Abstract: To understand means to apply; understanding is always put into practice and thus becomes a form of action in itself, in the world, and with others. It should come as no surprise that hermeneutics, as it recuperates the theoretical as well as practical value it has had since antiquity, develops in proximity to
                  practical philosophy.Gadamer emphasizes this point in his 1972 essay, “Hermeneutics as Practical Philosophy” (RAS88–112/VZW78–109).

  Abstract: When we try to answer the question whether philosophy, feminism, and faith can be reconciled, we see that many people have attempted the reconciliation, and quite a few have done so to their own satisfaction. Despite the multitude of personally satisfying accounts, no universally accepted reconciliation has ever been constructed. To argue for the compatibility of philosophy, feminism, and faith, then, is not a mathematical sort of task—one that can be completed to the satisfaction of some professionally constituted public. Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that neither philosophy nor feminism is a unitary body of thought.<br>

  Book Title: Material Feminisms-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hekman Susan<br>
  Abstract: Harnessing the energy of provocative theories generated by recent understandings of the human body, the natural world, and the material world, Material Feminisms presents an entirely new way for feminists to conceive of the question of materiality. In lively and timely essays, an international group of feminist thinkers challenges the assumptions and norms that have previously defined studies about the body. These wide-ranging essays grapple with topics such as the material reality of race, the significance of sexual difference, the impact of disability experience, and the complex interaction between nature and culture in traumatic events such as Hurricane Katrina. By insisting on the importance of materiality, this volume breaks new ground in philosophy, feminist theory, cultural studies, science studies, and other fields where the body and nature collide.<br>

  Abstract: New materialists are fond of lists. Consider, as a first example, the beginning of Myra Hird’s 2009 review essay on “material feminism”: “Trans-corporeality. Entanglement. Meeting-with. Matter. Nonhuman. Causality. Intra-action. Disclosure. Agential realism.” Each of the terms on this list names a concept central to the “emerging field” Hird is preparing to survey (329). Most of them have come to occupy an equally important position in the discourse of new materialist theory broadly speaking, which draws on material feminism but also taps additional sources, such as phenomenology and the philosophy of science, for ideas.<br>

  Abstract: Paracelsus (1493–1541) experienced the natural world as a complex order of sympathies, resonances, magnetic attractions, and analogies (Pagel 52).¹ Though Paracelsus is variously categorized as physician, philosopher, alchemist, herbalist, I like to think of him as a plant physiognomist, as, that is, a practitioner of the art of discovering temperament and character from outward appearance. Each natural object bore for him a divine “signature” encoded in the thing’s shape, smell, texture, color, posture. This equivocal sign served as a spur to the human perceiver to engage in the artistry—the speculative thinking and practical experimentation—that would give determinacy<br>

As Charles Kahn has pointed out, every age has “projected its own meaning and its own preoccupations onto the text of Heraclitus.”¹ His fragments have had a peculiar attraction in modern times.

  Abstract: Modern theology has focused upon the last words of Christ in Mark 15:34—“My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?”—as a key locus of Christological dispute and interpretation.¹ Revisionist Enlightenment historians such as Reimarus have perceived in this verse an “authentic saying” of Jesus that predates the redaction of the Gospels. For him it is the indication of the Nazarene’s disillusioned apocalypticism.² Protestant theologians, meanwhile, have found warrant in this Scriptural text for a theology of Christ’s “god-forsakenness” experienced for us as a dimension of redemption. For Calvin it indicates Christ’s state of abandonment as an “experience<br>

  Author(s) McGrath James F.<br>
  Abstract: The material found in John 2:13–22, depicting Jesus’ action in the temple and the saying about its being destroyed and rebuilt in three days, is a key point of intersection between the Gospel of John, the Synoptics, and the Gospel of Thomas. As such, it provides one of the relatively few places where questions of John, Jesus, and history can be discussed, as it were, “synoptically.” Because of this multiple attestation, there are very few scholars who dispute that Jesus engaged in

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16ptndz">John, Jesus, and History, Volume 2</a><br>
  Author(s) Miller Susan<br>
  Abstract: The account of the meeting of Jesus and the Samaritan woman (John 4:4–42) portrays the positive response of a Samaritan woman to Jesus’ mission. The Samaritan woman recognizes Jesus as the Messiah, and she then tells others in her town about Jesus. As a result of her actions, Jesus stays two days in the Samaritan town, and more Samaritans come to faith in him. There is no account of a Samaritan mission, however, in the other Gospels. Mark does not make any reference to the Samaritans, while Matthew includes a prohibition to the disciples not to enter a city<br>

  Aspects of Historicity in John 1–4: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16ptndz">John, Jesus, and History, Volume 2</a><br>
  Author(s) Koester Craig R.<br>
  Abstract: The manner in which modern scholars investigate questions of historicity is one that the Fourth Evangelist would find peculiar. In contemporary research, the historical Jesus is the pre-Easter Jesus, and questions of historicity focus on how much we can know about the ministry of Jesus prior to his death. The writer of the Fourth Gospel, however, assumes that truly understanding the pre-Easter Jesus involves a post-Easter perspective. At points this Gospel specifically draws later insights into the meaning of Jesus’ words and actions and acknowledges that Jesus said and did things that were not understood prior to his resurrection (John<br>

  [Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt175x2ht">Democracy, Culture, Catholicism: Voices from Four Continents</a><br>
  Abstract: When looking at the relationships between democracy, culture, and Catholicism within the Lithuanian context, what immediately comes to the fore are interactions characterized by trauma, distrust, and tragedy. The origins of this bleak picture can be traced back to Lithuania’s history, to the decades this nation and its people spent alternating under the rule of Soviet, Nazi, and (again) Soviet occupation. The themes of trauma and distrust come out clearly in the chapters included in this section. The concepts of democracy, culture, and Catholicism, so foundational to the objectives of this book, remain indeterminate in the Lithuanian context. This is<br>

  Christianity and Politics in Post-Soviet Lithuania: from:

  Author(s) Putinaitė Nerija<br>
  Abstract: Stereotypes about Christianity and attitudes of Christians toward public action were engrained into the minds of Lithuanian people during the Soviet regime and are evident in contemporary Lithuania. As clearly outlined in the chapters by Streikus and Šimkunas, the Soviet ideological apparatus sought to annihilate the influence of Christianity from the lives of people. From the beginning of the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in 1940–1941, and especially from 1944 until Stalin’s death in 1953, the Christian churches in Lithuania were brutally attacked as “the biggest obstacle to the smooth sovietisation of the occupied country.”¹ Many priests were deported, parishioners<br>

  Author(s) Trelles Jorge Aragón<br>
  Abstract: Research conducted in some Latin American countries has shown the existence of connections between self-reported levels of religious devoutness, church attendance, and specific political attitudes and orientations (e.g., trust in the government or satisfaction with the democracy). In light of this, the goal sought in this chapter is twofold. First, to contribute to a better understanding of the way religion can be considered as a political factor in Latin America. Second, through analyzing public opinion data, to provide an initial answer to the question as to whether Peru is a country where some religious beliefs and practices are associated with<br>

  Author(s) Sullivan Barry<br>
  Abstract: No government can operate entirely in the round. Some amount of secrecy is both necessary and inevitable.¹ But secrecy is fundamentally an affront to representative democracy, and it always exacts a cost. Secrecy engenders distrust, frustrates accountability, encourages arbitrary action, compromises the value of citizen participation, and disrespects human dignity. Secrecy also adds to the sense that government is distant and unresponsive. Institutions practice secrecy at their peril, yet many yield to its siren song. Institutions practice secrecy to various degrees and for various reasons: sometimes leaders or others have something terrible to hide, but often it simply seems easier<br>

  Abstract: In the

The cube, just like the Russian game

  Book Title: Mind in Architecture-Neuroscience, Embodiment, and the Future of Design<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Pallasmaa Juhani<br>
  Abstract: Although we spend more than ninety percent of our lives inside buildings, we understand very little about how the built environment affects our behavior, thoughts, emotions, and well-being. We are biological beings whose senses and neural systems have developed over millions of years; it stands to reason that research in the life sciences, particularly neuroscience, can offer compelling insights into the ways our buildings shape our interactions with the world. This expanded understanding can help architects design buildings that support both mind and body. In
      Mind in Architecture, leading thinkers from architecture and other disciplines, including neuroscience, cognitive science, psychiatry, and philosophy, explore what architecture and neuroscience can learn from each other. They offer historical context, examine the implications for current architectural practice and education, and imagine a neuroscientifically informed architecture of the future. Architecture is late in discovering the richness of neuroscientific research. As scientists were finding evidence for the bodily basis of mind and meaning, architecture was caught up in convoluted cerebral games that denied emotional and bodily reality altogether. This volume maps the extraordinary opportunity that engagement with cutting-edge neuroscience offers present-day architects.ContributorsThomas D.

  Author(s) Johnson Mark L.<br>
  Abstract: Human beings are creatures of the flesh who arrange spaces and physical structures fitted to their bodies. We live in and through our ongoing interactions with environments that are both physical and cultural. The structures we make are loosely adapted to the functions we perform. Some of these functions are necessary for our survival and flourishing, such as working, eating, having shelter, playing, and sleeping. However, we also order our environments to enhance meaning in our lives and to open up possibilities for deepened and enriched experience. In other words, although we are animals evolved for fitness, we are just<br>

  Abstract: Instead of stepping on the specialized ground of neuroscience, I wish to elaborate on the specific mental essence of architecture—a realm that is deeply biologically and culturally grounded, although poorly understood in both education and practice. It is my hope that the exciting doors that the biological and neurosciences are now opening will valorize the interaction of architecture and the human mind, and reveal hidden complexities that have thus far escaped measurement and rational analyses. In our postmodern society, dominated by shallow rationality and reliance on the empirical, measurable, and demonstrable, the embodied and mental dimensions of human existence<br>

  Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience today offers a novel approach to the study of human social cognition and culture. Such an approach can be viewed as a sort of “cognitive archaeology,” as it enables the empirical investigation of the neurophysiological brain mechanisms that make our interactions with the world possible, thereby allowing us to detect the possible functional antecedents of our cognitive skills and to measure the sociocultural influence exerted through human cultural evolution on that very same cognitive repertoire. Thanks to cognitive neuroscience we can deconstruct some of the concepts we normally use when referring to intersubjectivity or to aesthetics, art, and<br>

  Book Title: Reconfiguring Myth and Narrative in Contemporary Opera-Osvaldo Golijov, Kaija Saariaho, John Adams, and Tan Dun<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dun Tan<br>
  Abstract: Yayoi Uno Everett focuses on four operas that helped shape the careers of the composers Osvaldo Golijov, Kaija Saariaho, John Adams, and Tan Dun, which represent a unique encounter of music and production through what Everett calls "multimodal narrative." Aspects of production design, the mechanics of stagecraft, and their interaction with music and sung texts contribute significantly to the semiotics of operatic storytelling. Everett's study draws on Northrop Frye's theories of myth, Lacanian psychoanalysis via Slavoj Žižek, Linda and Michael Hutcheon's notion of production, and musical semiotics found in Robert Hatten's concept of troping in order to provide original interpretive models for conceptualizing new operatic narratives.<br>

  Abstract: The Reformation originated in the action of the Augustinian monk Martin Luther (1483-1546). Luther’s outstanding importance in his own time and his relevance still today are too obvious to ignore. However, nothing is more inappropriate for Luther than to simply celebrate him.¹ For “What is Luther?” asked Luther in 1522, describing himself as “poor and stinking maggot fodder,” and his name as “wretched,” so that no one should call themselves “Lutheran,” but simply “Christian.” In any case, “Neither was I crucified for anyone.”²<br>

In Mayotte, evil is often personified by a figure that circulates after sunset, dancing on graves in blatant contempt for the memory and space of the departed. Rogue characters of the night go unclothed, walk backward, feast on human waste, disrespect the elderly, mock the living, and are particularly harmful toward children.

  Abstract: In his introduction to the

If evil is perceived more broadly, as a range of actions that are associated with causing human harm, the categorization can include diverse instantiations of the phenomenon. Moreover, as a classification that is inherently relational, involving the imputation of responsibility to someone or something, the analysis of evil takes us into concerns with wider issues of cosmology and ontology.

  Book Title: Music, Analysis, Experience-New Perspectives in Musical Semiotics<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Reybrouck Mark<br>
  Abstract: Transdisciplinary and intermedial analysis of the experience of music Nowadays musical semiotics no longer ignores the fundamental challenges raised by cognitive sciences, ethology, or linguistics. Creation, action and experience play an increasing role in how we understand music, a sounding structure impinging upon our body, our mind, and the world we live in. Not discarding music as a closed system, an integral experience of music demands a transdisciplinary dialogue with other domains as well. Music, Analysis, Experience brings together contributions by semioticians, performers, and scholars from cognitive sciences, philosophy, and cultural studies, and deals with these fundamental questionings. Transdisciplinary and intermedial approaches to music meet musicologically oriented contributions to classical music, pop music, South American song, opera, narratology, and philosophy.<br>

  Abstract: This part reflects on the nature of music. It broadens its definition as a mere description in terms of a sounding structure by comparing it to language and speech. By stressing their roles in action and performance, both music and language in action establish social bonds that afford listeners and performers the feeling of a genuine and shared experience. The figure of the performer who acts as a mediator between music and audience is a crucial element in understanding the mutual relationship between theoretical approaches to music and its possible, actual performances.

  Abstract: Music and language seem, in our western conceptions, distinct spheres of human activity. Each has features that the other does not: language can refer, and is of paramount importance in our transactions with each other; music lacks any referential exactness and seem limited to the domain of affect, having powers to elicit emotions and their concomitant personal memories and meanings to a degree to which language, outwith the domain of poetry, rarely aspires. But seen, heard and understood from the perspective of cultures other than our own, the distinctness of music and language blurs. Music, for us primarily an aesthetic<br>

  Abstract: While single genre histories have been quite explored (e.g., Charlton, 1994; Borthwick & Moy, 2004; F. Fabbri, 2008), the notion of

This is not that surprising, as it is a crucial notion (possibly, the highest level of abstraction we can deal with as we talk about music), but, at the same time, a very ambiguous one.¹<br>

They sought an anthropology based on synchronous analysis and meticulous observation.

Anthropologists have always – at least since Boas and Malinowski – wished to call attention to the ways in which the economy is an integrated part of a social and cultural totality, and to reveal that economic systems and actions can only be fully understood if we look into their interrelationships with other aspects of culture and society.

  Abstract: In this follow up to their widely read earlier volume, The Trouble with Community, Vered Amit and Nigel Rapport ask: 'Do notions of community remain central to our sense of who we are, in the dislocating context of globalization, or can we see beyond community closures to a human whole?' This volume explores the variable nature of contemporary sociality. It focuses on the ethical, organizational and emotional claims and opportunities sought or fashioned for mobilizing and evading social collectivities in a world of mobile subjects. Here is an examination of the tensions and interactions between everyday forms of fluid fellowship, culturally normative claims to identity, and opportunities for realizing a universal humanity. The book offers a new perspective on human commonality through a dialogue between two eminent anthropologists who come from distinct, but complementary positions.<br>

  Abstract: Most academics read
                  The Satanic Verses(1988) as an extended meditation on cultural hybridity. As Gayatri Spivak argues, its mode of representation is “citation, reinscription, re-routing the historical,“epitomizing postcoloniality because it systematically dislodges “every metropolitan definition” (104). The novel is predicated on this trope of postcolonial disruption, foregrounding the political and cultural fallout of imperial contraction and the immigration of former colonial subjects to the metropole. InThe Location of Culture,Homi Bhabha famously reads Rushdie’s novel as a testament to “culture’s [inherent]hybridity” and the “indeterminacy of diasporic identity” (38, 225).

It has always received criticism, invective, vituperation; often angry, often confused and confusing (mis)representations of what it is, what it does, and why it goes about things the ways it does. It has also, of course, had its fair share of celebration, (over)indulgent congratulation and flattery.

                  Corps de jeune fille, which was published in France in 1986 and in England asBody of a Girlin 1989, is an excellent example of contemporary erotic writing by women. Barillé displays a remarkable maturity of style, her narrative voice fizzing with ironic wit and more than a touch of self-mockery. Her first fictional publication (the author is also a journalist) is not so much a novel as a series of vignettes about sex written from a young woman’s point of view<br>

  Abstract: One day someone will look back at the last few de cades of U.S. literary criticism and remark on the strange trajectory of the category of the “universal.” Beginning with the reaction against structuralism, that person will observe a strong conceptual and rhetorical preference for multiplicity, diversity, and smallness across the major categories of the field. Among the many examples of this trend we can include the antagonism toward “grand narratives,” the postcolonial emphasis on hybridity, the resistance to Marxist models of totality (synonymous, briefly, with totalization) or to masculine models of desire seen in French feminism and queer theory<br>

  Abstract: Alexander Veselovsky’s versatile body of work is notably hard to synthesize, and the method as well as the conceptual apparatus he refined over the years, yet never fully explicated, does not lend itself easily to either systematic summary or piecemeal extraction. It is in part for this reason that Veselovsky’s legacy proved of no direct use to the totalizing twentieth-century theories of literature, such as Structuralism of the French or Soviet varieties, or to the more recent transnational literarycritical practice, whose volatile methodological eclecticism favors the propagation of isolated conceptual moves and argumentative schemata. For Veselovsky’s is an approach that<br>

  Abstract: Richard Rorty is under no illusions concerning the revolutionary change in sensibility which procedural justice and substantive irony, as the public traits of a civil society, amounts to. If the shift from religiosity to secularism has proceeded over a number of centuries, is still ongoing and is periodically beset by reactionary counter-reformations, then the shift to postmodern bourgeois liberalism, as a global form of polity, might be equally gradual. For the paradox of ‘getting rid of God and of grammar’ (Nietzsche) while keeping as sacrosanct a method of rationally asserting and adjudicating their (good) riddance – of believing liberal democracy<br>

  Abstract: Ernest Gellner spoke of the ‘well-matured political systems’ of the liberal West (1995b: 9), as we have heard, where efficacious scientific practice and knowledge sat alongside cultural faith and spectacle (however ambiguously). In best effecting the satisfaction of human needs and of liberating humanity from material want, in proceeding towards ‘the goal of human liberation’ as such, it was not only true to say that some choices in human world-view and behaviour were better than others, but also that one choice was pre-eminent. This was the liberal West: the meaning-system which had developed and accommodated itself socio-culturally to the power<br>

  Abstract: In a footnote to

The book in question was published two years later and drew on fieldwork Bourdieu had conducted during the Algerian War.

This shift in the ‘social field’ as a whole, epitomised by the rise of the ‘progressive fractions’ of France’s bourgeoisie, had also manifested itself in a series of homologous shifts in a range of other fields or sub-fields.

Behind this lies the acknowledgment that grassroots communities in particular read the Bible “for life” and that their readings have (transformative) consequences.

The infamous success of the apartheid ideology as a social engineering process lay exactly in the area of cultural refutation in which the social interaction was regulated in terms of four “racial” groups—so-called white, black, colored, and Indian people.

  Abstract: In this essay I take a brief tour of contextual situations in which Latin American people live in the face of impunity; I also cover some interpretations of the biblical text, taking as a starting point the life of believing communities in our continent. It brings together the sincere and supportive interaction between those who share the same reality of pain, suffering, and the need to make claims so that impunity does not reign, but justice. I deal with three aspects: the impunity in Latin America, the struggle for justice, and the transformation toward an attitude of solidarity.<br>

  Abstract: Clearly, when we speak of bodies, we are speaking of ourselves, and furthermore our bodies as they are embedded in technology. Rather than thinking of ourselves as abstractions, our selves are a rich mix of dimensions that defy separation—they exist together in ways that our words and concept struggle to understand. The central issue is human identity. It’s about the struggle to arrive at the meaning of being human today, or theological anthropology. The struggle to arrive at human meaning is the grappling with our own human creativity, particularly in its technological expression. This struggle is at the heart<br>

  Abstract: Working with twentieth- and twenty-first-century sources ranging from theatrical works and novels to blogs, Murray-Román examines the ways in which writers such as Jacques Stephen Alexis, Zoé Valdés, Rosario Ferré, Patrick Chamoiseau, and Marlon James experiment with textually compensating for the loss of the corporeality of live relationship in performance traditions. Through their exploration of the interaction of literature and performance, she argues, Caribbean writers themselves offer a mode of bridging the disjunction between cultural and philosophical approaches within Caribbean studies.<br>

From his starting point in phenomenology, Ricoeur ventured into structuralism, psychoanalysis, biblical studies, linguistics, narrative theory, historiography, and even neuroscience. Ricoeur’s exploration in these diverse fields is part of his overarching project of philosophical anthropology, which asks the questions of human being, self-understanding, and action. These questions also provide the context for Ricoeur’s work in the philosophy of religion, which is where Bonhoeffer’s influence on Ricoeur is most evident.<br>

  Abstract: The word “naturalism” is used in many different ways in contemporary philosophy. For some, it has required that a properly naturalistic account appeal only to what is countenanced by the natural sciences, but there have been a number of recent attempts to formulate more liberal approaches to naturalism that allow for natural accounts that recognize the normative character of beliefs, practices, actions, and institutions.¹ A certain priority is rightly given to the sciences in the sense that, as Huw Price has put it, science tells us that humans are natural creatures, and any naturalistic approach should honor that.² But that<br>

  Author(s) Deuser Hermann<br>
  Abstract: As a theory of action, classical pragmatism—founded by the scientifically trained philosophers Charles S. Peirce and William James in New England—is also always a philosophy of religion. Human experience is not (as in the German tradition) divided according to practical experience, on the one hand, and scientific empiricism, on the other. Instead, it is precisely the interplay of belief in relation to action that explains our everyday behavior as much as the scientific method and religious experience. While different conceptions of god have inevitably resulted from the latter over time, the images, narratives, and symbols are nonetheless comparable.<br>

By “the world” we mean actual beings relative to the being of humans. Beings in-themselves are indeed really there, but they might not be actual for human beings. To be actual, beings must become objects of human being’s cognition and practice, and consequently, present actual meaning to human being. In this sense, actuality is characterized by becoming. The transformation of beings in-themselves into actuality is thus a historical interaction. In ancient Chinese, this<br>

As interrelated aspects of the social world, the individual domain and its connection to the public sphere also sets the concrete background for the historical process of accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things. As the actual mode of being, accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things is never separable from diverse social resources, and the acquisition, possession, and distribution of resources involves the issue of social justice.<br>

  Author(s) KHORRAMI MOHAMMAD MEHDI<br>
  Abstract: In a letter to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway called war “the writer’s best subject.” Hemingway justified this description by saying that “[War] groups the maximum of material and speeds up the action and brings out all sorts of stuff that normally you have to wait a lifetime to get.”¹ Keeping in mind the notion of dramatic license, he was probably right. And considering the fact that in the past few centuries the Persian literary tradition has had many chances to experience this “best subject,” it is reasonable to expect that many great works of Persian war literature have been<br>

  Abstract: Primum vivere deinde philosophari—“first live and then philosophize.” This famous saying of the ancients reminds us what is at stake in the act of writing and thinking. We do not first write and then live afterward or “on the side,” as it were. Rather,we live and then we write.The first imperative is not to know how to write but to learn to live; otherwise we run the risk of having nothing to say. The particularity of the philosopher is that he participates in the incarnate. No error is greater than his confusing himself for an abstraction, whereby<br>

  Author(s) Griffiths Alison<br>
  Abstract: In her speech as outgoing president of the American Anthropological Association in 1960, pioneering visual anthropologist Margaret Mead urged her colleagues to make greater use of the technologies of the still camera, audio tape recorder and motion picture camera. According to some observers, the reaction among Mead’s professional audience was decidedly mixed. Her appeals were greeted with ‘restless stirrings and angry murmurs … as these notebook-oriented scholars expressed their irritation at this revolutionary suggestion.’¹ In some respects, it is hardly surprising that Mead’s colleagues balked at the idea of using tape recorders and motion picture cameras in the field; beyond<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1bmzncx">Early Cinema and the "National"</a><br>
  Author(s) Balan Canan<br>
  Abstract: This essay presents a panorama of the evolution of viewing conventions in Istanbul, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (from the 1890s to the 1930s). Within the Ottoman Empire, Westernist, Turkist and Islamist schools of thought were in keen competition when the cinématographe arrived in Istanbul, in 1896. Traces of the discursive space configured by these schools are quite visible in Turkish cultural history, specifically in the history of cinematic spectatorship. A set of binary oppositions – between East and West, between National and International, and, finally, between Islamist and Secular – dominated the framework for reactions to the cinématographe.<br>

  Chapter 4  French Communism: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbw43">The French Exception</a><br>
  Author(s) Bell David S.<br>
  Abstract: French exceptionalism in politics comes down in many respects to French ‘political culture’. ‘Political culture’ is used here to mean the orientation that people have towards politics and their expectations of political action. However, political culture is not a passive given. Political culture is inherited from the past but it is adapted and built on by political institutions which in this way help shape a society’s attitudes to politics. In the case of the French Communist Party (Parti communiste français: PCF), it successfully picked up and used aspects of a pre-existing political culture but it also added its own components.<br>

  Author(s) Bryant Janet<br>
  Abstract: This chapter examines the notion of exceptionalism in the context of French foreign and defence policy in the Fifth Republic. The idea that France is exceptional in this area of policy has been characterised by the plethora of adjectives such as different, unusual, unconventional, distinctive and sometimes even maverick, that are often used when describing French actions. To what extent does it really make sense to talk about French exceptionalism in foreign and defence policy? Might it be argued, rather, that this term is particularly difficult to apply to an area of ‘high’ policy where every state will be seeking<br>

  Author(s) Brumlik Micha<br>
  Abstract: Historical consciousness originally appeared in human beings, from both the phylogenetic and the ontogenetic perspective, as narrative consciousness. Even myths and cosmologies embedded in a cyclical conception of time require narratives, accounts of things, actions, and events connected with adverbial particles such as “before” and “after,” “later” and “earlier,” “in the beginning” and “in the end.”<br>

  Author(s): Tak Herman<br>
  Abstract: This volume focuses on the conjunction of two disciplines where both the analytic promises as well as the difficulties involved in the meeting of humanist and social science approaches soon became obvious. Anthropologists and historians have come together here in order to recapture, elaborate, and criticize pre-Cultural Turn and non-Cultural Turn modes of analysing structures of experience, feeling, subjectivity and action in human societies and to highlight the still unexploited possibilities developed among others in the work of scholars such as Norbert Elias, Max Gluckman, Eric Wolf, E.P. Thompson and Raymond Williams.<br>

  Author(s) Kalb Don<br>
  Abstract: Few serious social researchers would deny the inescapability of pondering the conundrum of class—a conundrum because, while steadily contested, politically compromised, and conceptually inflated, the unsettling suspicion keeps surfacing that class involves inequality, power, culture, exploitation, accumulation, struggle and action, being in history and the making of history, being in place and the making of space, all in the same moment. Class, power, time, and space together form a huge program that has haunted social inquiry since Marx. Disciplined social science, on the other hand, has been a recurrent escape from its embrace, and understandably so, since it is<br>

The termproduits de terroiritself is notoriously difficult to define, but it is perhaps best described as traditional ‘local agricultural products and foodstuffs’ (English official rendering) whose qualities cross time and space and are anchored in a specific place and history.

  Abstract: ‘Identity’ has been among the most central concepts in 20
                  thcentury psychology and sociology. It acquired its significance, which has persisted in all essentials until today, particularly in the context of pragmatist, interactionist and psychoanalytical thought,—even if the term played no role in the work of either Sigmund Freud or William James, but rather only in subsequent attempts to develop their theories of the subject and the self (Straub, 1991, 1994). Of course the remarkable career of ‘identity’ is due especially to certain works that were still close to the sources of psychoanalysis and pragmatism, even if they were<br>

  Author(s) Devisch René<br>
  Abstract: Diversely echoing Gail Weiss (1999) and Paul Stoller and Cheryll Olkes (1987), I hold that maleficent fetishes that sustain lethal sorcery shape and enact, yet pervert, their proper contours of embodied interactions and transactions. These interactions are being absorbed and consumed, if not devoured, by the sensual order of the uncanny and by forces of abjection. From my immersion in the life of the Yaka people in Kinshasa and south-west Congo, I am aiming at some endogenous understanding of how interacting bodies – or more precisely, intercorporeal awareness – can conform to (attune to) and become subordinated to (and implicated<br>

  Author(s) Frankenberg Ronnie<br>
  Abstract: This essay uses some of the Ardeners’ seminal/uterine, even vaginal insights to analyse the way that anthropological research can be seen as a cooperative exercise between subjects rather than merely informant and fieldworker – to illuminate such diverse investigations as resistance and struggle in West Africa and images in art and drama. Finally, on the basis of Rhian Loudon’s own field research, they inform analysis of the both vulnerable and powerful, dominant and muted, speech and actions of British Asian women, observed in shared multiple simultaneous realities of home and health-service/social-service workplace.

  Abstract: Reflexive anthropology, anthropology ‘at home’ or ‘half-way home’, and the recognition of the researcher’s as well as her informants’ subjectivity have dominated much of anthropology since the 1970s. All are intimately bound with feminist critiques of ethnographic approaches and have been guiding principles in research conducted within the framework of Oxford’s Centre for Cross-Cultural Research on Women (E. Ardener 1975; S. Ardener 1975; Ardener and Burman 1995). To reach a closer understanding of women’s lives, it proved essential to focus on the contacts and active interactions of women in the societies we studied. Indeed, one of the questions we posed<br>

Before reaching that point, society tolerates or even supports the new movement. We march, link arms, and sing with the newcomers, identifying with their struggle. At some point, however, reaction sets in. We decide the group has gone far enough. At first, justice seemed to be on their side.

  Abstract: Social scientists have identified a number of features that characterize contemporary white attitudes toward blacks. First, traditional stereotypes and blatant discrimination are no longer common. Most whites, regardless of their political orientation, reject these traditional forms of discrimination. This is particularly true of white liberals who condition their behavior toward blacks on beliefs that strongly condemn traditional discrimination. Second, whites use ostensibly nonracial factors to justify any behavior that may have a disproportionate impact on blacks or could be perceived as being racist. Third, whites harbor attitudes of ambivalence toward blacks resulting in extreme positive or negative reactions. These attitudes<br>

  Abstract: “Dysconscious racism” is a form of racism that tacitly accepts dominant white norms and privileges. It is not the

Uncritical ways of thinking about racial inequity accept certain culturally sanctioned assumptions, myths, and beliefs that justify the social and economic advantages white people have as a result of subordinating others. Anything that calls this ideology of racial privilege into question inevitably challenges the self-identity of white people who have internalized these ideological justifications.

It was created to develop needed labor-force skills, and to provide those who had them with a life-style that reflected their value to the economy. The GI benefits ultimately extended to sixteen million GIs (veterans of the Korean War as well) included priority in jobs—that is, preferential hiring, but no one objected to it then—financial support during the job search; small loans for starting up businesses; and, most important, low-interest home loans and educational<br>

  Abstract: In significant ways, legal texts produce a narrative of national identity. They weave stories about who we are, what we are committed to, and what we expect of one another, individually and collectively. Certain foundational fictions, like “We the People,” provide the glue that over time binds a people to its past and to one another as a nation. But should law play the same role with respect to other aspects of human identity? I think not.

Within its brief compass, the archbishop’s introduction outlines two views of meaningful action. The first understands meaningful action as assertion, existing only where “a particular will has imprinted its agenda on the ‘external’ world”; the second insists that “meaningful action is action that is capable of contributing to a system of communication, to symbolic exchange.” The first “pervades so much of modernity and . . . postmodernity,” including “popular liberal and pluralist thought,” and ”raises a a<br>

  Abstract: Biblical Performance Criticism is a way of understanding the Bible. It is the result of many streams of thought meeting over the last century, including form criticism, oral-tradition studies, rhetorical criticism, narrative criticism, memory studies, media studies, and performance studies. In some way, each of these streams analyzes four elements: (1) someone speaking, (2) someone hearing, (3) a text, and (4) a social situation. Each has contributed to the understanding that the Bible should be read in terms of the interaction of those four elements rather than any one of them in isolation.<br>

  Book Title: Memory-Histories, Theories, Debates<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SCHWARZ BILL<br>
  Abstract: Memory has never been closer to us, yet never more difficult to understand. In the more than thirty specially commissioned essays that make up this book, leading scholars survey the histories, the theories, and the faultlines that compose the field of memory research.The volume reconstructs the work of the great philosophical and literary figures of the last two centuries who recast the concept of memory and brought it into the forefront of the modernist and postmodernist imagination-among them, Bergson, Halbwachs, Freud, Proust, Benjamin, Adorno, Derrida, and Deleuze. Drawing on recent advances in the sciences and in the humanities, the contributors address thequestion of how memory works, highlighting transactions between the interiority of subjective memory and the larger fields of public or collective memory.The public, political life of memory is an increasingly urgent issue in the societies we now inhabit, while the category of memory itself seems to become ever more capacious.Asking how we might think about the politics of memory, the closing chapters explore anumber of defining instances in which the troubled phenomenon of memory has entered and reshaped our very conception of what makes and drives the domain of politics. These include issues of slavery, the Soviet experience, the Holocaust, feminism and recovered memory, and memory in post-apartheid South Africa.<br>

Instead, he insisted that the prince acts in a world in which there are “no prefigured meanings, no implicit teleology,”¹ in which order and legibility are the products of human action rather than the a priori objects of human cognition. To recognize this, he argued, is to acknowledge the truth of power, as opposed to an idealistic notion of truth conceived in terms of representation, as correspondence<br>

  Abstract: IN THIS chapter, I consider Milton’s intervention in the debate concerning things indifferent in his prose works. As we will see, in enlarging the sphere of things indifferent and giving the individual conscience discretion in such matters, Milton departs from the usual puritan position, according to which “nothing is indifferent.” At the same time, he develops the principle of indifference into a rhetoric, thereby dramatizing his awareness that the sphere of indifference is the sphere of rhetoric, in which persuasion and action may take place. Milton’s Machiavellism in his prose works is both general and specific. In reflecting on the<br>

Yet paradigmatic revolution—a profound change in consciousness, however foolish that idea seems—is in the wind, and humankind may be on the brink of a postmodern age. Of course such qualifiers as anti-or posttend to obscure the central issue: Modernism.¹ Crucially, the idea of wilderness appears to undergird a new paradigm for understanding humankind as embodying natural process grown self-conscious.

Though this is a recurrent problem, I. A.

  Abstract: Although it is not always recognized, art is produced and enjoyed and even defined against a background of theories and ideas. Oversimplifying greatly, up to the 18th century theories of art were largely developments of and reactions to elements in Greek thought. The 18th and 19th centuries saw a tremendous development of new thinking about art. The 20th century has been even more prolific in production of new approaches. Some are developments of earlier themes but on the whole they can be studied independently. At the same time one can discern a good deal of interrelation between those 20th century<br>

  Book Title: Land and People-Papers in Memory of John G. Evans<br>
  Publisher: Oxbow Books<br>
  Author(s): O’Connor Terry<br>
  Abstract: This volume is derived, in concept, from a conference held in honour of John Evans by the School of History and Archaeology and The Prehistoric Society at Cardiff University in March 2006. It brings together papers that address themes and landscapes on a variety of levels. They cover geographical, methodological and thematic areas that were of interest to, and had been studied by, John Evans. The volume is divided into five sections, which echo themes of importance in British prehistory. They include papers on aspects of environmental archaeology, experiments and philosophy; new research on the nature of woodland on the chalklands of southern England; coasts and islands; people, process and social order, and snails and shells - a strong part of John Evans' career. This volume presents a range of papers examining people's interaction with the landscape in all its forms. The papers provide a diverse but cohesive picture of how archaeological landscapes are viewed within current research frameworks and approaches, while also paying tribute to the innovative and inspirational work of one of the leading protagonists of environmental archaeology and the holistic approach to landscape interpretation.<br>

  Abstract: John Evans was a power and a force. His energy, originality and independence prompted colleagues to thought, action, disagreement or all three. His pioneering analyses of molluscan assemblages from the Wessex chalkland remained a feature of his career over five decades. This paper examines the role of molluscan analysis in the interpretation of the fourth millennium cal BC monument complex on Hambledon Hill, Dorset (Mercer & Healy 2008) and its large faunal assemblage, which is dominated by cattle.<br>

  Author(s) Bunting M. Jane<br>
  Abstract: Freshwater Mollusca have perhaps not figured as large in the environmental archaeology literature as their terrestrial counterparts, despite their abundance and habitat specificity. In the case of small bivalves of the genus
                  Pisidium, the difficulties involved in their extraction and identification may be a contributory factor. Freshwater Mollusca are undoubtedly at their most valuable as part of a multi-proxy study, integrated as one of several sources of evidence. Recent work in the Orkney Islands has made good use of multi-proxy approaches to reconstruct landscape changes through the mid-Holocene (de la Vega Leinertet al.2000; 2007).

  Abstract: All aspects of archaeology, including environmental archaeology and subdisciplines within it, are ultimately about people in the past. Archaeology has been good at studying the material world that humans have produced and the items they have made, but less good at attempting to understand the people themselves. Attempts to get into the minds of people long gone or to attempt in some small way to engage with their feelings and life styles have often been considered unscientific and unhelpful. Yet humans are a part of the natural world, and they modify it and act as communities within in. Their actions<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, we will begin to develop a rich
                  situationalperspective to further our investigation. In order to grasp the reality behind the phenomenon of mental illness, we need to contextualize it within its historical framework and understand why and how it is culturally perceived, and how that perception has influenced the treatment options. What are the historical and political dimensions of this phenomenon? Who is benefiting from it, and who are the victims? What are the real barriers to recovery? Situations, including illness, never happen in abstraction; they always happen in a context and have different forces affecting<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4ks4">Facing the Fiend</a><br>
  Abstract: Satan is part of the myth of evil and if we assume that the story is one way to approach the reality of evil, we need to examine the myth in more detail. From a secular viewpoint, any metaphysical approach to the question of evil does not work. The responsibilities for all human actions lay, since Kant, in the agent’s will and accordingly, so does the decision to commit an evil deed. Nevertheless, despite all efforts to explain human behavior with psychology, sociology, biology, and psychoanalysis, there seems to be an explanatory gap when it comes to actions that hurt<br>

  Author(s) Horrocks Don<br>
  Abstract: The evangelical tradition has virtually co-existed, albeit uneasily, with concepts of universal salvation. If the period from 1730 to the mid-1800s is accepted as the heyday of evangelical Protestantism as a movement, its classic conversionist, crucicentrist, biblicist, activist expression² remained paramount throughout. Liberalizing trends were strongly resisted, and incipient universalist tendencies were strenuously repudiated. Faced with challenges to depart from what it saw as an established, traditional, biblical, and doctrinal position with regard to salvation, judgment, and eternal punishment, reaction was usually swift and hostile, often prompting simultaneous renaissance of historic definitive positions. Denial of eternal punishment and embrace of<br>

  Abstract: In reaction to the internal threats of Gnosticism and in response to external pressures from both Judaism and the Roman government, early Christianity began to consolidate and define itself as a distinct institution. The passage of time, which brought further delay to the hope of Christ’s near return, also prompted some rethinking about the church’s identity and mission in the world. What resulted from these developments is typical of most religious groups of the third and fourth generations.<br>

Scholars also tend to have narrowed the debate to the timing of and motivations behind the introduction of Stalinist regimes in Eastern Europe, generally focusing on whether the Sovietization of Eastern Europe was the predetermined result of Soviet foreign policy or a reaction to American assertiveness. This chapter will suggest that American policies had little or no influence on the course of events in Hungary. There is no evidence<br>

  Abstract: Several long-standing shifts in biblical studies suggest that biblical interpretation is done best in a collaborative way. Fernando Segovia, in

  Book Title: Returning to Reality-Christian Platonism for our Times<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Tyson Paul<br>
  Abstract: Could it be that we have lost touch with some basic human realities in our day of high-tech efficiency, frenetic competition, and ceaseless consumption? Have we turned from the moral, the spiritual, and even the physical realities that make our lives meaningful? These are metaphysical questions -questions about the nature of reality- but they are not abstract questions. These are very down to earth questions that concern power and the collective frameworks of belief and action governing our daily lives. This book is an introduction to the history, theory, and application of Christian metaphysics. Yet this book is not just an introduction, it is also a passionately argued call for a profound change in the contemporary Christian mind. Paul Tyson argues that as Western culture’s Christian Platonist understanding of reality was replaced by modern pragmatic realism, we turned not just from one outlook on reality to another, but away from reality itself. This book seeks to show that if we can recover this ancient Christian outlook on reality, reframed for our day, then we will be able to recover a way of life that is in harmony with human and divine truth.<br>

Some people could argue that the idea of a meaning in history is not clear at all: why is it necessary that there be a meaning, a sense for the historical events?

  Author(s) Pabst Adrian<br>
  Abstract: In a sense, the global recession of 2007–2010 is just another reminder that capitalist economies suffer periodic crises but that capitalism does not collapse under the weight of its own inner contradictions. Instead, it always reverts to the “normal” cycle of expansion, contraction, and recovery. This reversion is linked to over-accumulation and falling profit rates that prompt capital owners to cut the real wages of laborers in order to generate new surplus value, as both Adam Smith and Karl Marx recognized.¹ But whereas Smith evaded the issue of “primitive accumulation,” Marx followed Sir James Steuart in arguing that this<br>

  Author(s) Pabst Adrian<br>
  Abstract: A cross different academic disciplines, we are witnessing a fundamental and perhaps paradigmatic shift away from individuality towards relationality. Both natural sciences and humanities are seeing the emergence of different relational models that attempt to theorize the widespread recognition that reality cannot be reduced to self-generating, individual beings and that the outcome of interactions between various entities is more than the sum of parts (whether these be more atomistic or more collectivist). For instance, in particle physics it has been suggested that there are “things” such as quarks (subatomic particles) which cannot be measured individually because they are confined by<br>

  Abstract: Previously, we have argued that all of creation, and humanity itself, is brought into being as a gift, its origins lying in the hospitable and ecstatic actions of the loving Triune God. However, distorted by our own desire to live
                     distantlyandseparatelyand therefore cut off from the life of this divinecommunion, humanity becomes fearful ofotherness. The Other is no longer perceived as one who comes offering joy, enrichment and mutual beneficence, but rather as a threat to our existence, one to be struggled against and overcome. Fear erupts into violence, hospitality gives way to hostility.<br>

He asked, simply: “Can Poetry Matter?” Inquiring after the decline in poetry’s “cultural importance” Gioia laid down a gauntlet of sorts, one charged with implications not only for the status of poetry in contemporary Anglo-American society at large, but for a diverse range of more specified intellectual enterprises as well.

  Book Title: In the Eyes of God-A Metaphorical Approach to Biblical Anthropomorphic Language<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Howell Brian C.<br>
  Abstract: Anthropomorphic language has provided a conundrum for exegetes and theologians for millennia. Attempting to use human language to describe the divine presents ontological and epistemological problems that push our speech to the breaking point. In this new work, Howell shows that instances of divine action should not automatically be reduced simply to theological categories such as omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, immutability, etc., nor to criteria such as personhood, life, and approachability. Rather, he introduced readers to two unique approaches to “anthropomorphic expressions".<br>

  9  The Mountain with a View from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf0wh">In the Eyes of God</a><br>
  Abstract: In our last chapter, we found God’s sight acting in both a performative manner and by proxy. It performed actions through the use of sight, such as witnessing, confronting, and extending mercy. This accords with Stern’s context-based approach to metaphor, which expects to find differing meanings within each individual instantiation of a particular metaphor like divine “sight.” Furthermore, it demonstrates a distinct overlap in divine and human abilities. Although the
                     modus operandimight be different, God is still using sight in a manner that humans use it.<br>

  Metaphysics, Its Critique, and Post-Metaphysical Theology: from:

  Author(s) HALL ERIC E.<br>
  Abstract: Metaphysics has recently made a comeback. It is not at all clear whether this is good news, bad news, or something in between. One reason for this uncertainty lies in the still open question of what returns with metaphysics: what commitments, presuppositions, worldviews, and actions? No doubt, some might hold that this description is already misleading since metaphysics has never been absent, only confusedly and ruinously neglected metaphysics has acted as avia absconditafrom which we have taken but a short hiatus. Others might react with deep concern, fearing that all achievements of past battles against this “totalizing” power<br>

  Abstract: Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) saw morality in light of human reason. Practical reason itself becomes the criteria for right and wrong, stimulating moral action. Practical reason enables the human being to grasp innate moral law. The moral law is deontological in the sense that moral action has little to do with the consequences. For Kant, the categorical imperative is grounded solely in the notion of duty. There is one domain of value, the domain of moral value which is immune to human fragility and vulnerability. The very notion of a moral precept, for instance “Don’t kill”, can never conflict with<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf16n">The Hermeneutical Self and an Ethical Difference</a><br>
  Abstract: We have seen the gamut of interaction between Aristotelian virtue ethics and Kant’s deontological rigor. In this interaction Habermas’s discourse ethics occupies a significant place, while Neo-Aristotelian ethics plays a counterpart to Neo-Kantian deontological orientation. However, in postmodernity’s ethical emphasis on the Other, an ethical-hermeneutical model assumes an aesthetic dimension and prophetic witness. Foucault’s concept of care of self and Levinas’s unprecedented concern for the Other are to be understood as a new mode of interpretation in prioritizing care for others.<br>

  Abstract: Why should the theologian care about what Jesus of Nazareth thought of his impending death? The question becomes more potent if we phrase is slightly differently: Would it actually make any difference to the Christian faith if its doctrine of the atonement had no basis in the intention of Jesus and was merely a symbolic invention of the early church? An uncritical reaction to this type of question is to answer with an indignant affirmation, since there is more than a little audacity in the suggestion that Jesus’ intention is irrelevant to the Christian proclamation of salvation. However, does the<br>

  Author(s) Jasper David<br>
  Abstract: The sacramental life of the Christian Church has, from the very earliest times, been acquainted with scandal. There is reason to think that the celebration of the Eucharist, in some form, predates even the canonical Gospels, and by the end of the second century of the Christian era, Tertullian was grimly satirizing those outside the Church who clearly thought that the sacrament was shocking in the extreme and beyond what was tolerable. “We are accused,” he wrote, “of observing a sacred ritual in which we kill a little child and eat it.” He goes on to describe this action in<br>

  Abstract: Although we have thus far avoided the language, it should be clear by now that the mediacy and materiality of sacramentality is another way of saying that sacraments are sensuous they engage us, and we participate in them, at the level of our senses. We see, taste, touch, and smell the bread and the wine; we hear the fraction of the host and the pouring of water and wine into the chalice. And relatedly, sacraments are

While the emphasis thus far has been on the substance of Newbigin’s theology in the face of the challenge of the Enlightenment ideology, it would be incorrect to conclude that what Newbigin envisions is somehow confined to mere words, as important as words are.

  Abstract: Chapter 1 described Jürgen Moltmann’s future-determined, creationfocused, ideologically-modern, hope in the passible God who has been brought to suffer with humanity by Jesus Christ’s suffering and death. I followed the sketch of Moltmann’s theological hope with examples of Moltmannian hope and its humanist, this-worldly hope in the changes that responsible, hopeful actions can make. In chapter 2, I noted what an exclusive reliance on Moltmannian hope loses: non-modern imagination, divine impassibility, Christ’s two natures, heaven, transcendent human flourishing, and apparently irresponsible discipleship. Chapter 3 considered patristic and Thomistic presentations of theological hope and twenty-first-century treatments of hope from theologians appreciative<br>

Typical of the best hebrew narrative, the narrator of the Saul and David story rarely reveals the motivations of characters and even more sparingly provides moral evaluation of its characters’ actions, preferring a strategy of showing rather than telling the story.

  Abstract: The present study seeks to respond theologically to current discussions about ideas of self from the perspective of God’s action in and towards the world. Its aim is to trace a view of rationality that follows the drama of God’s engagement with the world, thus involving dying and resurrection, ascesis and abundance, suffering witness and Eucharistic communion. Since, as Calvin notes, knowledge of God and knowledge of self are intimately bound together, this exercise of discerning the shape of a theological rationality in the present arena of competing promises of meaning and truth is carried out on two levels: the theological and the anthropological.<br>

The formidable breadth of his philosophical compass, including as it does, fields as diverse as literary criticism and analytic philosophy, psychoanalysis and biblical interpretation, not only recapitulates the battles and aspirations of his own generation, but witnesses to the living tension between reflection and action, past and present, academic vogues and enduring truths. In a century of turmoil, marked by alternations of unprecedented bursts of hope for a reconciled humanity and unfathomable sources<br>

  Book Title: The Dialogical Spirit-Christian Reason and Theological Method in the Third Millennium<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Yong Amos<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary proposals for Christian theology from post-liberalism to Radical Orthodoxy and beyond have espoused their own methodological paradigms. Those who have ventured into this domain of theological method, however, have usually had to stake their claims vis-à-vis trends in what may be called the contemporary "post-al" age, whether of the post-modern, post-Christendom, post-Enlightenment, post-Western, or post-colonial varieties. This volume is unique among offerings in this arena in suggesting a way forward that engages on each of these fronts, and does so from a particularistic Christian perspective without giving up on Christian theology's traditional claims to universality. This is accomplished through the articulation of a distinctive dialogical methodology informed by both Pentecostalism and Evangelicalism, one rooted in the Christian salvation-history narrative of Incarnation and Pentecost that is yet open to the world in its many and various cultural, ethnic, religious, and disciplinary discourses. Amos Yong here engages with twelve different interlocutors representing different ecumenical, religious, and disciplinary perspectives. 'The Dialogical Spirit' thus not only proffers a model for Christian theological method suitable for the twenty-first century global context but also exemplifies this methodological approach through its interactions across the contemporary scholarly, inter-religious, and theological landscape.<br>

  Abstract: Soon after completing my PhD thesis I wrote a book on theological method,
                  Spirit-Word-Community: Theological Hermeneutics in Trinitarian Perspective.¹ I was motivated in this direction in part because the theological academy was caught up, around the turn of the millennium, on questions related to method,² and in part because my own graduate training under a philosophical theologian alerted me to the importance of providing methodological argumentation in a time when theological claims were no longer being received merely because they were asserted. Both trends were reactions to the post-Enlightenment world that had been emerging with increasing clarity across the last<br>

  Abstract: This chapter identifies and examines the formal characteristics that structure divine sorrow.¹ Several questions immediately arise concerning the interaction among the characteristics of this symbol’s two presuppositions² with reference to the characteristics of human sin in division one of the present volume of studies. (1) What is the relationship between divine vulnerability and this passive stage of divine grief? (2) To which operation or role of the Christian God does the symbol of divine sorrow refer?

  Abstract: In divine travail, the operations and interactions of the three dimensions of divine
                  caritasproduce divine travail’s material character, but involve even greater complexity than in the two stages of the previous divine wound, principally due to the self-externalization or self-concentration of the divine presence within the creation, through God’s becoming-human as Jesus of Nazareth. Strictly speaking, then, I should examine divine travail by combining analyses that followboththe pattern of my analyses of human life as love in terms ofcaritasandcupiditas andthe pattern of my previous analyses of divine life as love.¹ While aspects of<br>

  Book Title: Christian Ethics as Witness-Barth's Ethics for a World at Risk<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): HADDORFF DAVID<br>
  Abstract: Christian ethics is less a system of principles, rules, or even virtues, and more of a free and open-ended responsible witness to God's gracious action to be with and for others and the world. <CR><CR> Postmodernity has left us with the risky uncertainty of knowing and doing the good. It also leaves us with the global risks of political violence and terrorism, economic globalization and financial crisis, and environmental destruction and global climate change. How should Christians respond to these problems? Haddorf creatively explores how Christian ethics is best understood as a witness to God's action, bringing together two of his interests, Christian social ethics and social theory, and the theology and ethics of Karl Barth. <CR><CR> Although demanding and sometimes uncertain after postmodern changes, christian ethics enable humankind to remain God's witnesses of love and care for the future, even in a world at risk.<br>

  CHAPTER THREE  Barth’s Social Ethics: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf9s9">Christian Ethics as Witness</a><br>
  Abstract: In the last chapter, we saw how Barth, in his early writings, responded theologically and practically to the events around him during 1910s and 1920s. Reversing the dominant structure of modern ethics, which attempts to secure human freedom by separating humanity from God, Barth saw clearly that human freedom depends upon God’s freedom to act
                  in relatio. Thus, his task, in these early writings, was not to simply contrast God’s action and our action as the way to preserve human autonomy, but instead attempts to demonstrate how divine agency establishes, rather than negates, human agency. This theme more fully emerges<br>

  CHAPTER SIX  Witness and the Word of God from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf9s9">Christian Ethics as Witness</a><br>
  Abstract: In the last two chapters, we have examined two central responses to the postmodern situation, and concluded that neither theory, as such, can tell us with certainty what the
                  goodis and how we ought to practice it in the world. The crisis of postmodernity affects both the “supply” and “demand” of ethics, that is of moral knowledge and action, of truth and agency, and embodying and doing the good. Without a coherent moral ontology there is no coherent understanding of moral realism; we cannot have a coherent view of the good because we cannot account for the moral structure<br>

  CHAPTER SEVEN  Witness and Christian Moral Judgment from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf9s9">Christian Ethics as Witness</a><br>
  Abstract: Ethics as Christian witness begins with God’s action to be “with us” and “for us” in Jesus Christ. In this event, God has given Christians the
                  freedomto respond, as witnesses, to this objective reality both individually and collectively within the church. This leads to a particular dialectical understanding of ethical judgment and action. That is, Christians give witness by both standing against the various powers that oppress humanity and standing with and for others, the church, and the world. In chapter two, we saw how Barth’s dialectical thought during theRömerbriefperiod often began with the No of transcendent<br>

  CHAPTER TEN  Witness and Christian Responsibility from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf9s9">Christian Ethics as Witness</a><br>
  Abstract: In this last section of the book, we carry through in practice what was developed in theory, namely that Christian ethics is “responsible witness of the Word of God” serving both “God and men” (
                  CDIV/3: 609). In each movement, there is a corresponding dialectic of God’s initiating action and human response. In chapters 7–8, we saw how the Yes of moral knowledge of the good, human agency, and moral judgment is followed by the No against the nothingness of sin, death, evil, and the powers. We are now able to discuss further how God’s reconciling Yes provides the<br>

  Abstract: Contemplating the mystery of birth and our own originary experience invited us to acknowledge that the nature and unity of the singular being is gift, given to itself in order to recognize and adhere to the mystery of God, the

Failing to heed the call to affirm himself and the world as gift by gratuitously recognizing that God is everything, the created singular human being attempted to grasp at a greater delight by conceiving himself<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfb0w">Allegorizing History</a><br>
  Abstract: The preceding chapter showed that Bede did not figurally exegete events in the English Church’s history, despite frequent opportunities to do so. I will argue in this chapter that Bede’s commentary on Genesis and how he reads the creation of time, history, and the world displays a theological and philosophical ambiguity that factors into how Bede conceives of God’s action or providential caring for history and humanity. Using

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbb2">Reading Scripture to Hear God</a><br>
  Abstract: In the past several decades, the theological interpretation of Scripture has emerged as an identifiable discipline within systematic theology.¹ The theological interpretation of Scripture emerged as an attempt to bridge the ugly ditch between biblical studies and systematic theology which has been dug since the Enlightenment. In response to this modernist divorce between theological disciplines, the theological interpretation of Scripture attempts to explain how Scripture functions as the “soul of sacred theology,” by articulating how Scripture operates as a locus of God’s ongoing self-communicative action, and why scriptural reading must be primarily an activity performed by the church and for<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbb2">Reading Scripture to Hear God</a><br>
  Abstract: In the last chapter we examined the way in which Vanhoozer and de Lubac both seek to show that God’s use of Scripture is the foundational norm for all subsequent hermeneutical reflection. God’s use of precisely this collection of texts for self-mediation to readers is what makes Scripture unique, and all rules for reading should be developed from this assumption.Vanhoozer’s understanding of God’s speaking action through a clear, determinate canonical sense of Scripture, and de Lubac’s understanding of God’s speaking action through a three-fold spiritual sense of Scripture both arise from the same desire to articulate God’s present speaking action<br>

  CHAPTER 3  God’s Use of Scripture and Church in the Economy of Redemption from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbb2">Reading Scripture to Hear God</a><br>
  Abstract: In the last chapter we saw that Vanhoozer envisions God’s communicative action taking covenantal form in the Scriptures which mediate Christ to the church. We also saw that de Lubac envisions Christ’s self-communication taking sacramental form in Scripture, church, and Eucharist, so that each builds the other sacramental realities. Without leaving the discussion of ontology aside, this chapter will focus specifi-cally on the relationship between Scripture and church in the economy of redemption. The relationship between Scripture and church has been a significant issue in Catholic and Protestant interpretations of Scripture, and it remains the area of greatest disagreement between<br>

  Abstract: This is a book about living with the past—not about memory itself
                  per se, but about the process of constructing cultural memory, about the negotiation, implicit or explicit, between what is remembered, transmuted into narrative, handed on from generation to generation, and what is forgotten, unspoken, overlooked. My underlying assumption is that the understanding of the past generated by such a process plays an essential role in shaping attitudes and actions of individuals and societies in the present. This understanding (“memory”) is at times difficult to distinguish from the process of its formation (“memorialization”); the former is often the<br>

  Abstract: In social and cultural milieus across the globe, religion and violence are often linked dramatically by the actions of violent religious agents, and intellectually by academics, commentators, and authors who seek to understand these actions.¹ The link between violent struggle and the Koran has become commonplace in Western media since the events of September 11, 2001. More broadly, diverse groups and individuals across the religious spectrum have been involved in violent actions: so-called Christian groups blow up abortion clinics for the purpose of killing health professionals involved with acts of abortion; Jewish fundamentalist groups defend militarily their perceived religious right<br>

  Abstract: The insights presented by Girard, Taylor, Jones, and Juergensmeyer have provided us with enough evidence to support the proposition that some forms of religious expression both motivate and justify the violent actions of religious agents. However, the survey of these authors’ works also leads me to assert that it is not enough simply to demonstrate empirically that people are motivated to commit violent acts by religious images, symbols, and doctrines. It is also important to dialectically engage religious images, symbols, and doctrines so as to judge whether they are conducive to authentic living, whether they are authentic understandings of a<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbxv">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: On the basis of my previous preparatory steps, this chapter supplies a third, briefer, and final orientation for interaction with the Christian symbol of divine suffering. In one sense, this chapter initiates that interaction, since it provides a hypothetical overview of the symbol’s structure. In another sense, however, this chapter retains its orienting character, in that it does not yet

  Introduction to Part Two: from:

  Abstract: In part two, the most complex transitional steps emerge in the movement of this study into the more concrete analyses of this Christian symbol. In the chapters that follow, I will examine this symbol’s two principal presuppositions, both of which taken together supply part two of this book with its title: Presuppositions of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering. Nevertheless, a moment of abstraction remains. I have drawn these two presuppositions from testimonies to divine suffering in which they remain embedded as the conditions of possibility for divine suffering.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter constitutes the first stage in my analyses of the first presupposition of the Christian symbol of divine suffering. I repeat my formulation of this presupposition:
                  The God whose life is love limits the divine self in God’s creative activity; or, as the creator who is love, God limits the divine self as God creates. This first stage of my analysis works on the basis of an abstraction of divine life or being from divine activity, in order to clarify the characteristic ways in which this symbol envisions the actualization of divine love in divine creative activity.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbxv">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter develops the first half of an exposition of the second major presupposition of the Christian symbol of divine suffering. As I have mentioned already, most specifically, this presupposition takes the following form:
                  God has created human life or being, through the actualization of the divine being as love in God’s self-limiting creative activity, in the image of God with the being or life of love. Working on the basis of the abstraction of being or life from its actualization, this chapter will identify and analyze the formal and material structures of the human as the image of God,<br>

  Abstract: In moving from the distinction between human being and human action to their union, through the present consideration of human being’s actualization, I note again the abstract character of this distinction: human being always remains, and one can examine it empirically only as,
                     ens actu, being-in-act. Also, the insights that this abstraction discloses about this symbol’s anthropological presupposition refer to aspects of essential human being.<br>

  Publisher: Les Presses de l'Université d'Ottawa<br>
  Author(s): Routhier Gilles<br>
  Abstract: The Second Vatican Council (1961-1965) was one of the most significant religious events of the twentieth-century. In Canada, it was part of a moment of unprecedented cultural and societal change, causing Canadian Catholics to reexamine the church's place and mission in the world. For four years, Canadian Catholic bishops met with their peers from around the globe to reflect on and debate the pressing issues facing the church. This bilingual volume explores the interpretation and reception of Vatican II in Canada, looking at many issues including the role of the media, the reactions of other Christians, the contributions of Canadian participants, the council's impact on religious practice and its contribution to the growth of inter-religious dialogue.<br>

  Abstract: This article investigates the role of one of Canada’s most prominent voices at the Second Vatican Council, that of Cardinal Paul-Émile Léger, from material found in several archival collections.² In recent years, several publications have already documented Léger’s conciliar activities, making clear that Léger was—in the context of Vatican II—omnipresent.³ Therefore, this contribution simply cannot study the full scope of Léger’s actions, let alone the entire story of his involvement in the council’s revelation debate, on which it will focus. On that debate too, much research has already been conducted. It remains a

  Author(s) Masemann Charlotte<br>
  Abstract: The systematic study of gardens as loci of food production during the Middle Ages has largely been overlooked by agrarian historians. Economic agrarian history is based epistemologically on the idea that human actions can best be understood through their economic foundations and consequences, and methodologically on the idea that the best and most accurate conclusions can be reached from a base of quantifiable and documented evidence. This strong epistemological and methodological base has resulted in a large body of excellent and rigorous work. Its focus on numbers and documents has, however, largely obscured the economic importance of cultivation carried out<br>

  Abstract: During the past decade, there has been increased interest in the theoretical construct of countertransference. Attempts have been made to broaden its meaning to include all of the therapist’s feelings toward the client, in therapy and beyond therapy, and not to limit its meaning to the expression of the therapist’s unconscious and conflicted feelings as a reaction to a client’s transference. To better appreciate this trend, it is essential to revisit the concept of countertransference and to ascertain its original meaning, see how it has evolved over time, and consider the factors that have contributed to its modification.<br>

  Book Title: Enjeux interculturels des médias-Altérités, transferts et violences<br>
  Publisher: Les Presses de l'Université d'Ottawa<br>
  Author(s): Moser Walter<br>
  Abstract: Cet ouvrage vise à éclairer deux problématiques actuelles, l'intermédialité - l'interaction des représentations médiatiques - et l'interculturalité - l'interaction des cultures. Trois questions principales guident les contributeurs au volume : Comment les médias se sont-ils inscrits dans le processus actuel de mondialisation culturelle ? Quelles sont les images d'autres cultures qu'ils construisent ? Dans quelle mesure les médias exercent-t-ils une violence par rapport à d'autres cultures qui n'ont pas l'habitude de se représenter dans les genres médiatiques de l'Occident ? Pour y répondre, les auteurs explorent le rôle des médias dans la connaissance de l'Autre, la violence interculturelle et la mondialisation. Ils découvrent que le fil conducteur réside dans la tension entre mondialisation et réappropriation, entre images stéréotypées et images complexes, entre violence médiatique et formes de résistance.<br>

Although he develops and refines this concept in association with his revelations regarding various forms of media, he also links this concept with larger cultural experiences.

  Abstract: Par quel bout aborder la question de la modernité qui, tout affectée qu’elle est de toutes sortes de crises, de nos jours, fait preuve d’une remarquable persistance, voire résilience? Mais, d’abord, de quelle modernité parle-t-on? En suivant les divers débats sur la modernité, nous observons en fait que «modernité » peut se référer à une multitude de scénarios discursifs sectoriels et partiels qui montrent souvent une tendance à occuper la totalité du champ en question et, de ce fait, à nous faire oublier que le paradigme moderne se constitue de la convergence et de l’interaction—souvent conflictuelle—de ces divers<br>

  Author(s) BERDOULAY Vincent<br>
  Abstract: La prospective actuelle portant sur le devenir de la francophonie canadienne ne peut faire l’économie d’une interrogation sur la mémoire, quel que soit le degré d’investissement avec lequel elle est convoquée. C’est en effet par son intermédiaire que des éléments du passé sont mobilisés pour justifier les actions présentes ou futures. Je voudrais montrer ici qu’elle est nécessairement une mémoire des lieux et que, à ce titre, elle soulève une série d’enjeux d’aménagement qui dépassent la trop rapide et trop fréquente référence au « lieu ».<br>

  Author(s) Sweet William<br>
  Abstract: The word “solidarity” and the call to solidarity are familiar to us all. “Solidarity” reminds many of us of the trade union movement that arose in 1980 in opposition to the Polish government, whose leader Lech Walesa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 and whose actions were instrumental in the collapse of totalitarian regimes in Central and Eastern Europe. And for some four decades, the term “solidarity” and the call to be “in solidarity” have been uttered wherever we find those in need–the poor, the oppressed, and the marginalized.<br>

  Author(s) Buckley R. Philip<br>
  Abstract: It is well known that for a long period within the phenomenological tradition itself, there was a tendency to view the
                  Crisis-texts of Husserl’s last years as marking a radical shift in his thought. Major figures such as Gadamer and Merleau-Ponty¹ are well-known exponents of this view, and even circumspect and insightful subsequent scholars such as Carr tend to stress the novelty, for example, of the infusion of history into Husserl’s later philosophy² Some treat this ‘novelty’ as a reaction to the historical crisis of the 1930s, and also imply that the proximity and popularity of Heidegger should not be<br>

  Abstract: This paper concerns an important and prominent theme in Hegelian study: the power of mediation to unite diverse voices in dark times. I begin with my interpretation of Hegel’s phenomenological subjectivity of “self-consciousness.” According to my reading of his
                  Phenomenology of Spirit, his dialogical project gives significant emphasis to the idea that mediation acts as a dialogical process of representational “interplay.” I briefly discuss the historical and conceptual origin of this idea as it pertains to Hegelian thought. The central aim of this paper is to account for the role of imagination epistemologically as it relates to moral action. Exploring<br>

  Abstract: One of the fundamental assumptions of the liberal tradition of democracy, and so of the institutions nourished explicitly or implicitly by that tradition, is that there are a plurality of values that can conflict with one another and that are not reducible to one another. Consequently, it is widely accepted that value conflicts will not be eliminated. We do not expect to resolve our value conflicts to the satisfaction of all parties.¹ However, this belief sets up a problem for social living. How can this irreducible pluralism of values be combined with a notion of legitimate social or collective action?<br>

  Publisher: Les Presses de l'Université d'Ottawa<br>
  Author(s): Le Blanc Charles<br>
  Abstract: Lauréat du Prix Victor-Barbeau et finaliste des Prix littéraires du Gouverneur général.Sans théorie générale, la traduction est limitée à réfléchir sur son activité de communication et à n'être jamais qu'une fraction d'une discipline nommée herméneutique. Cette limitation de la traduction à son rôle de communication, rôle qui marque un certain enfermement dans le langage, forme ce que l'on nomme le « complexe d'Hermès ». Cet ouvrage entend montrer qu'il est possible de sortir de cet enfermement du langage en considérant comment l'usage de la langue participe au sens du message, comment l'organisation rhétorique participe au sens fondamental du langage. Cela étant, on déplace la traduction de la linguistique à l'esthétique, permettant un discours théorique sur la traduction en tant que discipline esthétique. Sur ce chemin, on trouve alors Apollon, le dieu de la théorie et le dieu des arts, qui a raison d'Hermès, dieu du langage et dieu des menteurs.<br>

  Abstract: We have been reading certain developments in German philosophy as an attempt to close the gap between Kant’s transcendental apparatus and the world to which that apparatus gives order and coherence. We have seen, however, that none of the developments under consideration has been able to provide a completely transcendental or a priori account of the Kantian schema. Rather schemata appear to result from the interaction of the mind and the empirical data of experience. Hence we might conclude with Heidegger that it is through schemata that what we call a “world” is first opened up. In confronting these diverse<br>

Actually, though, it was not a lecture on Islam and Christianity at all, but a subtle and carefully constructed discussion of faith and human reason.

  Abstract: This ethnography explores how Balinese citizens produce postcolonial intimacy-a complex interaction of claims to proximity and mutuality between themselves and the Dutch under colonialism that continues today. Such claims, Ana Dragojlovic explains, are crucial for the diasporic reconfiguration of kebalian, or Balinese-ness, a concept that encompasses the personal, social, and cultural complexities involved in Balinese identity in Dutch postcolonial society. This identity enables Balinese migrants to see themselves as carriers of unique cultural traditions both promoted by and in disagreement with Dutch cultural values.<br>

  Book Title: Body or the Soul?-Religion and Culture in a Quebec Parish, 1736-1901<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): ABBOTT FRANK A.<br>
  Abstract: There are many analyses of Tractarianism – a nineteenth-century form of Anglicanism that emphasized its Catholic origins – but how did people in the colonies react to the High Church movement? Beating against the Wind, a study in nineteenth-century vernacular spirituality, emphasizes the power of faith on a shifting frontier in a transatlantic world. Focusing on people living along the Newfoundland and Labrador coast, Calvin Hollett presents a nuanced perspective on popular resistance to the colonial emissary Bishop Edward Feild and his spiritual regimen of order, silence, and solemnity. Whether by outright opposing Bishop Feild, or by simply ignoring his wishes and views, or by brokering a hybrid style of Gothic architecture, the people of Newfoundland and Labrador demonstrated their independence in the face of an attempt at hierarchical ascendency upon the arrival of Tractarianism in British North America. Instead, they continued to practise evangelical Anglicanism and participate in Methodist revivals, and thereby negotiated a popular Protestantism, one often infused with the spirituality of other seafarers from Nova Scotia and New England. Exploring the interaction between popular spirituality and religious authority, Beating against the Wind challenges the traditional claim of Feild’s success in bringing Tractarianism to the colony while exploring the resistance to Feild’s initiatives and the reasons for his disappointments.There are many analyses of Tractarianism – a nineteenth-century form of Anglicanism that emphasized its Catholic origins – but how did people in the colonies react to the High Church movement?

  Abstract: Pre–Civil War Americans turned to all sorts of technology, from canals, steam power, and the telegraph to more obscure forms such as the daguerreotype and mining lamps, to hasten the pace of economic and moral progress. Law was another key technology they used. The law worked in favor of economic growth in several ways. First, judicial decisions self-consciously molded the law to promote economic efficiency. Second, legislatures used statutes to streamline credit markets, market transactions, and the formation of corporations. For the last several decades, scholars have often invoked Morton J.

It is a world of visits and conversations, which usually take place in houses and gardens. We do not see people at work; we do not directly encounter violent action or violent passion.

  Abstract: Jane Austen’s novels present a world more schematic than we are accustomed to find in more recent fiction. The schematism arises in part from her “vocabulary of discrimination,”² those abstract words which classify actions in moral terms. Wittgenstein’s remarks recall the adaptability of our responses, the readiness of our minds to discover how a literary work conveys its meanings and to make insensible adjustments to the forms its signs may take.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1dr37p0">Forms of Life</a><br>
  Abstract: Stendhal’s irony is more radical than Jane Austen’s. His characters tend to be unstable compounds, and they demand a shifting and flexible response from the reader. That response is enacted for us by the narrator, who regards his hero from constantly varying distances and directions. Stendhal’s rhetoric recalls, in its shifts and dodges, the example of Byron’s
                  Don Juan. That poem, like Stendhal’s novels, is a work of an age of reaction and political repression, of institutionalized banality. Behind both lie the French Revolution and the remarkable career of Napoleon. The vitality of the revolution and of the young Napoleon<br>

  9  James: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1dr37p0">Forms of Life</a><br>
  Abstract: In his later novels, Henry James leaves some crucial portion of his action, and of his characters, indeterminate. He does this, in part, by giving us characters’ conscious responses—at a somewhat shallow level of awareness—without accounting for their deeper motives or even, in some cases, indicating whether the surface awareness is consistent with what lies below. By a shallow level I mean only that the principal action of his novels takes place close enough to the surface of consciousness to alert us to meanings that are almost evident and therefore the more frustrating for their elusiveness.

  Abstract: By the time Sigmund Freud published
                  The Interpretation of Dreams(1900), the principles of psychoanalysis were in place. What were they? Laplanche and Pontalis’s scrupulous definition of psychoanalysis begins: “a method of investigation which consists essentially in bringing out the unconscious meanings of the words, the actions and the products of the imagination … of a particular subject” (367; cf. Freud, 1923b:235). This discovery or institution of the unconscious, that dark realm that governs us but which we cannot govern, whose contents express themselves obliquely—not transparently—in displacements, sublimations, condensations, and substitutions, was to be defining for psychoanalysis.

  Book Title: Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging meditation on the nature and purpose of hermeneutics, Gerald L. Bruns argues that hermeneutics is not merely a contemporary theory but an extended family of questions about understanding and interpretation that have multiple and conflicting histories going back to before the beginning of writing.What does it mean to understand a riddle, an action, a concept, a law, an alien culture, or oneself? Bruns expands our sense of the horizons of hermeneutics by situating its basic questions against a background of different cultural traditions and philosophical topics. He discusses, for example, the interpretation of oracles, the silencing of the muses and the writing of history, the quarrel between philosophy and poetry, the canonization of sacred texts, the nature of allegorical exegesis, rabbinical midrash, the mystical exegesis of the Qur'an, the rise of literalism and the individual interpreter, and the nature of Romantic hermeneutics. Dealing with thinkers ranging from Socrates to Luther to Wordsworth to Ricoeur, Bruns also ponders several basic dilemmas about the nature of hermeneutical experience, the meaning of tradition, the hermeneutical function of narrative, and the conflict between truth and freedom in philosophy and literature. His eloquent book demonstrates the continuing power of hermeneutical thinking to open up questions about the world and our place in it.<br>

  Introduction: from:

  Abstract: Let me try to situate my book by taking up, in some fairly familiar ways, the question of what sort of thing hermeneutics might he and what its point is. The simplest answer is that hermeneutics is a tradition of thinking or of philosophical reflection that tries to clarify the concept of
                  verstehen, that is, understanding. What is it to make sense of anything, whether a poem, a legal text, a human action, a language, an alien culture, or oneself? The difficulty is that this is not an entirely coherent question; or rather, the question of understanding turns up in<br>

  Abstract: Not all texts are for reading. Of course, the word
                  textitself contradicts this idea. Discourse from a textual standpoint is not so much expression as ciphering and concealing, that is, plotting and weaving, layering and folding, structuring and packing; and these are metaphors that call for reading in the strong modernist sense of analytical action. Texts impose tasks that it seems natural for us to characterize in the language of instrumental reason—of grasping and penetrating, getting on top of and breaking down, unpacking and laying bare.

  Book Title: La transformation sociale par l'innovation sociale-  Publisher: Presses de l'Université du Québec<br>
  Author(s): Roy Matthieu<br>
  Abstract: Les innovations sociales, à la manière de bougies d’allumage, engendrent des actions collectives qui proposent des solutions différentes de celles des pratiques dominantes en mettant l’économie au service des personnes et de la société. Or la simple multiplication des innovations sociales ne peut générer la transformation sociale à elle seule. La mise en relation des mouvements sociaux et de leur visée émancipatoire est nécessaire pour façonner de nouvelles normes et règles et mettre en place de nouveaux sentiers institutionnels. Ce sont certains de ces nouveaux sentiers que montrent les textes regroupés dans cet ouvrage. Fruit du ive Colloque international du Centre de recherche sur les innovations sociales, il expose les enjeux que pose la trans-formation sociale par l’innovation sociale et les documente par des illustrations ciblées sur des thématiques ou des expériences précises. Une discussion théorique sur le lien entre l’innovation sociale et la transformation sociale est d’abord proposée, puis les méthodes d’analyse de l’innovation sociale, le partage de connaissance entre les chercheurs et les acteurs sociaux, le rôle de l’État et des politiques publiques, l’économie solidaire et la place de l’entreprise sociale sont abordés. L’ensemble des textes analytiques et des textes illustratifs de cet ouvrage offre des pistes de réflexion sur la transformation sociale par l’inno-vation sociale, c’est-à-dire sur la façon dont certaines expérimen-tations aboutissent à la transformation de la société. L’ouvrage met ainsi de l’avant le rôle des citoyens et des organisations qui travaillent pour le bien-être des collectivités en expérimentant des solutions à leurs problèmes et en se mobilisant pour exiger leur reconnaissance. Il vise à poser les jalons pour comprendre et participer à la reconstruction sociale déjà à l’œuvre, dans le but de la renforcer.<br>

  Abstract: Alors que l’innovation sociale est sur toutes les tribunes et qu’elle s’affirme comme objet de recherche et comme source d’inspiration pour le renouvellement de l’action publique, il s’avère nécessaire, pour mieux l’analyser, en mesurer l’incidence et l’évaluer, de développer des méthodologies, des outils de diagnostic et des indicateurs pertinents. C’est ce que proposent les trois chapitres et les trois textes illustratifs compris dans cette partie.Tout d’abord, le texte de Frank Moulaert interroge les dérives épistémologiques de la recherche sur l’innovation sociale, puis présente les jalons d’une méthode d’analyse qui s’applique au domaine du développement territorial.

  Abstract: Notre présentation porte sur la relation partenariale qui prend forme entre des praticiens et des chercheurs dans le cadre de recherches impliquant une relation étroite entre ces deux acteurs. Dans la littérature, ce type de recherche se retrouve sous des dénominations différentes : recherche collaborative, recherche-action, recherche partenariale, recherche participative. Ces dénominations impliquent une relation étroite entre chercheurs et praticiens tout au long du processus de recherche.

  Abstract: Chaque initiative d’innovation sociale prend racine dans un terreau spécifique qui influe sur son évolution, sur sa trajectoire. Une approche territoriale permet la prise en compte de l’ensemble des acteurs impliqués dans les processus innovants et de faire ressortir les événements déclencheurs, les ressources mobilisées ainsi que les processus qui mènent à l’ancrage territorial des initiatives. Les textes regroupés dans cette partie abordent l’effet territorial dans l’innovation sociale.

  Author(s) Fournis Yann<br>
  Abstract: La dialectique innovation/institution est mal comprise. Concevoir l’innovation sociale au Canada et au Québec sur un mode monologique serait trompeur: conformément au style canadien des politiques réglementaires, l’État ne peut produire seul une politique innovatrice et doit nécessairement s’appuyer sur l’action de la société civile et des mouvements sociaux qui font le lien entre elle et la société politique. Symétriquement, la société civile ne se réalise pas dans l’apesanteur institutionnelle; pour émerger et se définir, elle renvoie et s’articule aux programmes et politiques configurant l’espace politique national. Or, en dépit de sa diversité, la réflexion québécoise sur le mouvement communautaire<br>

  Author(s) Hagemann-White Carol<br>
  Abstract: Violence against women was neither recognized as a significant problem, nor was it studied empirically, until women’s political action in the 1970s and 1980s. In particular, the success of grassroots feminist activism in creating hotlines, shelters, and counseling centres for women made men’s violence visible as a widespread social problem and a structural element in gender relations. Thus, in much of Western Europe, addressing violence against women began by creating places of safety and support for victims.<br>

  Abstract: In French and several other languages, the notion of judgment designates both a “faculty” or “capacity” and an action that takes place within the sphere of public or private relations. It can have a general neutral signification (that of an evaluation about the adequacy of means to ends or to the quality of the ends themselves). But more often it designates, in dissymmetrical fashion, the determination of a deserved or undeserved sanction upon the action of a subject, especially when the action in question is a “crime” or a “delict.”<br>

  Book Title: Taking Hold of the Real-Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Profound Worldliness of Christianity<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Harvey Barry<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer writes in one of his last prison letters that he had “come to know and understand more and more the profound this-worldliness of Christianity." In Taking Hold of the Real, Barry Harvey engages in constructive conversation with Bonhoeffer, contending that the “shallow and banal this-worldliness" of modern society is ordered to a significant degree around the social technologies of religion, culture, and race. These mechanisms displace human beings from their traditional connections with particular locales, and relocate them in their “proper places" as determined by the nation-state and capitalist markets. Christians are called to participate in the profound this-worldliness that breaks into the world in the apocalyptic action of Jesus Christ, a form of life that requires discipline and an understanding of death and resurrection. The church is a sacrament of this new humanity, performing for all to hear the polyphony of life that was prefigured in the Old Testament and now is realised in Christ. Unable to find a faithful form of this-worldliness in wartime Germany, Bonhoeffer joined the conspiracy against Hitler, a decision aptly contrasted with a small French church that, prepared by its life together over many generations, saved thousands of Jewish lives.<br>

  Abstract: As we have seen in the previous chapter, in constant tension with the representations of space of London’s orderly West End and tourist attractions are spaces of urban disorder, social ‘dysfunction’, and poverty that continually threaten to depose the institutional and ideological clarity of the figured city. For the French travellers examined in this chapter, spaces of disorder perform in correspondence and contrast with the monumentality of more official sites.

  Book Title: Acting for Others-Trinitarian Communion and Christological Agency<br>
  Publisher: Fortress Press<br>
  Author(s): Hinlicky Paul R.<br>
  Abstract: This book explores why the metaphor of the church as a family is insufficient. Taking up Arendt’s notions of action and her criticism of privatization, the author examines community, relation, and human subjects through the work of Bonhoeffer and Stăniloae. Synthesizing Bonhoeffer and Stăniloae, Christian calling is unfolded not only as acting for others, but also with others as Trinitarian participatory response—response to the words and deeds of the three divine Persons acting in communion.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ggjhd0">Acting for Others</a><br>
  Abstract: Bonhoeffer’s¹ theology of Christian agency is shaped by his notion of “being for others,” formulated also as living or existing for others. In this chapter, the interpersonal dimensions of action will be put into the foreground. With that aim, the following questions will be raised: what moves Christians to act? Does such acting necessarily entail fatherly and obedient approach of a dependent within and outside of the church? How is Christian acting interconnected with Christian freedom and equality? Since Christian acting is to find its fullest expression in the church, is there a connection between his understanding of Christian acting<br>

  Abstract: Human persons are invited and mercifully empowered by God to participate in the movement of love between the divine Persons, believes Stăniloae¹. What happens with a concept of action, when the life of the Trinity is one of its underlying foundations? In this chapter, I will trace the way in which Stăniloae’s theology of the Trinity as being for-one-another and also with-one-another has consequences for viewing acting as a communal and also common venture, open for a participation of others. This new feature of acting will constitute a crucial addition to this debate.<br>

  Abstract: Up until this point, I have concentrated on the church’s familial metaphor separately from reflecting on Christian action, which is embodied in it, and its challenges. In this final chapter, I will place the church’s understanding expressed in the family metaphor within the context of its calling to a specific kind of action—in terms of communal and common action. What is reflected in it? Is the church compared to a family still pertinent or does Christian acting of equals delineate another metaphor of the church?<br>

Their decoration required additional crafting time, labour and skill, altering their appearance and changing the interactions between the individual user, the vessel, and other participants within their context of use. Much emphasis has been placed within the discipline of archaeology on the communicative aspects of material culture (cf.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ggjkqm">An Archaeology of Prehistoric Bodies and Embodied Identities in the Eastern Mediterranean</a><br>
  Author(s) Kouka Ourania<br>
  Abstract: Following the aforementioned definition, which corresponds also to theoretical approaches of embodiment and its perception (Merleau-Ponty 1964, 159–90; Lesure 2005), it is argued that the built environment demonstrates from prehistoric times an anthropogenic system of closed and open spaces for hosting every-day life, economic, social and symbolic activities. It represents, therefore, an agent through which the needs, abilities and habits of humans are embodied, but also the field for economic and social interaction. Moreover, built environment — domestic, funeral, and sacred — displays the existential ground of culture that allows the identification of its cognitive creator and owner.<br>

  22  Secondary Burials and the Construction of Group Identities in Crete between the Second Half of the 4th and 2nd Millennia BC from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ggjkqm">An Archaeology of Prehistoric Bodies and Embodied Identities in the Eastern Mediterranean</a><br>
  Author(s) Todaro Simona<br>
  Abstract: Secondary mortuary practices entail the primary inhumation of the individual and the subsequent manipulation of its skeletal remains with actions of disarticulation, collection and relocation of selected bones from one location to another. It is, therefore, not easily identifiable in communal tombs,
                  i.e.in those funerary structures that were used for successive multiple burials that required the partial or total relocation of the previous inhumations in order to allow the re-use of the burial ground. It is therefore hardly surprising that secondary mortuary practices have only recently been recognised in the communal tombs of the central and western Mediterranean from<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ggjkqm">An Archaeology of Prehistoric Bodies and Embodied Identities in the Eastern Mediterranean</a><br>
  Author(s) Galanakis Yannis<br>
  Abstract: Although mortuary data is one of the primary sources for studying the Late Bronze Age (LBA) in the Aegean, it is often studied in isolation from the complex, multi-staged processes and performances that made up the funeral and everything that followed it. The depositional sequence of these actions is most frequently overlooked, not least because of practical difficulties in reconstructing these events and the ephemeral and often ambiguous nature of the evidence. Despite these limitations, however, there are many clues, both direct — in the form of residual remains — and indirect — in the form of purposefully destroyed things¹ — that hint at<br>

  Book Title: Marxism and Form-20th-Century Dialectical Theories of Literature<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): SARTRE JEAN-PAUL<br>
  Abstract: For more than thirty years, Fredric Jameson has been one of the most productive, wide-ranging, and distinctive literary theorists in the United States and the Anglophone world. Marxism and Form provided a pioneering account of the work of the major European Marxist theorists--T. W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse, Ernst Bloch, Georg Lukács, and Jean-Paul Sartre--work that was, at the time, largely neglected in the English-speaking world. Through penetrating readings of each theorist, Jameson developed a critical mode of engagement that has had tremendous in.uence. He provided a framework for analyzing the connection between art and the historical circumstances of its making--in particular, how cultural artifacts distort, repress, or transform their circumstances through the abstractions of aesthetic form.<br>

  Freud, Adorno, and the Ban on Images from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gk0831">Psychoanalytic Mediations between Marxist and Postcolonial Readings of the Bible</a><br>
  Author(s) Boer Roland<br>
  Abstract: It is less recognized than it should be that Theodor Adorno’s key noncategory of the
                  Bilderverbot, or ban on images, owes as much to overturning sigmund Freud’s argument concerning idolatry as it does to the biblical ban on images. Of course, both bounce their thoughts off the second commandment of Exod 20 (and Deut 5). Yet Freud’s interpretation runs the risk of replicating precisely what the ban seeks to overcome, for the abstraction he espies in the ban is precisely the move that reinstalls idolatry. For this reason, Adorno seeks to deploy the ban on images in a way that<br>

  Abstract: Modiano is still best known for writing novels set in the Occupation. His apparent obsession, especially in his earlier works, with this dark period of French history has been the main concern of his critics and reviewers. It is certainly a controversial subject: it was one of the main causes for the impact that Modiano’s first novels had on the public, instantly creating a reputation for the young author.¹ We may wonder, however, whether there was more to this reaction than that of simple choice of subject matter. What is the nature of Modiano’s treatment of the subject? Is it<br>

  Author(s) Chivallon Christine<br>
  Abstract: This chapter is concerned with the development of new patrimonial and museographical practices relating to transatlantic slavery in France and its far-flung overseas departments in the Caribbean.² From the outset, it is worth recalling that these departments consist of micro-societies that were born out of slavery and whose historical trajectory has yet to find its rightful place within that of the French nation. What follows may therefore appear surprising since the proposed analysis chimes a dissonant note amid the increasing clamour for action at a museal level for the creation of places to collect, remember and honour the memory of<br>

  Book Title: Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fiction-Explorations in Readers' Engagement with Characters<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): CARACCIOLO MARCO<br>
  Abstract: A storyteller's craft can often be judged by how convincingly the narrative captures the identity and personality of its characters. In this book, the characters who take center stage are "strange" first-person narrators: they are fascinating because of how they are at odds with what the reader would wish or expect to hear-while remaining reassuringly familiar in voice, interactions, and conversations. Combining literary analysis with research in cognitive and social psychology, Marco Caracciolo focuses on readers' encounters with the "strange" narrators of ten contemporary novels, including Bret Easton Ellis's
      American Psycho, Haruki Murakami'sHard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, and Mark Haddon'sThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. Caracciolo explores readers' responses to narrators who suffer from neurocognitive or developmental disorders, who are mentally disturbed due to multiple personality disorder or psychopathy, whose consciousness is split between two parallel dimensions or is disembodied, who are animals, or who lose their sanity.A foray into current work on reception, reader-response, cognitive literary study, and narratology,Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fictionillustrates why any encounter with a fictional text is a complex negotiation of interlaced feelings, thoughts, experiences, and interpretations.<br>

  Author(s) O’Donnell Mike<br>
  Abstract: The title of this collection may prompt two types of reaction. For some, it is inappropriate to talk about the resurgence of phenomena that have become established and ‘mainstream’. Personal freedoms in sexual relations, artistic expression and ongoing campaigns for equal rights have all become institutionalised in the past 40 years. However for other readers, familiar with the extravagant mission of the counter-culture and the shrivelling of revolutionary – or pseudo-revolutionary – politicking, the ‘spirit of the 60s’ may be thought of as beyond resuscitation. As one seasoned political journalist recently opined: ‘1968 was not a beginning – it was<br>

  Abstract: As the highpoint of sixties radicalism, 1968 was a year of action. This was certainly true for London’s Institute of Contemporary Arts which moved that year from its small premises in Dover Street to its current grander location on the Mall. However, Roland Barthes comments that, ‘every national shock produces a sudden flowering of written commentary’ (1968, 149) and 1968 was also a year of prolific written documentation. The immediacy of 1968’s historicization not only reveals its importance, but also its compromises and failures, as writers struggled to make sense of its disparate aims and ideological absences.

  Abstract: The 1980s witnessed a remarkable change in the social sciences, a significant renewal of sociological theory. In France it was an occasion to discover and appreciate, albeit with significant delay, the contribution of Anglo-Saxon sociological currents which had earlier been dismissed or underestimated, such as symbolic interactionism, ethno-methodology, and phenomenological sociology. Through the 1960s and 1970s, French sociology was limited mainly to four major currents, which Alain Touraine proposed to call ‘the four corners of sociology’, represented by Raymond Boudon, Pierre Bourdieu, Michel Crozier, and Alain Touraine himself. The debates in the social sciences during this period significantly turned around<br>

  Abstract: In the French edition of

And what potential contribution can intellectuals make to it? This last question is the one that I would like to address here, taking Bourdieu’s own answers to it as my starting point. The aim will not be to analyse the concrete orientation of his public interventions, but instead to understand the type of articulation between<br>

  Book Title: The Resounding Soul-Reflections on the Metaphysics and Vivacity of the Human Person<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Kimbriel Samuel<br>
  Abstract: It is surely not coincidental that the term “soul" should mean not only the centre of a creature’s life and consciousness, but also a thing or action characterized by intense vivacity (“that bike’s got soul!"). It also seems far from coincidental that the same contemporary academic discussions that have largely cast aside the language of “soul" in their quest to define the character of human mental life should themselves be so – how to say it? – bloodless, so lacking in soul. This volume arises from the opposite premise, namely that the task of understanding human nature is bound up with and in important respects dependent upon the more critical task of learning to be fully human, of learning to have soul. The papers collected here are derived from a conference in Oxford sponsored by the Centre of Theology and Philosophy and together explore the often surprising landscape that emerges when human consciousness is approached from this angle. Drawing upon literary, philosophical, theological, historical, and musical modes of analysis, the essays of this volume vividly remind the reader of the power of the ancient language of soul over against contemporary impulses to reduce, fragment, and overly determine human selfhood.<br>

  Abstract: If the epistemology of the signatories, the agents, of the racial contract requires evasion and denial of the realities of race, the epistemology of the victims, the objects, of the racial contract is, unsurprisingly, focused on these realities themselves.

Since its colonization by European settlers, Canada has built an economy around the extraction of resources destined to feed colonial capitals. In its early days, Canada simply exported whatever was wanted in Europe (furs, mostly). Economist and historian Harold Innis’s now-classic articulation of the staples thesis holds that Canada developed as it did because of its grounding in the export of staple goods like fur, fish, and other raw materials.

(These need not involve tales of actual motion or much, if any, movement—consider Beckett’s minimalism or the generic predicates for entropy in naturalist writing.)

Respiration, reproduction, digestion, blood circulation, and waste removal are functions of these metabolic processes. One driver of metabolism is the endocrine system, which regulates the flow of hormones through the body. Hormones act as a complex exchange of messages among different states and locations.

  Abstract: Texas looms large in contemporary oil culture. The state’s first major oil well, Spindletop, came in in 1901 and led to the formation of Gulf Oil and Texaco. Since then, Texas has figured in oil culture as a site of extraction and refining, a center for the multinational corporate oil industry, and an anchor for the oil industry’s ideological construction as an innately heroic, individualistic, and deeply American enterprise. This prominence is somewhat odd, considering that Pennsylvania was the site of the modern oil industry’s origin in the United States.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1hrdn0m">Children of God in the World</a><br>
  Abstract: We have just considered what might be called the “objective-metaphysical” side of grace: humans, through the gift of God, are transformed, ontologically elevated, renewed to the depths of their being and faculties by divine grace. On the basis of this elevation we shall now consider the “psychological-moral” side of the life of grace, that is, the renewal that God brings about within the faculties and actions of the human person. In effect, with grace God infuses truly divine powers into the soul, usually called “infused virtues,” powers with which Christians act as God’s children in a truly Christ-like and pneumatological<br>

  16  GRACE AND HUMAN FREEDOM: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1hrdn0m">Children of God in the World</a><br>
  Abstract: In the preceding chapters we considered God’s love for us in terms of “uncreated grace” and God as one who gives himself to humans, adopting them as his children in the Holy Spirit. Then we looked into the dynamics of the supernatural organism, fruit of God’s action, which remains stably present and active in believers; this is often referred to as “created grace.” But another important issue still needs to be considered, an articulated and complex one that refers to the relationship between divine grace and free human response, what we have called the personal-existential aspect of the life of<br>

  Abstract: One of the most obvious distinctions between persons is the sexual one, between man and woman, between male and female. Sexual difference manifests itself not only physiologically, but also psychologically and with differentiating features in the areas of affectivity and cognition.⁴ In this chapter, however, we cannot consider in depth the complex issues that refer to the psychological, sociological, and human differences between men and women and the corresponding myriad social implications, but rather we shall consider the theological statute of the difference, considering it on the basis of the creation of human persons, of their present action, of their<br>

  Author(s) FRAWLEY OONA<br>
  Abstract: A striking aspect of Irish studies has been its success beyond Ireland’s geographical boundaries. Indeed, much of the initial impetus for Irish studies as a field seemed to come from outside of Ireland, and it is now usual to hear of Irish studies not only at an array of Irish and American universities, not only in English-speaking countries such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, but also in places where it might seem more unexpected: in Japan, Brazil, France. Part of the attraction of Irish studies is undoubtedly the list of world-class Irish writers on whom thousands of theses and<br>

  Abstract: Let me begin on a personal note. Although I am known among my family and friends for having a good memory, I have long been aware, since childhood, of the attractions, even the desirability, of forgetting. Indeed, in my teens and twenties, I used to regularly experience what I grew to call “amnesia fantasies”: wish-fulfillment fantasies in which I imagined myself suffering from amnesia and having no idea who I was. In that condition, I could be unburdened of my own troubles and free to move on. I suspect I am not alone in having had such fantasies: after all,<br>

  Abstract: In the opening months of 1942, Marshal Pétain was still popular in sectors of this new French State. Church authorities were still willing to regard some of the more odious actions the government took (e.g., the Jewish Statute of October 3) as necessary compromises made in exchange for the Vichy government’s independent status. Pétain’s emphasis on the three virtues of work, family, and fatherland was accepted as a commonplace template for the moral reform of the French nation. Church publications made repeated favorable comment on this celebrated triptych. The president of the ÉRF, Pastor Boegner, was still in support of<br>

  Book Title: Disability Rhetoric-  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dolmage Jay Timothy<br>
  Abstract: Disability Rhetoric is the first book to view rhetorical theory and history through the lens of disability studies. Traditionally, the body has been seen as, at best, a rhetorical distraction; at worst, those whose bodies do not conform to a narrow range of norms are disqualified from speaking. Yet, Dolmage argues that communication has always been obsessed with the meaning of the body and that bodily difference is always highly rhetorical. Following from this rewriting of rhetorical history, he outlines the development of a new theory, affirming the ideas that all communication is embodied, that the body plays a central role in all expression, and that greater attention to a range of bodies is therefore essential to a better understanding of rhetorical histories, theories, and possibilities.<br>

  Book Title: Prophetic Politics-Emmanuel Levinas and the Sanctification of Suffering<br>
  Publisher: Ohio University Press<br>
  Author(s): HAROLD PHILIP J.<br>
  Abstract: In
      Prophetic Politics,Philip J. Haroldoffers an original interpretation of the political dimension of Emmanuel Levinas's thought. Harold argues that Levinas's mature position inOtherwise Than Beingbreaks radically with the dialogical inclinations of his earlierTotality and Infinityand that transformation manifests itself most clearly in the peculiar nature of Levinas's relationship to politics.Levinas's philosophy is concerned not with the ethical per se, in either its applied or its transcendent forms, but with the source of ethics. Once this source is revealed to be an anarchic interruption of our efforts to think the ethical, Levinas's political claims cannot be read as straightforward ideological positions or principles for political action. They are instead to be understood "prophetically," a position that Harold finds comparable to the communitarian critique of liberalism offered by such writers as Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor. In developing this interpretation, which runs counter to formative influences from the phenomenological tradition, Harold traces Levinas's debt to phenomenological descriptions of such experiences as empathy and playfulness.Prophetic Politicswill highlight the relevance of the phenomenological tradition to contemporary ethical and political thought-a long-standing goal of the series-while also making a significant and original contribution to Levinas scholarship.<br>

Ethics is the study of morality, an answer to the question “What are we to do?” In the vulgar sense of the term, when I am concerned for how my actions affect others—when I am put in question, as Levinas says—I have an ethical attitude. I can of course have a variety of other attitudes: professional, profit-maximizing, theoretical, and intimate all come to mind. As a discipline, ethics takes all of these into consideration, and is incomplete without the study of politics, as Aristotle taught. Ethics, and ultimately<br>

  Book Title: The Intimate. Polity and the Catholic Church-Laws about Life, Death and the Family in So-called Catholic Countries<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): PÉREZ-AGOTE ALFONSO<br>
  Abstract: The waning influence of the Catholic church in the ethical and political debate. For centuries the Catholic Church was able to impose her ethical rules in matters related to the intimate, that is, questions concerning life (from its beginning until its end) and the family, in the so-called Catholic countries in Western Europe. When the polity started to introduce legislation that was in opposition to the Catholic ethic, the ecclesiastical authorities and part of the population reacted. The media reported massive manifestations in France against same-sex marriages and in Spain against the de-penalization of abortion. In Italy the Episcopal conference entered the political field in opposition to the relaxation of several restrictive legal rules concerning medically assisted procreation and exhorted the voters to abstain from voting so that the referendum did not obtain the necessary quorum. In Portugal, to the contrary, the Church made a “pact" with the prime minister so that the law on same-sex marriages did not include the possibility of adoption. And in Belgium the Episcopal conference limited its actions to clearly expressing with religious, legal, and anthropological arguments its opposition to such laws, which all other Episcopal conferences did also. In this book, the authors analyse the full spectrum of the issue, including the emergence of such laws; the political discussions; the standpoints defended in the media by professionals, ethicists, and politicians; the votes in the parliaments; the political interventions of the Episcopal conferences; and the attitude of professionals. As a result the reader understands what was at stake and the differences in actions of the various Episcopal conferences. The authors also analyse the pro and con evaluations among the civil population of such actions by the Church. Finally, in a comparative synthesis, they discuss the public positions taken by Pope Francis to evaluate if a change in Church policy might be possible in the near future.

  Book Title: Sémiotique et vécu musical-Du sens à l'expérience, de l'expérience au sens<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Reybrouck Mark<br>
  Abstract: Nouvelles perspectives en sémiotique. Tout est musique, et la musique nous accompagne partout : ces lieux communs n’ont jamais été si vrais qu’aujourd’hui, au temps de l’arrosage musical continuel. Cette ubiquité, loin d’être simplement une mode, nous oblige à repenser sémiotiquement la fonction et le fonctionnement de la musique. Les essais composant Sémiotique et vécu musical montrent dans quelle direction se dirigent les recherches de nos jours. L’analyse de l’expérience musicale, par exemple, détermine la réception affective, peut provoquer l’ébranlement intérieur, transformer le temps vécu, changer et déterminer les structures de l’expérience ainsi que l’expérientialité. L’expérience musicale est profondément liée à l’incarnation et à la corporalité. Elle peut redéfinir l’horizon de compréhension, moduler les attentes, déterminer et délimiter les contenus phénoménaux. Elle est fondamentalement conditionnée par l’interaction physique avec un instrument ou encore modelée par le studio d’enregistrement. L’intelligence artificielle et l’usage de robots dans des spectacles commencent à remettre en cause nos conceptions de l’expérience musicale. Ces nouvelles perspectives développées en sémiotique s’ouvrent nécessairement et impérativement aux sciences cognitives, aux nouvelles approches de la musicologie, à la transdisciplinarité et au transmédial. Le caractère innovant du présent ouvrage qui touche la théorie, la méthodologie et l’empirisme, témoigne de la vivacité, de l’inventivité et du dynamisme qui caractérisent la sémiotique toujours jeune, curieuse et surprenante.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1jkts7v">Sémiotique et vécu musical</a><br>
  Author(s) Manzaneque Gabriel<br>
  Abstract: Dans le cadre d’une activité musicale, le recours à un objet intermédiaire, un « outil » (Schaeffner, [1968] 1994, p. 370), caractérise la notion d’acte instrumental. L’objet-instrument est pourvu d’une zone fonctionnelle où l’instrumentiste intervient afin d’émettre des sons et de produire du musical par la mise en vibration du corps instrumental et le jeu par agencement des sons et des intervalles. Cette zone, généralement
                  haptique¹, permet un processus de translation, d’encodage et d’interaction des corps, instrumentiste et instrumental. Ce processus tend à s’affiner au fil de l’évolution musicienne et musicale de l’individu. En effet, chaque occurrence de quelque activité<br>

  Abstract: Dans le cadre des productions de musiques actuelles, le studio d’enregistrement est un lieu d’un intérêt capital dans l’élaboration du projet artistique.

  Abstract: In her book

She demonstrates this on the basis of a comparative study between English and Polish requests. Using a series of examples she shows that the interaction between an Englishman and a Pole does not always go smoothly, because of the fact that differences in the formulation and interpretation of requests can lead to misunderstandings. According to Wierzbicka, two cultural values held by Poles seem to motivate certain lexico-syntactic phenomena in this type of speech acts namely cordiality and courtesy.<br>

  Book Title: New Romantic Cyborgs-Romanticism, Information Technology, and the End of the Machine<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Coeckelbergh Mark<br>
  Abstract: Romanticism and technology are widely assumed to be opposed to each other. Romanticism -- understood as a reaction against rationalism and objectivity -- is perhaps the last thing users and developers of information and communication technology (ICT) think about when they engage with computer programs and electronic devices. And yet, as Mark Coeckelbergh argues in this book, this way of thinking about technology is itself shaped by romanticism and obscures a better and deeper understanding of our relationship to technology. Coeckelbergh describes the complex relationship between technology and romanticism that links nineteenth-century monsters, automata, and mesmerism with twenty-first-century technology's magic devices and romantic cyborgs.Coeckelbergh argues that current uses of ICT can be interpreted as attempting a marriage of Enlightenment rationalism and romanticism. He describes the "romantic dialectic," when this new kind of material romanticism, particularly in the form of the cyborg as romantic figure, seems to turn into its opposite. He shows that both material romanticism and the objections to it are still part of modern thinking, and part of the romantic dialectic. Reflecting on what he calls "the end of the machine," Coeckelbergh argues that to achieve a more profound critique of contemporary technologies and culture, we need to explore not only different ways of thinking but also different technologies -- and that to accomplish the former we require the latter.<br>

  1  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1mtz81z">New Romantic Cyborgs</a><br>
  Abstract: Romanticism is usually seen as a historical artistic and cultural movement, starting at the end of the eighteenth century and—at most—reaching far into the nineteenth century: from Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s return to nature to William Morris’s medievalism and beyond. As a reaction against mainstream classicism, Enlightenment rationalism, scientific objectivism, disenchantment, and attempts to crush religion, Romanticism¹ attempted to revive and liberate subjective feeling and emotion, passion, horror, and melancholy. It tried to reenchant the world and unite what was divided. It searched for personal liberation and freedom from convention and tradition, experimented with drugs and various forms of sexual<br>

  CHAPTER 5  The New Time of Contestation: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1np9jh">Contesting Democracy</a><br>
  Abstract: The twentieth century demonstrated that Europe was no longer central to world politics. It had done so brutally in the First and Second World Wars; in a less obvious – and, of course, less brutal – way the 1960s were also to drive home this point. The decade seemed to synchronize political and cultural dissatisfaction around the globe – what the CIA at the time referred to as a ‘world-wide phenomenon of restless youth’ (another American institution,
                  Timemagazine, would actually declare youth the ‘Man of the Year’ in 1967). Outside Western Europe, the political stakes were clearly very high:<br>

  Book Title: The Enlightenment and the Intellectual Foundations of Modern Culture-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): DUPRÉ LOUIS<br>
  Abstract: The Enlightenment's critique of tradition was a necessary consequence of the fundamental modern principle that we humans are solely responsible for the course of history. Hence we can accept no belief, no authority, no institutions that are not in some way justified. This foundation, for better or for worse, determined the course of the following centuries. Despite contemporary reactions against it, the Enlightenment continues to shape our own time and still distinguishes Western culture from any other.<br>

  Book Title: Simplexity-Simplifying Principles for a Complex World'<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Weiss Giselle<br>
  Abstract: In this book a noted physiologist and neuroscientist introduces the concept of
         simplexity, the set of solutions living organisms find that enable them to deal with information and situations, while taking into account past experiences and anticipating future ones. Such solutions are new ways of addressing problems so that actions may be taken more quickly, more elegantly, and more efficiently.<br>

  5.  The Brain as Emulator and Creator of Worlds from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nph7v">Simplexity</a><br>
  Abstract: Our analysis of simplexity is guided by the central idea that not only action but also the
                  act(a much broader concept, which I have discussed in several previous books) must be at the center of all analysis of the functioning of living organisms. To act, the perceiving brain relies on simplifying principles. Psychology and the neurosciences have now established profound links between perception and action. For this reason, I have introduced the termpercactionin my courses at the Collège de France. The simplifying principles, too, link perception to action. Of course, it is impossible to describe all the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nph7v">Simplexity</a><br>
  Abstract: Animal and human gestures are used for action but also as signposts, symbols, and to indicate intention. They are neither simple nor complex. They are simplex because, in a very global and immediate way, they enable the brain to grasp a reality, an emotion, a thought, or a complex social relationship. Gesture is a fundamental mark of culture and art, which are always simplex expressions. Gesture is essential to them. Drawing, painting, music, mime, acting, sculpture, and dance are always expressed in gestures. For this reason, we must not be content with a physiology (or a philosophy) of action. We<br>

  Abstract: Let us now quickly review the neural basis of spatial processing in the brain. The goal here is not to present a course on physiology but to show how the spatialization of perception, action, memory, and decision making reduces complexity, sometimes by way of detours that, in turn, engender simplexity This theory has been revisited several times since neuroscientist and, later, Nobel Laureate Santiago Ramón y Cajal revealed the remarkable diversity of neuronal morphology. It seems obvious when we recall that the body, or even the outside world, is represented in the brain by neural maps organized by “topies,” which<br>

  Abstract: In its biblical forms, Judaism is a rather exoteric and democratic type of religiosity. The emphasis on making the teaching of the revealed instructions open to all classes of Israelites and the paramount importance of making religious actions open, in most cases, to all members of the nation, marginalize during the biblical phase of Judaism the surfacing and privileging of mysteries and secrets. Some of the subsequent phases of Judaism can, however, be described as part of an ongoing process of arcanization, to use a term I adopt from Jan Assmann,¹ which means that the common texts and actions become<br>

  Abstract: Not so long ago, though it may seem that way, literary criticism was practiced by people for whom literature was essential to thinking about life. Such people wrote about books in order to write about art, politics, religion, and the interaction of society and culture—in short, what men and women of letters have always brought to the table. Although the same can be said of current literary practitioners, something else can be said as well: Unlike those who interpret books today, earlier critics possessed an implicit belief in literature’s significance, not simply because literature espoused a point of view,<br>

One commentator singled out Gustave Flaubert from my list and responded with a skeptical “Hmm.” I understood the reaction: after all, Flaubert was known as a writer who cared more for style than social justice (“One never tires of what is well-written, style is life!”).

But when Jesus of Nazareth tells us to become like children, and when spiritual masters urge us to connect with the “child mind,” they are not being nostalgic or sentimental. They are drawing our attention to something we all instinctively recognise. There is something that our habitual adult consciousness has lost or buried, and it must be found, not as a comforting reinstatement of half-forgotten happiness but as a breakthrough to<br>

  Author(s) Steinmann Michael<br>
  Abstract: The essay discusses Karl Jaspers’ concept of limit situations in his
                  Psychology of Worldviews. In limit situations, individuals experience their finite existence in an essential way. The essay shows that the concept had great influence on Martin Heidegger, who gives two of the situations, death and guilt, a decisive role in the phenomenological analysis of human existence inBeing and Time. For Jaspers’Psychology, the main emphasis lies on the individual’s spiritual counter-reaction to the experience of limit situations, which leaves the overall status of the situations unclear.

  Abstract: Former prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri’s assassination on February 14, 2005, sparked both international pressure and local pro-sovereignty protests, forcing Syrian troops from Lebanon in April. This series of events profoundly transformed Sunni Islamism in North Lebanon.¹ For the first time, the Future Movement (Rafiq al-Hariri’s political party) could extend its political influence to the north of the country, a move that was not possible under the Syrian occupation.

  Abstract: As the Lebanese civil war was drawing to a close, various Salafi groups began incorporating the country’s Palestinian camps into their religious networks. That they were so quickly successful bears witness to the failure of the PLO’s political socialization tools within the camp. Several factors explain this dynamic. First, Salafism offered a new intellectual horizon to its partisans, allowing those who had not personally experienced the Palestinian nationalist struggle to look beyond their geographical, legal, and political restrictions as “Palestinian refugees” in Lebanon. Salafism offered a new religious identity and new possibilities for action severed from a Palestinian cause that<br>

  Abstract: This book has examined why it was so difficult to build a Sunni political community in this part of the Middle East. According to John Dewey, building a political community requires setting up mechanisms for deliberation that allow its members to identify collective interests and define a shared response to a number of threats. It cannot emerge without freedom of access to data that directly concerns its political affairs: “inquiry” moves a group from apathy to political action.<br>

  Abstract: The reactions of displaced writers who remain outside their homelands for a considerable period of time generally range between two extreme groups – isolationism and universalism. According to Rubchak, for writers who belong to the first group, writing becomes either “a vehicle for memories and hopes or a totally self-enclosed shell” (101). Thomas Mann speaks about another extreme which he experienced personally: “Exile has become something quite different from what it once was; it is no longer a condition of waiting programmed for an ultimate return, but rather [it] hints of the dissolution of nations and the unification of the world”<br>

That is to say constructive theology is inherently interdisciplinary.

  Book Title: The Priority of Injustice-Locating Democracy in Critical Theory<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): Doshi Sapana<br>
  Abstract: Debates about radical democracy, Barnett argues, have become trapped around a set of oppositions between deliberative and agonistic theories-contrasting thinkers who promote the possibility of rational agreement and those who seek to unmask the role of power or violence or difference in shaping human affairs. While these debates are often framed in terms of consensus versus contestation, Barnett unpacks the assumptions about space and time that underlie different understandings of the sources of political conflict and shows how these differences reflect deeper philosophical commitments to theories of creative action or revived ontologies of "the political." Rather than developing ideal theories of democracy or models of proper politics, he argues that attention should turn toward the practices of claims-making through which political movements express experiences of injustice and make demands for recognition, redress, and re pair. By rethinking the spatial grammar of discussions of public space, democratic inclusion, and globalization, Barnett develops a conceptual framework for analyzing the crucial roles played by geographical processes in generating and processing contentious politics.<br>

  Abstract: Over the next three chapters I critically engage with a set of intellectual traditions that present strongly ontological interpretations of the concept of the political. I argue that ontologies of the political often define democracy in a rather one-sided way, reserving authentic democratic action for the disruption of identities, hegemonies, and settled formations. This one-sidedness derives from the splitting of politics into two aspects and then arranging the world into two layers with a clear order of priority. Obvious and routine understandings of politics are contrasted to a more difficult to discern but more fundamental layer—the site and source<br>

  CONCLUSION from:

  Abstract: I have sought in this book to trace divergent ways of conceptualizing the sources of transformative political action in radical thought. In so doing, I have tried to draw into view how radical theorists’ interest in democracy is not simply driven by a concern with substantive or procedural questions of governance, participation, resistance, or rule. Democracy arises in a broad range of Left theory as a worry about the status, the legitimacy even, of the vocation of critique itself. What is at stake in assessing different theories is not simply whether they successfully identify the possibility of social transformation, perhaps<br>

While this presentism raises large conceptual questions,¹ its practical result with respect to theory was a strong bias against the historical in dominant approaches, whether the latter was functionalism or structuralism (to name but two, all but opposite options). in addition to reflecting contemporary practice,<br>

  Book Title: Biographical methods and professional practice-An international perspective<br>
  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Apitzsch Ursula<br>
  Abstract: The turn to biographical methods in social science is invigorating the relationship between policy and practice. This book shows how biographical methods can improve theoretical understanding of professional practice, as well as enrich the development of professionals, and promote more meaningful practitioner - service user relationships.This book uses a range of interpretive approaches to reveal the dynamics of service users' and professionals' individual experiences and life-worlds. From their research the contributors show how biographical methods can improve theoretical understanding of professional practice, as well as enrich the learning and development of professionals, and promote more meaningful and creative practitioner - service user relationships. The book: · reviews applications of biographical methods in both policy and practice in a range of professional contexts, from health and social care to education and employment; · explores the impact of social change in three main arenas - transformation from Eastern to Western types of society in Europe, major shifts in social and welfare principles, experiences of immigration and of new cultural diversities - on professional practice; · critically evaluates subjective and reflexive processes in interactions between researchers, practitioners and users of services; · considers the institutional arrangements and cultural contexts which support effective and sensitive interventions; · draws on actual projects and tracks reflection, progress and outcomes. With contributions from leading international experts, it provides a valuable comparative perspective. Researchers, policy analysts and practitioners, postgraduate students, teachers and trainers will find this book a stimulating read.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1t89h5j">Localism and neighbourhood planning</a><br>
  Author(s) Bradley Quintin<br>
  Abstract: This chapter situates international debates on participation and the widening of democratic engagement in the context of initiatives in the English planning system. It discusses the devolution of neighbourhood planning powers to local communities from 2011 and draws parallels with traditions of citizens’ control and direct action in land-use planning. It asks whether neighbourhood planning can be said to devolve some kind of ‘power to the people’. In doing so, the chapter argues for an understanding of participation not as a process of inclusion, but as a political practice founded on the inevitability of antagonism and conflict. It begins by<br>

  Abstract: Neighbourhood planning in the US can be traced to the settlement house movement at the turn of the 20th century.

  FIVE  The Construction of the Nation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1tfj8w7">Zhou Zuoren and an Alternative Chinese Response to Modernity</a><br>
  Abstract: The mistrust of didacticism that runs through Zhou’s writing can be read as a commentary on the ideological construction of the modern nation-state. Zhou’s attack on Han Yu and the

  Author(s) von Glahn Richard<br>
  Abstract: For three decades, historians of China have situated the Qing dynasty within a “late-imperial” epoch of Chinese history stretching from the midsixteenth to the early twentieth century. The late-imperial paradigm was conceived in reaction to the long-dominant characterization of China before the Opium War as caught in a repetitive “dynastic cycle” that reproduced an essentially inert “traditional” society until China was fully exposed to the forces of modernization issuing from the Western world. The late-imperial framework instead sought to identify and evaluate indigenous patterns of social, economic, and cultural change initiated in the last century of the Ming dynasty that<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1tm7gkh">Divine Simplicity</a><br>
  Abstract: Contemporary theological treatments of the doctrine of God and his perfections often neglect the doctrine of divine simplicity.¹ Discussions of simplicity are more often found in philosophical literature,² and the theologians who do address it usually express concerns instead of its importance. Chapter 2 will detail how the doctrine of divine simplicity has always had critics. However, reactions to the doctrine in the latter half of the twentieth century were of a different kind and greater degree. Although criticisms of divine simplicity are nothing new, modern theology developed a new narrative of the origins and content of divine simplicity that<br>

  Abstract: The marks left on the contemporary history of Christianity by the international ecumenical movement of the twentieth century are undeniable. Among the marks deserving to be remembered and celebrated are, first, the search for an answer to the demands of unity in the missionary movement, striving “so that the world may believe”; second, the articulations around “practical Christianity” that would overcome historical doctrinal divides; third, the doctrinal dialogue in efforts to produce “faith and order”; and fourth, the joint actions of Christian youth and educators from different churches, confessions, and regional Christian associations.<br>

  Abstract: Latin American liberation theology was the unforeseen enfant terrible in the academic and ecclesial realms of theological production during the last decades of the twentieth century. It brought to the conversation not only a new theme—liberation—but also a new perspective on doing theology and a novel way of referring to God’s being and action in history. Its project to reconfigure the interplay between religious studies, ethics, and politics became a meaningful topic of analysis and dialogue in the general theological discourse. Many scholars perceive in its emergence a drastic epistemological rupture, a radical change in paradigm, a significant<br>

  Abstract: In this essay, I aim to offer a reflection on women and academic theological education based on the experience of female students from the Faculdade Unida de Vitória, in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. Academic theological education is an important step for women to achieve ecclesial agency. My reflection is based on narrative interviews conducted with female students concerning the impact of theological studies in their own life experiences. Academic theological training enhances the self-esteem of women, empowers them, and provides them with tools for reflection-action-reflection in their Christian communities or in other organizational spaces, and it is fundamental<br>

  Author(s) HARKIN MICHAEL E.<br>
  Abstract: To ask what Franz Boas would have thought of 9/11 is obviously to engage in an act of historical and biographical imagination, but also one of self-examination. I would argue that we anthropologists, especially those of us trained in the great Americanist tradition of cultural anthropology and historical ethnography, feel that we know Boas. Indeed, we have internalized him in some way, like a beloved dead relative, and so, in some sense, his reaction is our reaction.

  Abstract: To make my discussion of human action within the sovereignty of God manageable and useful for this particular occasion, I limit its scope in significant ways. I do not seek to respond to the denial of human freedom by those natural scientists to whom world processes are deterministic to the point of eliminating any true notion of freedom. Nor do I take up the equally strong rejection of human freedom by neuroscientists and philosophers of mind who argue that everything humans do is caused by our “neurons”—that is, neuroscientific determinism. I have discussed and defeated these forms of determinism<br>

  Abstract: Persuasion is a special aspect of our social and linguistic practices – one where an interlocutor, or an audience, is induced, to perform a certain action or to endorse a certain belief, and these episodes are not due to the force of the better reason. When we come near persuasion, it seems that, in general, we are somehow giving up factual discourse (and perhaps the principles of logic), since persuading must be understood as almost different from convincing rationally¹. Sometimes, for example, we can find persuasion a political speech that relies on our feelings, emotions and values, but we can also<br>

  Abstract: Historically, natural soundscapes have been recorded in fragmented, decontextualized formats, the emphasis focused on the abstraction of single species’ animal voices intentionally removed from their more holistic and informative acoustic fabric. This older model, first expressed in the late nineteenth century when recording technologies were in their infancy, became an act of faith by the 1930s when ornithologists first applied the parabolic dish primarily to the capture of bird song and calls.

  Author(s) Toth Christie<br>
  Abstract: The educational impact of poverty on working-class students often goes unexamined in disciplinary conversations about composition pedagogy and theory. This elision reflects a long-standing national rhetoric that simplifies interactions between social classes and hails a middle-class identity so persuasively that most Americans self-identify as middle class, regardless of their economic bracket, material affordances, or social interests.² As a result, narratives about education and social uplift tend to obscure many of the lived realities of students experiencing poverty.³ In first-year composition courses, where many students first encounter the linguistic and cultural expectations of a middle-class professoriate, examining the relationships between class<br>

  Abstract: Literacy, in a traditional sense, is the ability to decode written texts and to encode oral language into writing. Yet many researchers and theorists argue that learning to read and write involves social activities influenced by interactions¹ and mediated by class affiliations.² In addition, gender, race, and ethnicity impact how individuals compose internal narratives driving motivation and academic performance.³ Therefore, the narratives we construct through our exchanges with families, teachers, and peers frame our literate identities.

  The Use of Paratext in Popular Eighteenth-Century Biography from:

  Author(s) Rogers Pat<br>
  Abstract: Why Curll, of all people? A natural reaction to the title of this essay might be to wonder what the rascally publisher Edmund Curll has to do with narratology, the theme of this volume. It might be thought that Curll (1683-1747) was an interesting fellow, no doubt, but scarcely a pioneer of writerly innovation. The case I shall try to make here is that Curll’s most characteristic productions, above all the instant biographies he brought out in the late 1720s and early 1730s, do tell us something about paratext – specifically on the way it constitutes a type of narrative statement<br>

Since it is very important to take account of the affective side of faith, we shall begin with his views on the interaction between faith and love. Thereafter, I shall vindicate the centrality of the First Truth, which intellectually grounds faith in a God whose presence, self-revelation, and self-communication are real.

Basically a Thomist, he nevertheless displayed remarkable creativity in the areas of epistemology, method, and historical consciousness.¹ His contribution to a theology of faith hinges upon two conversions: religious and intellectual. Accordingly, after briefly characterizing a third kind of conversion, the moral one, which is less important here for a theology of faith, this chapter shows the impact of religious and intellectual conversion.² The first two sections discuss the interaction between

Comparison of these monuments does not reveal direct interaction between the two memory cultures, therefore, but transnational analogies between local commemorative customs and discourses as well as local specificities.¹ It is precisely with such investigations of commemorations on the basis of analogies and specificities that it is possible to establish the degree to which the focal points, narrative structures<br>

The satisfaction may result from the new attention history has got in the realm of the humanities. One of the most dominating issues here is memory and its role in human culture. “Memory” covers the entire field of dealing with the past, thus including the realm of history as a subject matter and as a mode of recalling the past into life of its representation in the cultural framework of human<br>

The fact that student radicals looked to workers to make the revolution was less important in sparking strikes than the divisions among political elites. What has been called the “political opportunity structure” encouraged the extension of the unrest to wage earners.¹ Even some members of the Gaullist majority wavered in support for the government. As in 1789, 1848, and 1871, cleavages within ruling groups promoted popular revolt. Both student and worker actions were parts of<br>

  Abstract: Panourgia and Marcus bring together anthropologists working in various parts of the world (Greece, Bali, Taiwan, the United States) with classicists, historians, and scholars in cultural studies. The volume takes into account global realities such as 9/11 and the opening of the Cypriot Green Line and explores the different ways in which Geertz’s anthropology has shaped the pedagogy of their disciplines and enabled discussions among them. Focusing on place and time, locations and temporalities, the essays in this volume interrogate the fixity of interpretation and open new spaces of inquiry. The volume addresses a wide audience from the humanities and the social sciences—anyone interested in the development of a new humanism that will relocate the human as a subject of social action.<br>

  Abstract: This is a provocative essay of reflections on traditional mainstream scholarship on Chinese art as done by towering figures in the field such as James Cahill and Wen Fong. James Elkins offers an engaging and accessible survey of his personal journey encountering and interpreting Chinese art through Western scholars' writings. He argues that the search for optimal comparisons is itself a modern, Western interest, and that art history as a discipline is inherently Western in several identifiable senses. Although he concentrates on art history in this book, and on Chinese painting in particular, these issues bear implications for Sinology in general, and for wider questions about humanistic inquiry and historical writing. Jennifer Purtle's Foreword provides a useful counterpoint from the perspective of a Chinese art specialist, anticipating and responding to other specialists’ likely reactions to Elkins's hypotheses.<br>

  6  Ethics as First Philosophy and Religion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xhr5td">The Face of the Other and the Trace of God</a><br>
  Author(s) Bloechl Jeffrey<br>
  Abstract: Following the definition established by Aristotle, ethics examines the relationship between our capacity to mark and repeat certain actions, which includes recognizing rules and giving them to oneself, and the passivity denoted in the fact that experiences and ideas impress themselves on us. The good life consists in managing this activity and passivity on the complex field of economic, social and political life. The primary occasion in which we feel this challenge is the encounter with someone in need, where a face alone is often enough to call forth a response visibly guided by prior education and experience. As many<br>

  Author(s) Burggraeve Roger<br>
  Abstract: Faith is mature or fully developed only if it is reflective, that is, only if it involves a thinking interaction with the Scriptures which orient and inspire it. This is not only a crucial element in Levinas’s conception of Judaism, but also says much about how Levinas relates to his own Judaism. I will say more about this in the first part of this essay, sketching his specifically

  Book Title: Norms of Rhetorical Culture-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Farrell Thomas B.<br>
  Abstract: Rhetoric is widely regarded by both its detractors and advocates as a kind of antithesis to reason. In this book Thomas B. Farrell restores rhetoric as an art of practical reason and enlightened civic participation, grounding it in its classical tradition-particularly in the rhetoric of Aristotle. And, because prevailing modernist world views bear principal responsibility for the disparagement of rhetorical tradition, Farrell also offers a critique of the dominant currents of modern humanist thought.Farrell argues that rhetoric is not antithetical to reason but is a manner of posing and answering questions that is distinct from the approaches of analytic and dialectical reason. He develops this position in a number of ways: through a series of bold reinterpretations of Aristotle's
      Rhetoric; through a detailed appraisal of traditional rhetorical concepts as seen in modern texts from the Army-McCarthy hearings to Edward Kennedy's memorial for his brother, Mario Cuomo's address on abortion, Betty Friedan'sFeminine Mystique, and Vaclav Havel's inaugural address; and through a fresh appraisal of theories on the character of language and discourse found in contemporary philosophy, literary criticism, anthropology, deconstructionism, Marxism, and especially in Habermas's critical theory of communicative action.<br>

As a version of the Augustinian confession, with its drama of a conversion from secular words to sacred ones, the retraction served psychological and aesthetic, as well as religious, aims by providing a formal channel for the apologetic impulse that perennially besets authors preparing to take leave of their books.¹ Although the retraction may seem a dead convention today, its ghost lives on in the<br>

  Book Title: The Ambiguous Allure of the West-Traces of the Colonial in Thailand<br>
  Publisher: Hong Kong University Press, HKU<br>
  Author(s): Chakrabarty Dipesh<br>
  Abstract: The book brings studies of modern Thai history and culture into dialogue with debates in comparative intellectual history, Asian cultural studies, and postcolonial studies. It takes Thai Studies in new directions through case studies of the cultural hybridity and ambivalences that have emerged from the manifold interactions between Siam/Thailand and the West from 1850 to the present day. Central aims of The Ambiguous Allure of the West are to critique notions of Thai "uniqueness" or "exceptionalism" and locate Thai Studies in a broader, comparative perspective by arguing that modern Siam/Thailand needs to be understood as a semicolonial society. In contrast to conservative nationalist and royalist accounts of Thai history and culture, which resist comparing the country to its once-colonized Asian neighbours, this book's contributors highlight the value of postcolonial analysis in understanding the complexly ambiguous, interstitial, liminal and hybrid character of Thai/Western cultural interrelationships. At the same time, by pointing to the distinctive position of semicolonial societies in the Western-dominated world order, the chapters in this book make significant contributions to developing the critical theoretical perspectives of international cultural studies. The contributors demonstrate how the disciplines of history, anthropology, political science, film and cultural studies all enhance these contestations in intersecting ways, and across different historical moments. Each of the chapters raises manifold themes and questions regarding the nature of intercultural exchange, interrogated through theoretically critical lenses. This book directs its discussions at those studying not only in the fields of Thai and Southeast Asian studies but also in colonial and postcolonial studies, Asian cultural studies, film studies and comparative critical theory.<br>

  Book Title: Les fondations philanthropiques:de nouveaux acteurs politiques?-  Publisher: Presses de l'Université du Québec<br>
  Author(s): Lefèvre Sylvain<br>
  Abstract: Ouvrage clé permettant de comprendre le rôle politique des fondations subventionnaires, le présent collectif est la première grande synthèse de l’histoire de la philanthropie canadienne et québécoise. Dès le début du XXe siècle, la dimension sociopolitique des organisations philanthropiques a été remise en question : quelle légitimité d’action pouvaient avoir des acteurs privés fortunés dans le domaine de l’entraide ? Cet ouvrage répond à cette question en se basant sur une variété de travaux dirigés par différentes équipes de recherche. Plusieurs thèmes centraux sont abordés : survol historique et comparatif du rôle des fondations, au Québec, au Canada et ailleurs ; proposition de classification théorique et empirique des fondations ; caractérisation des relations entre les différents acteurs de l’éco­système philanthropique ; identification des stratégies mobilisées par ces différents acteurs ; réflexions sur le rôle des fondations dans la création de politiques publiques… Ce livre propose une vue d’ensemble éclairante du secteur de la philanthropie subventionnaire qui, malgré son champ d’action restreint, demeure fondamental dans les reconfigurations sociales en cours.<br>

  Abstract: L’action philanthropique s’enracine dans une histoire longue. On l’observe dès l’Antiquité grecque, notamment sous la forme de l’évergétisme (Veyne, 1976). De façon générale, ce type d’action permet une redistribution de ressources auprès de personnes démunies ainsi que l’allocation de fonds pour l’accomplissement de grands travaux dits d’intérêt public. Les ressources mobilisées pour la bienfaisance sont principalement financières. Elles proviennent de surplus engendrés par diverses activités économiques ou sont le fruit d’activités consacrées à la production d’un capital qui est réservé en totalité à des activités de bienfaisance. Cette histoire de la philanthropie se compose de différentes phases, où certaines périodes<br>

  Abstract: “Beauty will save the world. Two kinds of beauty,” Dostoevsky observes without further explanation in one of his notebooks to
                  The Idiot.² This condensed set of idea-signals points not only to the problem content ofThe Idiot, but to the complex dialectic of Dostoevsky’s esthetic thought. The first phrase, “Beauty will save the world,” is a model of syntactic precision and order; it promises direct, unimpeded action. But the second phrase is disruptive; it shatters the integrity of the beauty-savior and bogs down the action in ambiguity and enigma. “Is it true, Prince, that you once said that ‘beauty will<br>

  Abstract: Westphal is attempting to craft a prophetic line of philosophy he finds sorely lacking, particularly with Hegel. This is also the case for Husserlian phenomenology, which he sees as replicating Hegel by being purely descriptive, never prescriptive.¹ At this point, it is clear that Westphal aims to push philosophy into the realm of action: to not just reasonably argue but to move those arguments toward helping the widow, orphan, and stranger. Westphal sees in Kierkegaard a possible way to adapt this preferential option for the poor into a postmodern framework; with Kierkegaard, Westphal finds a Christian response to a society<br>

It was also propelled by a need to redefine the role of cinema in the wake of Stalin’s death. Rethinking the language of cinema, Soviet filmmakers began to emphasize the production of the environment as a social and filmic problem, creating spatial experiences within theatrical walls that differed significantly from those of established socialist practices. These filmmakers reorganized the spaces of familiar cities, landscapes, and public and private interiors, opening them up to dialogical interactions<br>

  Book Title: Sonata Fragments-Romantic Narratives in Chopin, Schumann, and Brahms<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Davis Andrew<br>
  Abstract: In
      Sonata Fragments, Andrew Davis argues that the Romantic sonata is firmly rooted, both formally and expressively, in its Classical forebears, using Classical conventions in order to convey a broad constellation of Romantic aesthetic values. This claim runs contrary to conventional theories of the Romantic sonata that place this nineteenth-century musical form squarely outside inherited Classical sonata procedures. Building on Sonata Theory, Davis examines moments of fracture and fragmentation that disrupt the cohesive and linear temporality in piano sonatas by Chopin, Brahms, and Schumann. These disruptions in the sonata form are a narrative technique that signify temporal shifts during which we move from the outer action to the inner thoughts of a musical agent, or we move from the story as it unfolds to a flashback or flash-forward. Through an interpretation of Romantic sonatas as temporally multi-dimensional works in which portions of the music in any given piece can lie inside or outside of what Sonata Theory would define as the sonata-space proper, Davis reads into these ruptures a narrative of expressive features that mark these sonatas as uniquely Romantic.<br>

  Book Title: Signs and Society-Further Studies in Semiotic Anthropology<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Parmentier Richard J.<br>
  Abstract: Brilliantly articulating the potent intersections of semiotic and linguistic anthropology, Signs and Society demonstrates how a keen appreciation of signs helps us better understand human agency, meaning, and creativity. Inspired by the foundational contributions of C. S. Peirce and Ferdinand de Saussure, and drawing upon key insights from neighboring scholarly fields, noted anthropologist Richard J. Parmentier develops an array of innovative conceptual tools for ethnographic, historical, and literary research. His concepts of "transactional value," "metapragmatic interpretant," and "circle of semiosis," for example, illuminate the foundations and effects of such diverse cultural forms and practices as economic exchanges on the Pacific island of Palau, Pindar's Victory Odes in ancient Greece, and material representations of transcendence in ancient Egypt and medieval Christianity. Other studies complicate the separation of emic and etic analytical models for such cultural domains as religion, economic value, and semiotic ideology. Provocative and absorbing, these fifteen pioneering essays blaze a trail into anthropology's future while remaining firmly rooted in its celebrated past.<br>

The initial or prevailing cultural units themselves articulate a scale of values, and the interactions between them revaluate the scale, reinforcing the rank relations among the cultural units (assimilation) or undermining them (displacement). As a result, when we turn to the issue of musical analysis, we shall have to account for the distinctive contributions of these two levels, which Liszka terms the

The former ensure that the musical details themselves determine the narrative trajectory, while the latter situates that trajectory within the network of social and personal value. The archetypes, as we have seen, model the distinct outcomes resulting from the interactions between alternative structures of power—interactions that are constantly being played out in our intrapsychic, interpersonal, and communal relationships.

  Abstract: Socialization processes normally imply that we stimulate and praise—or discourage and scorn—some of our desires. And something comparable happens to our beliefs, emotions, interests, and, of course, to our actions. A tradition or cultural heritage is not just something out there; it entails a complex, and usually implicit, social normativity. However, communities also make explicit, in a fragmentary way, that normativity by means of codes, regulations, exhortations, suggestions, prohibitions, historical narratives, monuments, songs—all in a more or less vague and inconsistent manner. Is this how a public normativity becomes rooted in every person’s life?<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005th6">Cosmopolitanism and Place</a><br>
  Author(s) Corbí Josep E.<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter, I focus on the experience of torture and, more specifically, on Jean Améry’s account of it in his book
                  At the Mind’s Limits.¹ There he claims thatthe loss of confidence in the worldis the most devastating effect he experienced as a victim of torture. I thus explore what cosmopolitan aspiration may be revealed by this loss and also discuss whether it is to be discredited as an irrational reaction on the victim’s side or instead as proportional to the facts and, consequently, as relevant to the conditions under which a certain cosmopolitan aspiration could be<br>

  Author(s) Stuhr John J.<br>
  Abstract: To consider seriously cosmopolitan ideals (in Part I of this volume) is to engage universalism of one or more sorts—moral, political, economic, religious, and cultural. It is to take up notions of universal and equal intrinsic worth, the dignity of all persons, and border-blind, history-blind, color-blind, money-blind, gender-blind (and so on) rights and responsibilities. And it is to entertain worldviews in which tribal, local, regional, national, and other differences are mere artifacts of time, inessential contingencies, instances of good luck or bad fortune, and facts that cannot serve as bases for reason-based values and actions.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005th6">Cosmopolitanism and Place</a><br>
  Author(s) Tarver Erin C.<br>
  Abstract: It is no secret that life in the twenty-first century happens, for many of us, in a “place” that defies traditional conceptions of place, community, and communication—namely, in the nebulous and Heraclitean world of the internet. Not only information but socialization and political life exist online; for many people, in fact, those relationships and conversations accessed via electronic mediums constitute the majority of all such interactions. And despite the hand-wringing that this fact might inspire in those nostalgic for pre-internet days, these interactions are
                  real: they are lived by flesh-and-blood people who not only inhabit traditionally physical communities but<br>

  Abstract: “The future is now.” Google this phrase and you might be surprised to see at least 854 million results, many of which seem to announce advances in technology, although there are some song titles high in the rankings. Yet in scrolling through them, it appears that none of the results define or explain what this phrase means. The philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach did not address the future as now, but he did write about “the philosophy of the future” in a critique of G.W.F.

  15  IS DIRECT PERCEPTION ARROGANT PERCEPTION?: from:

  Author(s) APRIL FLAKNE N.<br>
  Abstract: Feminist phenomenology promises numerous futures. In this essay, I will consider what emerging interactionist approaches to embodied social cognition might offer to feminist phenomenologists. For the sake of convenience, I will refer to a group of related, phenomenologically inspired approaches to embodied social cognition as “direct perception” (DP).¹ I use this overarching term not to ignore significant differences between the various strands, but to focus on their central, shared claim—namely, that our perception is “smart” enough to perceive “directly” that there are other minds as well as a great deal of what supposedly goes on “in” those other minds.²<br>

  Book Title: Self-Understanding and Lifeworld-Basic Traits of a Phenomenological Hermeneutics<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): RAYMAN JOSHUA<br>
  Abstract: What are the foundations of human self-understanding and the value of responsible philosophical questioning? Focusing on Heidegger's early work on facticity, historicity, and the phenomenological hermeneutics of factical-historical life, Hans-Helmuth Gander develops an idea of understanding that reflects our connection with the world and other, and thus invites deep consideration of phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. He draws usefully on Husserl's phenomenology and provides grounds for exchange with Descartes, Dilthey, Nietzsche, Gadamer, Ricoeur, and Foucault. On the way to developing a contemporary hermeneutical philosophy, Gander clarifies the human relation to self in and through conversation with Heidegger's early hermeneutics. Questions about reading and writing then follow as these are the very actions that structure human self-understanding and world understanding.<br>

  Abstract: As one of the most respected voices of Continental philosophy today, Rodolphe Gasché pulls together Aristotle's conception of rhetoric, Martin Heidegger's debate with theory, and Hannah Arendt's conception of judgment in a single work on the centrality of these themes as fundamental to human flourishing in public and political life. Gasché's readings address the distinctively human space of the public square and the actions that occur there, and his valorization of persuasion, reflection, and judgment reveals new insight into how the philosophical tradition distinguishes thinking from other faculties of the human mind.<br>

  Author(s) Lapeyronnie Didier<br>
  Abstract: Over the past twenty years, life in disadvantaged neighborhoods or

These have included the implementation of protectionist, but isolationist, measures and efforts aimed at restoring “social order” through a process of group segmentation. Communication across gender lines in these neighborhoods has diminished, identities have become increasingly ethnicized, and the importance of religion has been amplified. Today’s France is witnessing the creation of ghettos, neighborhoods populated by what are effectively second-class citizens, and who have become increasingly withdrawn into their own communities as a reaction to their lack of integration.<br>

  Book Title: Music and Embodied Cognition-Listening, Moving, Feeling, and Thinking<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): COX ARNIE<br>
  Abstract: Taking a cognitive approach to musical meaning, Arnie Cox explores embodied experiences of hearing music as those that move us both consciously and unconsciously. In this pioneering study that draws on neuroscience and music theory, phenomenology and cognitive science, Cox advances his theory of the "mimetic hypothesis," the notion that a large part of our experience and understanding of music involves an embodied imitation in the listener of bodily motions and exertions that are involved in producing music. Through an often unconscious imitation of action and sound, we feel the music as it moves and grows. With applications to tonal and post-tonal Western classical music, to Western vernacular music, and to non-Western music, Cox's work stands to expand the range of phenomena that can be explained by the role of sensory, motor, and affective aspects of human experience and cognition.<br>

  Abstract: If music cognition is embodied in a musically meaningful way, in the flesh of experience, then we ought to be able to specify just how this occurs. One way begins in imitation of musical sounds and of the physical exertions that produce them. This bodily comprehension of sounds and of sound-producing actions is one of the bases of embodied cognition of music, and it is the central basis that we will be exploring in the following chapters.<br>

Musical experience in general also includes what we see, do, and feel, whether we are actually performing or whether we are listening to, recalling, or otherwise thinking about music. In what we have considered so far, the

  Book Title: Novelas españolas ambientadas en Italia-Fra Filippo Lippi de Emilio Castelar; Bomarzo de Manuel Mujica Lainez<br>
  Publisher: Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca<br>
  Author(s): SANTOS M.ª ALMUDENA MATEOS<br>
  Abstract: Las fuentes en las que se fundamenta la novela histórica proporcionan, además de una ambientación correcta de la acción, la veracidad necesaria para que el lector reconozca el trabajo llevado a cabo por el autor. Este estudio se centra en descubrir las fuentes históricas, literarias, artísticas, religiosas y culturales de dos novelas muy diferentes que comparten un marco común, el Renacimiento Italiano. Mientras que en Fra Filippo Lippi de Emilio Castelar (1877-1879) la exactitud histórica se presenta sólo en determinados capítulos que parecen ralentizar la acción, en Bomarzo de Manuel Mujica Lainez (1962), lo histórico está tan integrado que es difícil detectar qué parte se corresponde con la historia y cuál con la ficción. Las fuentes consultadas por los autores e incorporadas al texto narrativo proporcionan laexhaustividad necesaria para que el ambiente histórico recreado sea preciso. Al confrontar dichas fuentes con el texto literario se observa cómo, además, el marco creado ayuda a delimitarla psicología de los protagonistas, pues, aunque son personajes históricos, los autores crean una vida de ficción a partir de los hechos históricos. Por otro lado, las referencias literarias (correspondientes a un periodo que va desde los siglos XV y XVI hasta el presente de los autores) aportan el marco necesario para que los protagonistas sean portadores de una nueva inmortalidad. La exactitud de las descripciones, la configuración de los caracteres tanto renacentistas como contemporáneos, las perspectivas artísticas o religiosas, configuran estas dos obras en una serie de coincidencias difíciles de obviar.The sources, which the historical novel is based on, provide the correct setting of the action and the necessary truthfulness for the reader to recognise the work carried out by the author. This research focuses on discovering the historical, literary, artistic, religious and cultural sources of two very different novels that share common framework of the Italian Renaissance. In Fra Filippo Lippi by Emilio Catelar (1877-1879) the historical accuracy is presented only incertain chapters, and slow down the action, whereas in Bomarzo by Manuel Mujica Lainez (1962), historical facts are integrated in such a way that it is difficult to detect which parts belong to fiction or non-fiction. The sources consulted by the authors and which are incorporated into the narrative text provide the necessary detail for the recreated historical environment to be accurate. Additionally, when comparing these historical sources with the literary text, it is obvious how the historical facts help to demonstrate the psychology of the main characters because, although they are historical characters, the authors create a living fiction based on historical events. The literary references, belonging to a period that covers the fifteenth and sixteenth century to the present of authors contribute the necessary details so that the main characters are bearers o fa new immortality. The accuracy of descriptions, the representation of both Renaissance and Contemporary characters and artistic and religious perspectives present us with a series of coincidences too obvious to ignore.<br>

  Abstract: Levinas’s critique of narrative and the conception of the narrating subject that underlies it leads him to the issue of how time is synchronized in the philosophy of history, where the process of abstraction from the singular other is most prominent. By interpreting the significance of disparate events and integrating them into a coherent account, the disciplinary approaches of history typically assume a formal conception of time, in which a linear chronology can be represented by consciousness. In other words, past events are treated as intentional objects. This synchronization of time entails generalizing from people’s experiences, selectively emphasizing certain elements<br>

                  TintinandCorto Malteseas examples.¹ We should not forget, though, that words (in the form of direct speech) emphasized by the expressivity of the body are already, in themselves, a privileged means of access to the subjectivity of a character, be<br>

Most recently, in large public venues, celebrities like Madonna or Katy Perry showcase these appropriated ethnic markers of identity to position themselves as “citizens of the world.”<br>

  Abstract: From a twenty-first century perspective, whether one reads patristic socioethical texts in the original or in translation, there are difficulties, pitfalls, and caveats. One of the most important facets to take into consideration when reading these texts is their genre. A homily delivered live in the ancient Church, for example, would be a public event, often taking account of audience reaction and of the circumstances behind its delivery (the presence of catechumens, newly baptized, imperial family; commemoration of local saints; recent natural disasters, and so on).

  Abstract: Having provided an answer to the question of 
                  what comedy does, we may now attempt a more exacting answer to the question of how comedy effects a catharsis of desire (eros) and sympathy. Aristotle is clear in the extant Poetics that plot is that through which the play does its work—it is the play’s archē and psuchē. It is particularly through recognitions and peripeties that tragic plots are made most emotionally effective, and this is especially so when they occur together (1450a32–34). Since all drama is a mimesis of action, and plot is the unitary action of the<br>

  Chapter Two  The Sophistic Revolution from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284x1w">Rhetoric in Antiquity</a><br>
  Abstract: Antiquity typically had recourse to the idea of “first inventor” 
                     (prōtos heuretēs) to describe the birth of different activities, arts, and techniques, in order to rationalize in some way their emergence, by attributing them to one individual’s decisive action, whether a mortal’s, a god’s, or a hero’s. Thus the invention of rhetoric was attributed either to Hermes—the god of crossroads and highways, of movement, passage, of communication in all senses of the term—or, as we have seen, to Homer, and finally to three men of the fifth century b.c., Empedokles, Korax, and Tisias.<br>

The focus of the debate has become fairly well defined; for the most part, theologians have concentrated their efforts on justifying a rejection of the traditional claim that some kinds of actions, apart from specifying circumstances, are intrinsically wrong, that some kinds of actions should never be freely chosen by human agents no matter what good is intended or foreseen.¹ They prefer instead to speak of “premoral,” “ontic,” or “physical” evils that cannot be morally defined apart<br>

  Author(s) Dahlstrom Daniel O.<br>
  Abstract: One of Kenneth Schmitz’s major and undoubtedly lasting accomplishments is his demonstration of the distinctive contribution made by Karol Wojtyla to philosophy. In Schmitz’s masterful expositions, Wojtyla’s philosophical project comes alive as an effort to understand action phenomenologically and realistically, as something that proceeds from and reveals, not consciousness, but the whole person “as a being among other beings.”¹ In this connection, among other things, Schmitz corrects a common misunderstanding of the extent of Wojtyla’s philosophical debt to Scheler’s thought. To be sure, Wojtyla plainly acknowledges the importance to him of both Scheler’s critique of Kant’s ethics and its basis<br>

  Abstract: As is well known, Gregory of Nazianzus (ca. 329–390) arrived in Constantinople in September 379 to commence a theological preaching and teaching mission. His mission had as its aim the advancement of Nicene orthodoxy in the city and the establishment of a viable unity among the members of the then current theological factions, who strongly disagreed about various aspects of the way in which the Trinity should be defined and understood.

  Abstract: What protection does the natural environment merit in wartime? It was in the aftermath of the Vietnam War of 1961–75 that this question came into focus.

We will see that kings and bishops powerfully influenced one another, and that the character of kingship was transformed in the course of the creation of the Carolingian Empire by the ideas, law, and ritual activities of bishops. Indeed, the building of the Empire and the sense of religious mission that inspired it can, to a significant extent, be attributed to the royal adoption of an episcopal platform. Royal power<br>

  Abstract: The subject of this book, the human person as the efficient cause of his own action, locates the very center of Wojtyła’s philosophy. One reason for this is the intrinsic unity and constant interrelation of anthropology and ethics in the thought of Wojtyła. In his anthropological publications, he always analyzes the ethical implications of the anthropological theses. Correspondingly, when he writes about ethics, he is always interested in the question: “What concept of man underlies a particular ethical theory?” I have been able, therefore, to explore the fundamental themes of Wojtyła’s anthropology and ethics while at the same time safeguarding<br>

  Abstract: Theories of agency discuss the possible ways of designing complex systems that display purposeful activity. Theories of agency have been researched in several disciplines (Brooks, 1986; Agre and Chapman, 1987; Suchman, 1987; Hendriks-Jansen, 1996; Johnston and Brennan, 1996; Agre and Horswill, 1997; Clancey, 1997), where two main positions are found – which we will call the ʹdeliberativeʹ and the ʹsituationalʹ theories of agency. The two theories have quite different modes of representation and action selection. In previous papers (Johnston and Milton, 2001; Johnston and Milton, 2002a; Lederman et al., 2003; Lederman et al., 2004) we have argued that information systems<br>

  Abstract: A new language, referred to for the purposes of this paper as the information systems business language or ISBL, is being born in the world of business. It is an artificial language (Lotman, 1990), designed to eliminate possibilities for misunderstandings in the conduct of standardised business transactions. Its primary source language is English but it incorporates information systems (IS) concepts, definitions, symbols and gestures and is therefore not a subset of English. The language has a sphere of operation restricted to interactions involving at least one autonomous IS, and is still in the very early stages of development. The development<br>

  Abstract: One of my early heroes was the great literary theorist Northrop Frye. His book
                  Anatomy of Criticismtook my young undergraduate imagination by storm. Frye was a system builder, and I saw in his approach the possibility of exploring the deepest interactions between the flow of cultural change, and the reactions of creative minds to their situated historical contexts. Great writers obviously held a high place in the governance of ideas and beliefs in the cultures he examined. Yet their minds were also, unavoidably, creatures of the cultural moment. The deep structure of their minds—the shifts in cultural contexts<br>

  Abstract: Interactions between the Sublime Porte and the capitals of Western powers did not become very frequent – or indeed any friendlier – but the degree of acquaintance grew. From assuming difference and observing it with curiosity, travellers began to point to the differences in order to keep a distance and exculpate themselves by association, as we saw in relation to the whirling dervishes. When the

  CHAPTER 1  Being and Time from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jc857">Time in the Philosophy of Gabriel Marcel</a><br>
  Abstract: It is in reaction to Bergson, perhaps more than any other philosopher, that Marcel came to establish his own philosophical position: ‘sans l’aventure bergsonienne et l’admirable courage dont elle témoigne, il est probable que je n’aurais jamais eu ni la vaillance, ni même simplement le pouvoir de m’engager dans ma propre recherche’ (
                  EM: 79), he confesses in the 1952 article ‘Méditation sur la musique’. Marcel’s encounter with Bergson’s thought can therefore be understood as the catalyst behind his entire philosophical project.¹ ‘[Bergson] a joué pour moi un rôle de libérateur même s’il n’est pas extrêmement facile de dire ce que<br>

  CHAPTER 2  Phenomenological Time from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jc857">Time in the Philosophy of Gabriel Marcel</a><br>
  Abstract: Chapter 1 introduced Marcel’s and Bergson’s shared desire to engage with the time of lived experience as opposed to thinking in abstraction. However, Marcel’s philosophy emerged as very different from that of Bergson and, as such, was suggested to be problematic: it appeared to subordinate time to an eternal present, and this seemed at odds with his assertions concerning (temporal) existence’s dynamic, dialectical nature. This potentially problematic relation between time and eternity was identified in the first part of Marcel’s
                  Journal(January–May 1914), before his thought evolved in reaction against his idealist leanings; but strangely, in spite of his<br>

  CONCLUSION TO PART II from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jc857">Time in the Philosophy of Gabriel Marcel</a><br>
  Abstract: According to Richard Cohen, ‘what Levinas wants to account for [...] is not the relation
                  betweenself and other, but the encounter with alterity as transcendence [itself], as the outside, the other’ (2000: 141). While Marcel’s theatre — and indeed some of his philosophical writings — have been shown to engage with this aspect of alterity, his philosophical project cannot simply be confined to this because, as Marcel’s narrations of his plays reinforce, he is also concerned with the self in action — that is, with the basis on which the self might make decisions, and in what light (‘authentic’ or otherwise) these<br>

  CHAPTER 1  Encuentro con Lope en el Camino: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jc86q">The Signifying Self</a><br>
  Abstract: Canavaggio has commented that: ‘No se puede hablar de Cervantes sin encontrar a Lope en el camino’, a view substantiated by the fact that critical attention concerning Cervantes’s
                  Ocho comediashas prioritised the playwright’s unease with Lope’s highly popular theatre.¹ Canavaggio’s observation, however, is particularly reflective of studies ofLa entretenida,El laberinto de amorandLa casa de los celos. Each of these plays has been identified as a Cervantine reaction to dominant contemporary theatrical practise and all have been subject to analysis vis-à-vis Lope to varying degrees. This is especially true ofEl laberinto de amorandLa<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jcf1j">Integral Pluralism</a><br>
  Abstract: As the saying goes: the center does not hold. If one were to highlight a central feature of the modern age, one could plausibly point to its centrifugal momentum, its tendency toward fragmentation. In the intellectual domain, the tendency is patently evident in the process of specialization, the relentless segregation of fields of knowledge. However, the trend exceeds the knowledge domain. Together with other thinkers of his time, the philosopher Hegel saw modernity marked by radical “diremptions” or divisions (
                  Entzweiungen)—divisions between knowledge and action, thinking and feeling, private self-interest and the common good—with the prospects of reconciliation growing<br>

  Abstract: Neoconservatismhas become a code word for reactionary thinking in our time and a badge of unity for those in the Bush administration advocating a new imperialist foreign policy, an assault on the welfare state, and a return to “family values.” Its members are directly culpable for the disintegration of American prestige abroad, the erosion of a huge budget surplus, and the debasement of democracy at home.

  Abstract: One of the common attributes of western films is the “lone hero.” Whether it’s in the final scene, where he takes that inevitable “lone ride” off into the sunset or in his heroic acts throughout the film, where he saves the town folk from danger, the lone hero keeps to himself. He is the quintessential “strong silent type” traditionally prized in the American psyche. He is strong in the sense that he is powerful in his physical, intellectual, and moral capacities. He is silent in the sense that, despite the social benefits earned by his outward actions, he remains secluded<br>

  Author(s) Hada Ken<br>
  Abstract: A common perception associated with the classic western suggests characters welded to their notions of right judgment, characters who will not deviate from their code of honor, regardless of consequences. The honor implied in such deliberate devotion to duty is characteristically celebrated, at least on the surface, in the acts and speeches of typical heroes. It follows that the unyielding posture of the hero suggests a certain understanding of ethics. A strong hero is committed to his course of action because he sees the necessity to choose in a particular way, as the right thing to do, regardless of public<br>

  Book Title: In Search of the Good Life-A Pedogogy for Troubled Times<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): DALLMAYR FRED<br>
  Abstract: The great German novelist Thomas Mann implored readers to resist the persistent and growing militarism of the mid-twentieth century. To whom should we turn for guidance during this current era of global violence, political corruption, economic inequality, and environmental degradation? For more than two millennia, the world's great thinkers have held that the ethically "good life" is the highest purpose of human existence. Renowned political philosopher Fred Dallmayr traces the development of this notion, finding surprising connections among Aristotelian ethics, Abrahamic and Eastern religious traditions, German idealism, and postindustrial social criticism. In Search of the Good Life does not offer a blueprint but rather invites readers on a cross-cultural quest. Along the way, the author discusses the teachings of Aristotle, Confucius, Nicolaus of Cusa, Leibniz, and Schiller, in addition invoking more recent writings of Gadamer and Ricoeur, as guideposts and sources of hope during our troubled times. Among contemporary themes Dallmayr discusses are the role of the classics in education, proper and improper ways of spreading democracy globally, the possibility of transnational citizenship, the problem of politicized evil, and the role of religion in our predominantly secular culture. Dallmayr restores the notion of the good life as a hallmark of personal conduct, civic virtue, and political engagement, and as the road map to enduring peace. In Search of the Good Life seeks to arouse complacent and dispirited citizens, guiding them out of the distractions of shallow amusements and perilous resentments in the direction of mutual learning and civic pedagogy -- a direction that will enable them to impose accountability on political leaders who stray from fundamental ethical standards.<br>

  Abstract: To all appearances,

Human-size pods appear in the California town of Santa Mira and begin duplicating the bodies of the residents, absorbing their minds while they sleep. Rushing into action with his growing realization that Santa Mira is being taken over by the pods, Dr. Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) shows a resilient defiance in his perseverance against all odds. Evidently, we are meant to understand what it means to believe in something and fight for a cause.<br>

  Abstract: Spike Lee dramatically announces the tone and perspective of his adaptation of Richard Price’s novel of urban decay,
                  Clockers(1995), in the opening credits of the film. Since the silent era, opening credits have served a variety of functions. As David Bordwell points out, they are “highly self-conscious and explicitly addressed to the audience.”¹ Not only do titles and names provide a context for the narrative, but still and moving images oft en “anticipate a motif” or “establish the space of upcoming action.” Credits, Bordewell argues, accumulate significance as “memory is amplified by the ongoing story.”² InClockers, Lee goes<br>

  Abstract: I have written well over a hundred poems that are to one degree or another after works of art—usually paintings. When I was asked recently about the attraction of such a topic, it occurred to me that the attraction lies in part in the fact that those works are finished things: whether or not they sport actual frames, they are all in some sense framed. Another way of saying this is that they are the polar opposite of the chaotic; and for reasons in part instinctive and in part educational, I do love the manifestly coherent—a brick wall<br>

  Book Title: Telling Stories-Language, Narrative, and Social Life<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nylund Anastasia<br>
  Abstract: Narratives are fundamental to our lives: we dream, plan, complain, endorse, entertain, teach, learn, and reminisce through telling stories. They provide hopes, enhance or mitigate disappointments, challenge or support moral order and test out theories of the world at both personal and communal levels. It is because of this deep embedding of narrative in everyday life that its study has become a wide research field including disciplines as diverse as linguistics, literary theory, folklore, clinical psychology, cognitive and developmental psychology, anthropology, sociology, and history. In
      Telling Storiesleading scholars illustrate how narratives build bridges among language, identity, interaction, society, and culture; and they investigate various settings such as therapeutic and medical encounters, educational environments, politics, media, marketing, and public relations. They analyze a variety of topics from the narrative construction of self and identity to the telling of stories in different media and the roles that small and big life stories play in everyday social interactions and institutions. These new reflections on the theory and analysis of narrative offer the latest tools to researchers in the fields of discourse analysis and sociolinguistics.<br>

  Author(s) RAZO ELIANA<br>
  Abstract: IN THIS CHAPTER we examine what appears to be a perfect storm related to identity work in social interaction: the use of language alternation in quoting others’ speech in the course of telling conversational, or “small,” stories. Central to language alternation is laying claim to, putting off, or otherwise constructing and negotiating social identities (Torras and Gafaranga 2002). Similarly, identity formation and construction are based in narrative forms and functions (Georgakopoulou 2006; Taylor 2006). Last, identity work is at the core of reported speech (Clift 2006; Stokoe and Edwards 2007). Here we analyze two conversational stories from group interview sessions<br>

  Author(s) COHEN LEOR<br>
  Abstract: THE PURPOSE of this study is to explore how people negotiate their place in the world through the discursive manipulations of identity. A social constructionist perspective is assumed, where identity is constructed online through discourse in social interaction. Constructionism views identity as a dynamic, fluid, multiplicitous construct able to adjust to the demands of the almost infinite array of contexts. Interactional sociolinguistics emerged out of a constructionist framework (De Fina, Schiffrin, and Bamberg 2006, 1–6), where the microanalysis of discourse affords diverse opportunities to uncover that which would otherwise be rationally invisible (Garfinkel 1967, vii; Shotter 1993, 102).

This principle was articulated as follows: Sexual actions within marriage by which a couple is united intimately and chastely are noble and worthy. If expressed in a manner that is truly human and justly loving, these actions signify and promote that mutual self-giving whereby spouses enrich each other, their family, and their community with a joyful and thankful will.

  Abstract: THE IDEAS OF THE previous three chapters have implications for any area of moral life. In the following three chapters I offer but three examples. The application of theory to practice is not a one-way street: theory sheds light on action just as understanding action changes theory—in a hermeneutical circle, as it were. However, if the ethics of childhood calls for anything, it calls for addressing moral relations not only abstractly but also in their practical concreteness.<br>

In 1789 the Protestants and in 1791 the Jews of France gained full emancipation; in 1917 the Jews of Russia. Each time, however, there was a price to be paid. In terms of lives, the cost of religious liberation was, of course, infinitely greater during the Russian than the French Revolution. But while adverse reactions against emancipation were very different in scale, their causes and dynamics were uncommonly alike. During both revolutions, antirevolutionaries and counterrevolutionaries were the chief<br>

In addition to identifying with the artist as “countryman” and sharing with him the metaphoric implications of eyes “the color of a new axe blade” (756) and of a “sagging broken-backed cabin” (746), one should be able to catch the<br>

  Abstract: Charles Johnson is an extraordinarily innovative American writer whose work revolves around profound ethical issues. Because his ethics emerge from the philosophy he studied in graduate school, his ethical outlook is complex and difficult to discern—primarily because his is a dissenting voice from current philosophical schools of ethics.¹ Contemporary Western philosophy usually treats ethics as primarily the moral evaluation of specific actions.² However, such an approach is insufficient for a novelist with Johnson’s convictions.

Accordingly, it is not surprising when a student who walks into my world music class after leaving a class discussion on the global economy at an International Studies Institute, for example, challenges his world music teacher (myself) for “falsely claiming” globalization for the domain of music cultures. Certainly, such may not be the reaction of students from cultural studies, diaspora studies, ethnomusicology, anthropology, and other culture-related cognate disciplines.

  Abstract: From the West as well as the East, among Roman Catholics as well as Protestants, Christian theologians now regularly suggest that western theology suffers from a “pneumatological deficit.” The Western theological tradition accounts for the temporal actions of the triune God, so these critics worry, without giving the Holy Spirit anything to do. In contrast to the Father and especially the Son, the Spirit has no action of his own, and no property, effect, or relationship to us that is unique to him. As a result, the Spirit himself tends to vanish.¹ Where we should expect traditional theology to speak<br>

  Abstract: Sin and evil are categories traditional to Catholic theology, even if Lonergan’s analysis of them is his own. Bias, an inauthentic orientation caused by and causal of inauthentic actions, decisions, judgments, ideas, and experiences, is a concept more original to Lonergan. It is both the result of sin and a cause of further sin.¹ As such, bias functions in a way I find similar to Aristotle’s bad habits, or vices.² However, while Aristotle discusses vice as an extreme on either side of a golden mean, Lonergan analyzes bias in terms of conscious intentionality, social dynamics, and history.

Common sense commonly feels itself omnicompetent in practical affairs, is commonly blinded to long-term consequences of policies and courses of action, is commonly unaware of the admixture of common nonsense in its more cherished convictions and slogans.¹<br>

  Abstract: It is now possible to return to the question from which this enquiry into the nature of human action and identity started: In what does the unity of an individual life consist? The answer is that its unity is the unity of a narrative embodied in a single life. To ask “What is the good for me?” is to ask how best I might live out that unity and bring it to completion. To ask “What is the good for man?” is to ask what all answers to the former question must have in common. But now it is important<br>

  10  Does Truth Matter to Ethics? from:

  Author(s) GUPTA JAY A.<br>
  Abstract: Does truth matter to ethics? Ethical truth is a highly vexed notion. In addition to a virtual chaos of views concerning right versus wrong courses of action in applied issues, philosophers have encountered perennial difficulties in the attempt to theoretically specify what ethical truth could be. As James Rachels notes, whatever it is, it is not like planets, trees, or spoons; ethical truth is not “out there” in the usual sense.¹ But then, perhaps it is inappropriate to talk about ethical truth at all.<br>

  12  Educating for Truthfulness from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b7h7">Truth Matters</a><br>
  Author(s) BLOMBERG DOUG<br>
  Abstract: The challenge of the Truth Matters conference call to “reclaim truthfulness for the academic enterprise” underscores that a commitment to truth is not an abstract principle but a concrete action. As Plato recognizes, philosopher-rulers need not only “the ability to grasp eternal and immutable truth” but also certain “qualities of character”; in describing these, he begins with “love of the knowledge that reveals eternal reality” and follows immediately with “truthfulness” – for how could “a love of wisdom and a love of falsehood” possibly coexist in one person?¹ Character thus connotes integrity, because virtuous traits are complementary and coherent.<br>

  Book Title: Art and Its Uses in Thomas Mann's 'Felix Krull'-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Schonfield Ernest<br>
  Abstract: The turn of the twentieth century was a time of identity crisis for the upper and middle classes, one in which increased social mobility caused the blurring of traditional boundaries and created a need for reference works such as the British Who's Who (1897). At the same time, the rise of a new leisure industry and an increase in international travel led to a boom period for confidence men, who frequently operated in hotels and holiday resorts. Thomas Mann's "Felix Krull", written between 1910-13 and continued (though never completed) in 1951-54, uses contemporary accounts of these figures as a starting-point from which to explore the aesthetics of society. The early Krull marks an important stage in Mann's development in a number of respects.In writing it, Mann acquired a more flexible conception of identity and a new understanding of the relation between artist and public. Krull also signals a deeper engagement with Goethe and a shift in Mann's work towards a more open treatment of sexuality. The novel presents art as being central to the development of the individual and to social interaction. While Krull is nominally a confidence man, he is more of a performance artist, a purveyor of beauty who relies upon the complicity of his audience. The later Krull takes up where Mann left off and continues the justification of art as an essential human activity. This study draws upon unpublished material in order to provide a comprehensive reading of "Felix Krull". It examines the novel within the context of Mann's work as a whole, and, in doing so, it seeks to demonstrate the remarkable continuity of Mann's creative achievement.<br>

  Abstract: Interpretive theory has been unsuccessful in finding a system of rules that can be applied in legal reasoning or in the interpretation of literature. Theorists’ aspiration toward such a system of rules and their skepticism that such rules are possible have given rise to much controversy.¹ Rhetoric offers a way out of this impasse because it is an art of reasoning adapted to the particularities of situation and action. This art is reasonable but does not presuppose that, in order to be used intelligently, rules and terms must be determinate (specifiable precisely, repeatable in different situations, and univocal).

  Book Title: The Uncertain Sciences-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mazlish Bruce<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging book one of the most esteemed cultural historians of our time turns his attention to major questions about human experience and the attempts to understand it "scientifically." Bruce Mazlish considers the achievements, failings, and possibilities of the human sciences-a domain that he broadly defines to include the social sciences, literature, psychology, and hermeneutic studies. In a rich and original synthesis built upon the work of earlier philosophers and historians, Mazlish constructs a new view of the nature and meaning of the human sciences.Starting with the remote human past and moving through the Age of Discovery to the present day, the author discusses what sort of knowledge the human sciences claim to offer. He looks closely at the positivistic aspirations of the human sciences, which are modeled after the natural sciences, and at their interpretive tendencies. In an analysis of scientific method and scientific community, he explores the roles they can or should assume in the human sciences. Mazlish's approach is genuinely interdisciplinary, and he draws on an array of topics, from civil society to globalization to the interactions of humans and machines, to inform his thought-provoking discussion of historical consciousness.<br>

  Abstract: Culture is the key concept in much (though not all) of human science. Yet it is more useful to think of humans first as symbolic animals, rather than cultural animals, for symbolic abilities underlie the existence of both cultures and societies. The species, at the same time that its brain physically evolved, adding a cerebral cortex to its limbic core, increasingly replaced immediate, instinctual responses with delayed, thoughtful actions, mediated through symbols. We need not examine in detail the familiar findings of recent research that tell us of the development of symbolic language, with denotative and connotative characteristics, especially as<br>

According to such Christian humanists as Valla, Erasmus, and Ficino, a universal divine attraction sanctifies the natural order and draws it back to its source. Archaic religion, ancient philosophy, Hebrew and Christian revelation—in an order of increasing intensity—all responded to the same divine impulse. Generally speaking, humanism offered more an alternative than an answer to the questions raised by fifteenth-century School theology. Humanists, even when acquainted<br>

Closely intertwined with Char’s own actions as captain on the maquis, the collection of prose poems offers a rare engagement with historical experience in poetic form, both a tragic affirmation of life and, in its own right, a means of resistance. But I also argue here that this example of historical poetry illustrates some important connections between the writing of lived historical event and translation.

Here, translations become exemplary “traveling texts,” capable of highlighting the complex interactions between still vital nationalisms on the one hand, and growing local and international cultures on the other. Four of these essays explore colonial and postcolonial issues in texts from francophone Africa, India, South Africa, and Latin America, while the fifth and final essay takes its literary example from the war-torn Balkans.

  Abstract: For Kant, the “emotional satisfaction” produced by the sublime derives from the realization of the powers of Reason. For Burke, the pain and terror brought by the sublime achieve a catharsis; they “clear the parts, whether fine, or gross, of a dangerous and troublesome incumbrance.”¹ Yet it strikes me that any satisfaction achieved with a more modern sublime relates to the pleasure felt when standing in the midst of ruin.

People oriented themselves on the sensory range between “nervousness” and “staying calm,” with many bedding down in the shelter in hopes of finding more of the latter. “I’m okay.

They owed their strength to political concerns and pragmatic effects, and served as tropes in the lives of staff and residents alike. Paul Rabinow notes that sociologies of scientific practices “have sought (with some success) to lower-case the abstractions of Science, Reason, Truth and Society.”¹ Reflections on a commonplace but perhaps less well understood kind of reasoning—reasoning that takes form in everyday life—might enable us to similarly lower-case reason, intimate its cultural and political features, and<br>

  Book Title: Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna (Ibn Sina)-With a Translation of the Book of the Prophet Muhammad's Ascent to Heaven<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Heath Peter<br>
  Abstract: Islamic allegory is the product of a cohesive literary tradition to which few contributed as significantly as Ibn Sina (Avicenna), the eleventh-century Muslim philosopher. Peter Heath here offers a detailed examination of Avicenna's contribution, paying special attention to Avicenna's psychology and poetics and to the ways in which they influenced strains of theological, mystical, and literary thought in subsequent Islamic-and Western-intellectual and religious history. Heath begins by showing how Avicenna's writings fit into the context and general history of Islamic allegory and explores the interaction among allegory, allegoresis, and philosophy in Avicenna's thought. He then provides a brief introduction to Avicenna as an historical figure. From there, he examines the ways in which Avicenna's cosmological, psychological, and epistemological theories find parallel, if diverse, expression in the disparate formats of philosophical and allegorical narration. Included in this book is an illustration of Avicenna's allegorical practice. This takes the form of a translation of the Mi'raj Nama (The Book of the Prophet Muhammad's Ascent to Heaven), a short treatise in Persian generally attributed to Avicenna. The text concludes with an investigation of the literary dimension Avicenna's allegorical theory and practice by examining his use of description metaphor. Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna is an original and important work that breaks new ground by applying the techniques of modern literary criticism to the study of Medieval Islamic philosophy. It will be of interest to scholars and students of medieval Islamic and Western literature and philosophy.<br>

  Abstract: Avicenna lived in a world rich in opportunity. After enjoying a brief era of strong central authority and cultural florescence in the first part of the 3rd/9th century, the ‘Abbâsid empire had begun to experience political decentralization. Given the enormous expanse of the empire, central control from Baghdad was unwieldy at best, and it was not long before it became politically unfeasible as well. The governing families of provinces far from the capital (Aghlabids in Ifrîqiya, Ṭûlûnids in Egypt, Ṭâhirids in Khurâsân) naturally wished to achieve the greatest possible freedom of action, and they strove toward a state in which<br>

Many scholars who have taken violence as their subject of study have been keenly aware that violence is an especially challenging, perhaps even distinctive subject matter (see Nordstrom and Robben 1995; Donham 2006; Lubkemann 2008).

  Chapter 2  The Road to Hell from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fj2cq">The Dynamics of Violence in Central Africa</a><br>
  Abstract: If the fate of the African continent evokes hopelessness, nowhere is this sense of despair more evident than in former Belgian Africa. No other region has experienced a more deadly combination of external aggression, foreign-linked factionalism, interstate violence, factional strife, and ethnic rivalries. Nowhere else in Africa has genocide exacted a more horrendous price in human lives lost, economic and financial resources squandered, and developmental opportunities wasted. The scale of the disaster is in sharp contrast with the polite indifference of the international community in the face of this unprecedented human tragedy. What has been called Africa’s first world war<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt46mvd1">Identity Processes and Dynamics in Multi-Ethnic Europe</a><br>
  Author(s) Bastos Susana<br>
  Abstract: The preference for an anthropological reflection upon identity processes as a means to overcome the micro-macro dichotomy that has hampered the development of the social sciences (Calhoun 1996) immediately faces a number of obstacles. A strategy of total subjective and relative social research, reduced to micro-dimensions (limited to the construction of the self and interaction), may impede an analysis of the relationships between socio-historical groups. Similarly, a strategy of conceptual and theoretical babelisation of the concept of identity (and its derivatives) may lead to the loss of its analytical function in understanding historical dynamics.<br>

  Book Title: The Cinema of Attractions Reloaded-  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Strauven Wanda<br>
  Abstract: What have Lumière in common with Wachowski? More than one hundred years separate these two pairs of brothers who astonished, quite similarly, the film spectator of their respective time with special effects of movement: a train rushing into the audience and a bullet flying in slow motion. Do they belong to the same family of "cinema of attractions"? Twenty years ago Tom Gunning introduced the phrase "cinema of attractions" to define the essence of the earliest films made between 1895 and 1906. His term scored an immediate success, even outside the field of early cinema. The present anthology questions the attractiveness and usefulness of the term for both pre-classical and post-classical cinema. With contributions by the most prominent scholars of this discipline (such as Tom Gunning, André Gaudreault, Thomas Elsaesser, Charles Musser, Scott Bukatman and Vivian Sobchack) this volume offers a kaleidoscopic overview of an important historiographical debate.

  Abstract: Someone once said (it might even have been me) that historians begin by studying history and end by becoming part of it. Bearing in mind that oblivion remains the ultimate fate of most writing (and even publishing), and hopefully avoiding a hubristic perspective, I would like to embed my concept of the cinema of attractions, or at least the writing of the essays that launched it, in a historical context, largely based on personal memory. That, rather than a defense or further explanation of the term, forms the modest ambition of this essay, which will hopefully provide an additional context<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I aim to rationally reconstruct (in the sense defined by Sklar above) the conceptual structure of, and assumptions underlying, Tom Gunning’s essay “The Cinema of Attractions.” I use Rudolf Botha’s philosophical study into the conduct of inquiry to analyze the way Gunning formulates conceptual and empirical problems and how he deproblematizes them.² In terms of my reconstruction strategies, I shall rearrange the parts of Gunning’s essay according to the four central activities Botha identifies in the formulation of theoretical problems: (1) Analyzing the problematic state of affairs; (2) Describing the problematic state of affairs; (3) Constructing problems;<br>

  Author(s) Kessler Frank<br>
  Abstract: Raymond Bellour once characterized Christian Metz’s
                  Grande Syntagmatiqueas an “opérateur théorique,” a theoretical operator, because to him this widely discussed model of a cinematic code actualized the possibility of a semiotics of cinema “by bringing its virtualness onto a material level.”¹ In a similar, though obviously different manner, the concept of “cinema of attractions” has become such a theoretical operator by creating a framework thanks to which early cinema could be seen as an object different from classical narrative cinema, as something which was not justearlycinema, that is an earlier form of what cinema was to become,<br>

  Abstract: The impact of Laura Mulvey’s “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema” continues to be widely felt, well beyond the parameters of film studies. Debates around its premises and methods continue; and it remains a fundament of film theory.

  Abstract: One of the key elements of the “new film history” which arose in the wake of the Brighton conference in 1978 was that it put forth a
                  model of attractions, one both heuristic and quite real at the same time; the tenets of this model and where it has led us today are the subjects of the present volume. This simultaneously theoretical and archaeological concept has produced another way of thinking about the relationship between viewer and film, taking as its starting point precisely the web of relationships found in early cinema and its connection to the era’s popular entertainments<br>

  Abstract: This present anthology confirms what has been obvious for some time: the turn of phrase “cinema of attractions” has captured the enthusiastic attention of the film studies community as well as a wide range of scholars working in visual culture. It has not only provided a powerful means of gaining insight into important aspects of early cinema but served as a gloss for those seeking a quick, up-to-date understanding of its cultural gestalt.

  Abstract: “Come here! Come here! Ladies and gentlemen, come to see the most surprising and exciting fairground attraction, the cinematograph.” Such was the commentary of dozens, if not of hundreds of barkers (
                     bonisseurs¹) in front of theaters where the first “animated photographs” were presented all over the globe circa 1895. They invited passers-by to come to experience a “state of shock.” This expression is appropriate to portray the first film spectator because the views represented the quintessence of what art historians have named the distraction, which characterized modernity, and that cinema historians have named “cinema of attractions.”<br>

  Abstract: In the twenty years since “the cinema of attractions” introduced a compelling periodization schema predicated on an attentiveness to early cinema’s formal norms, the exact nature of the attraction’s relationship to narrative remains open to debate. Linda Williams has suggested that “[Tom] Gunning’s notions of attraction and astonishment have caught on […] because, in addition to being apt descriptions of early cinema, they describe aspects of all cinema that have also been undervalued in the classical paradigm”³; according to this account, attractions stand as a refutation of classicism’s reliance on causality and its appeal to a viewer’s problem-solving capabilities.

  Abstract: For nearly 200 years the term “attraction” has seen a host of semantic and theoretical shifts, becoming today one of the key concepts in cinema studies. According to the
                  Oxford English Dictionary, the meaning of “attraction” as a “thing or feature which draws people by appealing to their desires, tastes, etc.,esp. any interesting or amusing exhibition which ‘draws’ crowds” dates from as early as 1829 (“These performances, although possessing much novelty, did not prove sterling attractions”).

  Author(s) Jaques Pierre-Emmanuel<br>
  Abstract: In use again in the 1980s, the concept of attraction first provided a way to analyze the discourse features of early cinema. However, since his first article on this concept, Tom Gunning has not failed to note that attractions, far from disappearing with the development of integrated narrative cinema, continue to exist within certain genres: “In fact the cinema of attraction does not disappear with the dominance of narrative, but rather goes underground, both into certain avant-garde practices and as a component of narrative films, more evident in some genres (e.g. the musical) than in others.”¹ In the same article,<br>

  Abstract: The metaphor is not new: the cinema, like a cobweb, traps the spectator’s gaze. This quasi-hypnotic preoccupation of the image rules nowadays contemporary Hollywood production, and more specifically what forms today a type of film as precise as large, the blockbuster. If the analysis of these extremely popular, very big budget entertainment films, produced in the heart of new intermediality, can be based mainly on questions of intertextuality,¹ it can also, far from any definitive definition, be fuelled by a rich and complex network of notions which carries along in its modern rush the term of attraction.<br>

One such suspended moment is the poem, which freeze-frames the interplay as language so that we can contemplate it, feel it, and concentrate on it.

The negotiation of culture through the use of the objects of daily life is of interest in this study.

Important messages were conveyed through jokes, wisecracks, and anecdotes. Humorous expressions offered insights into the concepts, concerns, and values of individuals and groups.

  Book Title: Moral Evil-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Flescher Andrew Michael<br>
  Abstract: The idea of moral evil has always held a special place in philosophy and theology because the existence of evil has implications for the dignity of the human and the limits of human action. Andrew M. Flescher proposes four interpretations of evil, drawing on philosophical and theological sources and using them to trace through history the moral traditions that are associated with them.The first model, evil as the presence of badness, offers a traditional dualistic model represented by Manicheanism. The second, evil leading to goodness through suffering, presents a theological interpretation known as theodicy. Absence of badness-that is, evil as a social construction-is the third model. The fourth, evil as the absence of goodness, describes when evil exists in lieu of the good-the "privation" thesis staked out nearly two millennia ago by Christian theologian St. Augustine. Flescher extends this fourth model-evil as privation-into a fifth, which incorporates a virtue ethic. Drawing original connections between Augustine and Aristotle, Flescher's fifth model emphasizes the formation of altruistic habits that can lead us to better moral choices throughout our lives.Flescher eschews the temptation to think of human agents who commit evil as outside the norm of human experience. Instead, through the honing of moral skills and the practice of attending to the needs of others to a greater degree than we currently do, Flescher offers a plausible and hopeful approach to the reality of moral evil.<br>

Each substance is the true and real cause of its own immanent actions, and has the power of acting, and although it is sustained by the divine concourse nevertheless it cannot happen that it is merely passive, and this is true both in the case of corporeal substances and incorporeal ones. But on the other hand, each substance (excepting God alone) is nothing except the occasional cause of its transeunt actions towards another substance.

  Book Title: The Machine Question-Critical Perspectives on AI, Robots, and Ethics<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Gunkel David J.<br>
  Abstract: One of the enduring concerns of moral philosophy is deciding who or what is deserving of ethical consideration. Much recent attention has been devoted to the "animal question" -- consideration of the moral status of nonhuman animals. In this book, David Gunkel takes up the "machine question": whether and to what extent intelligent and autonomous machines of our own making can be considered to have legitimate moral responsibilities and any legitimate claim to moral consideration. The machine question poses a fundamental challenge to moral thinking, questioning the traditional philosophical conceptualization of technology as a tool or instrument to be used by human agents. Gunkel begins by addressing the question of machine moral agency: whether a machine might be considered a legitimate moral agent that could be held responsible for decisions and actions. He then approaches the machine question from the other side, considering whether a machine might be a moral patient due legitimate moral consideration. Finally, Gunkel considers some recent innovations in moral philosophy and critical theory that complicate the machine question, deconstructing the binary agent--patient opposition itself. Technological advances may prompt us to wonder if the science fiction of computers and robots whose actions affect their human companions (think of HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey) could become science fact. Gunkel's argument promises to influence future considerations of ethics, ourselves, and the other entities who inhabit this world.<br>

  Book Title: Political Creativity-Reconfiguring Institutional Order and Change<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Hattam Victoria<br>
  Abstract: Political Creativityintervenes in the lively debate currently underway in the social sciences on institutional change. Editors Gerald Berk, Dennis C. Galvan, and Victoria Hattam, along with the contributors to the volume, show how institutions inevitably combine order and change, because formal rules and roles are always available for reconfiguration. Creative action is not the exception but the very process through which all political formations are built, promulgated and changed.<br>

  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjkqq">Political Creativity</a><br>
  Abstract: The game’s afoot in institutionalist research. As institutionalists grapple with change, diversity, innovation, indeterminacy, creativity, and surprising assemblages of institutional artifacts, some have come to question the implicit structuralist foundations of their research and turned elsewhere for help. The catalog is big and growing. Among other traditions, institutionalists have turned to social studies of science, action theory, ecology, narrative knowing, poststructuralism, constructivism, postcolonialism, pragmatism, theories of entrepreneurship, religious studies, and economic anthropology. This volume assembles a group of political scientists, whose only obvious commonality is their restlessness with structuralism and their commitment to alternative intellectual traditions to animate their research.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjkqq">Political Creativity</a><br>
  Author(s) Amberg Stephen<br>
  Abstract: The federal government’s rescue of General Motors and Chrysler in 2008–2009 was a dramatic reminder that a liberal state can exert plenary powers to stem a public crisis by controlling the primary agents. Yet federal action came at a moment when social science debates about how institutions shape change had reached a point where government intervention is less significant than the ways that agents are able to innovate from institutional routines.¹ The successful auto bailout raised questions about the evolution of government-market relationships and the capacity of government to improve on market outcomes. The U.S. auto crisis began in<br>

  Chapter 11  Interest in the Absence of Articulation: from:

  Author(s) Harrold Deborah<br>
  Abstract: Several authoritarian regimes in the Middle East and North Africa were taken down in 2011, but this wave of challenges to strong states missed Algeria. In Algeria, large demonstrations in January 2011 and new efforts at political mobilization were overwhelmed by state security and could not continue. What Algeria lacked were the alliances built in other nations. Algeria’s civil war (1993–2000) left deep rifts and mistrust between groups.¹ Profound dissatisfaction with the state and desire for change could not take the place of the political work, underground or in open, of bridging interests and shaping alliances among democratic forces,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjrjj">Dance And Lived Body</a><br>
  Abstract: In part 2, we are still moving away from those futile existentialist views that fail to see meaning in life because they emphasize lifeʹs contingency rather than its cohesion, and fail to see the impossibility of erasing (even in our thoughts, let alone our actions) the compelling connectedness of self, body, earth, and world – a universe (a single verse), rendering both unity and diversity possible. Disconnection is possible only if connection is assumed. Likewise, irrationality stands in relation to rationality, nonbeing to being, negative to positive, and contingent properties must be contingent upon something. In short, all oppositions stand<br>

  Abstract: Modiano is still best known for writing novels set in the Occupation. His apparent obsession, especially in his earlier works, with this dark period of French history has been the main concern of his critics and reviewers. It is certainly a controversial subject: it was probably one of the main causes for the impact that Modiano’s first novels had on the public, instantly creating a reputation for the young author.¹ We may wonder, however, whether there was more to this reaction than that of simple choice of subject matter. What is the nature of Modiano’s treatment of the subject? Is<br>

  Author(s) Reinhard Wolfgang<br>
  Abstract: When I consider all the unsolicited emails I receive every day, it seems to me that there are two main values for our contemporaries, money and sex, both quite everyday things. Now the world does not, of course, consist solely of spam, but on a somewhat higher level, in the case of professional and economic success measured in monetary terms, and in the case of love, we are in fact dealing with core values of Western culture and society. But they are so normal and everyday that they are scarcely perceived as values that function as guides to action.<br>

  Book Title: Black Intersectionalities-A Critique for the 21st Century<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rocchi Jean-Paul<br>
  Abstract: Black Intersectionalities: A Critique for the 21st Century explores the complex interrelationships between race, gender, and sex as these are conceptualised within contemporary thought. Markers of identity are too often isolated and presented as definitive, then examined and theorised, a process that further naturalises their absoluteness; thus socially generated constructs become socialising categories that assume coercive power. The resulting set of oppositions isolate and delimit: male or female, black or white, straight or gay. A new kind of intervention is needed, an intervention that recognises the validity of the researcher’s own self-reflexivity. Focusing on the way identity is both constructed and constructive, the collection examines the frameworks and practices that deny transgressive possibilities. It seeks to engage in a consciousness raising exercise that documents the damaging nature of assigned social positions and either/or identity constructions. It seeks to progress beyond the socially prescribed categories of race, gender and sex, recognising the need to combine intellectualization and feeling, rationality and affectivity, abstraction and emotion, consciousness and desire. It seeks to develop new types of transdisciplinary frameworks where subjective and political spaces can be universalized while remaining particular, leaving texts open so that identity remains imagined, plural, and continuously shifting. Such an approach restores the complexity of what it means to be human.<br>

  Author(s) Sarnelli Laura<br>
  Abstract: The theoretical concept of melancholia has recently received heightened critical attention in the field of race and postcolonial studies. As an emotional reaction to the denial of the loss of a loved object, be it a person, a place, or an ideal, melancholia gives shape to a “constellation of affect” or a “structure of feeling” encompassing the individual and the collective, the psychic and the social (Eng and Kazanjian, 2003: 3). As such, it has emerged as a crucial touchstone for subjective as well as political formations. In particular, melancholia has been deployed to unravel the complex mechanisms of national<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjcgf">Ciaran Carson</a><br>
  Abstract: The importance and complexity of memory in Carson’s aesthetic is apparent when, as in ‘Ambition’, time is conceived as a road that rarely runs straight, its course marked by manifold obstructions and convolutions. After all, the action of taking one step forward, two steps back can be understood in temporal as well as spatial terms, and in Carson’s writing the past typically manifests itself as ‘a trail of moments/Dislocated, then located’ (
                  IFN, 58) that precludes a commanding overview. This much is clear in the opening lines of ‘Ambition’, where the narrator and his father have climbed Black Mountain in order<br>

  Abstract: Translation is a longstanding and recurrent component of Ciaran Carson’s work, not only as practice, process, and artefact – as his recent book-length versions of Dante’s
                  Inferno, Brian Merriman’sThe Midnight Court, and the Old Irish epic,The Táin, attest – but also as a theme or trope that relates to the multifarious effects of language itself. In this regard ‘translation’ concerns itself with the ways in which transactions between words, idioms, discourses, and languages reveal the difference that is internal to all language. Or, as Walter Benjamin expresses it, ‘all translation is only a somewhat provisional way of coming to terms<br>

  Abstract: Joseph Conrad was the first modern writer V. S. Naipaul encountered at the age of ten; and Conrad, seaman turned author, was also someone who ‘had been everywhere before me’ and who ‘sixty to seventy years ago meditated on my world’ (
                  CD, p. 210). Indeed, Conrad’s vision of this world, as some critics have remarked,² is one which Naipaul seems bound to repeat in his own work: ‘half-made societies ... where there was no goal, and where always “something inherent in the necessities of successful action ... carried with it the moral degradation of the idea”’ (CD, p. 208).

  Abstract: That nations dwell in eternal anarchy has been one of the defining assumptions that have shaped the socialization of several generations of students of international relations. While political struggle inside the state takes place in the shadow of the law (conceived as the sovereign’s command), this mediation was thought to be absent in the international arena. However, the demise of the Soviet Union and the increase in the volume, scope and speed of transnational interactions challenged this traditional assumption of anarchy and non-co-operation.

With the expansion of the medical humanities and the development of ‘narrative medicine’, medical practitioners have looked to other disciplines – literary analysis, philosophy, history and anthropology – for models and metaphors by which to express the experiences of patients, carers and clinicians. The attraction of the notion of rite of passage is obvious, offering a versatile means of expressing a range of phenomena including:<br>

That there is such an association is often claimed in relation to a number of thinkers, but most notably perhaps in relation to Heidegger.¹ Sometimes the claim is extended to encompass broader movements in contemporary thought, with environmental thinking being the most common, but by no means the only target here.² Seldom, however, is much consideration given to the way such a claim<br>

  Abstract: In this paper I am interested in the way Job is treated in the nineteenth-century oratorio tradition in Britain. Sacred oratorio¹ took off in the nineteenth-century and had two primary forms—one of a more meditative nature (e.g., Handel’s
                  Messiah) and the other of a more dramatic character (e.g., Mendelssohn’sElijah).² Old Testament narratives were particularly suited to the dramatic variety, although the book of Job, unusually, provided both—action from the dramatic events recounted in the prologue and epilogue, and meditation from the dialogue, notably Job’s own speeches and God’s reply. Three oratorios based on Job represent well the<br>

  Abstract: As many of the contributors to this volume have argued, the face-to-face encounters at Pontigny-en-Amérique engendered fruitful, if subtle, shifts in the poetic, philosophical, and artistic exchanges between American and European culture. The formal and informal conversations that took place then may not have led to immediate or discernible outcomes. Nevertheless, more than sixty years later, their afterlife continues to occupy us. The contributions in this section embody the very essence of conversation as a form of action and of response to injustice and to imagining a world not prone to war and violence.<br>

  Abstract: Tim Burton’s films always contain a cast of interesting characters. Primarily, his character construction and interaction with the plot revolve around a critique of the normal. Normalcy, by whatever yardstick the viewer measures it, never goes unconsidered in a Tim Burton film. We see this in movies as diverse in setting and storytelling as

Often Burton portrays the normal people, the powerful people, and the conventionally beautiful people as possessing deep character flaws, and the entrenched systems of discourse in which they participate as pervasively corrupt.

The idea of the rule of law is the centuries-old solution for mediating interhuman conflict over applicable moral principles and for controlling the despotism of rulers.¹ The law, as conceptualized by this idea, is an articulated set of rules, objectively enforced.

  Abstract: It is fair to say, after our examination, that corruption is a troubled concept in law. The traditional understandings of corruption, used in law—corruption as the breach of duty, corruption as the quid pro quo transaction, corruption as illegality or inequality, and so on—capture parts of this idea, but not all. Animating these technical and rational understandings in spirit and practice is another, quite incommensurable concept. Corruption, under this deeper (and popular) understanding, is a raw moral idea. It invokes ideas of ʺdepravityʺ and ʺevil,ʺ human frailty and temptation. It is the capture of individuals and political systems<br>

  Abstract: Assimilation is a rather unfriendly concept when used in a social context. In French, it generally means an act of the mind that considers (something) as similar (to something else). A relevant secondary meaning is the action of making (something) similar (to something else) by integration or absorption. This meaning has existed in physiology since 1495. Around 1840, the concept was related to social processes for the first time, as the act of assimilating persons and peoples; the process through which these persons, these peoples, assimilate (themselves). This connotation incorporates terms like ‘Americanisation’ and ‘Frenchisation’. The older physiological connotation shines<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wpr8v">The Economics of Creativity</a><br>
  Abstract: Action analysis in both sociology and economics faces a persistent tension. To understand how individuals differ in their behavior, we may need to define each individual’s characteristics, preferences, and resources at the onset of the course of action. This essentially leads to a long-term, propelling view of the causal determination of individual action. However, as action unfolds sequentially, within an environment of interactions, people learn from each other and about themselves in ways that cannot be fully anticipated. Can we, simultaneously, fully define the identities of social actors and the situations that bring those actors together? My view is that<br>

  Abstract: In classical economic analysis, labor is generally treated as a negative magnitude. It is described restrictively as a “disutility,” an expense of individual energy in exchange for a salary and the consumer goods to which that salary provides access. Leisure and consumer goods are the only sources of satisfaction and individual well-being. Thus labor is reduced to “negative consumption.” When labor is described this way, involvement in the labor market becomes a case of rational behavior and maximization under constraint: The choice to engage in a remunerated activity can be understood entirely as a choice balancing the sacrifice of well-being<br>

The commonsense view is that the main cause of differences in artists’ success levels is talent. But how can talent be defined and to what source can it be traced?

  Author(s): Zou Hui<br>
  Abstract: In this volume, Hui Zou analyzes historical, architectural, visual, literary, and philosophical perspectives on the Western-styled garden that formed part of the great Yuanming Yuan complex in Beijing, constructed during the Qing dynasty. Designed and built in the late eighteenth century by Italian and French Jesuits, the garden described in this book was a wonderland of multistoried buildings, fountains, labyrinths, and geometrical hills. It even included an open-air theater. Through detailed examination of historical literature and representations, Zou analyzes the ways in which the Jesuits accommodated their design within the Chinese cultural context. He shows how an especially important element of their approach was the application of a linear perspective—the “line-method”—to create the jing, the Chinese concept of the bounded bright view of a garden scene. Hui Zou’s book demonstrates how Jesuit metaphysics fused with Chinese cosmology and broadens our understanding of cultural and religious encounters in early Chinese modernity. It presents an intriguing reflection on the interaction between Western metaphysics and the poetical tradition of Chinese culture. The volume will be of interest to scholars and students in a variety of fields, including literature, philosophy, architecture, landscape and urban studies, and East-West comparative cultural studies.<br>

  Abstract: During my attendance at the 2001 Scholars’ Conference on the Holocaust and the Churches a survivor told me that she had come to a horrifying realization about the relation between Holocaust scholars and Holocaust survivors. Speaking in a whisper, as though afraid of her own words, she said to me, “I know now what they want us to do: they want us to die.” My initial reaction was shock. For reasons I did not immediately grasp, her words brought to mind one of the conference sessions on Holocaust education. At one point the discussion in that session revolved around the<br>

  Abstract: In his influential examination of the social and historical conditions that gave rise to the historical novel, Georg Lukács describes the power of a “real mass movement” to influence the way people view and lend importance to history. “The appeal to national independence and national character,” Lukács writes, “is necessarily connected with a re-awakening of national history, with memories of the past, of past greatness, of moments of national dishonour, whether this results in a progressive or reactionary ideology” (25). Although Lukács’s observations are trained on early nineteenth-century movements in Europe, they are equally applicable to the re-emergence of the<br>

  Author(s) Radunović Dušan<br>
  Abstract: The conceptual foundations of Gustav Shpet's general semasiology and Valentin Voloshinov's principle of dialogic speech interaction have rarely been considered from a comparative perspective. This article purports to draw critical attention to the partly convergent, partly divergent trajectories that these two thinkers followed in their approach to language. Whereas the two methodologies and discursive practices may not appear commensurable on the surface, there emerge beneath important philosophical convergences between Shpet and Voloshinov. Notwithstanding the fact that the two thinkers developed their views on language in different directions, coextensive philosophical concerns and common intellectual backgrounds provide a certain justification for a<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqfzw">Mediating Across Difference</a><br>
  Author(s) Väyrynen Tarja<br>
  Abstract: Western models of conflict resolution tend to privilege speech over nonverbal means of communication. Speech is thought to be vital for dialogue and, therefore, for conflict resolution and peacebuilding after a violent conflict. A large domain of silent interaction is thus left unnoticed and unexamined by the dominant Western forms of conflict resolution. The complex and underexamined
                  problématiqueof silence in conflict resolution can be approached by understanding silence as a nonverbal means of communication and as a form of social and political action. Silence relates intimately to reconstructing and narrating a community after violent conflict. Some issues are narrated<br>

  Abstract: Several centuries of interaction across ethnic and religious difference in the Indonesian archipelago have been accompanied by the evolution of local ways of resolving communal disputes and violence. We term the resulting norms and practices ‘local conflict resolution’. The development of these ways of mediating across difference has itself sometimes been violent, yet the accompanying local conflict resolution processes are dynamic and pluralist. They are open to revision and adaptation, including to the input of outside and new forces and actors. For this reason our use of the term ‘local’ does not connote a bounded space that excludes outsiders. Rather,<br>

  Abstract: The stereotype holds that practitioners abandoned society to pursue their esoteric arts, but as we have seen their relations with local communities were, in fact, exponentially more complex than that. They functioned in society as a type of holy person, in part by absenting themselves from normal patterns of social interaction and taking up instead the behaviors identified with the role of
                     xian-hood-seeker, but these behaviors included many relations with others. We now turn to the social relations of practitioners with their own families and with representatives of the imperial bureaucracy.<br>

  Abstract: In late classical and early medieval China, individuals became transcendents not solely by their own efforts but by those of many other people as well. They came to be recognized as transcendents in the course of their multifaceted interactions with others, and, as a result of people’s responses to them, during and after their active presence in communities. Their reputations were formed by social and conversational processes that occurred mostly outside the texts that survive for us to read today.

A history of journeys, encounters, inclinations, and leaps of faith can be shown to survive in maps and plans once their symbolic character is recognized, and it is these supplementary inscriptions that constitute dark writing. Dark writing alludes to the bodies that go missing in the action of representation. But it does not seek to replace them—to represent them. Aligned to their passage, it registers their passage graphically, as a pattern of traces. In the last three<br>

  Book Title: Out of the Margins-The Rise of Chinese Vernacular Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Ge Liangyan<br>
  Abstract: The novel Water Margin (Shuihu zhuan), China's earliest full-length narrative in vernacular prose, first appeared in print in the sixteenth century. The tale of one hundred and eight bandit heroes evolved from a long oral tradition; in its novelized form, it played a pivotal role in the rise of Chinese vernacular fiction, which flourished during the late Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) periods. Liangyan Ge's multidimensional study considers the evolution of Water Margin and the rise of vernacular fiction against the background of the vernacularization of premodern Chinese literature as a whole. This gradual and arduous process, as the book convincingly shows, was driven by sustained contact and interaction between written culture and popular orality. Ge examines the stylistic and linguistic features of the novel against those of other works of early Chinese vernacular literature (stories, in particular), revealing an accretion of features typical of different historical periods and a prolonged and cumulative process of textualization. In addition to providing a meticulous philological study, his work offers a new reading of the novel that interprets some of its salient characteristics in terms of the interplay between audience, storytellers, and men of letters associated with popular orality.<br>

  Abstract: The rise of written vernacular as a new literary language, in China as in the West, was inevitably the result of a long process of the interaction and interpenetration between the forces of written culture and those of orality and of a gradual confluence of literary consciousness with oral sensibilities.¹ In the cultural context of early premodern China, the persistent transmission and textualization of the

Less familiar is the work of evangelistic missionaries and their local counterparts. The contributions and achievements of the “agents and actors” in these areas are not in doubt. However, the practitioners remain objects for study rather than people to identify with, and missionaries—and again this seems<br>

  Book Title: Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): MATSUMOTO STACIE<br>
  Abstract: The first three centuries of the Heian period (794–1086) saw some of its most fertile innovations and epochal achievements in Japanese literature and the arts. It was also a time of important transitions in the spheres of religion and politics, as aristocratic authority was consolidated in Kyoto, powerful court factions and religious institutions emerged, and adjustments were made in the Chinese-style system of ruler-ship. At the same time, the era’s leaders faced serious challenges from the provinces that called into question the primacy and efficiency of the governmental system and tested the social/cultural status quo. Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries, the first book of its kind to examine the early Heian from a wide variety of multidisciplinary perspectives, offers a fresh look at these seemingly contradictory trends. Essays by fourteen leading American, European, and Japanese scholars of art history, history, literature, and religions take up core texts and iconic images, cultural achievements and social crises, and the ever-fascinating patterns and puzzles of the time. The authors tackle some of Heian Japan’s most enduring paradigms as well as hitherto unexplored problems in search of new ways of understanding the currents of change as well as the processes of institutionalization that shaped the Heian scene, defined the contours of its legacies, and make it one of the most intensely studied periods of the Japanese past.<br>

  Book Title: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains-Culture and Society in the Highlands of Bali<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Reuter Thomas A.<br>
  Abstract: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains is the first comprehensive ethnography of the Bali Aga, a large ethnic minority that occupies the island's central highlands. The Bali Aga are popularly viewed as the indigenous counterparts to other Balinese who trace their origin to invaders from the Javanese kingdom of Majapait, who have ruled Bali from the fourteenth century A.D. Although Bali remains one of the most intensely researched localities in the world, the Bali Aga have long been overshadowed by the more exotic courtly culture of the south. A closer analysis of the changing position of the Bali Aga within Balinese society provides a key to understanding the politics and social process of cultural representation in Bali and beyond. The process is marked by a blend of representational competition and cooperation among the Bali Aga themselves, among the Bali Aga and southern Balinese, and later among the island's aristocratic elites and foreign colonizers or scholars, and state authorities. The study of this process raises important issues about the establishment and maintenance of status and power structures at regional, national, and global levels. Custodians of the Sacred Mountains explores the marginalization of the Bali Aga in light of a critical theory of cultural representation and calls for a morally engaged approach to ethnographic research. It proposes an intersubjective and communicative model of human interaction as the foundation for understanding the relative significance of cooperation and competition in the cultural production of knowledge.<br>

  Abstract: The social landscape of highland Bali is patterned by regional networks of ritual alliance among groups of villages. Such networks are locally referred to as

The study of regional social interaction among the Bali Aga leads to a magical world where human beings, ancestors, spirits, and gods share a sacred landscape and timescape, brought to life in an intricate<br>

I acknowledge that there are many variables in African American women’s lives and work, which make their stories of literacy far from monothematic. Vibrant among these practices, however, is the use of literacy as an instrument for producing spiraling effects in both sociopolitical thought and sociopolitical action. Literacy has enabled African American women to create whirlpools in the pond of public discourse,<br>

The novel’s form and content, the wild proliferation of unpredictable characters, and what was perceived as a deep-seated pessimism were all difficult to reconcile with the image of Arguedas as a major cultural icon of progressive Peruvian culture.

  Book Title: Interpretation-Ways of Thinking about the Sciences and the Arts<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolters Gereon<br>
  Abstract: The act of interpretation occurs in nearly every area of the arts and sciences. That ubiquity serves as the inspiration for the fourteen essays of this volume, covering many of the domains in which interpretive practices are found. Individual topics include: the general nature of interpretation and its forms; comparing and contrasting interpretation and hermeneutics; culture as interpretation seen through Hegel's aesthetics; interpreting philosophical texts; methodologies for interpreting human action; interpretation in medical practice focusing on manifestations as indicators of disease; the brain and its interpretative, structured, learning and storage processes; interpreting hybrid wines and cognitive preconceptions of novel objects; and the importance of sensory perception as means of interpreting in the case of dry German Rieslings.In an interesting turn, Nicholas Rescher writes on the interpretation of philosophical texts. Then Catherine Wilson and Andreas Blank explicate and critique Rescher's theories through analysis of the mill passage from Leibniz's

  Abstract: In this article an instrumentalist conception of action interpretation will be developed. This conception shall be suitable for interpreting moral actions as well as other actions.

After these preliminary remarks it will be explained which kind of information we expect from action interpretations (section 1). In the subsequent section it will be discussed which model of action and action interpretation in principle could provide this information (section 2). In<br>

In this mode, ecocriticism participates in a broader development of “affnity studies” that encompass the many efforts across the disciplines toward reconfiguring our “intraactions” with the world in terms that avoid dichotomies and Newtonian linearity and that utilize instead nonlinear, nondualistic forms of “hybridity.” Hybrids, in Steve Hinchliffe’s words, are “more or less durable bodies made up of similarly hybrid and impermanent relations.

In addition, religion is so pervasive in our society that the life of any American is likely to include references to religion in some form and degree or other. American autobiographies that include religious disclosures are not exceptional, then. Conversely, autobiographies that include religious self-disclosures are potentially engaging to American readers because they themselves are likely to have had to deal with religion as part of their pasts, their current interactions, or their thoughts<br>

  Book Title: A Theory of the Trial-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burns Robert P.<br>
  Abstract: Burns explores the rich narrative structure of the trial, beginning with the lawyers' opening statements, which establish opposing moral frameworks in which to interpret the evidence. In the succession of witnesses, stories compete and are held in tension. At some point during the performance, a sense of the right thing to do arises among the jurors. How this happens is at the core of Burns's investigation, which draws on careful descriptions of what trial lawyers do, the rules governing their actions, interpretations of actual trial material, social science findings, and a broad philosophical and political appreciation of the trial as a unique vehicle of American self-government.<br>

  CHAPTER EIGHT  From Ritual to Askēsis from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rs06">Reading Renunciation</a><br>
  Abstract: In some quarters, the study of ritual has shifted emphasis in recent decades. Scholars have gradually abandoned the functionalist view that ritual serves to create social unity,¹ stressing instead its marking of social difference. In part, this shift signals a dissatisfaction with functionalism’s inherently conservative emphasis on “societal balance,” on the preservation of the
                  status quo.² Informed by a more sharply critical analysis, theoreticians now note the gaps, the distinctions, the discrepancies of a society that ritual, far from healing, instead underscores and maintains. Differentiation is here seen as an activity that can be examined through a focus on ritual.³<br>

  Conclusion: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rwjm">The Satanic Epic</a><br>
  Abstract: When the comet Hale-Bopp made its graceful way across our skies in 1998, most informed people were impressed by its beauty and curious about the science. But a few people were driven by religious fanatics to various tragic episodes of mass-suicide. They read the comet as a message, which they interpreted in the conventional way as a sign of the Apocalypse. The contrast between these two kinds of reaction to astronomical phenomena is discernible already in the seventeenth century. But the proportions would have been quite different: a majority would have taken the religious view, even some members of the<br>

  Book Title: Brahms and His World-(Revised Edition)<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): KARNES KEVIN C.<br>
  Abstract: Since its first publication in 1990,
         Brahms and His Worldhas become a key text for listeners, performers, and scholars interested in the life, work, and times of one of the nineteenth century's most celebrated composers. In this substantially revised and enlarged edition, the editors remain close to the vision behind the original book while updating its contents to reflect new perspectives on Brahms that have developed over the past two decades. To this end, the original essays by leading experts are retained and revised, and supplemented by contributions from a new generation of Brahms scholars. Together, they consider such topics as Brahms's relationship with Clara and Robert Schumann, his musical interactions with the "New German School" of Wagner and Liszt, his influence upon Arnold Schoenberg and other young composers, his approach to performing his own music, and his productive interactions with visual artists.<br>

  Abstract: September 26, 2000. Protestors stage another action aimed against the agenda of globalization as promoted through the policies of wealthy Northern countries and corporations. The scene: the World Economic summit held in Prague, Czechoslovakia. With their persistent outcries and violent confrontations, demonstrators capture the attention of the powerful leaders and global financiers and the world spectatorship. They express their outrage.

  CHAPTER FOUR  “Pantaloon in Black” and “The Old People”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7sb40">William Faulkner</a><br>
  Abstract: IN the plantation South, by 1942 historical conditions existed for the extraction of black from white. For two decades, whiteness had whitened by way of steady out-migration. With the decline of tenantry and the relaxation of the structure enforcing dependency, white, in the last instance, had less reason to be black. The first three stories of
                  Go Down, Moses, usefully described by John Matthews as the “plantation trilogy,”¹ feature black movement, much of it away from whites. “Was” (set in 1859) concerns Turl’s annual runaway. Buck and Buddy McCaslin catch their slave, but not before black motion has disrupted two<br>

  Abstract: Through its denial of an authority rooted in an experience of transcendence, modernity fails to account for individual and collective moral action. First, deprived of a sacred source of the self, depictions of moral action are reduced to motives of self interest.

  Chapter One  THE SELF IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7sp0b">Modernity's Wager</a><br>
  Abstract: One of the more intractable problems in the social sciences is the problem of explaining human agency, or what is often termed the structure/action debate. The problem seems to crop up anew with each generation of practitioners, who have generated a small library on this problem alone. The very triumph of sociology, anthropology, and political science as disciplinary specialties has, however, been marked by a loss of certain categories of thought and by an ever increasing difficulty in expressing human existence in the world in terms of words and concepts that had, in a presociological era, stood at the core<br>

  Chapter Four  THE SELF INTERNALIZED from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7sp0b">Modernity's Wager</a><br>
  Abstract: The previous chapter ended with three themes linked in a somewhat unanticipated manner:
                  recognition,authority, andextended self. It was very much the need for recognition, as noted by philosophers from Adam Ferguson and Adam Smith to G.W.F. Hegel, that formed the basis of what we are calling here the extended, or nonautonomous, self. Ferguson points to this need for approbation in noting that “what comes from a fellow-creature is received with peculiar emotion; and every language abounds with terms that express somewhat in the transactions of men different from success and disappointment.”¹ He continues: “The bosom kindles in company,<br>

  Abstract: In 1994, the American Psychiatric Association published a fourth edition of its official nosology. The new manual,
                     DSM-IV, perpetuates the Kraepelinian framework established byDSM-III. Disorders are generally represented as monothetic categories, each one bounded by a distinctive list of criterial features. The manual’s most obvious departure from the previous editions is rhetorical and concerns the definition of its eponymic subject, “mental disorders.” InDSM-IIIandDSM-III-R, the term is defined in a way that includes all of the factions and orientations that were then represented in the American Psychiatric Association:<br>

  Abstract: The ability to imagine alternative scenarios is a ubiquitous, if not essential, part of human mental life.¹ It is a universal phenomenon, not a practice restricted to or more pronounced in Western culture.² Counterfactuals are routinely used by ordinary people and policymakers to work their way through problems, reach decisions, cope with anxiety, and make normative judgments. They are readily inspired by disconfirmed expectations and failed actions and the regrets they evoke.³ In these circumstances, counterfactual scenarios can empower us by making us believe that we could have brought about better outcomes.⁴ When people invent counterfactuals for any of these<br>

  Author(s) LITTLE DAVID<br>
  Abstract: There are several conceptual ambiguities about the term ʺpluralismʺ that need to be clarified. According to the dictionary, it is both a descriptive term, ʺthe quality or state of being plural,ʺ and a theoretical or normative term, ʺthe doctrine that there are more than one or two kinds of being or independent centers of causationʺ; ʺopposed to
                  monism, or dualism.ʺ¹ Accordingly, the phrase ʺethical pluralismʺ might designate the simple existence of a diversity or plurality of ethical positions, or it might refer to a doctrine holding that ethics, as the systematic evaluation of human action, isin its natureincapable<br>

  Book Title: Politics and the Imagination-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Geuss Raymond<br>
  Abstract: In politics, utopians do not have a monopoly on imagination. Even the most conservative defenses of the status quo, Raymond Geuss argues, require imaginative acts of some kind. In this collection of recent essays, including his most overtly political writing yet, Geuss explores the role of imagination in politics, particularly how imaginative constructs interact with political reality. He uses decisions about the war in Iraq to explore the peculiar ways in which politicians can be deluded and citizens can misunderstand their leaders. He also examines critically what he sees as one of the most serious delusions of western political thinking--the idea that a human society is always best conceived as a closed system obeying fixed rules. And, in essays on
      Don Quixote, museums, Celan's poetry, Heidegger's brother Fritz, Richard Rorty, and bourgeois philosophy, Geuss reflects on how cultural artifacts can lead us to embrace or reject conventional assumptions about the world. While paying particular attention to the relative political roles played by rule-following, utilitarian calculations of interest, and aspirations to lead a collective life of a certain kind, Geuss discusses a wide range of related issues, including the distance critics need from their political systems, the extent to which history can enlighten politics, and the possibility of utopian thinking in a world in which action retains its urgency.<br>

  Abstract: Philosophers are at a serious disadvantage when it comes to understanding politics, and it is a disadvantage that results from the very peculiarity of their special vocation and training. From almost the very beginning of its existence as a distinct activity, Western philosophy has been committed to certain principles of at least minimal self-awareness, clarity, coherence, and consistency of thought, speech, valuation, and action. Socrates, who notoriously took no part in city politics beyond what was strictly required of him by his obligations as a citizen, also started philosophy down the path of exhortation to

  Book Title: Circles Disturbed-The Interplay of Mathematics and Narrative<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): MAZUR BARRY<br>
  Abstract: Circles Disturbedbrings together important thinkers in mathematics, history, and philosophy to explore the relationship between mathematics and narrative. The book's title recalls the last words of the great Greek mathematician Archimedes before he was slain by a Roman soldier--"Don't disturb my circles"--words that seem to refer to two radically different concerns: that of the practical person living in the concrete world of reality, and that of the theoretician lost in a world of abstraction. Stories and theorems are, in a sense, the natural languages of these two worlds--stories representing the way we act and interact, and theorems giving us pure thought, distilled from the hustle and bustle of reality. Yet, though the voices of stories and theorems seem totally different, they share profound connections and similarities.<br>

  Abstract: The Counter-Enlightenment thinker Joseph de Maistre (1753-1821) was an extraordinarily intelligent, well educated, well read, and engaged observer and commentator on foundational developments that have shaped our modern world. His interaction with the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, although from the perspective of opposition to these landmarks of modernity, was remarkably open and creative. His reaction to these developments, though hostile, included quite innovative and still valuable theorizing about such human phenomena as the violence and unreason that so often flourish in human societies.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7znxx">Joseph de Maistre's Life, Thought, and Influence</a><br>
  Author(s) Lebrun Richard A.<br>
  Abstract: When Joseph de Maistre read Edmund Burke’s
                  Reflections on the Revolution in Franceearly in 1791 (within a couple of months of its publication), his immediate reaction was to acclaim Burke’s assessment of events. In a letter to a close friend, Maistre wrote: “I’m delighted, and I don’t know how to tell you how he has reinforced my anti-democratic and anti-Gallican ideas.”² Although Joseph de Maistre (1753-1821) was almost a generation younger than Edmund Burke (1729-1797), their names are very often linked as exemplars of a conservative reaction against the Enlightenment and the French Revolution.

  Author(s) Miltchyna Vera<br>
  Abstract: The great subject of “Joseph de Maistre in Russia” can be treated in two different ways: on the one hand, one can concentrate on Joseph de Maistre’s relations with Russians during his stay in St. Petersburg as minister of the king of Sardinia, a stay that lasted fourteen years - from 1803 to 1817; on the other hand, one can speak of what one calls “the reception”-reactions (sometimes very unexpected) that Maistre’s works have provoked among Russian authors. The two subjects are equally interesting, however the first is - at least in broad terms - well enough known. Maistre’s biographers<br>

It gives a bird’s-eye view of these three pathways so as to situate them in relation to the ones previously discussed.

  CHAPTER SIX  Meta-utopian Consciousness from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztgwq">Russian Experimental Fiction</a><br>
  Abstract: A consideration of consciousness provides an appropriate end point for understanding the interaction between aesthetic experiment and ideological critique in meta-utopian fiction. In its challenge to exclusivist modes of social imagination and practice there emerges in this art a different mentality characterized by an insistence on balancing public and private modes of discourse, a love of ideological play, and an acknowledgment of the thinking, discerning person. The meta-utopian consciousness is built on a distinction between apparent ideological differences (for example, the looking-glass war between modes of realism) and significant valuative oppositions and choices (for example, between didactic and ludic art,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztqsd">The Matrix of Modernism</a><br>
  Abstract: In this chapter and the next, the focus shifts from the articulation of a global structure to the examination of individual writers. While the dynamics of abstraction and experience will continue to guide the investigation, the turn from paradigm to person will bring to light distinctive features of the works of Pound and Eliot. The present chapter, devoted to Ezra Pound, begins with the poet’s tendency to think in terms of certain oppositions—form/flux, abstraction/experience, identity/difference, unity/multiplicity—and then to find constructs that hold together the antithetical terms. This attempt to integrate form and flux is typical of Pound’s approach<br>

  Abstract: Throughout this book I have explored the modern tendency to think in terms of “surfaces” and “depths,” focusing particularly on the opposition between conceptual abstraction and concrete sensation. These terms have been used to conduct an investigation that might be extended well beyond the limits of this study. They inform the works of many writers of the early twentieth century, and Chapters III and IV merely suggest the kind of work to be done with Yeats, Stevens, and Williams, as well as the novelists of the period. In many respects these terms are still central to the human sciences, philosophy,<br>

  Abstract: Milton read the Book of Psalms as the record of a journey through life traversing all the tempers, moods, passions, and uneven reactions that mark the psalmist’s search for an adequate faith. Such a mode of reading was common to Englishmen in his day, guided by the Geneva Bible’s representation of Psalms as a course of life by which “at length [to] atteine to [an] incorruptible crowne of glorie.”¹ Since the journey is not a consistent progress toward enlightenment, individual psalms register backsliding, fear, self-deception, even inadequacy of response no less truly than nobility of spirit.

  Author(s) Bowler Peter J.<br>
  Abstract: Certain images spring immediately to mind whenever the scientific reaction to Darwinism is mentioned. For many, Thomas Henry Huxley’s response to Bishop Samuel Wilberforce at the Oxford BAAS meeting in 1860 symbolizes the scientists’ refusal to bow to outside pressure. Huxley’s debate with Richard Owen over man’s relationship to the apes illustrates the clash between the radical and conservative responses within science, as do the efforts of Asa Gray and William Barton Rogers to defend Darwinism against the attacks of Louis Agassiz in the United States. Many laymen no doubt assume that once the initial opposition was overcome, Darwinism soon<br>

  Abstract: The eleven-year interval since the conference on the reception of Darwinism organized by Thomas F.

More case studies on Germany have appeared; Professor Yvette Conry has published her large volume on French non-reactions to Darwin; and a new generation of Italian historians of science has undertaken to explore the immense and immensely under-researched territory of Italian reactions to Darwin. Yet at present, as in 1972, the task of offering a balanced comparative assessment of Darwinian debates within the major European countries proves daunting. For the most part,<br>

  Abstract: When Sartre first applied his existential ontology to political questions, the Marxist theorist Henri Lefebvre chided him for posing “the human problem” as “an individual question, abstract and theoretical.” This was in sorry contrast to Marxism, which sees man’s social condition as “a problem of action founded on objective knowledge.”¹ Merleau-Ponty, coming to Sartre’s defense, was suspicious of this Marxism that refused to “tarry over the task of describing being and of founding the existence of other people” (SNS 134, tr. 77). His use of “founding” suggests that political theory starts not by assuming that man’s nature is social, but<br>

  NINE  POLITICS AND EXPRESSION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztzb8">Merleau-Ponty and the Foundation of Existential Politics</a><br>
  Abstract: The argument cannot be made that, having become liberal, Merleau-Ponty suddenly forgot what it meant to think politically. In
                  The Adventures of the Dialectiche repeats once again the litany of requirements that he places on truly political thought: it begins with a probabilistic reading of events, it needs a philosophy of history, it treats people statistically, it aims at success (AD 239, 9, 226, 251, tr. 163, 3, 154, 172). Chastising Sartre for his notion of “pure action,” Merleau-Ponty reminds him that political actors cannot use the fact that history is “overflowing with meaning” to justify an arbitrary perspective<br>

  Losing the Edge from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv117">Eros the Bittersweet</a><br>
  Abstract: The self forms at the edge of desire, and a science of self arises in the effort to leave that self behind. But more than one response is possible to the acute awareness of self that ensues from the reach of desire. Neville conceives it as a “contraction” of the self upon itself and finds it merely strange. “How curiously one is changed,” he muses. He does not appear to hate the change, nor to relish it. Nietzsche, on the other hand, is delighted: “One seems to oneself transfigured, stronger, richer, more complete; one

The other is the damage done by writing and reading in the name of communication. Why does he set these two sorts of damage beside one another? Plato appears to believe that they act on the soul in analogous ways and violate reality by the same kind of misapprehension.

  Author(s) Iser Wolfgang<br>
  Abstract: Central to the reading of every literary work is the interaction between its structure and its recipient. This is why the phenomenological theory of art has emphatically drawn attention to the fact that the study of a literary work should concern not only the actual text but also, and in equal measure, the actions involved in responding to that text. The text itself simply offers “schematized aspects”¹ through which the aesthetic object of the work can be produced.<br>

Extremes bring natural reactions, and the two polarities, called at the time the Intentional and the Affective Fallacies, seem to have compromised on a safe buffer state called The Text as Object, an apparently autonomous unit that encodes both its author (implied), or addresser, and its reader (implied),<br>

  Author(s) Beaujour Michel<br>
  Abstract: In order to avoid the kind of frivolity that holds ethical concerns to be irrelevant in a discussion of the reader in (of) texts, it may be wise to revisit briefly the Russian critical tradition. This tradition has entertained with high seriousness the notion—somewhat disreputable in the West—that literature, and particularly fiction, must be held accountable, since it encodes messages which affect not only the subjective world view of readers, but their attitudes and actions. Novels are presumed capable of endangering (or reinforcing) the structure of society and the legal order.¹ Rufus Mathewson’s analysis of Russian radical poetics<br>

  Abstract: Politically and socially the most momentous change in the Renaissance is the growth of centralized power. Even in countries where this growth was not very successful, as in Italy and Germany, people acted as if it were. Machiavelli’s penetrating analysis of power in action is based on what he saw of Medici control in Florence, even though the Medicis ruled only a small territory and Italy would not become a unified nation for another four centuries. Machiavelli’s realism contrasts with the cultivated neo-Platonic idealism of the Medici court, but both are direct reflections of an emerging political model that emulated<br>

  Abstract: Aristotle, we might say, contributed to Greek civilization, Burke to the ferment following the French Revolution, both to our understanding of political theory, the human condition, or the political life. In so saying we use the term ‘contribution’ in rather different senses, the first two of which are, if trite, unexceptionable insofar as they refer to tangible quantitative phenomena. The third occasion of use is interesting and dubious. For it is not entirely clear how any thinker contributes, in any significant sense of the word, to an abstraction such as the political life.

Purposive ambiguity refers to a family of specific communicative devices: deliberate attempts to control audience reaction through the structure of discourse. More precisely, purposive ambiguity is that for which reference to a hypothetical intention has explanatory force. Circumstantial ambiguity amounts to a residual classification for ruptured communication, for, that is, an audience’s room to<br>

  Book Title: The Life of Roman Republicanism-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): CONNOLLY JOY<br>
  Abstract: With an original combination of close reading and political theory, Joy Connolly argues that Cicero, Sallust, and Horace inspire fresh thinking about central concerns of contemporary political thought and action. These include the role of conflict in the political community, especially as it emerges from class differences; the necessity of recognition for an equal and just society; the corporeal and passionate aspects of civic experience; citizens' interdependence on one another for senses of selfhood; and the uses and dangers of self-sovereignty and fantasy. Putting classicists and political theorists in dialogue, the book also addresses a range of modern thinkers, including Kant, Hannah Arendt, Stanley Cavell, and Philip Pettit. Together, Connolly's readings construct a new civic ethos of advocacy, self-criticism, embodied awareness, imagination, and irony.<br>

  4  DIVIDUAL ADVOCACY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvf23">The Life of Roman Republicanism</a><br>
  Abstract: Classical political thought is often understood as hostile to the disruptions, irrationalities, and banalities of quotidian experience: unity and order are taken to be its goals. In a much-quoted passage in Plato’s
                  Republic, musical harmony is used as a metaphor to describe the self and the city (401d–e, 432a); Aristotle praises genteel moderation and confines political theory to the variegated but contained sphere of rule; Cicero wrote his ownRepublic, which had its own memorable musical metaphor for concord (2.69). But as we saw in chapter 1, Cicero also theorizes political action as a contest, seeing the republic as<br>

  CHAPTER EIGHT  A DELIRIUM OF SOLUTIONS from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvgsp">The Tale of the Tribe</a><br>
  Abstract: “Art is local.” As a slogan, these words ring more like “an identification and a plan for action” (Invocation:2) than a critical absolute. Even though the phrase was originally attributed to the Flemish painter Maurice Vlaminck, widely repeated in the circle gathered around Alfred Stieglitz, and quoted by Williams’ friend Marsden Hartley in his 1921 memoirs,

  Abstract: Structurally,
                  The Maximus Poemsare constituted by the interaction between two types of “records,” two narratives which, during the course of the text, are meant to unite and validate a particular (even if, as we shall see, highly problematic) ethical imperative. Because history is presented through the subjective, fragmentary responses of Olson’s own daily reactions to Gloucester—“that tradition is / at least is where I find it, / how I got to / what I say” (“Letter 11”: 48)—as well as through the objective chronicle of the town’s past, the poem contains a double plot, an impersonal “outer<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvh3g">Symbol and Truth in Blake's Myth</a><br>
  Abstract: Blake’s myth is above all else psychological. His cosmology, theology, and even epistemology are all transpositions of the central inquiry into the self. This is no disinterested quest. Like many in his age Blake was haunted, if not obsessed, by dividedness within the self and between self and world. As Hegel said in his first published work, division or discord
                  (Entzweiung)“is the source of the need for philosophy.” And both Hegel and Blake were convinced that harmony must be achieved by restoring the fruitful interaction of opposites, not by abolishing them. “When the power of unification disappears from the<br>

  Book Title: I Am You-The Hermeneutics of Empathy in Western Literature, Theology and Art<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Morrison Karl F.<br>
  Abstract: The author uses diverse sources: in theology ranging from Augustine to Schleiermacher, in art from the religious art of the Christian Empire to posty2DAbstractionism, and in literature from Donne to Joyce, Pirandello, and Mann. In this work he builds on the thought of two earlier books: Tradition and Authority in the Western Church: 300-1140 (Princeton, 1969) and The Mimetic Tradition of Reform in the West (Princeton, 1982). "I Am You" goes beyond their themes to the inward act that, according to tradition, consummated the change achieved by mimesis: namely, empathetic participation.<br>

  CONCLUSION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvm0c">I Am You</a><br>
  Abstract: As literature and theology were pervaded by historical standards of judgment from the eighteenth century onward, the possibilities of esthetic bonding were seen to narrow. This constriction occurred because human existence itself, and with it human knowledge, came to be seen as creatures of finite historical situations that could not recur. Human actions and feelings, confined to nonrecurring situations, could not teach by example; they were inimitable; they could not be reexperienced or performed by spectators.<br>

  Abstract: Persons are subjects of thought and action; they live in a world that science has so successfully managed to understand. As subjects, persons have a very particular perspective on the world and their actions in it: call it the subjective perspective. Persons are also capable of transcending this subjective perspective and of thinking about the world and their behaviour in a detached manner. They are capable of viewing the world not just from

  Book Title: Between Muslim and Jew-The Problem of Symbiosis under Early Islam<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): WASSERSTROM STEVEN M.<br>
  Abstract: In Part I, "Trajectories," the author explores early Jewish-Muslim interactions, studying such areas as messianism, professions, authority, and class structure and showing how they were reshaped during the first centuries of Islam. Part II, "Constructions," looks at influences of Judaism on the development of the emerging Shi'ite community. This is tied to the wider issue of how early Muslims conceptualized "the Jew." In Part III, "Intimacies," the author tackles the complex "esoteric symbiosis" between Muslim and Jewish theologies. An investigation of the milieu in which Jews and Muslims interacted sheds new light on their shared religious imaginings. Throughout, Wasserstrom expands on the work of social and political historians to include symbolic and conceptual aspects of interreligious symbiosis. This book will interest scholars of Judaism and Islam, as well as those who are attracted by the larger issues exposed by its methodology.<br>

  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Thomas Francis-Noël<br>
  Abstract: In an age of authorless, contextless, deconstructed texts, Francis-NoÃ«l Thomas argues that it is time to re-examine a fundamental but neglected concept of literature: writing is an action whose agent is an individual. Addressing both general readers and scholars, Thomas offers two cases, Bernard Shaw's
         Saint Joanand Marcel Proust'sA la recherche du temps perdu, read against the background of the authors' large, eccentric, and surprisingly similar claims about their texts as acts. He examines what happens when we take these claims seriously enough to find out why the authors made them in the first place and what bearing they have on the texts themselves.<br>

  Abstract: This book began with an image of the writer writing, an icon for a concept of literature based on a commonplace concept of human action. It is a concept of literature that situates agency in an individual human being. Texts, in this perspective, are the actions of individual writers. They can be understood in the same way that we understand other human actions undertaken by individuals. Writing, looked upon in this way, is one of a range of things that people do. It is better documented than many other human activities, but it is not isolated from them. On the<br>

  Author(s) GOLDBERG DAVID W.<br>
  Abstract: We live in an age of ethical relativism gone rampant, an age in which adjudication between moral positions has been undermined and thrown into doubt. One of the repercussions of postmodern thinking has been the dissolution of that conceptual certainty that modern philosophy and its philosophic predecessors reveled in: an envisioned certainty that enabled previous generations to condone or condemn moral positions outright and with a certitude that bordered on arrogance.¹ But as our world grows rapidly smaller, our contemporary view (especially within the United States) is one that expects divergence of moral positionings and finds it instanced in actions<br>

  Abstract: The main thesis of this chapter is that only in and through collective social action can

I do not mean to distort or cover over the fundamentalJemeinigkeit, or “mineness,” ofDasein– that is, its having its being entrusted to it, to win or lose it, to choose or abandon it to the “They,” and I affirm with Heidegger that the being that we ourselves are “is alwaysmine.”¹ Yet, to win itself, to choose itself in its being, Dasein must complement its “individuation”² with collective action.

  Author(s) McMichael Anthony J<br>
  Abstract: How can we (as the Americans might say) “walk the walk” of transdisciplinarity? For most of us, the idea of transcending the conventional boundaries of disciplinary fiefdoms, of exploring bigger ideas, is inherently intriguing and attractive. Nevertheless, most researchers and social analysts also know that there are formidable structures, traditions, and mental roadblocks that limit and compartmentalize our intellectual lives. The attainment of successful transdisciplinary thought and action is demanding.<br>

  Abstract: I understand the concept of transdisciplinarity as an integrated approach to complex problems using the methodology and insights from a range of disciplines with differing perspectives on the problem under consideration. Clearly, the term needs to be distinguished from what is meant by multi- and interdisciplinarity, but these three terms can be seen as a continuum, with transdisciplinarity as the most evolved version of an interaction that transcends individual disciplines.<br>

  4  Experience and the Retrospective Glance to the Past from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zxm6">Subaltern Appeal to Experience</a><br>
  Abstract: The experiential process may well appear future-oriented insofar as it remains recalcitrant to seamless integration within prior expectations and insofar as it perturbs routinized perceptions, actions, and attitudes. Yet it also involves the
                  retrospective revision, and not the outright dismissal, of the earlier orientations it disrupts. Experience harbours two temporal maneuvers: an initial disruption of the given is followed by a retrospective revision of the past so as to accommodate the new and reestablish continuity. At hand in dialectical experience is what can be called – what has in fact already been called by Kristeva, Heidegger, Luhmann, and others –<br>

  Abstract: At hand in the temporality of the last two to three decades is not, as Ricoeur would have it, the exacerbation of temporal divergence beyond the mediating capacities of narratives;¹ at hand instead is the contraction of temporality within the narrow horizons of an extended present where a culture of immediacy, not temporal extension, becomes the order of the day. It is just this apparent culture of immediacy that brings us back to our initial problem – the Thompson-inspired subaltern appeal to

  Abstract: Michel Lincourt calls for a dignified architecture, centred around the concept of elegance, that will provide satisfaction to both its users and the surrounding society. Elegance, defined as the symbiosis of excellence and magnificence, is the ultimate attribute of any creative endeavour and achieving it is the architect's prime motivation. Using this concept, Lincourt develops a set of archetypes for designing a more satisfactory architecture and provides an in-depth analysis of three examples of architectural elegance: the Palais-Royal and the Fondation Rothchild Workers' Residence in Paris and the Municipality of Outremont in Montreal.<br>

Using three examples, we explored the symbiotic idea of high quality and great beauty as the necessary conditions for producing an architecture of satisfaction. But our inquiry is not yet finished.

And we have developed only one constitution; more are required.<br>

In attempting to understand – perhaps merely in concrete and individual terms at the outset – the situation of the early modern self, it is helpful to reflect upon the mental and emotional tension experienced by Luther as he faced that august, severe assembly and uttered his famous words of resistance.

  Author(s) Roniger Luis<br>
  Abstract: The study of patronage and clientelism — which has burgeoned in the social sciences since the late 1960s — can be considered part of a broader reaction against evolutionary assumptions about the presumed generalized move of modern society towards Western liberal forms of political development and bureaucratic-universalism. From different vantage points, these assumptions were seriously questioned by the research of scholars who analyzed the actual operation of modern institutions. Thus, over and above their concrete contribution, works by Khayyam Paltiel on the financing of modern parties and studies on political machines by J.

  Abstract: The existence of an increased level of environmental consciousness, of the kind experienced in the 1980s, will create new opportunities for change. However, this situation in itself does not prefigure what the outcomes of that change will look like. Relations with our environment will not be set once and for all or encapsulated in one big “action plan,” but will arise out of much trial and error, changed individual behaviour, political dispute and compromise, and diverse policy initiatives developed over time and unique to specific circumstances.<br>

  Abstract: The purpose of this chapter is to analyze morality and ethics in cinema. This analysis is based on the assumption that morality and ethics are discourses of conduct and character. Moral discourse concerns itself with the appropriateness of conduct and action relative to situations. Rather than prevent changes in conduct and character, morality (at least in its cinematic forms) aims to control their flow and regulate their transformation (see Deleuze 1992 on control). The extent and effectiveness of these efforts can be recognized in the regularities of movement they produce. Ethics also involves movement and change, but it is concerned<br>

The dominance of the perspectives of formal logic and linguistic analysis in the schools of philosophy in the academic scene has largely relegated traditional metaphysics and its interest in ontology to a purely historical account of the past.

Polanyi, who in his personal life was greatly inspired by Leo Tolstoy,¹ was not a philosopher in the strict sense. Yet he believed that as a social and political thinker he had to articulate his intuitions regarding the ethical foundation of human thought and action. He first did so as a young man in the Vienna of the 1920s while struggling against his depression over the useless killing of the Great War. As Polanyi<br>

Whether it is a question of influence or simple affinity matters little for our purposes here; suffice it to say that we are often reminded of the sententiousaphoristic style of these two predecessors as we read Saint-Exupéry’s text. The most clear-cut manifestation of the style in question occurs in Saint-Exupéry’s highly aphoristic

One can write of children as they always are; so my books of children are always good; but when you come to write of the “miss” you have to depict a sweet, insipid young thing—really a child grown older—to whom the basic realities of life and reactions to them are quite unknown.

Nowhere was the reaction to the general’s challenge more disappointing than among France’s senior diplomats, whose responses ranged in tone from indifferent to openly hostile.

It thus offers a model for both theological understanding and pastoral action.<br>

                  Il. T.40, 22.170;Od. I.66). Ancient piety rested on a foundation of killing, death, and eating.

  Abstract: In this chapter we continue to investigate the delimiters in cosmological research that originate in the structure of the human knower—in particular, how the purposiveness of human actions cascades toward the purposiveness of cosmological research. Purposiveness of research is not purposiveness related to the alleged object of this research, that is, the universe. In this sense we are not dealing with a traditional teleology, which would imply the assertion in the purposiveness of the universe’s evolution. We rather deal, as we could say together with Kant, with a “formal” purposiveness of cosmology which, because of the specificity of its<br>

  Book Title: Hope in Action-Subversive Eschatology in the Theology of Edward Schillebeeckx and Johann Baptist Metz<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Rodenborn Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: This volume contends against a major lacuna in the story of eschatology in the twentieth century by offering a historical and comparative analysis of Edward Schillebeeckx’s prophetic eschatology and Johann Baptist Metz’s apocalyptic eschatology with the goal of identifying relative advantages and limitations of these divergent eschatological frameworks for rendering a Christian account of hope that prompts action in the public arena. Rodenborn provides a fresh angle on eschatologies of hope, bringing to the fore two Catholic theologians whose influences range from Vatican II to Latin American liberation theology. Hope in Action offers an innovative contribution to the theological account of the emergence of European political theologies and the role of eschatology as a practical and destabilizing theological category.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0tr7">Liturgy as Revelation</a><br>
  Abstract: René Latourelle is a theologian typical of the focus phase¹ in the history of fundamental theology. Born in Montreal in 1918, he entered the Society of Jesus in 1938 and, after completing doctoral studies in both history and theology, he began in 1959 to teach theology at the Gregorian University, where he subsequently became dean of the faculty of theology.² Latourelle’s career as a student, theologian, and teacher spans the era of the development of fundamental theology through phases that he later calls “Reaction,” “Expansion,” and “Focusing.” Educated within the era of classical apologetics, he was involved with the development<br>

  Abstract: Context matters. We can understand the words and actions of others only with knowledge of the contexts in which those words were spoken and those actions taken. For example, whether someone thinks it is appropriate to wear shoes in one’s home depends on their historical and cultural context.

  Abstract: Since the spread of modernity as a consequence of the French Revolution and the political forms and concepts, the ideologies, and the legal norms it exported, a succession of seekers have set out on a quest for organism, for notions of umbilical immediacy, that is thought to go beyond the arid snares and illusions of Reason, of Jacobinism, of Bonapartism. At the time of the French Revolution and in reaction to it, and after the revolutionary waves of the 1830s and of 1918–1920, no less than after the demise of Communism, voices have multiplied and achieved demotic hegemony, seeking<br>

  Abstract: This paper explores the prospects of a proactive approach to historical thinking in relation to the paradox of human difference and interdependence in a global context. The dual premise of my analysis is the reality and permanence of cultural (including religious) diversity of human societies, on the one hand, and the imperatives of peaceful and cooperative co-existence in an increasingly globalized environment, on the other. Competing visions of history, I suggest, have always been integral to conceptions of self-identity and relationship to the “other,” in individual and communal interactions.

This has made the discipline pliable to modes of understanding the past developed in other disciplines such as arts, aesthetics, literary theory and criticism, ethnology, sociology, philosophy, linguistics, and so on.²<br>

  Abstract: As in all countries which were occupied by Germany during the Second World War, the German Occupation in Norway was met by resistance. This resistance was not only carried out by organized military groups but also by parts of the civilian population. Though it took very different forms and developed in different ways, resistance became an elementary component in the national self-image of Norway after 1945. Memory of the resistance in the post-war period was mostly shaped by the circulation of popular stories about ‘resistance heroes’ and their actions – such as in the extensive ‘experience’ literature.

  Book Title: The Rhetorical Emergence of Culture-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Girke Felix<br>
  Abstract: "Just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric" - the first half of this central statement from the International Rhetoric Culture Project is abundantly evidenced. It is the latter half that this volume explores: how does culture emerge out of rhetorical action, out of seemingly dispersed individual actions and interactions? The contributors do not rely on rhetorical "text" alone but engage the situational, bodily, and often antagonistic character of cultural and communicative practices. The social situation itself is argued to be the fundamental site of cultural creation, as will-driven social processes are shaped by cognitive dispositions and shape them in turn. Drawing on expertise in a variety of disciplines and regions, the contributors critically engage dialogical approaches in their emphasis on how a view from rhetoric changes our perception of people's intersubjective and conjoint creation of culture.<br>

  Abstract: Hitler’s Willing Executioners, authored by Daniel J. Goldhagen and published in 1996, was not least a vehement criticism of conventional research. The German edition was released in the same year that the original English edition came out in the United States. In his book, Goldhagen posits that during the period of National Socialism, the Germans had held an active anti-Semitic attitude featuring eliminatory characteristics toward the Jews. This thesis, which provoked fierce reactions from both the German public and within specialist circles, notably among historians, was eventually rejected as untenable.

  Book Title: Human Nature as Capacity-Transcending Discourse and Classification<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Rapport Nigel<br>
  Abstract: What is it to be human? What are our specifically human attributes, our capacities and liabilities?Such questions gave birth to anthropology as an Enlightenment science. This book argues that it is again appropriate to bring "the human" to the fore, to reclaim the singularity of the word as central to the anthropological endeavor, not on the basis of thesubstanceof a human nature - "To be human is to act like this and react like this, to feel this and want this" - but in terms of species-widecapacities: capabilities for action and imagination, liabilities for suffering and cruelty. The contributors approach "the human" with an awareness of these complexities and particularities, rendering this volume unique in its ability to build on anthropology's ethnographic expertise.<br>

  Author(s) Amit Vered<br>
  Abstract: The topic of student travel readily evokes two long-standing tropes of transition and change. On the one hand, youth is commonly regarded as quintessentially ephemeral. On the other hand, since the Grand Tour of the sixteenthth and seventeenth centuries, travel has often been associated with processes of self-formation and transformation. Both youth and travel also call to mind the interaction between change as a modality of personal as well as broader social formation. Thus the Grand Tour through Continental Europe was intended to serve as the basis for the cultivation of elite tastes among young British aristocrats. The transitions identified<br>

  Abstract: Attempts to discuss the central ritual forms of American Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity, among them conversion narrative and sermon, are troubled by a seeming conflict. They seem to be ritual forms, and at the same time, to be something more, even opposed to ritual action. The urgency and personal quality of these forms of devotional practice lead, sometimes, to readings of them as transparent statements of fact. Conversion narrative, for example, is both clearly a form of devotional practice and also “real,” compelling as autobiography and a source of information about practitioners’ lives. This chapter unpacks this paradoxical quality to<br>

The complete restitution of the past is terrifying and a clear impossibility (one, however, that Borges imagined in his story of ‘Funes, the Memorious’). Memory is essentially a selection: certain traits of an event are conserved, others immediately or progressively set aside and forgotten. Hence it is baffling that the ability Computers have to save information is termed memory, since they lack a basic feature of memory,<br>

  Book Title: Melanesian Odysseys-Negotiating the Self, Narrative, and Modernity<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Josephides Lisette<br>
  Abstract: In a series of epic self-narratives ranging from traditional cultural embodiments to picaresque adventures, Christian epiphanies and a host of interactive strategies and techniques for living, Kewa Highlanders (PNG) attempt to shape and control their selves and their relentlessly changing world. This lively account transcends ethnographic particularity and offers a wide-reaching perspective on the nature of being human. Inverting the analytic logic of her previous work, which sought to uncover what social structures concealed, Josephides focuses instead on the cultural understandings that people make explicit in their actions and speech. Using approaches from philosophy and anthropology, she examines elicitation (how people create their selves and their worlds in the act of making explicit) and mimesis (how anthropologists produce ethnographies), to arrive at an unexpected conclusion: that knowledge of self and other alike derives from self-externalization rather than self-introspection.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qd3fk">Melanesian Odysseys</a><br>
  Abstract: The previous chapter provided a conceptual framework for understanding human interactions as operations that construct the self and the other in a reciprocal activity through forcefully eliciting practices. The same operations simultaneously negotiate understandings of cultural practices and social knowledge. Subsequent chapters will show how much of this activity is telescoped in the accounts that people give about themselves, their lives and their achievements. The importance of narrative, then, is from the outset analytically bound up with the human interactions that are central to this study. The present chapter does something different: it uses older people’s narratives to provide for<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qd3fk">Melanesian Odysseys</a><br>
  Abstract: In an earlier ethnography (Josephides 1985) I traced a Kewa ‘master narrative’ as it attempted to account for the production of inequalities in so-called egalitarian societies. It presented a generalized picture of culture and dealt with the problems of a complex social reality by means of a theoretical stratagem that posited a contradiction between ideology and practice.¹ The present work complements that ethnography with a picture of everyday social interactions, including many-layered accounts, whose effect is to break up any putative master narrative about ‘Kewa culture’.

  Abstract: The death of any individual strikes at the hearts of the living. Family and friends mourn a lost life; a community recognizes a permanent loss. If a death is thought to have been needless—or worse, politically motivated—mourning may well take on the trappings of public protest. Along with the official rituals of church and state, we often see, as the editors of this volume suggest, a kind of “grassroots memorialization,” in which individuals are mourned as a form of social action. When the causes of death are objectionable, foreseeable, or avoidable, people often mourn publicly in protest (Margry<br>

  Abstract: First, I would like to put forward a general hypothesis that is, I think, corroborated by the various recent scholarly studies on grassroots memorials and spontaneous shrines. This phenomenon can be called a “new culture of disaster,” and it is currently shared by large numbers of people around the world. Beyond the specificity of each society, history, and religion, when a catastrophe strikes, people seem to draw on the same repertory of actions. For centuries, we have shared a common political activism in the form of demonstrations and strikes (Tilly 1986). But the public culture of disaster seems different for<br>

  Book Title: Culture and Rhetoric-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Tyler Stephen<br>
  Abstract: While some scholars have said that there is no such thing as culture and have urged to abandon the concept altogether, the contributors to this volume overcome this impasse by understanding cultures and their representations for what they ultimately are - rhetorical constructs. These senior, international scholars explore the complex relationships between culture and rhetoric arguing that just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric. This intersection constitutes the central theme of the first part of the book, while the second is dedicated to the study of figuration as a common ground of rhetoric and anthropology. The book offers a compelling range of theoretical reflections, historical vistas, and empirical investigations, which aim to show how people talk themselves and others into particular modalities of thought and action, and how rhetoric and culture, in this way, are co-emergent. It thus turns a new page in the history of academic discourse by bringing two disciplines - anthropology and rhetoric - together in a way that has never been done before.<br>

  Abstract: We might first found the tropological point of view in social science inquiry in two ancient founding figures, the Pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus and the Roman Rhetorician Quintillian. As with all the contributors to our common Rhetoric Culture project, “social science inquiry” is understood as investigation into the rhetoric of culture creation and social interaction. Heraclitus may be regarded as foundational, not only in his doctrine of flux and constancy of change, but in his view that for the most part, acting under the requirements of social order, cultural constancy, and personal stability, people do not understand fully what is going<br>

  Author(s) Bosi Lorenzo<br>
  Abstract: The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Movement (hereafter, CRM) between the 1960s and early 1970s shifted from an inclusive, reformist movement to an exclusivist, ethnonationalist one.* What is the explanation for such a significant transformation? This chapter seeks to answer the question by looking at the complex interactions of political opportunities/threats and the internal dynamics and competitiveness between different organizations and groups within the movement. What I am suggesting in this work is that much of the process of social movement development is understandable only by looking at the broader political environment as well as by looking within the movement itself.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdcbq">Narrating the Nation</a><br>
  Author(s) Lim Jie-Hyun<br>
  Abstract: Modern historiography has often been a tool to legitimate the nation-state ‘objectively and scientifically’. Despite its proclamation of objectivity and scientific inquiry, modern historiography has promoted the political project of constructing national history. Its underlying logic was to find the course of historical development that led to the nation-state. Thus, national history has made the nation-state both the subject and the object of its own discipline. The ‘Prussian school’ provides a typical example. Not only was Ranke the official historiographer of the Prussian state, Droysen’s distinction between ‘History’ (

  Book Title: Young Men in Uncertain Times-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Dyck Noel<br>
  Abstract: Anthropology is particularly well suited to explore the contemporary predicament in the coming of age of young men. Its grounded and comparative empiricism provides the opportunity to move beyond statistics, moral panics, or gender stereotypes in order to explore specific aspects of life course transitions, as well as the similar or divergent barriers or opportunities that young men in different parts of the world face. Yet, effective contextualization and comparison cannot be achieved by looking at male youths in isolation. This volume undertakes to contextualize male youths' circumstances and to learn about their lives, perspectives, and actions, and in turn illuminates the larger structures and processes that mediate the experiences entailed in becoming young men. The situation of male youths provides an important vantage point from which to consider broader social transformations and continuities. By paying careful attention to these contexts, we achieve a better understanding of the current influences encountered and acted upon by young people.<br>

This self-reflection, compelled by the annually recurring dialogue with educational philosophers (cf.

In doing so, they emphasize that new media are interesting and important inasmuch as they combine three main elements: artifacts or devices, practices, and the arrangements and social forms built around practices. “Today, a lively and contentious cycle of capture, cooptation and subversion of information, content, personal interaction, and system architecture characterizes the relationship between the institutionalized, mainstream center and the increasingly interactive, participatory and expanding edges of media culture” (Lievrouw 2011, 2).<br>

  Abstract: Today’s synthetic biology, just like traditional biotechnology, raises important questions about the moral significance of its products; and questions about the “use” values and disvalues of synthetic organisms are especially prominent among these. It is, after all, the uses—and, by extension, the markets—for these new bacterial organisms that typically drive research into their production.

  Book Title: Constructing Feminine Poetics in the Works of a Late-20th-Century Catalan Woman Poet: Maria-Mercè Marçal-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Vicedo Noelia Díaz<br>
  Abstract: This study focuses upon the work of the Catalan woman poet Maria-Mercè Marçal. It analyses the interaction between body and language in her first five books of poetry. Drawing on the Italian feminist thought of il pensiero della differenza sessuale, it examines the ways in which Marçal’s poetic images display her Catalan feminine subjectivity, including the function of the poet, the space of poetry and the representation of love. It also explores the potentiality of the space of poetry to reconstruct female identity and reconfigure reality. In addition, it unravels the way in which the poet uses poetry to express the love for the other whilst also extending the boundaries of the self. The central concern is to bridge the fissure between female experience and universal precepts on the art of poetry through the predominance of an embodied and natural iconography. This study presents Marçal’s poetic compositions within the international panorama of poetry and feminist studies and aims to open up new terrains of discussion in the field of language, body and writing.<br>

  Abstract: In maintaining the character of Marçal’s poetry as praxis, in Chapter Three I examined poetry as the space where the process of the reconfiguration of reality takes place. Moving from myth to the various levels of reality, I have shown that Marçal concentrated her agency as a writer upon the action of
                  mettere al mondo il mondo. The results attestes to her emergence as a woman poet, and reveales the prevalence of poetic action upon the theme of birth as Marçal’s specific form of creating a novel iconographic female universe. As a writer, she reappropriates the female body and repositions<br>

  Author(s) Grant Nathan L.<br>
  Abstract: James Baldwin, as a developing essayist and thinker, sought to fashion the Black reaction to anti-Black racism by iterating and reiterating the risk of genuine freedom for whites who refused to relinquish their hatred. Baldwin desired to dissolve the horror of American racism in the crucible of love, and thus pass to his brothers and sisters the cup of understanding. This idea was at the heart of his first collection of essays,

  Abstract: All of the lawyers in this study shared a commitment to social change. Many were troubled by how their commitment has played out in work with clients over the course of their careers, particularly in the conservative political climate of the 1990s and the early twenty-first century that is at best apathetic and at worst hostile to poor people’s claims. Clients were less direct in their discussion of social justice. While most felt dissatisfaction with the “system,” they (understandably) focused on their immediate needs.

  Abstract: The previous chapter focused on the value of client autonomy. This chapter examines a technique of lawyering that has been called “collaborative lawyering,” which is in many ways closely tied to notions of autonomy. Collaborative lawyering models portray lawyers and clients as “co-eminent problem solvers.”¹ This term is rooted in a belief that both lawyers and clients can and should contribute knowledge and skills to the relationship, and that clients should make decisions and take actions. In this chapter, I briefly examine the basis for collaborative lawyering and advocate adoption of a broad definition of collaboration. Relying on that definition,<br>

  Abstract: The term “audience” has only relatively recently come to acquire its dominant modern meaning, referring to the viewers of an entertainment or readers of a book. The earliest such usage listed in the
                  Oxford English Dictionary(OED) dates to 1855 . Earlier meanings include “[t]he action of hearing” (dating from c. 1374) and a “[f]ormal hearing,” often with royalty or with a judge (from 1377 ). Derived from the Latinaudire, to hear, the term has a special resonance for children’s literature, for the youngest children are not readers but rather auditors of literature, truly an audience.

  Author(s) Mechling Jay<br>
  Abstract: The concept of character has two uses in children’s literature discourse. One use belongs to literary criticism, as the critic and reader observe the people in a story or novel as “characters,” that is, as agents or actors (Burke 1973 ) whose actions move a story through time. The other use refers to the moral qualities of a person. These uses of “character” are related, as the root of the English word lies in a Greek word for a tool used to mark or engrave a material (

A common usage of “marketing” that directly affects children’s literature is “the action, business, or process of promoting and selling a product” (OED). Since the advent of the printing press, literature has been intimately related to marketing.

  Abstract: To turn from nineteenth-century Congregationalism to Anglicanism, and especially Anglo-Catholicism, is in many ways to turn from what David Tracy, working from Paul Ricoeur, calls proclamation to what he calls manifestation, or from a dialectical toward an analogical imagination and language.¹ Congregationalism, we have seen, grounds the Christ-event as a Word-event, thus calling Christians to witness to that central experience in further, often dialectical, word and action. Anglicanism historically also values proclamation, with Scripture and sermon integral to its liturgy; as Tracy points out, the Christian faith has historically held that “Jesus Christ is both the decisive word and the<br>

It inquired into congruencies of citizens’ ways of life with policy makers’ styles and strategies in problem framing and structuring. This chapter will deal with

If policy making is intertwined cogitation and interaction (Wildavsky, 1980 [1979]), then policy politics is the combination of types of cognitive processes and styles of interaction, characteristic for problem processing in an issue domain.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qgx59">The governance of problems</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter explores a theory of problem-structuring dynamics. It follows the structuration logic proposed by Giddens (1979), showing how policy actors can influence the nature of institutionalised systems of interaction while at the same time being constrained by them. On the one hand, problem-frame shifts and the possibilities for policy change depend on the structure of policy networks. A closed, institutionalised policy network differs from an open, emergent or decaying network. Part of the difference is in shaping different types of policy-making processes, with different capacities for problem processing, and, therefore, speed, scope and direction of policy change and innovation.<br>

We would suggest that this literature offers important insights into how vocabularies of expertise have been used throughout modernity diverting attention from the human significance of what suffering does to people (Wilkinson, 2005).

  Abstract: Journeys and life on the road have fired the human imagination since time immemorial and inspired some of literature’s most enduringly popular narratives. Film did not escape this attraction, and the birth of cinema itself is tantalizingly associated with recording the experience of being on the move. Early cinema, as Giuliana Bruno has pointed out, ‘envisioned “panoramic views” that incorporated site-seeing journeys and the spatio-visual desire for circulation that had become fully embedded with modernity.’¹ Such connection between mobility and film is encoded in the very titles of some of the new medium’s earliest outputs, from the Lumière brothers’ landmark<br>

It was argued that this Cartesian reaction to the arguments for externalism faces serious difficulties. Nonetheless, we have not yet worked out the implications of the arguments themselves. If an essentially Cartesian strategy to limit their scope does not work, we have, as yet, done nothing to work out what that scope is. This is the task of this chapter.<br>

  Author(s) Klassen Helmut<br>
  Abstract: When the image of the human body first appeared in Greek art, it was as an anthropomorphic projection by which unknown and ambiguous powers in the world were identified and could be recognized. Form and gestures, joined with a name, delineated a physiognomy that made apparent a characteristic mode of action and behaviour in the world.² More than a representation or picture of man, the image of the body was thus a mask or figure with which something invisible and ultimately unknown was grasped and made familiar. It was a construction that represented the achievement of a certain understanding of<br>

  Abstract: THIS PAPER DEALS PRIMARILY with the need to integrate local cultural dynamics into all activities related to community development, including education. It also deals with a particular positioning for social scientists committed to the defence of native cultures and to the promotion of a pluralistic and democratic attitude towards local development through the use of participatory methodologies (Fals Borda, 1979, 1980, 1987). Based on my field experience and understanding of development as cultural action, I am questioning previous categories of analysis and constructed theoretical positions affecting the various processes involved in community development.<br>

  Book Title: Everyone Says No-Public Service Broadcasting and the Failure of Translation<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): CONWAY KYLE<br>
  Abstract: Quebec has never signed on to Canada's constitution. After both major attempts to win Quebec's approval - the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords - failed, Quebec came within a fraction of a percentage point of voting for independence. Everyone Says No examines how the failure of these accords was depicted in French and English media and the ways in which journalists' reporting failed to translate the differences between Quebec and the rest of Canada. Focusing on the English- and French-language networks of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Kyle Conway draws on the CBC/Radio Canada rich print and video archive as well as journalists' accounts of their reporting to revisit the story of the accords and the furor they stirred in both French and English Canada. He shows that CBC/Radio Canada attempts to translate language and culture and encourage understanding among Canadians actually confirmed viewers' pre-existing assumptions rather than challenging them. The first book to examine translation in Canadian news, Everyone Says No also provides insight into Canada's constitutional history and the challenges faced by contemporary public service broadcasters in increasingly multilingual and multicultural communities.<br>

  Abstract: The Renaissance was an important era in Western history because of its immense infl uence on the manner in which individuals conceived of their place in the universe and the way in which this conception facilitated the development of a civility tradition that was not as dependent on theological dogma. The subsequent Protestant Reformation and Enlightenment movements were facilitated by Renaissance interaction values because the Renaissance thinkers set the stage for a reversal in the ideologies that had kept absolutist monarchies in power. Although princes remained all-powerful in the Renaissance city-states, a new appreciation of individualism provided the rationale for<br>

  Abstract: Thinkers of the Renaissance placed a certain amount of responsibility on the individual for his actions and moral behaviour. Many of the writings of Renaissance thinkers favoured a personal morality that was not dependent on religious edict. This was an important transformation in worldview and it facilitated the massive cultural changes that occurred as a result of the Protestant Reformation and then the Enlightenment. Both historical developments had the effect of weakening the religious foundations of courtesy and transforming it into a practice of responsible secular citizenship. Our understanding of these changes is important if we are to appreciate how<br>

  Abstract: In previous chapters we have described how the development of centralized monarchies gave rise to a civility ethos that served to legitimize the privileges accorded to aristocrats. As we will argue in our comparison of contemporary civility practices in France and England (chapter 10), this background has had a salient influence on the manner in which individuals interact with one another. In this present chapter we will describe the formation of a civility tradition that was not the outcome of aristocratic society, but a reaction to it.

  Abstract: In Part I we tried to show how France, America, and England developed different civility preferences due to the manner in which each nation was affected by a variety of factors, including political philosophy and system of government, religion, intellectual history, geography, economy, familial norms, and the manner in which emotions were restrained and expressed. By the close of the nineteenth century each nation possessed its own civility and interaction ethos.

  Abstract: The study of civility is the study not only of the social history of a culture but of the human need for satisfactory social bonds and the problems that emerge when these bonds become too loose or too tight. When they are too tight, we are left with a collectivism that engulfs the individual, drowning out personal needs and aspirations. When they are too loose, the individual is deprived of the safety of communal norms and abandoned to a wasteland of freedom in which interactions between self and others lack meaning and depth.

  Abstract: In the absence of an institutional Catholic Church in England after the Reformation, lay piety loomed particularly large in the English recusant community’s efforts to sustain a sense of religious identity and culture. Though scholars of early modern Catholicism once disagreed about whether early modern Catholic culture was characterized by the survival of late medieval traditions or the influence of missionary priests, recent work on both English and Continental Catholicism has shown that it was in fact defined by complex interactions between the two, as the traditions of the past and the spiritual directives of the Counter-Reformation merged, clashed, and<br>

It brought together the various interpretations of collective life to which human beings have committed themselves. The intellectual and spiritual change that Merleau-Ponty underwent has been described as cutting himself off from ‘vertical’ transcendence in the religious or philosophical sense, implying that the act was a mistake. It was motivated by his rejection of religious and philosophical dogma and the existential attractions of Hegel’s idea of commitment to humanism or a regime of mutual recognition.<br>

  Abstract: A GREAT DEAL has been written about Existentialism in recent years, but this work of Dr. Kingston’s seems to me to occupy a unique and important place, and this for two reasons. First, in my opinion he seems to raise those questions about the Existentialist movement which most immediately spring to the mind of any intelligent Christian who finds himself confronted with it. Is the movement a reaction against Christian orthodoxy as such, or is it an attempt to recover certain Christian insights which Christians themselves have largely forgotten?

Mascall suggests that it would be interesting to discuss the existentialism of St. Thomas Aquinas in relation to contemporary philosophies known by the same name. In the past, Catholic philosophy has been dominated and distorted by an essentialist, Cartesian interpretation of St. Thomas and many have come to regard him as a Christianized Aristotle and his philosophy as a completely idealist, rationalistic and closed system. The dominant place given to atheism and freedom in Sartre’s writings can only be fully understood as a reaction against this essentialist Thomism. In contrast to such<br>

  Abstract: IT WOULD BE INTERESTING to know the prospects for the development of quantum electronics, but I do not think they can yet be foretold. In spite of its rapid development and large practical contribution, quantum electronics is not yet a formed scientific trend. In most cases, where the action of quantum devices depends on certain physical limits, these limits are not yet fixed. We cannot yet distinctly answer the simplest questions: are there any limits to the monochromaticity and coherence of radiation, and how do they depend on energy and radiation frequency?

  Abstract: MY SUBJECT in this lecture is perhaps more concerned with the human reaction to cosmology rather than with cosmology itself, since I have become more and more fascinated with the way the human muid responds to changes and advances in science. Cosmology excites particularly strong, varied and interesting responses, for the subject matter is the structure and history of the universe as a whole. It is therefore not in the least surprising that people have been fascinated by it for thousands of years. Nor is it surprising that it belongs among the most speculative and rapidly varying subjects in the<br>

  Abstract: Over the past several decades narrative accounts of personal identity have become increasingly popular (see, e.g. Davenport 2012, MacIntyre 1984, Ricoeur 1992, Rudd 2012, Schechtman 1996, Taylor 1989). As the narrative approach has become more prominent it has, predictably, attracted its share of criticism, and there has been a fairly strong reaction against the idea that our lives can profitably be understood in narrative terms. The most common and forceful objection to this approach is often formulated as a kind of dilemma: either narrative theories really mean to claim that our lives are significantly like literary narratives or these views<br>

Both John J. Davenport (the author of the book in question) and Anthony Rudd have in recent work sought to clarify the conception of ‘narrative’ that they see as operative in Kierkegaard (Davenport 2011, 2012; Rudd 2007b, 2008a, 2012). In doing so, both have revised and qualified their positions in various respects,<br>

  Abstract: Documentary dealing with immigration and the migrant experience in Australia is a continuous thread running through Australian cinema, more recently eclipsed by works equally complex in their articulation of politics and culture, responding in different ways to Australia’s reaction to refugees and the troublesome obsession in Australian domestic political discourse with ‘border protection’. In what follows, we make reference to state-sponsored documentary of the early 1950s supporting immigration in post-war reconstruction, and to a number of recent documentary projects across a spectrum of contemporary forms, projects that respond to public debate around asylum seekers and refugees.

  Abstract: In recent decades, many Italian filmmakers have been turning to the documentary medium in response to the lack of commitment by public and private broadcasters to the production of programmes of cultural significance (Bertozzi 2008: 305). Unfortunately, the contestable funding available for their production (mostly local, regional or special interest) is limited, as is documentary distribution beyond the festival circuit.

  Abstract: Between the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a transition occurred in modern fiction as writers became increasingly reliant on the visual. In his study

  Abstract: Mansfield’s relationship with France is expressed in many different ways in her short stories, one of which is the fundamental role played by the French language. Mansfield confronts English-speaking readers with a foreign language that constantly interacts with their mother tongue, creating an intriguing tension between the two languages, both of which are unsettled as a result, and lose their familiarity. This tension puzzles native speakers, whether French or English, albeit through different processes; the title of one of her most famous stories, ‘Je ne parle pas français’, through its very paradoxical nature, epitomises the issue of the interaction between<br>

  Abstract: It would be arguable that the gold standard of commercial narrative film, the ‘affection image’ or facial close-up, is a fatal error for any cinema of the Left; that Griffith’s pioneering innovations in the conventions of close-up cinematography were nothing less than a capture of the fledgling discourse of narrative cinema for the forces of sentimental reaction, leaving a legacy of bourgeois individualism lodged within the very grammar of the form. The conventions of eye-line matching and shot-reverse-shot montage, and the anchoring of emotional catharsis in the fetishised face as such, have tended to predispose commercial film narrative towards an<br>

  Abstract: Narrative became a concept of great versatility and fluidity in the second half of the twentieth century, configuring multi-dimensional understandings and meanings in healthcare. The literary and social theorist Martin Kreiswirth speaks of ‘a massive and unprecedented eruption of interest in narrative and in theorizing about narrative’ in the period,³ which resulted in stories and fragments of stories gaining significant conceptual traction in many discourses and practices. Not until narrative began to be credited with such as multi-disciplinary capacities were claims for a pluripotential role in medicine explicitly formulated.⁴<br>

For Milner, we must now recognise that ‘the heart of the question of politics’ is ‘the issue of bodies and their survival’.² Accepting this ‘hard kernel’ of the political entails that we adopt a sceptical position vis-à-vis political action, in which a certain kind of pragmatism should order our actions. For Badiou, by contrast, such a position is tantamount to an abandonment of political militancy as such. As is well known, he instead proposes a reconstruction of ‘the<br>

However, as a limitless reaction, the worst violence arises from the essential nature of a limit.

  Abstract: In the two books he wrote on the cinematic image, Gilles Deleuze proposes a fundamental break in the history of film form. This break occurred, he declares, sometime around the end of the Second World War and finds its first expression in the work of Italian neorealist film-makers such as Roberto Rossellini. In Rossellini’s images of aimless characters wandering through the ruins of a bombed-out Europe, Deleuze uncovers a decisive rupture with the logic of classical cinema, a rejection of the possibility for action upon which classical narrative depends.

Moreover, the connotations of the term within each of these areas are multiple, complicated and contested. It is thus not easy to define the term or to determine the nature of the phenomenon that the term describes.

  Author(s) Nightingale Virginia<br>
  Abstract: Observation-based research relies on interactions and exchanges between researcher and research participants, and it is this expanded vision of observation – observation that explicitly designs and accounts for the impact of the research process on the fieldwork experience and the data it produces – that the chapter explores. It is based on the premise that communication is a material process in the sense that it is something that can be observed, recorded, documented, analysed and written about. Fieldwork involves finding ways to transform the fleeting character of communication and social relations into durable analysable forms. Other research practices – for<br>

  Abstract: The argument of this book is that poems encourage their readers to experience language as a dual-aspect phenomenon, as something known and understood in two different ways simultaneously. Poems make the language in which they are made appear contingent, and necessary, at once: they make their writers and readers feel a justness or truth in the poem’s language, at the same time as making those writers and readers question just how that part of the poem’s language (a rhyme, an image, the weight on a syllable, and so on) could produce the reactions it produces.

  Author(s) Phillips David J.<br>
  Abstract: The term

At that time in the Athenianpolis(city-state), the aristocratic Kleisthenes ‘took the people (demos) into his faction’ (Aristotle [332 BCE] 1984: 20.1; Herodotus [430 bce ] 1972: 5.66.2). He did so in order to gain the upper hand in his struggle for political power with the aristocratic and Spartan-backed Isagoras who had been elected as the eponymousarchonfor 508/7. These two men contested power in the aftermath of the tyranny of the Peisistratids (545– 511/10), which had curbed the opportunities<br>

  Abstract: Utilitarianism was a minority position in nineteenth-century English philosophy. After many twists and turns, it gradually spread across all branches of modern knowledge: economics, animal ethics, morality, political science, and law. This ‘consequentialist’ moral theory focuses on an action’s consequences, and not on an action’s intention or intrinsic value. The theory recommends acting so that every being’s well-being increases.

  Abstract: The universe is both

By valuing objects and events, one intensifies things with either more or less of the Beautiful, the True, and the Good. By classifying objects and events, one does not consider the intensity of things, but their extension and the way they belong to other objects or events.<br>

  Author(s) Evans Mark<br>
  Abstract: When faced with a choice between courses of action both or all of which have significant attendant costs or drawbacks – a scenario to which politics is, by its nature, especially prone – we are wont to call the choice on which we settle ‘the lesser of two evils’ (or the ‘least evil’ if the options were more numerous). We employ this phrase when we believe our choice has incurred the least cost compared with the alternatives and, to that extent, it is proffered in justification of the choice made. But it is also an acknowledgement that there is a cost which<br>

  Abstract: Hannah Arendt is one of the most revered and reviled philosophers of the twentieth century. Almost sixty years after the publication of 
                  Eichmann in Jerusalem, her conclusions still have the power to provoke extreme reactions. For example, David Cesarani accuses Arendt of being deeply contemptuous of the Jews of Poland and Russia because of her bourgeois German Jewish background. Barry Gewen, reviewing the book in the New York Times, dismisses Cesarani as ‘a writer in control of neither his material nor himself’. Arendt could certainly be dismissive, contemptuous and excessively judgemental of those outside her circle, and yet her flashes<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r1zbd">Texts</a><br>
  Abstract: In this chapter I want to consider the import of a political speech in the context of the relation between the ethical and the political, the spiritual and the material. To do this I want to play off the historical moment and its surrounding contextual discourses with the speech’s invocation of a transhistorical and universal set of values. New Historicism evolved in the 1980s as in some ways a reaction to structuralism and formalism. Indebted to political, poststructuralist and reader-response theory, it has focused on the intertextuality of literary and non-literary texts and the presence of diverse culturally specific discourses<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r22rz">The World, the Flesh and the Subject</a><br>
  Abstract: Let us suppose that we reject the ‘myth of the given’ or the idea of ‘contents’ of consciousness whose character explains what it is like to have our experiences, and adopt instead an account in terms of the ways things can become intentional objects of experience through the manner of our bodily interactions with them. This may still leave us with the uneasy feeling that something the ‘given’ was meant to suggest has dropped out of our story, namely, the way in which our perceptions and especially our bodily sensations are not only what we

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r22rz">The World, the Flesh and the Subject</a><br>
  Abstract: Within much contemporary analytic philosophy of mind desires are conceived of primarily as the inner states which provide us, together with beliefs, with reasons for forming intentions and consequently acting. When linked with beliefs, such desires then cause us to act in appropriate ways. Desires therefore have a role both in providing premises for practical reasoning and a causal, functional role in terms of the agent’s behaviour. Weaving these two roles together has been one of the challenges of contemporary materialism. Within standard accounts of practical reasoning the agent derives an intention or proceeds to action on the basis of<br>

  Abstract: By the time you have reached this point in the book you may be exasperated, excited, intrigued or merely bored. Whatever your reaction, if you have any reaction at all you will most likely be experiencing some emotion. But what are emotions, and why do we experience them? Could we be much the sort of creatures that we are, with all our other experiences, thoughts and desires, and yet be devoid of emotional feelings? And if we could not, is that because our emotions somehow derive from these other psychological states, or do they add some indispensable element to them?<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter our discussion of emotion drew attention to an often made contrast between intentional engagements with the world, explicable in terms of reason, and emotional responses, themselves bodily, which apparently fall outside the sphere of purposive, intentional engagement. This contrast worked on a picture of intentional action which involved mental deliberation and the operation of impersonal standards of reasoning, and a picture of emotion as disruptive bodily eruptions of a personal kind which assail otherwise rational subjects. By the end of the chapter, however, this contrast had been undermined, by an account of our bodily emotional responses<br>

  Abstract: My title alludes to an essay by Jean-François Lyotard, ‘The Dream-Work Does Not Think’,¹ which in turn alludes to Freud’s
                  Interpretation of Dreams. The issue is whether the Freudian theory of psychoanalysis construes the individual psyche as having any capacity tothinkwhatsoever. It might be problematised thus: if the psychic mechanism is compelled to repeat, can any of its intellections be considered as thought or cogitation, as opposed to Pavlovian reaction? The compulsion to repeat is one – perhaps the arch – element making the psychic mechanism mechanical, hence the structural role it plays, and consequently its tolerance of<br>

  Abstract: This chapter considers the extent to which verbal interaction through the mass media differs from other kinds, such as the face-to-face interaction of individuals, and its consequences in terms of power relations. It examines the power of the media in its assertions of shared values and opinions and works through how such constructions of ‘common sense’ can be critically investigated, drawing for examples on work on racist discourse in the press.

To begin, it examines the well-known claim that men and women tend to use interactional styles based on power and solidarity respectively. The section then goes on to maintain that, in order to explore patterns of male dominance effectively, we need to go beyond this polarised view and attend to discourses and practices in specific situations, institutions and genres which may establish men in positions from which they can dominate women.

  Abstract: The taxonomies of friendship examined in Chapter 1 explain the development of relations between friends on the basis of their mutual need, advantage, tastes and pleasures, commitment to notions of the good or commitment to moral and intellectual principles. This chapter examines how we perceive the other as friend; the nature of the attraction between us; what we see ourselves as having in common. It considers the nature of the choice we make in befriending another person: whether we are helpless before the force of our desires and affinities; whether likes or opposites attract; and whether friendship is a form<br>

  Abstract: My engagement with the work of Laclau has focused on the importance of combining a Lacan-inspired awareness of lack and of the limits of discourse (the Lacanian conceptualisation of negativity qua encounter with the real) with a more substantive dimension, crucial for understanding political life and especially the affective aspect of identification processes: the axis of enjoyment in its different modalities and in its continuous interaction with the discursive constitution of our social and political reality, with the materiality of the signifier. As we have seen, such an articulation requires a delicate balancing act between negativity and positivity. If the<br>

  Abstract: Although our contemporary world is marked throughout by the importance of questions of identity, something increasingly reflected in the directions of contemporary social–scientific research, in the general field of nationalism studies the issue of the attraction and salience of national identities has not been sufficiently examined. This is partly due to the hegemonic position of modernist and constructionist approaches in the relevant literature.² In opposition to the common doxa reproduced by nationalist myths, contemporary research on the nation tends to stress the constructed character of national identity: the nation is primarily understood as a modern social and political construction.<br>

                  jouissance in its different modalities and interactions with the world of signification and social practice. Obviously the emergence of the ‘new’ cannot succeed if it ignores this important parameter, but this is not to say that sedimented, libidinally invested identifications are in any way privileged to retain their hegemonic position indefinitely. Processes of dis-identification and affective re-investment are, on the contrary, part and parcel of social and political life. In capitalist – especially late<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenology or Deconstruction?-The Question of Ontology in Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricoeur and Jean-Luc Nancy<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Watkin Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Phenomenology or Deconstruction? challenges traditional understandings of the relationship between phenomenology and deconstruction through new readings of the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Ricœur and Jean-Luc Nancy. A constant dialogue with Jacques Derrida's engagement with phenomenological themes provides the impetus to establishing a new understanding of 'being' and 'presence' that exposes significant blindspots inherent in traditional readings of both phenomenology and deconstruction.In reproducing neither a stock phenomenological reaction to deconstruction nor the routine deconstructive reading of phenomenology, Christopher Watkin provides a fresh assessment of the possibilities for the future of phenomenology, along with a new reading of the deconstructive legacy. Through detailed studies of the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty, Ricœur and Nancy, he shows how a phenomenological tradition much wider and richer than Husserlian or Heideggerean thought alone can take account of Derrida's critique of ontology and yet still hold a commitment to the ontological. This new reading of being and presence fundamentally re-draws our understanding of the relation of deconstruction and phenomenology, and provides the first sustained discussion of the possibilities and problems for any future 'deconstructive phenomenology'.<br>

  Abstract: A consideration of Paul Ricoeur’s hermeneutic phenomenology has allowed us to trace points of (more usually) proximity and (occasionally) divergence between Derrida and Ricoeur on questions of alterity and coherence. In terms of alterity, ‘life’ and ‘narrative’ for Ricoeur are inextricably intertwined, and the meaning of prefigured action is not posited but attested in the context of a hermeneutic wager: it is a ‘broken attestation’. Similarly, Derrida cannot justify the ‘good’ of alterity, but assumes it. As regards the question of coherence, Ricoeur’s thought deals with a constant tension between chaos and cosmos: narrative is a ‘discordant concordance’ and justice<br>

  Abstract: If communication is the lifeblood of human interaction, the media constitute the veins through which it flows. The media have a multiplicity of forms, functions, and impacts. They exist in oral, literary and visual forms; they are transmitted through print, audiovisual, and digital technologies; and they play communicative, creative, and representational roles. As a whole, or in specific artifacts and genres, the media have varied social, economic and political effects that can promote democracy, development, nation building and inclusion as much as they can sustain authoritarianism, exploitation, conflict and exclusion.

  Abstract: In

The concept of life was not one concept among others but allowed for the construction of a new plane or ‘historical a priori’. If man had been, as Foucault notes, a political animal this was because his humanity was created through the social relations he established through speech and action. When ‘man’ becomes an epiphenomenon of life then his political being is no longer constitutive of who he is; rather his political being might now be explained by reference<br>

  Book Title: Post-Foundational Political Thought-Political Difference in Nancy, Lefort, Badiou and Laclau<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Marchart Oliver<br>
  Abstract: A wide-ranging overview of the emergence of post-foundationalism and a survey of the work of its key contemporary exponents.This book presents the first systematic coverage of the conceptual difference between ‘politics’ (the practice of conventional politics: the political system or political forms of action) and ‘the political’ (a much more radical aspect which cannot be restricted to the realms of institutional politics). It is also the first introductory overview of post-foundationalism and the tradition of ‘left Heideggerianism’: the political thought of contemporary theorists who make frequent use of the idea of political difference: Jean-Luc Nancy, Claude Lefort, Alain Badiou and Ernesto Laclau.After an overview of current trends in social post-foundationalism and a genealogical chapter on the historical emergence of the difference between the concepts of ‘politics’ and ‘the political’, the work of individual theorists is presented and discussed at length. Individual chapters are presented on the political thought of Jean-Luc Nancy (including Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe), Claude Lefort, Alain Badiou, and Ernesto Laclau (including Chantal Mouffe).Overall the book offers an elaboration of the idea of a post-foundational conception of politics.Other titles in the Taking on the Political series: Valentine and Arditi/ Polemicisation 0 7486 1064 2Shapiro/ Cinematic Political Thought 0 7486 1289 0Chambers/ Language and the Politics of Untimeliness 0 7486 1766 3Bowman/ Post-Marxism Versus Cultural Studies 978 0 7486 1762 3Simons/ Critical Political Theory in the Media Age 0 7486 1583 0<br>

  Abstract: Politics, as Paul Ricœur once remarked, ‘only exists in great moments, in “crises”, in the climactic and turning points of history’ (1965: 255). In 1956, troops of the Warsaw pact states invaded Hungary and cracked down on the Hungarian revolution. This event had heavily dislocating effects on Western political thought – no matter whether Marxist or not. As a reaction, Paul Ricœur published one of his best-known essays, ‘The Political Paradox’, in which he seeks to come to terms philosophically with the exigency of the Hungarian events (1965).

The idea of the future as a wager suggests probability as a more obvious mathematics of the future perfect than set theory. There can be no question that our cognitive control of the future must involve us in an assessment of the probability of events that we foresee, and it seems likely that the events that we do not foresee are the lowest probability events.

Film produces life, movement and action from light, making it seem organic (as light produces life and growth in the natural world), but also uncanny (the creation of life and movement from nothing). That the world is reproduced through the effects of light in photography and film has led numerous critics recently to reassert the uncanny and occult status of the media (Gunning 1995).

  Abstract: Where does the history of the history of intelligence begin? As a self-conscious academic subject, intelligence history is widely understood to have started in the 1980s. In Britain, Christopher Andrew and David Dilks proclaimed a deliberate manifesto for intelligence historians in 1984, urging scholars to explore the ‘missing dimension’. Broadly contemporaneous with this, the American historian Richard Immerman asserted that it was important to incorporate covert action into any sophisticated understanding of foreign policy. The mid-1980s also saw the creation of the journal

  Abstract: There is no doubting the importance of ideas of place in Basil Bunting’s poetry, particularly in his major work,
                  Briggflatts(1966), where Northumbria emerges as a luminous and multi-faceted affective terrain. Bunting’s representations of place are also complex and multi-layered, issuing from a geographical imagination that thrives on contradictions. His regional modernism is characterised both by the imaginative centrality of northern landscapes and cultural paradigms to his writing, and by the refraction of such local and regional attachments through a self-consciously international modernist poetics.Briggflattsexplores its themes of dislocation and homecoming through an intense imaginative engagement with the landscapes,<br>

  Author(s): Musheno Michael<br>
  Abstract: Whether on a patrol beat, in social service offices, or in public school classrooms, street-level workers continually confront rules in relation to their own beliefs about the people they encounter. Cops, Teachers, Counselors is the first major study of street-level bureaucracy to rely on storytelling. Steven Maynard-Moody and Michael Musheno collect the stories told by these workers in order to analyze the ways that they ascribe identities to the people they encounter and use these identities to account for their own decisions and actions. The authors show us how the world of street-level work is defined by the competing tensions of law abidance and cultural abidance in a unique study that finally allows cops, teachers, and counselors to voice their own views of their work.Steven Maynard-Moody is Director of the Policy Research Institute and Professor of Public Administration at the University of Kansas.Michael Musheno is Professor of Justice and Policy Studies at Lycoming College and Professor Emeritus of Justice Studies, Arizona State University.<br>

  Abstract: Street-level decision making is complexly moral and contingent rather than narrowly rule bound and fixed. A fundamental dilemma—perhaps the defining characteristic—of street-level work is that the needs of individual citizen-clients exist in tension with the demands and limits of rules. This does not mean that rules do not permeate all aspects of street-level work (they do) or that most street-level actions are not consistent with law and policy (they are). The most common situation may be that the rules effectively fit the complexity of workers’ judgments about citizen-clients. When the rules and standard procedures fit the situation, street-level<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3998/mpub.119520">Utopia in Performance</a><br>
  Abstract: Utopia can be a placeholder for social change, a no-place that the apparatus of theater—its liveness, the potential it holds for real social exchange, its mortality, its openness to human interactions that life outside this magical space prohibits—can model productively. In the last chapter, I found these feelings of utopia in Holly Hughes, Peggy Shaw, and Deb Margolin’s interactions with their audiences. Their stories directly addressed spectators and modeled an ephemeral but powerful intersubjectivity that let spectators experience affectively, if fleetingly, what utopia might feel like. This chapter considers multiple-character solo performances by comedienne and film and stage<br>

  EIGHT  Technique from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3998/mpub.147168">Staging Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) Lutterbie John<br>
  Abstract: When techniques are broadly defined—as process-oriented and involving any systematic and goal-directed human action—one finds them in every creative human activity: in sports, painting, dancing, playing musical instruments, and acting; in physics, chemistry, medicine, and astronomy; in education, administration, and sex. Joseph Agassi argues that magic consists of techniques, though unscientific ones.¹ The swing-era ballad “Oh, Look At Me Now” mentions “technique of kisses.” But techniques can also be much more narrowly defined to include only fully articulated and independently recognized practices that are specifically identified and studied as techniques (the “Alexander technique”).<br>

  NINE  Presenting Objects, Presenting Things from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3998/mpub.147168">Staging Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) Rayner Alice<br>
  Abstract: Theater habitually situates abstractions in material realities. If the philosophical debates over the meanings and functions of presence initially draw from theater, practice returns them there, materializes and frames not only the qualitative sense of heightened being or charisma and the temporality of disappearance but the occasion of perception and the paradoxes of its partiality. All these elements have been carefully and well discussed in the essays in this anthology by Philip Auslander, Noël Carroll, Jon Erickson, and Suzanne Jaeger. Instead of duplicating their efforts, I want to consider one way in which theater presents—not so much to examine<br>

  Author(s) Nanay Bence<br>
  Abstract: My endeavor in this chapter is to examine the ways in which the general structure of perception is modified in the case of the reception of theater performances. First, perception in general is examined. I will then argue that a basic characteristic of perception is that it is sometimes interdependent with action. Next I turn to the special case of the perception of a theatrical performance—what I call
                  theater perception—examining the role of perception for the possibility of action in the case of watching a performance. I contend that theater perception cannot be sufficiently analyzed without taking into<br>

  Abstract: For all of the now vast amount of research done on the democratic peace, there is still a chasm in that research that has only been very partially filled. Simply put, it is the virtual absence of the international security setting. This is all the more surprising because of the growth of international security as a field and the rather obvious concern that scholars in the field should have for the

  Author(s) Walker Stephen G.<br>
  Abstract: A main axis of intellectual tension in the area of foreign policy analysis over the past forty years is the issue of the importance of “beliefs”¹ in the explanation and prediction of foreign policy decisions and outcomes. The seminal decision-making approach to foreign policy articulated by Snyder, Bruck, and Sapin at midcentury was partly in reaction to a skewed emphasis by the realist tradition on external circumstances (e. g., the balance of power) and the omission of beliefs in explaining foreign policy decisions.² Snyder and his colleagues argued that this strategy of explanation came at the expense of neglecting the<br>

  Abstract: Listening to patients and the illness story is one of the most important skills (
                  technē) a physician uses during a lifetime of practice. Because the patient history is the most important diagnostic information, listening carefully is of enormous importance. Patients commonly complain that their doctor does not listen. But when patients are heard, they report that their doctor was empathetic. Listening carefully helps build rapport, increases diagnostic accuracy, and improves patient satisfaction. If a doctor has a broad and deep enough knowledge base, has the skills to listen carefully to what the patient has to say, and gets the information<br>

  Abstract: Ethical practices—behaviors and relationships that necessarily encompass “good” (versus “bad”) actions—are woven into every aspect of medical practices precisely because health care always is vitally concerned with issues of the nature of well-being (the good life, Aristotle’s

  Abstract: We began this book’s discussion with a philosophical argument that the objects of humanistic understanding obtained through narrative knowledge are real and that this reality is a result of narrative understanding and reflection. This reality is demonstrated in a pragmatic way by attending to the actions that spring from the apprehension of dramatic stories and by the outcomes or consequences resulting from exposure to their literary structure and content. We have demonstrated that the consequences of having studied and reflected on the features of narrative structure, character development and motives, time lines in narrative—in a word, the details and<br>

He accomplished this by using a formula he had found in an eighteenth-century mathematics text.² Two years later, three other theorists—Yoichiro Nambu, Leonard Susskind, and Holger Nielsen—independently suggested that Veneziano’s redeployment of this antique mathematical function implied that the particles that formed the nuclei of atoms were not actually zero-dimensional point-particles, but<br>

  Abstract: One day in July 1988, I stood on the concourse at London’s Waterloo Station thinking of the hopes once entertained by late politician Anthony Crosland. As a leading Labour Party intellectual in the mid-1950s, Crosland had dreamed of a less austere socialism where the uniformity of the reforming state would weigh less heavily on the life of the nation. As he wrote in

  Abstract: John Milton’s Eve in
                  Paradise Lost(1667) is not built on biblical precedent. She finds knowledge more seductive than flattery as the serpent tempts her through the power of speech and his capacity to rationalize. Listening to the serpent, Eve imagines how she too might possess greater knowledge, augmenting her own “inward powers.” She discovers the “virtues” of a fruit that makes her mind “capacious,” suddenly capable of discerning “things” erstwhile “visible” only “in heaven.” While recognizing how her actions violate God’s command, she nonetheless momentarily relishes the reward.

  Author(s) Braveman Paula<br>
  Abstract: Over the past two and a half decades, distinct approaches have been taken to defining and measuring health inequalities or disparities and health equity. Some efforts have focused on technical issues in measurement, at times without addressing the implications for the concepts themselves and how that might influence action. Others have focused on the concepts, sometimes without adequately addressing the implications for measurement. This chapter contrasts a few different approaches, examining their conceptual bases and the implications for measurement and policy. It argues for an approach to defining health inequalities and health equity that centers explicitly on notions of justice<br>

  Abstract: Petrarchism is not a monolith, but an endless series of refractions. The preceding analyses underline the fact that even within a well-established tradition, “content” is no stable quantity: thematic elements take on different meanings according to the context; more importantly, they vary with the tone. The

  Book Title: Covering Bin Laden-Global Media and the World's Most Wanted Man<br>
  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): AL-SUMAIT FAHED<br>
  Abstract: Starting in 2001, much of the world media used the image of Osama bin Laden as a shorthand for terrorism. Bin Laden himself considered media manipulation on a par with military, political, and ideological tools, and intentionally used interviews, taped speeches, and distributed statements to further al-Qaida's ends. In Covering Bin Laden , editors Susan Jeffords and Fahed Yahya Al-Sumait collect perspectives from global scholars exploring a startling premise: that media depictions of Bin Laden not only diverge but often contradict each other, depending on the media provider and format, the place in which the depiction is presented, and the viewer's political and cultural background. The contributors analyze the representations of the many Bin Ladens, ranging from Al Jazeera broadcasts to video games. They examine the media's dominant role in shaping our understanding of terrorists and why/how they should be feared, and they engage with the ways the mosaic of Bin Laden images and narratives have influenced policies and actions around the world. Contributors include Fahed Al-Sumait, Saranaz Barforoush, Aditi Bhatia, Purnima Bose, Ryan Croken, Simon Ferrari, Andrew Hill, Richard Jackson, Susan Jeffords, Joanna Margueritte-Giecewicz, Noha Mellor, Susan Moeller, Brigitte Nacos, Courtney C.

  Abstract: In the complex pedagogical scene of projection that endeavors to produce the subject as a disembodied witness who exercises rational vision, the action of shedding light to cast out or eliminate the shadows of superstition, false belief, the susceptibility of witness, and the spectator’s own bodily vulnerability is not only to illumine. Such shadow projecting is also to participate in a volatile but also potentially self-perpetuating motion machine, for to shed light upon is also to cast the very shadows the scene is to eliminate. Indeed, the scene of projection necessarily depends precariously on the fungible dynamics of the umbral<br>

This theory runs through a vast panorama of universal history, which is painted in the book’s central chapter in a quaintly archaic style that could make the anthropological reader wince. Not only does it employ the venerable savagery-barbarism-civilization triad, but the proliferating ethnographic references are treated in a seemingly<br>

They conjoin different topics, perspectives, and speeds of approach. This can<br>

However, he and she represent a genuine historical vector in the afterlife of colonized countries; and it is a moot point where colonization ends and migration begins, or whether the latter is simply the aestheticization of history.

Up until now the phenomenon of meeting has been imagined as emerging out of a primary pantomimicry, as an evolution of gestures informing a performance whose communication is increasingly verbal. The word
                  discoursemeans literally a running hither and thither, and this sense of meeting as a choreography of encounter has enabled us to define the meeting place in terms of the dynamics of meeting itself, as an event whose meaning is inscribed in the continuous present of the action.

  Abstract: Waxing lyrical on the figure of the rainbow, bringing us back from the brink of an abstracting adulthood to a childhood in which color manifests as substance, Walter Benjamin posits something on the order of a prismatic materialism in these lines. Color morphs and moves. Insector angel-like, it “flits from one form to the next,” rendering each lively if not alive. This undifferentiated relation to color as substance radicalizes perception. It ties color to the objects that play host to it such that the visual becomes tactile. Color becomes transitive or transactional. Color happens. It happens to you, through you.<br>

  Abstract: In an article entitled “The
                  Retraitof Metaphor,” Jacques Derrida argues that within a certain context (but only in the limits of this context), the French wordretraitis “the most proper to capture the greatest quantity of energy and information in the Heideggerian text.”Retrait, having a variety of meanings in French like retrace, withdrawal, recess, retraction, retreat, etc., translates (without translating) Heidegger’s notion of a withdrawal of Being(Entziehung, Entzug).¹ If this word became indispensable to Derrida when trying to account for Martin Heidegger’s statements on metaphor, it becomes indispensable to me as well when trying to assess,<br>

  Book Title: On the Rim-Looking for the Grand Canyon<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): NEUMANN MARK<br>
  Abstract: Why do nearly five million people travel to the Grand Canyon each year? Mark Neumann answers this question with a book as compelling as the panoramic vistas of the canyon. In On the Rim, he describes how the Grand Canyon became an internationally renowned tourist attraction and cultural icon, and delves into the meanings the place holds for the individuals who live, work, and travel there. “In the chasm’s dizzying depths and flamboyant displacement of solid ground, as well as in the perceptions of those drawn there-explorers and day-trippers, employees and outlaws, artists and fast-buck artists-Neumann discovers a context in which to examine cultural and experimental fissures that separate leisure and work, home and away, religion and science, art and life. . . . A lively read.” Boston Globe<br>

  Abstract: Many open questions remain. In these concluding remarks, I want to take up an issue that, although frequently mentioned throughout the text, merits further discussion. The issue is that in addition to cultural and symbolic considerations, it is important to incorporate the analysis of institutions and the issues related to the democratic construction of citizenship. These issues are significant for an academic perspective; they are crucial and central for a book that wants to contribute to civic responsibility and action orientations.<br>

  Author(s) Marshall Donald<br>
  Abstract: In 1912, Arnold Schönberg composed
                  Pierrot Lunaire, a musical setting of “thrice seven” poems by the French poet Albert Guirard. The texts assemble a conventional symbolist environment, through which move characters from thecommedia dell’arteengaged in vaguely ritual actions of indeterminate import but with overtones of hostility to the order and monuments of ordinary bourgeois culture. They are, in short, “dated.” But Schönberg’s music remains irreducibly strange even after three-quarters of a century (this fact has seemed to some Schönberg’s chief excellence). And the “method of composing with twelve tones” goes even further. For that method can no longer<br>

  Abstract: This book is about the troubled and violent journey of postcolonial nationalism in South Asia. It examines the interaction between the modern enterprise of nation building and the emergence of ethnic conflict in this area by focusing on a specific event: Indian political and military involvement in the struggle between Sinhalese and Tamils in Sri Lanka. It argues that the attempt to construct nation-states on the basis of exclusionary narratives of the past and univocal visions for the future has reached an impasse. The fixation with producing a pulverized and uniform sense of national identity (usually along majoritarian lines) has<br>

  Abstract: In a sense, to speak of foreign policy presupposes the availability of a given spatialization of the world in terms of us and them. Conventionally, foreign policy is the set of actions by “us” out “there.” In the modern, post-Westphalian world of nation-states, foreign policy constitutes the actions of state elites who try to maintain, at minimum, something called “our national security” and to further at every opportunity something called “our national interest.” This discourse of foreign policy is amnesiac about the relative novelty of its central identities and the dialectical character of its antinomies. It exemplifies the Nietzschean dictum<br>

  Abstract: Ethnicity is not. Any more than the nation. I begin this chapter by evoking Frantz Fanon’s famous quote, “The Negro is not. Any more than the white man” (1967, 231), to indicate the dialectical and mutually constitutive character of ethnicity and nation under the regimes of modernity. Neither nation nor ethnicity is an immanent force, an essence within history, destined for eventual recuperation. Rather, they have to be understood in a relational framework, one that highlights their mutual indispensability and the hierarchizing effects of their interaction (Comaroff 1991). The intellectual and political privileging of the nation-state and its univocal discourse<br>

  Abstract: The preceding chapters examined the social constructions of India, Sri Lanka, and the two Tamil nationalist movements as contested narratives. Throughout, the focus was trained on the interaction between ethnicity/nation, self/other, minority/majority, inside/outside, and various other antinomies in the production and reproduction of these selfsame identities. Rather than proceeding from a standpoint of epistemic realism (the notion that “the world comprises objects the existence of which is independent of ideas or beliefs about them” [Campbell 1992, 4]) oriented toward discovering

  Abstract: If an aporia is defined as a problem or difficulty arising from an awareness of opposing or incompatible views on the same theoretic matter, it seems to me that we have reached an aporetic stage in the postcolonial quest for nation building. The very practices that produce the nation are coeval with its simultaneous fragmentation or unraveling. Although the supposedly progressive and universal idea of the nation is expected to eventually triumph over the reactionary and particularist idea denoted as ethnicity, a close look at the practices of nation building reveal that both nation and ethnicity share a logic that<br>

  Abstract: Although underestimated by defense experts, the promotion of dialogue and face-to-face encounters is by no means a radical idea. Most state actors entangled in the Korean security situation display a preference for the so-called soft landing scenario, which foresees an incremental rapprochement between North and South. All but the most radical critics of engagement advocate policies that are geared toward avoiding either a direct military conflict with or a sudden collapse of North Korea. Since the late 1990s the South Korean government has been particularly active in promoting such a step-by-step approach toward normalizing political interactions on the peninsula. While<br>

  Author(s) Schwab Martin<br>
  Abstract: In his two cinema books,
                  The Movement-ImageandThe Time-Image, Gilles Deleuze offers an aesthetic and historical account of the cinema based on an unfamiliar and intriguing ontology—an ontology of images. Objects, qualities, processes, actions, even the brain: all are images in a dynamic universe of images. In this ″image-world,″ art—specifically, the cinema—emerges as something not ontologically distinct from the rest of the world. Indeed, Deleuze′s theory amounts to the simultaneous dynamization and de-Platonization of the cinema. Deleuzian ″image-art″ is neither semblance (Schein), nor the coming to the fore of a separate and ″artificial″ world, nor the<br>

  Abstract: If one were to take the Academy Awards and the Cannes film festival the way the newspapers do, one would believe that standard cinema is in good health. Global action pictures (

  Abstract: The professions in North America are under attack. Surveys reveal widespread public distrust of professions such as law and politics, and the bottom-line management of professions such as medicine and architecture has become equally pervasive, with the rise of entities such as health maintenance organizations and disciplines such as construction management.

  Author(s) Ahrentzen Sherry<br>
  Abstract: Architects frequently take great pride in pointing to architecture as the most interdisciplinary of professional pursuits. Indeed, for many, one of the great attractions of the field is its inherently interdisciplinary quality, the necessity of integrating widely divergent concerns—aesthetic choices, social implications, the highly technical issues of structural and mechanical calculations, as well as matters treated in other professional fields such as interior design and landscape architecture. In this respect, architecture might be characterized as “inherently interdisciplinary,” in the way that others have characterized academic fields such as geography, or professional fields such as public health (J. Klein 1990).<br>

  Abstract: The philosopher who goes off in search of what is proper to man often stops short, too quickly satisfied with abstractions and entities—essence, nature, consciousness. Scientists from any discipline are all the more willing to make fun of his naïveté because his discourse makes claims to rigor. Either that or the philosopher simply abdicates in the face of scientific advances and reproduces in his own way the reductionist, even eliminationist naturalism that positivist knowledge makes available to him. In which case he can no longer even be a philosopher, for he is only vulgarizing by acquiescing to fatalistic determinism.<br>

  Abstract: Perhaps their working on language and on the imaginary defines the specificity of literary practices, their social dimension (and social role) as well as the confluence of different discursive formations in the literary text. It does not follow, however, that the literary text organizes itself in a purely mechanistic way. On the contrary, it is located in dialogical interaction with a concrete sociohistorical conjuncture, is mediated by various ideological instances, and participates in the contradictory network of the discursive formations of its surroundings. Thus a contextual boundary must be established that might allow an understanding of the “grand dialogue” in<br>

  Abstract: Traditional utopian literature relates to the novel’s contemporary historical circumstances through a process of negation—contemporary society is present only as a repressed subtext, and visible only in the conceptual “antinomies” that the utopian text attempts to neutralize or resolve. In the previous chapter, I explored the effects that occur when, instead of repressing the connection between contemporary society and imaginary society (a repression that is designed to preserve the absolute “elsewhere” of utopia), a text actively foregrounds and thematizes the interaction between utopia and contemporary society. This increased interaction funds an “ideologeme of activism” within the text, while the<br>

Reading Somalia as a cinematographic fiction is not only made possible by the explosion of visual media that this post–cold war intervention triggered.¹ It is also influenced by the actors themselves, the level of reality at which their actions take place, and the staged scenarios that they try to follow.

  Abstract: Boundaries abound. Between humanity and the gods. Between human and animal. Between culture and nature. Between life and death. Between genders, nations, peoples, times, races, classes, and territories. But boundaries have also become problematic today, perhaps more so than before. In a world experienced by many to be without a natural design to which they might conform, the function of boundaries becomes highly ambiguous. Boundaries form indispensable protections against violation and violence; but the divisions they sustain also carry cruelty and violence. Boundaries provide preconditions of identity, individual agency, and collective action; but they also close off possibilities of being<br>

The eclectic iconography of the Quays’ cinematic world—its meandering narrative structures and unique cosmogony—hinders an assured or exclusive classification to a genre or a movement. If anything, their works belong to a hybrid category of poetic-experimental film that operates at a liminal threshold between live action and animation.

Beginning with the Restoration of 1815 and the new philosophical reaction to the French Revolution, however, they were almost exclusively political—if not necessarily cultural—adherents of the right: intelligent conservatives committed to organic notions of development like Edmund Burke, elitists seeking a return to the sword and the robe like Joseph de Maistre, racists<br>

  Abstract: Jürgen Habermas’s intellectual itinerary can hardly be understood without considering its critical and constructive interplay with the thought of Karl-Otto Apel—interactions between the two theorists have often marked significant turning points in Habermas’s project. Without the theoretical-architectonic alternatives that Apel’s reflections open, it would be impossible to evaluate the philosophical course Habermas has steered. Apel and Habermas are united by a lifelong professional friendship, which began when they studied together in Bonn in the early 1950s; since then, the liberating encounter with American pragmatism—of which Apel was one of the first German translators (1967, 1970)—has strengthened their<br>

  Author(s) EDER KLAUS<br>
  Abstract: The theory of social evolution plays a key role in the foundation of Habermas’s theory of communicative action. Since Marx, the evolutionary perspective has struggled with the fact that the position the observer occupies must necessarily be, at the same time, the endpoint of the process in question—and therefore a point of teleological narrowness restricting the scope of social theory. Over time, this problem has lost none of its actuality for projects that seek to address processes of societal development. Durkheim, for example, was wedded to the model of phase-specific progression as much as, more recently, Parsons, Luhmann, and<br>

  Author(s) KREIDE REGINA<br>
  Abstract: For Nietzsche and Sloterdijk, justice is the enemy of freedom. Justice restricts freedom, which they both understand—notwithstanding other differences of opinion—in terms of what affords the greatest possible space for action. For Jürgen Habermas, on the other hand, freedom can only be understood insofar as it is afforded by justice. Without just processes that permit us to determine freedom’s extent and limits, there exists only arbitrary freedom for individuals— but no freedom in the proper sense (freedom for all).<br>

  Abstract: For over forty years Habermas has taken inspiration from and been deeply influenced by the classical American pragmatists, especially Charles S.

He has appropriated, reconstructed, and integrated many of the primary themes of these thinkers into his own comprehensive philosophic perspective: a radical critique of Cartesianism and the philosophy of consciousness; a focus on the primacy of social practices and action in understanding everyday life (the lifeworld); a thoroughgoing fallibilism that encompasses both knowledge of the world and moral reasoning; a development of an intersubjective dialogical understanding of action and rationality; and a<br>

They brought his reflections on historical materialism since the 1950s together with his work in the early 1970s on the theory of communicative action, on one side, and with the results of his recent exchange with Niklas Luhmann concerning social-systems theory, on the other side.

  Abstract: Depending on one’s temperament and sensibilities, progress in the biological sciences occasions enthusiasm or misgivings. Either way, these advances have prompted calls—which are only growing in number—for points of normative orientation. Genetic technology and biotechnology have not only given rise to philosophical reactions along the lines of applied ethics (e.g., disputes about appropriate standards and codes of regulation). In addition, discussions concerning stem-cell research and changes to human genetic material have brought into focus a basic anthropological question about “the future of human nature.” As Habermas views things, the fundamental provocation represented by preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and<br>

Instead, its key feature is that participants attempt to coordinate their different action plans on the basis of an understanding that has been mutually achieved. In the technical sense, “communicative action” refers only to those linguistically mediated interactions in which the “use of language oriented to reaching understanding” assumes a “coordinating role” (Truth, 110). Given that communicative action represents only one kind of social action among others, it is important to bear in<br>

  Abstract: Robert Brandom (2002) describes pragmatism “as a movement centered on the primacy of the practical” (40). This primacy of practice over theory is manifested in Habermas’s writings in two ways. First, it emerges in his lifelong insistence on the primacy of “know how” (what he often calls intuitive knowledge) over “know that.” This is a key Heideggerian distinction, which Habermas uses in his theoretical analyses, in his formal pragmatics, and in developing his social theory. Second, it is manifested in Habermas’s rejection of what he calls the “spectator model” of knowledge and his insistence that action has “cognitive” significance—in<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/brun16642">The Habermas Handbook</a><br>
  Author(s) BRUNKHORST HAUKE<br>
  Abstract: Just as the label “the theory of communicative action” effectively covers all of Habermas’s work to date, the phrase “radical reformism” stands for the author’s view of political praxis— i.e., the practical implications of his theoretical reflections. In a lengthy introduction—written in the winter of 1969—to his first collection of essays, notes (
                  Denkschriften), and contributions to debates on university reform and student protest, Habermas addressed the objectives, theoretical justifications, achievements, reactions, and origins (which were the same across the globe) of the first international movement of this kind. The piece ends with Lenin’s famous question: “What is to<br>

  Book Title: Political Uses of Utopia-New Marxist, Anarchist, and Radical Democratic Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): INGRAM JAMES D.<br>
  Abstract: Utopia has long been banished from political theory, framed as an impossible-and possibly dangerous-political ideal, a flawed social blueprint, or a thought experiment without any practical import. Even the "realistic utopias" of liberal theory strike many as wishful thinking. Can politics think utopia otherwise? Can utopian thinking contribute to the renewal of politics?In
      Political Uses of Utopia, an international cast of leading and emerging theorists agree that the uses of utopia for politics are multiple and nuanced and lie somewhere between-or, better yet, beyond-the mainstream caution against it and the conviction that another, better world ought to be possible. Representing a range of perspectives on the grand tradition of Western utopianism, which extends back half a millennium and perhaps as far as Plato, these essays are united in their interest in the relevance of utopianism to specific historical and contemporary political contexts. Featuring contributions from Miguel Abensour, Étienne Balibar, Raymond Geuss, and Jacques Rancière, among others,Political Uses of Utopiareopens the question of whether and how utopianism can inform political thinking and action today.<br>

  Author(s) LÖWY MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: The global justice movement is without a doubt the most important phenomenon of antisystemic resistance of the beginning of the twenty-first century. This vast, nebulous “movement of movements,” which has taken visible form since the regional or world social forums and the great protest demonstrations—against the WTO, the G8, or the imperial war in Iraq—does not correspond to the usual forms of social or political action. A large decentralized network, it is multiple, diverse, and heterogeneous, joining trade unions and peasant movements, NGOs and indigenous organizations, women’s movements, as well as ecological associations, intellectuals, and young activists.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/chro17958">Political Uses of Utopia</a><br>
  Author(s) KINNA RUTH<br>
  Abstract: For anarchists, utopias are about action. As Uri Gordon argues, utopias are “umbilically connected to the idea of social revolution.”¹ The kind of action utopia describes is a matter of debate. This essay examines how utopian thinking shapes anarchist thought and highlights some recent shift s in the political uses of utopia. Utopianism is not treated as an abstract concept or method, or as a literary genre or place—because that is not how anarchists have understood the idea. Utopia, Gordon notes, “has always meant something more than a hypothetical exercise in designing a perfect society.” As a revolutionary idea,<br>

  Abstract: Human action has always been a mystery, even for those who perform it. Beyond the obvious train of events, the monotonous and predictable taking of decisions (which is often no more than assuming one’s own destiny, what is given to us and what we can accommodate only with decorum),¹ on a very few exceptional occasions the dull cadence of action is interrupted and, with a flash of proof, with an almost luminous character of revelation, the agent is shown the emptiness of his existence, the irreparable hollowness of his existential becoming.<br>

  Abstract: A body of thought is too often reduced to a “silhouette” that one thinks is a summary. In thus personifying the work of philosophy, we take away its thickness. But this complexity does not exist in isolation, any more than it can be frozen in time in the form of an unchanging position. Bodies of thought enrich and transform each other through the play of interactions and reactions, strategies and exchanges, and conflicts and ruptures. One body of thought thus implicates others. This relation is not constructed simply by borrowing from, or subscribing to, other thoughts, any more than the<br>

  Abstract: The state of war suspends morality; it divests the eternal institutions and obligations of their eternity and rescinds ad interim the unconditional imperatives.

  Book Title: Broken Tablets-Levinas, Derrida, and the Literary Afterlife of Religion<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): HAMMERSCHLAG SARAH<br>
  Abstract: Over a span of thirty years, twentieth-century French philosophers Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida held a conversation across texts. Sharing a Jewish heritage and a background in phenomenology, both came to situate their work at the margins of philosophy, articulating this placement through religion and literature. Chronicling the interactions between these thinkers, Sarah Hammerschlag argues that the stakes in their respective positions were more than philosophical. They were also political. Levinas's investments were born out in his writings on Judaism and ultimately in an evolving conviction that the young state of Israel held the best possibility for achieving such an ideal. For Derrida, the Jewish question was literary. The stakes of Jewish survival could only be approached through reflections on modern literature's religious legacy, a line of thinking that provided him the means to reconceive democracy. Hammerschlag's reexamination of Derrida and Levinas's textual exchange not only produces a new account of this friendship but also has significant ramifications for debates within Continental philosophy, the study of religion, and political theology.<br>

  Book Title: The Specter of Democracy-What Marx and Marxists Haven't Understood and Why<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Howard Dick<br>
  Abstract: Howard uses a critical rereading of Marx as a theorist of democracy to offer his audience a new way to think about this political ideal. He argues that it is democracy, rather than Marxism, that is radical and revolutionary, and that Marx could have seen this but did not. In Part I, Howard explores the attraction Marxism held for intellectuals, particularly French intellectuals, and he demonstrates how the critique of totalitarianism from a Marxist viewpoint allowed these intellectuals to see the radical nature of democracy. Part II examines two hundred years of democratic political life -- comparing America's experience as a democracy to that of France. Part III offers a rethinking of Marx's contribution to democratic politics. Howard concludes that Marx was attempting a "philosophy by other means," and that paradoxically, just because he was such an astute philosopher, Marx was unable to see the radical political implications of his own analyses. The philosophically justified "revolution" turns out to be the basis of an anti-politics whose end was foreshadowed by the fall of European communism in 1989.<br>

  Abstract: Although the title of this chapter poses a question, and its analysis will be descriptive, the conclusion is prescriptive. I will offer an argument that explains historically, sociologically, and philosophically the attraction of Marxism in France, the intellectual options that choice entails for those whom I broadly term “communist” (following Marx’s own description in 
                  The Communist Manifesto), and the strength and weaknesses of their position.¹ Finally, I will point to some indices of the emergence of another intellectual style, one that I find more attractive and have labeled elsewhere a “politics of judgment,”² to which I will return later in<br>

  CHAPTER 11  Reading U.S. History as Political from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/howa12484">The Specter of Democracy</a><br>
  Abstract: Historians correctly warn their political scientist friends against the danger of an overly present-centered reading of the stakes of politics. For example, the issues roiling French politics must be understood within the symbolic framework inaugurated by the rupture begun in 1789. Seemingly unrelated actions, whose motivation seems to depend only on simple self-interest, may acquire a meaning that their authors have not consciously intended. Similarly, German politics is framed by the symbolic context created by both Frederick the Great’s early legal codification of the Allgemeines Landgesetz and by the failure of the 1848 revolution to institute a liberal parliamentary regime<br>

  Book Title: Radical Cosmopolitics-The Ethics and Politics of Democratic Universalism<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Ingram James D.<br>
  Abstract: In morality as in politics, theorists have generally focused first on discovering universal values and second on their implementation. Ingram argues that only by prioritizing the development and articulation of universal values through political action in the fight for freedom and equality can theorists do justice to these efforts and cosmopolitanism's universal vocation. Only by proceeding from the local to the global, from the bottom up rather than from the top down, on the basis of political practice rather than moral ideals, can we salvage moral and political universalism. In this book, Ingram provides the clearest, most systematic account yet of this schematic reversal and its radical possibilities.<br>

  Abstract: Cosmopolitanism, I have claimed, is, first of all, a moral-ethical matter—the idea that every person, wherever they live and whatever citizen ship they hold (or do not hold), commands our respect and moral concern. This imperative can be formulated in various ways, some of which I explored in the last chapter: that we should recognize the humanity of others as deserving of fully human lives, as having equal moral standing, or as if they had equal say in the rules and institutions that govern our interaction. All these formulations have the effect of expanding the scope of our moral<br>

  Book Title: Reimagining the Sacred-Richard Kearney Debates God with James Wood, Catherine Keller, Charles Taylor, Julia Kristeva, Gianni Vattimo, Simon Critchley, Jean-Luc Marion, John Caputo, David Tracey, Jens Zimmermann, and Merold Westphal<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Jens<br>
  Abstract: Richard Kearney explores these questions with a host of philosophers known for their inclusive, forward-thinking work on the intersection of secularism, politics, and religion. An interreligious dialogue that refuses to paper over religious difference, these conversations locate the sacred within secular society and affirm a positive role for religion in human reflection and action. Drawing on his own philosophical formulations, literary analysis, and personal interreligious experiences, Kearney develops through these engagements a basic gesture of hospitality for approaching the question of God. His work facilitates a fresh encounter with our best-known voices in continental philosophy and their views on issues of importance to all spiritually minded individuals and skeptics: how to reconcile God's goodness with human evil, how to believe in both God and natural science, how to talk about God without indulging in fundamentalist rhetoric, and how to balance God's sovereignty with God's love.<br>

  Abstract: Lebanon's fragmented political culture is a byproduct of two general features. First, it reflects the traditional forces and political conflicts caused by striking differences in religious beliefs and communal and sectarian loyalties that continue to split the society and reinforce its factional character.

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Allen Amy<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on Immanuel Kant's and Hannah Arendt's ideas about reflective judgment, Lara argues that narrative plays a key role in helping societies acknowledge their pasts. Particular stories haunt our consciousness and lead to a kind of examination and dialogue that shape notions of morality. A powerful description of a crime can act as a filter, helping us to draw conclusions about what constitutes a moral wrong, and public debates over these narratives allow us to construct a more accurate picture of historical truth, leading to a better understanding of why such actions are possible.<br>

  Abstract: Why has evil become such a hot topic these days? Although there could be many reasons, it seems to me that the most important one—the most interesting—has to do with our growing concern with how this age-old problem has entered more and more into our consciousness. In other words, in spite of our failure to cope with human cruelty, we possess a clearer, more moral way to analyze what we call “atrocities.” Our last century was plagued by horrific actions of human cruelty; nevertheless, something about our understanding has been transformed.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/lara14030">Narrating Evil</a><br>
  Abstract: Stories perform many functions for those who read them and those who write them. In this sense, we should first focus on what makes a story an important model for reflective judgment. I will argue that processes of aesthetic apprehension are created by the work of the productive imagination of some moral experiences. This makes stories important vehicles of reflective judgments. Through their written expression, moral stories have demonstrated that, in spite of many theorists’ skepticism, they capture the “ineffable” characteristics of evil actions.¹ In works of fiction as well as in historical stories about evil acts, the “ineffable” seems<br>

I have not yet defined why this connection is conceptually so important. I would like to argue in this chapter that moral wrongdoing is best described in actions wherein the characters are revealed in the complexity of their interactions, which are crystallized in plots. I have argued before that moral wrongdoing is one of the basic conditions for understanding evil because the perpetrator of evil actions causes permanent damage—that is, moral<br>

  Book Title: The Disclosure of Politics-Struggles Over the Semantics of Secularization<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lara María Pía<br>
  Abstract: For Lara, secularization means three things: the translation of religious semantics into politics; a transformation of religious notions into political ideas; and the reoccupation of a space left void by changing political actors that gives rise to new conceptions of political interaction. Conceptual innovation redefines politics as a horizontal relationship between governments and the governed and better enables societies (and individual political actors) to articulate meaning through action -- that is, through the emergence of new concepts. These actions, Lara proves, radically transform our understanding of politics and the role of political agents and are further enhanced by challenging the structural dependence of politics on religious phenomena.<br>

  Abstract: All human action, all political and subjective agency, entails a conceptual framework within which actors make sense of their actions and projects. The concepts I have discussed in this book entailed the disclosure of a new way of thinking about politics during the eighteenth century, which transformed the way social agents saw themselves, their experiences, and their future.¹ This process allowed them to imagine concepts such as critique, emancipation, and the political role of civil society as part of negotiating the space between their expectations and their actual political experiences.

  Book Title: Milton and the Rabbis-Hebraism, Hellenism, and Christianity<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Shoulson Jeffrey S.<br>
  Abstract: Shoulson is unconvinced of a direct link between a specific collection of rabbinic writings and Milton's works. He argues that many of Milton's poetic ideas that parallel midrash are likely to have entered Christian discourse not only through early modern Christian Hebraicists but also through Protestant writers and preachers without special knowledge of Hebrew. At the heart of Shoulson's inquiry lies a fundamental question: When is an idea, a theme, or an emphasis distinctively Judaic or Hebraic and when is it Christian? The difficulty in answering such questions reveals and highlights the fluid interaction between ostensibly Jewish, Hellenistic, and Christian modes of thought not only during the early modern period but also early in time when rabbinic Judaism and Christianity began.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/thom14778">The Death of Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: The twentieth century, particularly on its analytic side, was undeniably marked by what Jocelyn Benoist does not hesitate to call the “race to reference.”¹ Interest in the problem of reference would be a kind of reaction against Kantian idealism and, in general, against any form of representationalism. With Bernard Bolzano and Gottlob Frege, later with the early Husserl and of course Bertrand Russell, a desire was expressed to return to the object, against a too-exclusive concern for our representations of the object. In a word, the thematization of reference was presented as an offensive against the transcendental—which, by means<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/yu--17860">Chinese History and Culture</a><br>
  Abstract: Nowadays the term “modernization” has lost much of the popularity it once enjoyed during the 1950s in the heyday of American modernization theory. In recent academic discourse, the place of “modernization” has been taken over by a number of “posts” beginning with “postmodern.” It is significant to note, however, that as early as the 1970s, some of the leading modernization theorists already found it necessary to reformulate the original thesis by way of clarification or modification. As a response to a widespread dissatisfaction with many of the assumptions of initial modernization studies, Daedalus devoted a whole special issue in 1973<br>

  Book Title: Why Only Art Can Save Us-Aesthetics and the Absence of Emergency<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): ZABALA SANTIAGO<br>
  Abstract: The state of emergency, according to thinkers such as Carl Schmidt, Walter Benjamin, and Giorgio Agamben, is at the heart of any theory of politics. But today the problem is not the crises that we do confront, which are often used by governments to legitimize themselves, but the ones that political realism stops us from recognizing as emergencies, from widespread surveillance to climate change to the systemic shocks of neoliberalism. We need a way of disrupting the existing order that can energize radical democratic action rather than reinforcing the status quo. In this provocative book, Santiago Zabala declares that in an age where the greatest emergency is the absence of emergency, only contemporary art's capacity to alter reality can save us.
      Why Only Art Can Save Usadvances a new aesthetics centered on the nature of the emergency that characterizes the twenty-first century. Zabala draws on Martin Heidegger's distinction between works of art that rescue us from emergency and those that are rescuersintoemergency. The former are a means of cultural politics, conservers of the status quo that conceal emergencies; the latter are disruptive events that thrust us into emergencies. Building on Arthur Danto, Jacques Rancière, and Gianni Vattimo, who made aesthetics more responsive to contemporary art, Zabala argues that works of art are not simply a means of elevating consumerism or contemplating beauty but are points of departure to change the world. Radical artists create works that disclose and demand active intervention in ongoing crises. Interpreting works of art that aim to propel us into absent emergencies, Zabala shows how art's ability to create new realities is fundamental to the politics of radical democracy in the state of emergency that is the present.<br>

  Book Title: The Last Cannibals-A South American Oral History<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): BASSO ELLEN B.<br>
  Abstract: An especially comprehensive study of Brazilian Amazonian Indian history, The Last Cannibals is the first attempt to understand, through indigenous discourse, the emergence of Upper Xingú society. Drawing on oral documents recorded directly from the native language, Ellen Basso transcribes and analyzes nine traditional Kalapalo stories to offer important insights into Kalapalo historical knowledge and the performance of historical narratives within their nonliterate society. This engaging book challenges the familiar view of biography as a strictly Western literary form. Of special interest are biographies of powerful warriors whose actions led to the emergence of a more recent social order based on restrained behaviors from an earlier time when people were said to be fierce and violent. From these stories, Basso explores how the Kalapalo remember and understand their past and what specific linguistic, psychological, and ideological materials they employ to construct their historical consciousness. Her book will be important reading in anthropology, folklore, linguistics, and South American studies.<br>

  Abstract: Royal ancestors played a vital role in religious and political life, actively taking part in a variety of activities ranging from accessions to birthday celebrations. Dead kings occasionally “saw” or “witnessed” the activities of their descendants, overseeing events from celestial or similar positions in the manner of Classic Maya gods. Caracol Stela 6 (Figure 57), for example, mentions the scattering of incense by Knot Ajaw on the Period Ending date of 9.8.10.0.0 4 Ahau 13 Xul (July 4, 603).

  Abstract: Apart from the fact that they were both prominent architects in socialist Yugoslavia, at first sight, Vjenceslav Richter (1917–2002) and Bogdan Bogdanović (1922–2010) do not seem to have much in common. The former was an avantgardist known for light, cool, geometricized structures that explored the limits of modernist tropes of abstraction, technology, and space. The latter created exuberant, allusive, symbolically charged monuments, often rustically hand-carved out of stone, which evoked a distant history rather than projecting the visions of a brave future. Even at a second look, there is not much that connects them, as they emerged out<br>

  Abstract: Understanding “the gods” concerned both the Aztecs and the Spaniards from the earliest moments of Contact. As the Aztecs observed the Spaniards, apprehension about the gods’ presence and absence plagued Moteuczoma and his priests. Accounts of the Encounter leave us with a mythohistorical mix of (re) actions ascribed to the

  Author(s) Urton Gary<br>
  Abstract: Writing about writing is a particularly vexed example of the general relationship, experienced by humans in all cultures, between acting, on the one hand, and commenting on that action, on the other hand. There are not, in fact, many examples of the parallelism between “doing the thing that we are commenting on” in the performance of, and commentary on, most other forms of human activities. Another such example is the closely related activity of talking; that is, we

This field, in effect, is prepopulated by figures that shape expectations of what the politics of mourning looks like, the kinds of actions it involves, and the affective registers through which it is filtered.

The risk of nonneutrality—the risk of discrimination—accompanies efforts both to ignore and to recognize difference in equal treatment and special treatment. Difference can he recreated in color or gender blindness and in affirmative action;¹ in governmental neutrality and in governmental preferences; and in discretionary decisions and in formal constraints on discretion. Why does difference seem to pose choices each of which undesirably revives difference or the stigma or disadvantage associated with it? In this last question lies a clue to the problem.

  Book Title: Language as Hermeneutic-A Primer on the Word and Digitization<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): van den Berg Sara<br>
  Abstract: Language in all its modes-oral, written, print, electronic-claims the central role in Walter J. Ong's acclaimed speculations on human culture. After his death, his archives were found to contain unpublished drafts of a final book manuscript that Ong envisioned as a distillation of his life's work. This first publication of
         Language as Hermeneutic, reconstructed from Ong's various drafts by Thomas D. Zlatic and Sara van den Berg, is more than a summation of his thinking. It develops new arguments around issues of cognition, interpretation, and language. Digitization, he writes, is inherent in all forms of "writing," from its early beginnings in clay tablets. As digitization increases in print and now electronic culture, there is a corresponding need to counter the fractioning of digitization with the unitive attempts of hermeneutics, particularly hermeneutics that are modeled on oral rather than written paradigms.<br>

  Abstract: A hermeneutic of speech in oral cultures demands that we do not assume total likeness between oral speech events in primary oral cultures and oral speech events of literates.

Verbalization is human action—indeed, human action at its peak.<br>

  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Terry Fiona<br>
  Abstract: Terry was the head of the French section of Medecins sans frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) when it withdrew from the Rwandan refugee camps in Zaire because aid intended for refugees actually strengthened those responsible for perpetrating genocide. This book contains documents from the former Rwandan army and government that were found in the refugee camps after they were attacked in late 1996. This material illustrates how combatants manipulate humanitarian action to their benefit.

  Abstract: Concerned with preserving the dignity of humanity, the term “humanitarian” encompasses constraints, or things that individuals and governments must not do, and obligations, or things that they should do. International humanitarian law imposes limits on permissible behavior during war; human rights law sets the minimum standards to which individuals are entitled by virtue of their membership in humanity; and humanitarian action seeks to restore some of those rights when individuals are deprived of them by circumstance. Hence the “duty” to provide humanitarian assistance occurs only once the duty to avoid depriving and to protect from deprivation have failed to be<br>

Heidegger consistently approaches this problem in terms of ways of belonging that precede theoretical abstraction.

To bethink be-ing is to take part in the founding of the there—the event<br>

  Abstract: Violent crime in popular entertainment is first and foremost a question of storytelling. On the most basic level, violence demands more story than does sex. Consider, for example, the extreme cases in popular entertainment directed at roughly the same demographic (men): in pornography, storytelling is kept to a minimum, since anything that is not overtly sexual is simply a distraction, and thus sex scenes can be strung together with the flimsiest of narrative threads (“Is that the delivery boy?”). In stories of violence, there is no precise narrative equivalent to pornography, as graphic violence tends to be much more motivated<br>

Another source of misunderstanding is the “well-known fact” that lots of species use tools, especially chimpanzees. This chapter is partly a critique of prevailing ideas about tools and artifacts. I want to show the need for a new take on the basic concepts of technological civilization, including

  Author(s): Roberts David<br>
  Abstract: The history and theory of the total work of art pose a whole series of questions not only to aesthetic modernism and its utopias but also to the whole epoch from the French Revolution to the totalitarian revolutions of the twentieth century. The total work of art indicates the need to revisit key assumptions of modernism, such as the foregrounding of the autonomy and separation of the arts at the expense of the countertendencies to the reunion of the arts, and cuts across the neat equation of avant-gardism with progress and deconstructs the familiar left-right divide between revolution and reaction, the modern and the antimodern. Situated at the interface between art, religion, and politics, the total work of art invites us to rethink the relationship between art and religion and art and politics in European modernism.<br>

Could members of these groups get along well enough to get things done together if they needed to? In this chapter I examine how Viroquans’ tastes for different cultures of community played out in their interactions with one another.

  Abstract: The Solonian judgment of happiness need not be restricted to a particular social context or sedimented into a formalized social ritual. Any such formalization of the judgment of happiness into a habitual practice, not arising from the initiative of the community but from the obligation of social custom, always risks undermining the very responsibility it seeks to instill, because it requires the performance of an action that is responsible only insofar as it is not compelled. There is no institution that escapes this aporia. Nevertheless, the existence of an institution also testifies to the social currency of particular practices. It<br>

Solon’s proverb simply requires that we judge a life’s narrative as we find it: is this life happy or unhappy? It does not specify any content to happiness in advance. Nor does it specify any criteria for happiness that would place it out of the reach of a finite being, such as the continuity of pleasure or satisfaction or the optimization of wealth.

These effects are still visible in our lives today: the conception of happiness as an affect, the ambivalent attitude toward happiness, the structuring of our lives according to the alternation of desire/satisfaction or work/leisure, the ongoing legacy of utilitarianism’s reductive, mathematized conception of happiness. But the effects of the trial narrative are not always easy to discern: despite widespread criticism of<br>

Both are still too often described largely as ad hoc reactions to what went immediately before. The Hulme-Eliot-Pound-Leavis-Richards-Ransom kind of criticism is set against the impressionistic and often autobiographical performances of William Hazlitt, Walter Pater (“the presence that thus rose so strangely beside the waters”), or Oscar Wilde.

The history of the word since its encounter and interaction with technology when the first writing systems were devised some six thousand years ago has been largely a matter of such separations and systems. By comparison with oral speech, writing is itself a closed system: a written text exists on its own, physically separate from any speaker or hearer, as no real spoken word can exist.

  Book Title: Studies in Medievalism XXIV-Medievalism on the Margins<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Montoya Alicia C.<br>
  Abstract: This volume not only defines medievalism's margins, as well as its role in marginalizing other fields, ideas, people, places, and events, but also provides tools and models for exploring those issues and indicates new subjects to which they might apply. The eight opening essays address the physical marginalizing of medievalism in annotated texts on medieval studies; the marginalism of oneself via medievalism; medievalism's dearth of ecotheory and religious studies; academia's paucity of pop medievalism; and the marginalization of races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, and literary characters in contemporary medievalism. The seven subsequent articles build on this foundation while discussing: the distancing of oneself (and others) during imaginary visits to the Middle Ages; lessons from the margins of Brazilian medievalism; mutual marginalization among factions of Spanish medieval studies; and medievalism in the marginalization of lower socio-economic classes in late-eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Spain, of modern gamers, of contemporary laborers, and of Alfred Austin, a late-nineteenth- and early twentieth-century poet also known as Alfred the Little. In thus investigating the margins of and marginalization via medievalism, the volume affirms their centrality to the field.

  Author(s) Rider Jeff<br>
  Abstract: Today, the Middle Ages might be conveniently defined as the study of the events and artifacts in Europe (more or less) between 500 and 1500 (more or less) that still survive, and our interactions with them. Countless medieval acts of various kinds have been incorporated, and survive as what Bruno Latour has called “actants,” in our present institutions, artifacts, and gestures, but they are so combined with so many other actants that it is impossible to disentangle the medieval actants from the others, and meaningless to do so, since in these cases their value lies not in their historical difference,<br>

  Author(s) Adler Hans<br>
  Abstract: Johann Gottfried Herder has long been known for having developed groundbreaking concepts of thought as well as having modified those of others decisively.
                  Humanitätis—along with concepts such as origin, history, culture, Volk, and language—one of the core concepts of Herder’s works. As a matter of fact,Humanitätis Herder’s all-encompassing concept. All his thinking, writing, and actions were centered around it. In short: Herder was the philosopher ofHumanität.Not only has Herder often been called “the philosopher of humanity”; he has also been accused of being the proponent of a vague “philanthropy.”¹ The fact that scholars<br>

  Abstract: We know nothing conclusive about Julian’s early life, but she indicates that she had been devout since her youth; if Julian’s childhood and youth had been spent in Norwich, how would the experiences of her early life have fed her devotional life and possibly informed her visions?

  Abstract: Many scholars and readers of Julian have puzzled over the strangeness of her text’s structure and the curiously recursive and apparently involuted way that she expounds her showings. Right from the outset, she challenges standard interpretative strategies with her claim in the first chapter of the Long Text that the showing of the Crown of Thorns both ‘comprehended and specified the blessed Trinity’ in which ‘all the shewinges that foloweth be groundide and oned’.² This is typical of her dizzying changes of visual and intellectual perspective: both comprehensive and specific; effortlessly moving from image (crown) to abstraction (Trinity); grounding and<br>

  Abstract: For scholars of the Middle Ages, the old
                  French chanson de gestehas traditionally served as the benchmark for one extreme of a continuum of representation, a genre expressing the distilled essence of the medieval masculine. This reading of the epic presumes a transparent equivalence of the masculine with the body and actions of the knight, constructing the “male” as a necessary element in an ideology of chivalric caste and power. Furthermore, this definition of the masculine is, in Simon Gaunt’s words, “monologic,” meaning that “in thechansons de gestemale characters are defined as individuals in relation to other<br>

  Abstract: An important strategy in the method of early Franciscan preachers and poets was to evoke understanding of vice and virtue through concrete and visible examples. In sermons and catechetical texts, Franciscans used stories and poetry full of lively images to describe sin and show it in action; in this way, the Friars Minor provided literary performance of the vices and virtues for the purpose of correcting the sins of lay society.¹ Indeed our understanding today of what “sinful” behavior was for medieval people is greatly enhanced by the depiction and enactment of specific vices in Franciscan literature.

  Abstract: In the murky climate of Paris 1413, on a Mayday when king Charles VI had gone mad, noble factions were killing each other off, and the city in revolt, the major chroniclers focused on one episode.

  Abstract: German Romantic literature rests on unstable ground. For example, Friedrich Schlegel’s notion of Romantic irony as a “permanente Parekbase” (permanent parabasis)¹ denies the authority of a single vantage point. As parabasis—the Greek term for the chorus stepping out of the action of the play and addressing an ode to the audience—irony is the constant possibility of assuming another subject position, of viewing and representing the world from a different and even contradictory angle.

  Abstract: Near the beginning of the sixteenth century, Martin Luther found new meaning in the Pauline expression

Luther’s theological discovery inspired others to articulate and invoke fundamental religious, political, and cultural changes within the European societies. At the same time, the Protestant Reformation gave rise to a tension between a religious and a humanistic outlook. Many solutions put forward to overcome this tension were informed by fear or fascination and appear to us as reactionary or progressive.

  Abstract: Jews are confined to the periphery in twelfth- and thirteenth-century literature. When they do appear within Christian texts, their actions and behaviour are restricted and circumscribed. Viewed as living symbols of Christʹs suffering on the cross, and as actors within the wider Christian drama, their performance was interpreted through the Churchʹs teachings. Within a literary context, as Stephen Kruger has argued, ʹJews and Judaism can be quite easily rendered ʺvirtual,ʺ reduced to a non-presence, even a non-being that functions to reconfirm a real, present Christianityʹ.¹ In this way, representations of Jews were used to define the nature of Christianity, and<br>

  Author(s) Grimes Nicole<br>
  Abstract: Most of the reactions to Eduard Hanslick’s monograph 
                  Vom Musikalisch-Schönen during the author’s lifetime have either a decidedly polemical or a flattering ring to them. The result is that Hanslick’s theories on musical aesthetics are often abbreviated to handy catch-phrases, a practice that attests to the ideological prejudice of many of his contemporaries, and that has subsequently prevented an objective and substantive dialogue with his aesthetic theory. Despite avoiding such a polemical tone, Das Musikalisch-Schöne und das Gesammtkunstwerk vom Standpunkte der formalen Ästhetik,¹ published by Otakar Hostinský (1847–1910) in 1877, was poorly received and is largely forgotten today.

In his writings, Adorno often tries to draw a distinction between Berg and Wagner, but his explanations, while illuminating, only contribute to the problem. In his reevaluation of Berg, written about twenty years after Berg’s death, Adorno recognizes the “autonomy” of Berg’s works but points to a peculiar sort of metaphysics in which Berg’s music would emerge from underneath the music drama. In other words, Adorno draws a distinction<br>

                  Faust expresses Romanticism’s agony over the fact of individuation and the individual’s distance from its origin and destiny. Its action is propelled by a man’s desire to escape from selfhood into love. Faust does not end in a Liebestod, like Romeo and Juliet or Aida. Yet what is at stake is the continuation of Faust’s self-identity in time versus his dissolution, his Entgrenzung, in a timeless moment of bliss. The escape from selfhood into union with another, whether a lover, the world, or God, would be a Liebestod, and there are many echoes of the love-death theme in Faust,<br>

  Author(s): Arn Mary-Jo<br>
  Abstract: Charles, duc d'Orléans, prince and poet, was a captive in England for twenty-five years following the battle of Agincourt. The studies in this volume, by European and American scholars, focus on his life and actions during that time, and show him as a serious and learned reader, a cunning political figure (accomplished in the skills that would impress the English nobility around him), and a masterful poet, innovative, witty, and intensely self-aware. Discussion of his manuscripts, his social and political relationships, his extensive library, and his poetry in two languages reveal him as a shrewd observer of life, which in his poetry he describes in ways not seen again until the Renaissance.

  Author(s) Chronister Necia<br>
  Abstract: Unlike any other medium, literature has the ability to employ the reader’s imagination in the construction of bodies. When a narrator communicates information about a text’s characters, the reader completes the act of constructing bodies by imagining their contours, postures, and gestures. A character’s gender is thus dependent upon both the narrator’s speech—his/her use of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives—and the reader’s expectations regarding gender. If the narrator omits information about the character’s gender, the reader finds clues in the text—social cues, behaviors, and actions—to fill in that information and assign one. Such moments activate literature’s potential<br>

  Abstract: Since the mid-2000s there has been a marked uptick across the Western world of discussions surrounding the validity and effectiveness of feminism today.¹ Terms such as “postfeminism” or “lifestyle feminism” are increasingly used to characterize a popular interest in making feminism palatable through depoliticization, even as political actions are publicly evaluated as successes or failures on the basis of criteria more appropriate for their second-wave forebears. These discussions either brand feminist cultural production as successful activism against a sexist, mainstream, and consumerist culture, or condemn it as mere media sensation that points to the failure or ineffectuality of feminism today.<br>

Thomas and Florian Znaniecki Memorial Conference on Social Theory, held at the University of Chicago, brought together an outstanding array of scholars representing a variety of contending approaches to social theory. In panels, presentations, and general discussions, these scholars confronted one another in the context of an entire range of approaches. But as readers of this deftly edited collection will discover, the conference was more than a forum for abstract theoretical debate. These papers and discussions represent original scholarly contributions that exemplify orientations to social theory by examining real problems in the functioning of society-from large-scale economic growth and decline to the dynamics of interpersonal interaction.<br>

  Author(s) OBERSCHALL ANTHONY<br>
  Abstract: This paper will provide an example of how to account for social structure by means of transaction costs. Transaction costs refer to the costs of interaction and of exchange itself, such as the costs of collecting information on interaction partners and on the commodity or action that is exchanged, the costs of negotiating an agreement or contract and of monitoring its implementation, and the actual enforcement costs of the agreement. Transaction costs exist because human beings’ rationality is bounded, not least by the time and effort of collecting and processing information; because some people are opportunists who violate trust and<br>

  Author(s) BLAU PETER M.<br>
  Abstract: Oberschall starts his paper by emphasizing that recent developments in economics have overcome the limitations of the assumption of unbounded rationality of neoclassical economic theory. Specifically, by taking transaction costs into account, it is possible for economics—and by implication for sociology-to maintain the model of rational choice without ignoring or neglecting the external social conditions that restrain human action and that explain why it is not based on purely rational self-interest. The body of Oberschall’s paper uses a discussion of the California gold rush in the years around 1850 to illustrate this claim.<br>

  Abstract: Joseph Gusjield:Phenomenology has often been criticized for doing away with any kind of definitive statement that one can make about what is happening and consequently reducing the role of the observer to reporting on what he finds from his relationship to subjects. I am very reluctant to take away from sociologists the kind of activity that tries to give some sense of what are the consequences of actions.

  Abstract: Ever since the pioneering empirical work of Alfred Chandler, the investigation of multidivisional firms has been transforming our understanding of what organizations are and of how they operate. Williamson began the theoretical task by undermining the classical Weberian dichotomy between markets and hierarchies. Through his transaction cost analysis of contracting systems, Williamson underlined the fact that current business management is a mixture of market and hierarchy principles. Hybrid organizational forms such as diversification, profit centers, performance evaluation, transfer pricing, subcontracting, joint ventures, and conglomerates all point to the pervasiveness both of profit-oriented exchange relations within economic units and of overtly<br>

  Abstract: William Labov has used a background which includes training in both “autonomous linguistics” and sociological methods and theory to contribute to our understanding of core issues in both disciplines. His past work has included both macro studies of phenomena of stratification (and mobility) and linguistic and social change; much of this research has employed analyses of results of extensive surveys of phonological production. He has also done micro studies of social interactional processes and rules; this research has attended to a variety of features of speech (phonological, syntactic, prosodic) in “comprehensive discourses analyses.” Labov started his paper by observing that<br>

  Author(s) HEISE DAVID R.<br>
  Abstract: Symbolic interactionism (e.g., McCall & Simmons 1978; Stryker 1980) provides insights into how humans understand social events. Definitions of situations categorize settings and the people in them, narrowing a person’s attention to a constrained range of phenomena, a restricted set of identities and objects that guide understanding and anticipation of social events. Events are created and interpreted to confirm the situational meanings provided by the definition of the situation. People create events to establish identities, to maintain identities, and to restore damaged identities. Expectations for another’s behavior reflect his or her identity, and if an observed event does not confirm<br>

  Abstract: When speaking of the BAN debates as Turner’s redressive phase, what is peculiar about the Bulgarian case is that the whole framework upon which the redressive mechanism was based was itself in a legitimacy crisis from the mid-1980s on. By the 1990s it had completely collapsed and this is probably the most salient explanation why the redressive machinery did not “fix” the problem. What the BAN debates did demonstrate, however, is that “it is in the redressive phase that both pragmatic techniques and symbolic action reach their fullest expression.”

  Book Title: Serbian Orthodox Fundamentals-The Quest for an Eternal Identity<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mylonas Christos<br>
  Abstract: This book is a comprehensive exposition of the interaction of a national (the Serbian people) and a religiou (the Orthodox Christian faith) content, in the formation of a distinctive national identity and a mode of being. Its interdisciplinary approach, drawing on sociology, social anthropology, theology, political theory, Balkan historiography, and Serbian folklore, is deployed to provide a powerful and original analysis of how Serbian Orthodoxy has resulted in the sacralisation of the Serbian nation by framing the parameters of its existence. Addresses the following questions: what 'makes' a Serb? Are meaningful assumptions possible by introducing Serbian Orthodoxy as the primal point of reference? Why does religion appear to have an especially strong appeal?<br>

  Abstract: The Orthodox experience, as the primordial factor of Serbianhood, nurtures upon doctrinal and functional precepts, distinctive cultural and institutional patterns that provide a sense of “protection” and of national be longing to its members. This sense of protection pertains to divinely sanctioned exegeses, concerned with human origins and behaviour and in particular, with the Manichean distinction between good and evil, right and wrong. Orthodoxy as a signifier of collective representation, crystallises rules, symbols, behavioural inducements and consequences for actions, whose justification is also reflected in the internal necessities and functional core of the Serbian society.

  Abstract: Orthodoxy, as already suggested, through the dialectical interaction of her religious content—doctrinal and functional—with the national substance of the Serbian being, sacralises the identity of the latter in the confines of the human–divine communion. Spatial, sacramental, historical, temporal, aesthetic, and spiritual signifiers or referents of faith contribute toward the constitution of a holistic and objectified experience that permeates the nature of the national collectivity. A genealogy of right belief, underlined by the “mediative” presence of venerated patriots and the autocephaly of ecclesiastical institutions, concretise the convergence of the catholic and universal character of Orthodoxy into a unique<br>

For example, the period 1530-1660 “presents the fastest word growth in the history of English in proportion to the vocabulary size of the time”.³ In the history of language, as in the history of visual culture, the movement we call<br>

  Abstract: In the domain of religion, the evidence of interactions between different beliefs and practices in the long sixteenth century is inescapable. Whether or not these interactions are part of the Renaissance movement is a more difficult and controversial question. However, the revival of antiquity, especially the “patristic revival” (the renewed interest in Augustine, Jerome and other leading figures of the early Church), was important in the history of Christianity in this period. The writings of the Fathers, which exemplify the Hellenization of Christianity, were influential on Catholics and Protestants alike.<br>

  Abstract: One wintry night, walking home from a knight-themed party, three merry young men with swords come across a white statue in a cold dark park. They dare each other to behead it, and after much effort, on the fifth blow, one succeeds. As his drunken friends celebrate the statue’s demise, the decapitator suddenly falls to his knees, vomiting violently. The dotingly picturesque description of this abrupt physical reaction, along with its sound effects (“He gagged, then rattled, and snowflakes melted in his hoarse breath”), constitutes the most vivid part of a tiny, 150-word story “Briug” (1996) by Kharkiv writer Yuri<br>

  Abstract: Karl Marx’s
                  Capitalwas the seminal work of nineteenth-century socioeconomic criticism, generating heated social and political debates in Britain and Ireland. There is a view according to which the social theories proposed by Marx and his friend, Friedrich Engels, were themselves utopian, although both social critics repeatedly emphasized their rejection of nineteenth-century utopian socialism—Marx himself claimed bluntly that it was simply “silly” and “stale” and “reactionary.”¹ During the second half of the nineteenth century, Marxism, in its various shapes and forms, emerged as a powerful movement, making its very palpable presence felt in late-Victorian economic, social, and political discourses<br>

  Abstract: The present volume offers interdisciplinary analyses of utopian phenomena. The interdisciplinary nature of studies in utopianism (and also in other fields) is becoming more and more accepted, yet the cooperation of the various disciplines in interpretation is not automatic, and their emphases and approaches may differ substantially. As Balázs Trencsényi argues, “historians of political thought try to renegotiate the relationship between history, literary studies and the social sciences, pointing out that the understanding of a political interaction might necessitate the use of a variety of different interpretative techniques and approaches.”¹ Yet interdisciplinarity is not only a technical issue.

There was a sense on many sides that the Enlightenment had been “on trial” during the French Revolution and that the understanding of human nature and history offered by the Enlightenment had proved inadequate.

Issue: et.2001.112.issue-1<br>

Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Abstract: The necessity of both solidarity and proceduralism thus holds for both distributive and criminal justice. In the end, Ricoeur remains committed to notions that ground the just polity in community and mutual sharing without thinking that these notions require us to dispense with the formalism of procedures of justice. While the latter are not sufficient on their own to create or sustain a just society, while, indeed, formal procedures always presuppose some conception of the good, procedural conceptions allow us to recognize each other as subjects of rights. Although it is not always clear that Ricoeur succeeds in reconciling Rawls and Walzer or Habermas and Gadamer, he does provide a fresh perspective on current debates within his own interesting account of the structure of moral action.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Abstract: In the course of the book, no real convergence is achieved; each one ends where he started, asserting his own beliefs, visions, and concerns. Has anything been gained in the process? The intense and occasionally pointed dialogues bring forth an incremental, but substantial clarification of the issues at hand, the issues at stake, and their potential (but not actual) interaction. The fact of the matter is that neuroscience has no privileged bearing on human affairs simply because it deals with the brain. Why push it to realms in which it does not belong?<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Doctrine and method, theory and interpretation are not necessarily coordinate. Were such coordination possible, a metacritical stance would be required. By accepting uncritically the presuppositions that lie behind psychoanalytic metapsychology, Juillerat abrogates, in my view, ethnological responsibility, that is, the responsibility to measure in a receptive manner the presuppositions of ones hermeneutic against those of the culture one is studying. Though his attention to ethnographic detail leads Juillerat to refine psychoanalytic doctrine, it confirms the epistemological and hermeneutic assumptions of that doctrine (e.g., notions of the unconscious, id, ego, and superego, drives, repression, and, indeed, psychic space). Yafar myth and ritual as he presents them become allegories of that doctrineallegories, I would argue, of allegories. There would appear to be no escape, were it not for the Yafar voices that sound through Juillerats psychoanalytically predetermined presentations. (He offers us almost no contextualized verbatim texts in these essays, though he does in his monographs.) They remind us that, as LviStrauss demonstrated, myths are readily translated one into another, particularly when they are decontextualized. What is of ethnographic, indeed, psychoanalytic import is howand perhaps whytranslation is arrested and a particular myth (e.g., the Oedipal tale) becomes so authoritative that it has the power of promiscuous reduction. Though fascinated by the range of Yafar cultural expression, Juillerat fails to consider the implications of Yafars refusal to reduce their corpus of mythology and ritual to a single mytha singular ritual.<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”
            Theological Studies47 (1986): 44–45.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since his 1962
   Introduction to Husserl’s “The Origin of Geometry.”The real difference between the thought of Ricoeur and Derrida is the distinctive way each thinker supplements phenomenology to take into account the creativity of meaning at the boundary of reason. For Derrida, it is thedifféranceof deconstruction; for Ricoeur, the graft of hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: Hence, our choice of philosophies should not be limited to the two main philosophies identified by Budd but rather could take up ideas from process thinking, which is a quieter but nevertheless relevant philosophy to which LIS should attend. By valuing the processes and articulating this with better abstractions more congruent with our action, we not only further our own project; we also sustain a vital engagement with the projects of individuals. We more clearly articulate the library in the life of the user, to use the words of Wiegand [

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question about the extent to which novels can be understood as “evidence” in any sense at all, or whether Kern should be focusing on trial reports rather than their fictionalized representations. This difficulty would be obviated if the focus of the work were an understanding of the impact of developments in scientific theory on narrative form, yet Kern seems reluctant to move fully in this direction. And indeed, if the ideal reader ofA Cultural History of Causalityis in fact a literary critic, he or she may be inclined to probe a number of Kern’s other assumptions as well—he is perhaps a little too inclined to assert that the Victorian novel is artistically “tidy,” that its patterns of closure are always neat and carefully wrought, as an expression of what Thomas Vargish has called “the providential aesthetic” in his study of the same name (Virginia, 1985). Scholars of nineteenth‐century fiction may perhaps feel that Kern’s descriptions of such neat closures sit uncomfortably with their readings ofBleak House(which is as much about the loss and destruction of evidence as it is about its recovery and careful explication) orOur Mutual FriendorDaniel DerondaorThe Brothers Karamazov(each of which problematizes our sense of a character’s relentless movement toward transgression, judgment, and punishment or acquittal). One is left with a sense that Kern occasionally deploys the term “Victorian” in a rather unsophisticated fashion: as Thomas has shown inDetective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science,even the most carefully crafted detective story of the nineteenth century can raise for readers and critics crucial questions about individual and national identity and the power of public surveillance. Yet these criticisms should not undermine a reader’s sense of Kern’s achievement in this book: it is a vast, ambitious attempt to effect a synthesis of scientific thought and literary experimentation, and on the whole it succeeds well.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: Instructive as his book is, Popkin could also have explored in greater depth yet the relationship between historical scholarship and expressions of the self. By focusing on autobiographies alone, he misses an opportunity to examine how such texts and scholarly publications related to (and possibly affected) one another, most notably in their divergent or convergent patterns of self‐representation. The boundary between autobiographical and scholarly writings may be more porous than Popkin intimates. Paul Hollander’s recent study of academic acknowledgments arrives, for instance, at conclusions that mirror Popkin’s regarding self‐representation and professional norms (“Acknowledgments: An Academic Ritual,”
   Academic Questions15, no. 1 [2001–2]: 63–76). Likewise, one could question why Popkin limited himself to the discursive analysis of published sources and “the motives that historian‐autobiographers acknowledge in their texts” (78). Autobiographies are also social practices that call for systematic research outside the text, in archival and published sources (and, perhaps, interviews as well). But Popkin is too good a historian not to know this. His book is by and about historians; it is dedicated to historians, but it is not only for historians. Its chief objective may well be to show how much the historian’s autobiography has contributed “to the literature of personal life writing” (8). In this respect as in many others,History, Historians, and Autobiographyis a success.<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede- cessors and, perhaps because it is as much recit as the others were peintures, it is also rather more compelling a read. More than the first two volumes of his work, volume three of Barbarism and Religion leaves one hanging; like Gibbon and his first readers, we are only at the Milvian Bridge, pondering what will follow with Constantine. One hopes that, unlike those readers, we will not have to wait five years for the next episode. DANIEL WOOLF University of Alberta [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00090]] LAWRENCE W. MCBRIDE, editor. Reading Irish Histories: Texts, Contexts, and Memory in Modem Ireland. Port- land, Oreg.: Four Courts Press. 2003. Pp. 233. $55.00. The final essay of this collection closes with the following sentiment from Sean Farrell Moran: "Like Socrates and Plato who stood firmly against the influ- ence of myth in Athenian democracy, academic histo- rians will step in to attempt to correct the misconcep- tions of Irish citizens" (p. 218). In the previous essay, one such "academic historian," Ben Novick, stepped into the breach in the following fashion: "Writing, as discussed throughout this book, is a primary means of disseminating information" (p. 211). Socrates and Plato have indeed met their match. It is perhaps unfortunate that this collection, edited by Lawrence W. McBride, closes with one of the most arrogant pieces of scholarship that I have ever had the displeasure of reading. The conceit of the comparison quoted above, and the condescension of statements such as "Perhaps we should pity the peasants. They made the mistake of remembering their past incor- rectly" and "The common Irish man and woman must then be re-educated about Ireland's past and abandon their memories" (p. 218), make it difficult to commend the essay as a fine conclusion to an exceptional book. One can only hope that Moran is trying to be ironic. But it would be unfair to condemn this book on the basis of one author's misguided faith in the powers of the "academic historian." Indeed, the book, although most worthy at times, has enough problems without that. The intention of the collection is clearly estab- lished in the editor's preface: to "examine how a variety of historical narratives were delivered through the written word, but with special attention paid to how readers might have reacted to these texts" (p. 13). The difficulty is that the reader is the one consistent absentee from the essays that follow. From Paul Townend's chapter on the reading rooms of the na- tional movements of the late nineteenth century to Novick's chapter on the newspaper of the Irish Volun- teers, the reader is little more than a shadowy figure. Even the most basic details are ignored; there is no attempt to estimate circulation figures for books or newspapers. Anne Kane's attempts at "reconstructing" (p. 46) what a newspaper reader during the land war might have felt amounts to little more than an essay in speculative sociology. Paul Ricoeur and Clifford Geertz seem to get more attention than the actual people who "may have" (p. 46) and "could well have" (p. 56) responded to the newspapers examined. It also seems unlikely that any farmer facing eviction could have conceived of the land war as a "ritual process" (p. 45). But Kane's essay is not the only one at fault in this fashion. The extent of the readers' absence almost begs one to question why the editor made such a particular point of drawing "special attention" to the reader at all. This is not a fault particular to this book or to these essays. Beyond specific accounts by a reader reacting to a text, which in turn have all the inherent linguistic and interpretative pitfalls of any other text, there are very few ways to interpret the readers' response to any type of narrative. Timothy McMahon is one of the few authors in this collection who actually quotes from the men and women who attended the Gaelic Summer Colleges that he examines. His essay is one of the collection's most valuable as a result. Colin Barr's piece on university education, again valuable in its factual content, has nothing to say about the students or how the changes in the universities effected them AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 471 APRIL 2004 [[END 06A00090]] [[START 06A00090]] Reviews of Books and Films and their learning. The academic career of one Galway student, H. Fitzwalter Kirker, is traced in its entirety, but only in a footnote. The reader gets at least something approximating a lifeline in the piece by McBride on the young reader and the teaching and learning of Irish history. That "young people are by nature curious" (p. 114), however, seems an inade- quate point on which to hang a conclusion. The book is at its strongest in the essays by Jose Lanters and Gregory Castle, which focus on the work of T. W. Rolleston and Standish O'Grady, respectively. Both historians are examined in the context of their contemporaries; both essays actually attempt to fulfill the claims they make for themselves in their opening pages. The same cannot be said, however, for Eileen Reilly's piece on J. A. Froude. Its bland rehearsal of his life is punctuated with references to his visits to Ireland and quotations from some of his more offen- sive diatribes on the Irish people. She offers little or no comment on the bigotry that billowed forth from his pen. For example, one is told of Froude's dislike for Daniel O'Connell but not the reason why. Novick's piece on the military education of the Irish Volunteers begins with an interesting description, but it is rather disappointing thereafter. Although the material is fascinating, the author's conclusions are not. At one point, he deduces that "The pattern of military education seen in the Irish Volunteer and the Workers' Republic lends weight to the idea of the Rising as blood sacrifice, since the key strategist, Joseph Plunkett, never wrote military columns for the Irish Volunteer" (p. 198). At no point does it occur to Novick that the rebels might not have printed their plans in the paper because letting the authorities in Dublin Castle know in advance was not really part of the plan. How useful, indeed, is an examination of the Irish Volunteer's role in the training of the rebels when even the author concedes that details of training on urban insurrection were "left to the writers of the Workers' Republic" (p. 210); when the author gives approximately nine lines of consideration to what he adjudges to be the more important source? Through- out there is little sense of the eye of Dublin Castle watching over what was published and curtailing what could be written. This is a worthy but a frustrating book. There is a lot of value in each essay in terms of the material that is brought to light, but there is also the crushing weight of the artificial framework under which the essays are forced to labor. Like Froude, it is perhaps this book's "portion in life to please no one faction" (p. 140). ANNE DOLAN Trinity College Dublin [[END 06A00090]] [[START 06A00100]] COLIN NEWBURY. Patrons, Clients, and Empire: Chief- taincy and Over-Rule in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. New York: Oxford University Press. 2003. Pp. xii, 328. $72.00. It is a brave historian nowadays who admits that his or her current academic preoccupations began in the 1950s, but an unrepentant Colin Newbury tells us that imperial history at Oxford University is peculiarly marked by continuity. He says that literary theory has dominated the study of discourse for too long (al- though presumably not at Oxford), and it is time to get back to the study of political discourse using the time-honored model of patron-client relations. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of African and Pacific imperial history, with the addition of material on South and Southeast Asia, Newbury presents a well researched and cogently argued case for the persis- tence of precolonial clientage networks in certain British and French colonies. Patron-client modeling was refined by social scientists in the 1960s and 1970s, when it became a useful way of explaining why inde- pendence had brought relatively little change to the administrative systems of former colonies. That polit- ical and economic relations in some colonies can be analyzed effectively using this theory is clear; whether the exercise speaks to wider debates about empire is another question. The omission of colonies of settle- ment, along with almost all of the Portuguese, Dutch, and German empires, weakens the case considerably. Newbury draws on a wide, although extremely selec- tive, range of secondary literature to supplement his own research, wisely conceding that authors may not like the use he makes of their material. He feels no need to address the epistemological and methodolog- ical concerns raised by authors whose work he mines for empirical detail. He excludes pioneering cross- disciplinary studies, such as Jean and John Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution (1991) and Nicholas Thomas, Colonialism's Culture: Anthropology, Travel and Government (1994), which have done so much to shape current debates in postcolonial anthropology. Newbury calls for more interaction between social scientists and historians, but he does surprisingly little to encourage it. If patron-client brokerage really is the best model, Newbury should be able to tackle other theories with confidence, demonstrating their inade- quacies through constructive engagement. Instead he revives battles won long ago, such as the critique of "collaboration" and "indirect rule" analysis. There are still some historians who work with these terms, but far more interesting is the much larger number of scholars tackling more recent debates. This book's contribution to imperial historiography is therefore difficult to assess. Newbury hopes that it will help to determine whether imperial rule suc- ceeded or failed "in 'preparing' [its colonies] for the exigencies and responsibilities of devolved govern- ment" (p. viii). One wonders whether this is still a pressing question, however. It has been a long time since independence for many of the countries Newbury discusses. Scholars posing broader questions about colonialism's legacy will wonder about the cost of Newbury's ruthlessly exclusive approach.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] I wish to thank the editors of the AHR, first, for inviting me to consider the issues in this essay, second, for the helpful comments of Acting Editor Jeffrey Wasserstrom, and, third, for the quite stimulating commentary of several anonymous reviewers. 1 See Eric Foner, ed., The New American History (Philadelphia, 1990); Foner, ed., The New American History, rev. and expanded edn.

Beard.4 But during the 1970s, the claims being made for a national mind or culture were challenged by social historians. Intellectual history was chastened and transformed by the confrontation with social history. Eschewing their former embrace of synthesis, intellectual historians pulled back to study more precisely defined themes and thinkers.5 Not only intellectual history but other subfields accommodated social history's provocation to rethink conventional gen- eralizations. In addition, a professional, even "social-scientific," concern for precision and specificity of reference collaborated-sometimes with forethought, often not-with a sharpened awareness of difference and conflict that came from social movements outside the academy to undermine older composite narratives. Neither the frame supplied by Charles and Mary Beard in The Rise of American Civilization (1927), with its dramatic narrative of conflict between the "people" and the "interests," nor the consensual pluralism that succeeded that interpretation in the 1950s survived.6 If the consensus historians underplayed conflict, the Beards' approach, for all of its sympathy for the dispossessed, was found to be inadequate as well. Their narrative revealed little feel for the diversity of Americans, and it paid scant attention to non-whites. Most important of all, while their narrative voice was sympathetic, one did not discover the quotidian life or hear the voices of those groups that have found voice in more recent historiography. Judged by newer historiographical expectations, The Rise of American Civilization seemed "thin," compared with the increasingly popular "thick" description that was built, in part, on the enormously influential anthropological work of Clifford Geertz.7 In the past quarter century, there has been a proliferation of exciting new research, much of it bringing previously overlooked or explicitly excluded groups and events into the light of history. The number and variety of American stories multiplied. Suddenly, there were histories where there had been none or where the available histories had not been attended to by professional historians: histories of African Americans in the era of slavery and beyond; of Native Americans; of workers at home in their communities, at work, and at play; of women at home and outside of the home and of gender relations more generally; of consumption as well as production; of ethnic minorities and "borderlands"; of popular culture and other "marginal" forms of cultural production; of objects and material culture; of whites and whiteness as historical subjects; of non-state international and intercultural relations; and much more. [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 4Frederick Jackson Turner never completed a major synthesis, but one can see how he might have done that work in his posthumously published The United States, 1830-1850 (New York, 1935); Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, The Rise of American Civilization (1927; 2 volumes in 1, New York, 1930).. In fact, the Beards participated in this shift with the publication of The American Spirit: A Study of the Idea of Civilization in the United States (New York, 1942). 5 For an early anticipation of this development-from the point of view of intellectual history-see Lawrence Veysey, "Intellectual History and the New Social History," in Paul K. Conkin and John Higham, eds., New Directions in American Intellectual History (Baltimore, Md., 1979), 3-26. See also, in the same volume, David A.

These developments were occurring at a moment when the number of American historians was expanding to an unprecedented degree. Disciplinary expansion both allowed and prompted increased specialization. And that worried some, who began to speak of hyperspecialization and fragmentation. The structure of specialization derived in large part from the impact of a social history that often fused the group-based particularity of focus with ideological commitments to class and identity-based social movements. This pattern of work discouraged the integration of particular histories into some kind of synthesis.8 Traditionalists, perhaps not surprisingly, were unnerved by these develop- ments.9 But even some proponents of the newer history worried. Early on, Herbert G. Gutman, one of the leading figures in the movement to write a history that included all Americans and that recognized differences-class, ethnic, racial, gender-was concerned that instead of enriching and enlarging the usable history of the United States, the new scholarship was failing to do that, perhaps making it in fact less usable. The "new social history," he wrote in the introduction to his collection of pioneering essays in the field, "suffers from a very limiting overspe- cialization." Take an Irish-born Catholic female textile worker and union organizer in Fall River involved in a disorderly strike in 1875. She might be the subject of nearly a dozen sub-specializations, which would, he feared, "wash out the wholeness that is essential to understanding human behavior."10 Later, in the wake of a national meeting of writers at which historians and history seemed to be largely ignored in discussions of the political and cultural situation in the aftermath of Richard Nixon, Gutman mused aloud in the pages of The Nation over whether the failure of historians to incorporate social history's findings into a new synthesis had seriously diminished, even evacuated, history's possible contribution to public debate."1 In the mid-1980s, in what turned out to be a controversial pair of articles, I raised a related question: how might one construct the (to my mind) needed synthesis of recent historiography on the United States.12 There was considerable negative reaction to those articles, coming from two different positions.

These arguments were equated with a carelessness about scholarly rigor.13 The other, and more widespread position, focused on the risks of a national narrative itself. It was evidently feared that such a narrative would, by definition, re-exclude those groups and themes that had so recently been brought under the umbrella of history and would re-inscribe a "master narrative" dominated by white, elite males.14 By the end of the 1980s, however, the question of synthesis had become less controversial. The issue became more practical, more professional in some sense: how to do it and how to do it within the parameters of inclusion that had been central to the discussion from the beginning. It was on this note that Alice Kessler-Harris, the author of the chapter on social history in The New American History (1990 edition), addressed the question. In the last section of her essay, with the section title of "The Problem of Synthesis," she acknowledged the problem and explored various possible ways to overcome "fragmentation" and move toward synthesis.15 A different issue emerged in the 1990s. Poststructuralist literary and cultural theory, sometimes broadly and even more vaguely characterized as postmodernism, was and is suspicious of any aspiration toward a comprehensive narrative. It is to this body of theory that we owe the commonplace use and misuse of the epithet "master narrative."16 These theories have been rather slow to penetrate workaday historical practice among American historians. Levels and types of awareness of them vary: from shocked indignation at the whole idea, to vague awareness and thoughtless dismissal, to intellectual fascination largely in isolation from the making of one's own histories. In his recent book, Beyond the Great Story: History as Text and Discourse (1995), Robert Berkhofer seeks to force more attention to these issues. Insistently, but not always consistently, he urges historians to recognize the dimensions of the postmodern crisis that surrounds them. He seems more interested in sounding the alarm about the quicksand before us than in guiding us [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 13 Eric H.

But either way, he intends to challenge the very possibility of narrative synthesis.17 While these worries, proposals, and polemics were being fashioned, the daily work of historians proceeded. Among the products of that work have been a good number of explicitly synthetic volumes. There is, of course, no clear or settled notion of what defines a work of synthesis. I have used a rather generous definition. Some of the books I am calling synthetic might alternatively be designated as monographs-archivally based but exceptionally ambitious books that tackle big questions and seek to frame a large field or to provide an interpretation for an audience well beyond specialists. Others are more obviously synthetic, relying heavily on secondary literature to establish the state of the art in a broad field for a wide audience, including, often, students and the general public. With this diversity of form, purpose, and audience in mind-as well as a concern for a reasonable distribution of fields and periods-I have, with the help of the editors of the American Historical Review, selected a few recent synthetic works for examina- tion.18 The very existence of these books mutes the question of whether we need synthetic works or whether, under the constraints of present historiographical practice, synthesis is possible. In fact, the seeming proliferation of syntheses at present-and their variousness-suggests that the field of American history is at a formative (or reformative) moment that invites synthesis: the quest for new understandings that has undermined established narratives has now, perhaps, prompted new efforts at crystallizing a very unstable body of historical writing into new syntheses. A different question, however, provides the focus of this essay. What strategies for narrative synthesis are available to historians today? How might we think about the relation between a particular structure of narrative synthesis and the author's purpose or interpretation? How do these different strategies relate to current historiography? What particular work do they do, within the profession and beyond it? And finally I want to ask some questions about the firmness of the boundaries (mostly geographical) that define what is and is not captured in synthetic narratives of U.S. history. These works do not, of course, cover the whole field of synthetic works. More and other books could have been chosen, but these eleven books (and several others mentioned along the way) at least represent different kinds of history, different [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 17 Robert F.

Hine and John Mack Faragher (TheAmerican West). In fact, I have recommended each to non-historians asking for a literate one-volume history of the United States.

Together, the eleven total nearly 6,000 pages of outstanding historical writing. If nothing else, I can conclude that synthetic narrative invites long books. Because I cannot claim special knowledge in any of the fields being synthesized in these books, I do not propose to do the kind of analysis one would find in specialized reviews. Such criticisms that I have will be framed from the position of my interest in synthetic narrative. I say that in part to be honest about my own limitations in appraising these books but also for another, more positive reason. I want to insist that narrative synthesis is a form of knowledge, indeed, a particularly powerful form of creating, not simply summarizing, knowledge. I hope to get past or under the story enough to probe the implications of different modes of structuring a narrative synthesis. The way different narrative strategies construct that knowledge is important. While inclusion is one of the tests our generation will rightly ask of synthesis, there are other important historiographical issues that are embedded in the question of narrative synthesis.19 The more seriously we consider possible narratives of American history, the more we may be prepared to ask questions that press beyond inclusion. We may even be both bold enough and hopeful enough to worry a little about the language of inclusion, if not the principle. Is there perhaps more than a hint of dominant culture noblesse oblige in the language of inclusion? Might not a more sophisticated notion of the temporal and geographical boundaries of American history, including an awareness of the diasporic stories within American history, complicate and enrich the notion of inclusion?20 Can the historical and historiographical terrain be opened a bit more in a way that enables a deeper, denser, and more complex historiographical exploration of justice and difference at the center of American history? Might democracy be the word, the concept, the commitment that will move us in that direction? As I examine the stack of books before me, I propose to keep these issues in mind and to return to them at the end of this essay. JON BUTLER'S Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (2000) covers the whole mainland British colonial space and history, and it addresses a wide range of themes. In fact, themes, not time or chronology, organize his story. His brief, often one-word, chapter titles reveal a very distinctive type of synthesis, one immediately accessible to the reader, whether professional or lay: Peoples, Economy, Politics, Things Material, Things Spiritual. It is a reasonable progression, and in each case he brings together a good deal of material. Although his theme is transformation, Butler also claims (following recent historiography) a more inclusive geography, making more of the middle colonies than would have been the case a generation ago. In some ways, his manner of organizing the material topically bears a relation to [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 19 I do not propose to go into theories of narrative or even my own notions, but I will here indicate that my understanding has been greatly influenced by the work of Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative, Kathleen McLaughlin and David Pellauer, trans., 3 vols. (Chicago, 1984-88). 20 Such thinking is not restricted to specialists in the profession exploring the theme of diaspora. The novelist Russell Banks has recently argued that the focus for a synthesis of American history ought to be the African diaspora. See "The Star-Spangled Novel," Los Angeles Times, July 2, 2000.

If Hofstadter's book was intended to provide a snapshot that would serve as a starting point, Butler's title ("Becoming America") and his stated intentions announce change as his theme. He means to persuade the reader of a broad pattern of transformation that produced a distinctive and modern society in advance of 1776 and that in turn spawned the first modern revolution. Such an argument demands more complex and careful attention to process and cause than his framing of the book seems to allow. While he has surely gathered together a considerable body of material (his notes run to fifty pages), he has not produced a synthetic narrative of change over time, one that sketches a develop- mental sequence that integrates disparate elements in the interest of a causal interpretation. By bounding each unit of synthesis, Butler is stuck with a structural isolation of topics that undercuts narrative explanation. Given that Butler's theme is transformation, this narrative structure is crippling. For reasons related to structure and style of argument, Butler's claims for American modernity are quite vulnerable. While there are doubtless some specific ways in which the British North American colonies became "modern" before independence, they were not uniformly modern-over space or in all aspects of life. Many historians would readily grant numerous anticipations of modernity by the middle of the eighteenth century, but few would insist, with Butler, that so much modernity had been achieved so soon, implying that only a few pre-modern anomalies remained on the eve of revolution.22 Most give a significant role to the revolution.23 But the most serious problem is not with the phenomena he notices or does not notice, even if there is some real unevenness on this point. Rather, it is Butler's teleology of the modern, combined with his exceedingly loose, elusive, and, as is so often said today, undertheorized definition of modernity. Add to this an unneces- sary but apparently irresistible tendency to claim American uniqueness and "firsts" for nearly everything he identifies as modern in America. He names a number of phenomena that he considers evidences of the modern-polyglot, slaves, cities, market economy, refined crafts and trades, religious pluralism, and "sophisticated politics." Without further historical specification and theoretical precision, one can indulge in reductio ad absurdum. With the exception of religious pluralism, all of these qualities probably described Athens in the age of Aristotle at least as well as the British colonies. In fact, I suspect that Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, relying on their recent book The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (2000), would argue that the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 21 Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (New York, 1971). 22 Jon Butler, Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (Cambridge, Mass., 2000), 1. 23 See, for example, Gordon S. Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (New York, 1992). Long before, Bernard Bailyn suggested certain developments that Butler would consider modern had developed in the eighteenth century, but he emphasized the unevenness and even paradoxical character of this proto-modernity.

In the end, however, it is diversity, which he tends to equate with multiculturalism, that for Butler makes Americans modern. But if we look around, we cannot but wonder about his claims for a uniquely polyglot society. This assertion may be quite vulnerable from any sight line approaching a global perspective. Can he fairly claim that New York City harbored a level of diversity "never before gathered together"?25 Might not this be as plausibly said of Constantinople during the period covered by Butler's book? And did not the Ottoman Empire-of which Constantinople was the capital-far exceed the religious and ethnic diversity of the British colonies? My point here is partly one of fact, of care in making comparative statements without comparison. More important, however, are the criteria of the modern. Few, if any, major political bodies in the past half millennium more successfully accommodated diversity than the Ottomans, yet that achievement has never brought them recognition for a precocious modernity. One needs greater defini- tional and descriptive specificity to make the argument he claims. Because of the breadth and generality of synthetic narratives, it is especially important to be clear about key concepts. Similarly, he tends to claim the realization of "Americanness"-here equated with some vague notion of modernity-for events that, however interesting in themselves, hardly sustain his assertion that they designated "the American future."26 For example, writing of the French Huguenots, a group he knows well, he notes their assimilation, and he calls this "American."27 Well, of course it is, but so are the endogenous marriages that continue for various groups well into the twentieth century-sometimes because of racial difference and even legislation (as in the case of African Americans) or out of choice, as in the case of Scandinavians in the upper Midwest. Or to take a more ominous subject, it seems a bit fatalistic to say that colonial encroachment on Indian land "predicted" nineteenth-century relations with the Indians.28 Oddly, such a claim, while taking the moral high ground, nonetheless erases the postcolonial history of the United States by denying contingency and thus diminishing both the capacity and moral responsibility of all later actors or potential actors. The twin and linked teleologies of "modern" and "American" produce a distorting and de-historicizing synthesis. If there is a problem with the sort of synthesis Butler has written, what precisely is it? He makes historical claims about patterns and meanings of development on the basis of a narrative structure that effectively isolates and de-historicizes his themes. By not constructing a developmental narrative that integrates the various themes now separated in distinct chapters, the process and complexity of develop- ment is obscured. While his chapters are full of relevant and interesting details of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 24 Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (Boston, 2000). 25 Butler, Becoming America, 9. 26 Butler, Becoming America, 36. 27 Butler, Becoming America, 22.

In the absence of a narrative of change to explain and interpret, he resorts for a theme to repeated assertions of "modernity." The issue is not so much the claim for an eighteenth-century American modernity-although I am myself drawn to much more complex, nuanced, and contradictory discussions of that theme-as it is the incapacity of the particular model of synthesis he deploys to advance that theme or argument. Philip D. Morgan's Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry (1998) is at once similar to Butler's and quite different. Both focus tightly in each chapter on a particular topic or theme; there is little play among the different themes in both cases. While Butler's themes propose a reorganization of material, thus giving an impression of freshness, Morgan's quite important questions are phrased in well-established ways. While Butler's structure works against his theme of transformation, Morgan's similar structure better fits his goals for the book, partly because transformation plays a smaller role in his analysis than one might expect. Slave Counterpoint addresses nearly all the issues raised by a half century of vigorous scholarship on the beginnings of slavery, the practices of racial slavery as a labor and social system, and the nature of African-American culture in early America. It is a book of enviable learning: with a seeming total command of the historiography and an impressive knowledge of a substantial archival base, Morgan proceeds to pose (or re-pose) difficult historiographical issues. Again and again, he offers compelling answers. Want to know what scholarship has disclosed about slavery and African-American culture in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and Lowcountry? Look to Morgan's synthesis of a generation of scholarship. To have done that is to have done a great deal, and he has done it magnificently. Yet one gets the sense of a summary volume, a volume driven by the past, by past questions. Synthesis can either cap a phase of scholarship or initiate another. I think Morgan's book falls into the former category, while Ira Berlin's new book, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (1998), which also relies on a generation of scholarship and addresses many of the same issues, has the potential to become a new starting point. Berlin has captured the shift to an Atlantic perspective that has increasingly characterized scholarship by early modern Europeanists, Africanists, Latin Americanists, and historians of British North America. In this sense, his work, at least the early parts that sketch out and populate the Atlantic littoral, points forward.29 In a dramatic opening section, Berlin, relying more on secondary literatures than does Morgan, locates his story in very broad understandings of time (periodization) and space (the Atlantic world), the dimensions of which are shadowy, almost invisible, in Morgan's account. He locates Africans in an Atlantic history connecting four continents and in a rich and growing historiography reaching out from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and North America.30 One [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 29 Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (Cambridge, Mass., 1998). 30 Berlin's powerful evocation of the Atlantic builds on many predecessors. At minimum, mention should be made of Philip D. Curtin's The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census (Madison, Wis., 1969); and The AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 138 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] wishes Berlin had sustained this perspective in the later sections. But even if he narrows the story to the territory that later became the United States and loses the multiple histories implied by his portrait of the Atlantic world, the beginnings of stories, whether novels or histories, are heavy with intention and implication that can, I hope, be built upon.31 In fact, the four Atlantic continents remain an always changing aspect of American and African histories. Attending to, or at least recognizing, that larger and continuing extended terrain of American history would enrich the story of the making of African Americans and America, a historiography that is at present too much captured by an implicit and too simple assimilation or "Americanization" model. Nonetheless, Berlin has provided a powerful image of the creation of the Atlantic world and of the origin of modern slavery within it. Morgan has a quite different strategy. His domain is not the Atlantic but the South, or two regions of the South, which he is anxious to reveal as differentiated. Thus his is a comparative history, comparing two regions within the South. Suggesting a certain scientific aspiration, he refers to his delimited space as a kind of laboratory, a site for an "indirect experiment."32 This approach offers him much. He is able to focus tightly on his questions and generally achieves sharply phrased answers. Yet, like any good scientific laboratory, his field of inquiry is almost hermetically sealed. A two-hundred-page part of the book titled "The Black World" begins with a fifteen-page section on "Africans." Yet it is in only one paragraph at the beginning and a few other scattered references that one reads anything about Africa. His story rarely strays east (or south or north or west) of the Maryland/ Virginia and South Carolina boundaries. His comparative method has impressive rigor. Yet one senses that not only does his approach trap him within a particular place, he is also caught within a very confining net woven from the existing historiography. As Walter Johnson pointed out in a review of the book in this journal, his questions are smaller than the stories he has unearthed.33 Much like another important book on African-American history, Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom (1976), this book, for all its synthetic aspirations, cannot capture some of its best material within the tightly bounded historiographical questions and issues that frame it.34 As in the case of Berlin's book, Morgan's is quite explicit about time and space. There is a well-thought-out chronology of change, and one of his major arguments is that the South, and thus the black as well as white experience, was not uniform over space. He shows real and important distinctions between the experience of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex (New York, 1990; 2d edn., 1998); and John K.

Yet by treating both the temporal and spatial aspects of the story as sites (and very limited ones) rather than as processes of historical making, he weakens the capacity of his local analyses to explain change over time and, to a lesser extent, space. His major explanatory claims appear in the introduction. They are not only brief but also separate from the rich stories he tells and the analyses he makes of historiographical questions.35 The expansiveness of Many Thousands Gone, by contrast, evokes a strong sense of change, of process. It achieves a narrative synthesis of the movement of Africans onto the Atlantic and into the Western hemisphere. The difference between this approach and the tightly controlled analysis crafted by Morgan is striking. Like Morgan's, Michael Schudson's book, The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life (1998), is organized around fairly established questions- especially one big question. Has American civic life deteriorated over the course of the past three centuries? Naturally, the question is of a different order than those driving Morgan's analysis. It has not been generated by disciplinary scholarship. It arose out of American public life. Schudson thus draws on history and other disciplines to address directly a public question, one endlessly repeated today and, as he shows, in the past. Schudson himself, we should note, is not a historian. He was trained as a sociologist, and he teaches in a Department of Communication. While he reveals an impressive command of the relevant historiography, historians are not his primary reference group or audience.36 Although I am sure specialists will find some of his formulations to be of considerable historiographical significance and likely to encourage new lines of research, his intention, again, is different: his audience is a general one, and he seeks to bring historical knowledge to bear on a civic issue. What he is doing points toward the most important work that one kind of successful narrative synthesis can do, for the profession and for the public. By openly declaring his address to a public issue and for a public audience, Schudson participates in a very important tradition of historical writing. Some of the very best professional historians of the United States in this century have done precisely that: Frederick Jackson Turner, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles Beard, and Richard Hofstadter all focused on issues, worries, or preoccupations of fairly general interest to write synthetic works that importantly rephrased fundamental themes in American history. This mutual enrichment of public and professional discourse is perhaps the ideal cultural work of narrative synthesis. Let us hope that historians can do this more often and more effectively. Yet as I make this point, I realize that all of the historians just named, including Schudson himself, were either trained as social scientists or did not recognize a significant boundary between history and the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 35Morgan, Slave Counterpoint, xv-xxiv. I should note that my concerns about boundary setting in Morgan's book do not apply nearly so much to Philip D. Morgan, "The Black Experience in the British Empire, 1680-1810," in The Oxford History of the British Empire, Vol. 2: The Eighteenth Century, P. J. Marshall, ed. (Oxford, 1998), 465-86. 36 This command is at once impressive and sometimes puzzling. In discussing the Founding and the Constitution, he does not mention Gordon Wood's The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1969). Nor, in writing about the first decades of the nineteenth century, does he mention either of two key books by Robert H. Wiebe, The Opening of American Society: From the Adoption of the Constitution to the Eve of Disunion (New York, 1984); and Self-Rule: A Cultural History of American Democracy (Chicago, 1995). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 140 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] (other?) once more expansive social sciences. Is this a mere coincidence, or is it an issue to be addressed by the profession? While I would not place Schudson's book in the same class as the scholarship produced by the short list of great historians, he has written a fine book. It is a book about change over time, and he establishes three eras of citizenship and participa- tion, each clearly defined. He does not devote much attention to how each configuration changes into the next, but he effectively characterizes their differ- ences, even in some very brief summaries, as in the following paragraph from early in the book: Another way to characterize the past three hundred years of political change is to say that the type of authority by which society is governed shifted from personal authority (gentlemen) to interpersonal authority (parties, coalitions, and majorities), to impersonal authority (science, expertise, legal rights, and information) ... The geographical center of politics has shifted from the countryside to the cities to the suburbs and perhaps, today, to "technoburbs," "postsuburbs," or "edge cities," or whatever we name our newer habitations. Correspondingly, the kind of knowledge a good citizen requires has changed: in an age of gentlemen, the citizen's relatively rare entrances into public discussion or controversy could be guided by his knowledge of social position; in the era of rule by majorities, the citizen's voting could be led by the enthusiasm and rhetoric of parties and their most active partisans; in the era of expertise and bureaucracies, the citizens had increasingly to learn to trust their own canvass of newspapers, interest groups, parties, and other sources of knowledge, only occasionally supported by the immediacy of human contact; and in the emerging age of rights, citizens learn to catalog what entitlements they may have and what forms of victimization they may knowingly or unknowingly have experienced.37 This paragraph reveals the argument and the narrative strategy that Schudson uses to undercut the widespread notion of civic decline: rather than a story of decline, it is one of restructuring, one that recalibrates citizenship and civic practice in relation to changing values and social experiences. What some, including me, see as the erosion of our public life and the thinning of American political culture, he presents as a complex rearticulation of expectations and institutions. Whether one fully agrees with Schudson or not, the book and the point of view it ingeniously argues constitutes an important contribution of contemporary civic life. And a narrative strategy of restructuring (as opposed to the usual rise or fall scenarios) deserves a place in the historian's menu of narrative types. "Presentist" purposes may, however, carry the danger of anachronistic readings. Schudson is vulnerable on this score, especially in his consideration of the colonial period. He too easily asks how democratic any phase of political life was. A commitment to explore the fate of democracy in our past-something I endorse- surely includes recognizing when democracy is not an available concept. He might better have asked how the legitimation and exercise of power worked. Indeed, such a deeper historicism would complement his anti-anti-Whig approach. Similarly, while a then-and-now binary invites sometimes interesting questions and offers some illumination of past and present, it also invites problems. Again, one sees this risk in Schudson's work. False categories of judgment are explicitly or implicitly brought to bear.

Voters then were expected to have "local knowledge-not of laws or principles, but of men."38 The binary obscures the role of principles in the past and knowledge of men in the present. Most important of all, it diverts our attention from the principles that it was thought would aid voters in judging character.39 Sometimes, by focusing so much on the party system that we worry about today, he overlooks those important issues that eluded the parties or that parties avoided. Substantive issues-the reason citizenship and civic life are important-are marginalized in his account of the different concepts and patterns of public life. The result, whether intended or not, is a form of consensus history.40 "Progress or decline is not the real question," Schudson concludes.41 He converts that question into one of restructuring that points to his core argument: there must be a fit between forms of citizenship and forms of everyday life, between values and institutions, between aspirations and commitments. It is that historically informed understanding that allows him in his conclusion to speculate in quite promising ways about an evolving pattern of citizenship that may yet serve our collective hopes and needs. Still, his conclusion leaves me uneasy. Like the journalistic coverage of politics today, the substance of political conflict is subordinated to discussion of the "health" of the system, of the institutions and practices. By contrast, the tensions, conflicts, and substantive issues that made politics so important in the development of the United States and in the lives of individuals are at the center of Eric Foner's The Story of American Freedom (1998). Foner's book has an uncanny resemblance to one that at first glance might seem utterly unrelated: Richard Hofstadter's The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It.42 Of course, Foner inverts the point Hofstadter sought to make. If Hofstadter famously played down conflict and (less remarked upon) paid little attention to the social making of political ideologies, Foner emphasizes conflict and the changing historical construction and reconstruction of the idea and ideology of freedom. Foner's work is much more explicitly sensitive to social history, even if it parallels Hofstadter's in its interest in ideology and the limits and possibilities of American political culture. While Hofstadter was alternately comic and ironic, bitterly so at times, in The American Political Tradition, Foner's Story of American Freedom is strikingly fair and straightforward. Yet the underlying hope is similar. As James Oakes has perceptively noted, Foner's narrative is undergirded by an unstated but firm liberal ideal of freedom- one that at once shares in an Enlightenment universalism and [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 38 Schudson, Good Citizen, 81. 39 See Joyce Appleby, Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans (Cambridge, Mass., 2000). 40 See, for example, his summary judgment of the party system at Schudson, Good Citizen, 132.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 142 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] accommodates current concerns for inclusion and regard for difference.43 I would even argue that Hofstadter's own liberal position was closer to Foner's than one might at first suspect. Both appraised American political culture and its prospects from the position of a richer, more textured liberalism than we usually recognize in current debates.44 In thinking about the core issue in Foner's narrative, therefore, it seems fair to consider it to be the quest for a democratic liberalism, insisting on the relevance and indispensability of the modifier inserted before liberalism. One might thus characterize Foner's as a democratic synthesis, which, as I suggested above, offers a stronger and more egalitarian standard of judgment than commonplace invoca- tions of inclusion. It offers as well the implication of voice and empowerment. To Foner, as he indicates in his introduction, "abstract definitions" of freedom are not the focus. His concern is "with the debates and struggles through which freedom acquires concrete meanings, and how understandings of freedom are shaped by, and in turn help to shape, social movements and political and economic events."45 The result is a narrative that is at once focused yet always open to an examination of larger issues, structures, and events that intersect with and often drive his story. It is a dynamic story, filled with actors, with agents making freedom and using freedom. He selects key events or controversies of different eras, events that are widely contested (slavery, labor and property, the role of the state, social movements). Of course, coverage is selective; the gain is the richness deriving from a series of concentrated focal points. In each case, he examines the conflict, the parties contending, and the stakes. He does not hesitate to declare justices and injustices, to name winners and losers, and he does so from a consistently democratic perspective. Foner thus achieves inclusion without the dilution conse- quent with the faux openness characteristic of talk radio and without the postmod- ern hesitations that undermine moral judgment.46 The American West: A New Interpretive History (2000) by Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher spans the whole of American history, from "the European invasion" until the present.47 The book is written in the spirit of Frederick Jackson Turner. Instead of lamenting the ambiguity of Turner's conception of the frontier, which after Turner got reduced by rigorous historians to a place, the West, Hine and Faragher embrace its fullness.

That openness allows them to tell the history of the United States as a story of successive frontiers, including a fascinating rethinking of American regionalism as urban-centered at the end of the twentieth century.48 In fact, the chapter on the postwar era is a tour de force-imaginative, original, and quite compelling. In Turnerian fashion, they argue that "westering defined America's unique heritage."49 To a very impressive degree, they give substance to this claim, but recent historiography makes that claim, even for western history, problematic. As Hine and Faragher show, in the nineteenth century as well as today, the West (and the United States) was formed by migrations from west to east and south to north, and even in a limited way north to south, as well as east to west. The notion of westering is so strong in American and European history and culture, it is difficult to construct an alternative narrative structure, though no less important for the difficulty.50 This worry does not, however, undercut another summary point they make: the "frontier is our common past."51 The book is grounded in social history. Of all the books under consideration here, The American West is probably the most sensitive to the categories of experience and groups previously excluded from mainstream narratives of Ameri- can history. Their work goes well beyond mere representation of such groups and categories; previously invisible groups, whether Native Americans, migrating women, African-American settlers, working people, or the people of the border- lands, are actors who contributed to the shaping of history. But there are limits to this achievement. While there are multiple positions and voices represented in their narrative, only rarely does their narrative bring the reader inside group life. There is not much inquiry into the interior experience and subjective meanings shared by the various groups identified and recognized.52 While the story could have been situated in a wider context, one that revealed the global reach of the empires or, later, the importance of global markets, in its particular geographical focus the book consistently avoids privileging the English line of settlement. Other settler efforts are considered and sometimes compared. As is often the case with synthetic histories, however, there is a tendency to do the work of inclusion at a particular moment, and then lose the group at issue.

At times, the transnational themes they develop are extremely illuminating. They refer to what would later be characterized by theorists of the global cities as a "dual economy" in describing the role of foreign migrants, especially Chinese, in the nineteenth-century California agricultural economy.53 Likewise the interplay of national and international in their discussion of the Zimmerman telegram inviting Mexico to ally with Germany in World War I and in their discussion of San Francisco's "commercial hinterland."54 But, as in the case of Butler's book, there is a bit of parochialism in making claims of distinction. Perhaps such assertions can be demonstrated, but more rigorous definitions and empirical research than we have here are required to establish, for example, that the United States is today the world's most multicultural society.55 How would it compare with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, whose citizens speak more than 100 languages and live on almost numberless islands? The social-history approach, whatever its success in representing difference, has in this instance under-represented national political institutions and policies. The development of the West, as Richard White and other historians of the West have pointed out, was profoundly indebted to what western Republicans now call "big government," for water, transportation, Indian removal, and, more recently, direct investment, as in defense contracts and installations and aerospace industries.56 The political economy and the role of markets, as has already been suggested, do not get the attention they deserve. We often overlook how much industry was in the West, and how much western industries-from milling and meatpacking to mining-were integral to the industrial system of the United States. And we forget how much the astonishing productivity of western agriculture enabled the formation of a large urban industrial labor supply. More of these dimensions of western history might have been included if only in the interest in enabling the story better to tell the national experience. If Hine and Faragher encompass both the full geographical and temporal dimensions of western history, Linda Gordon's microhistory builds out from a very delimited western space, the Sonoran highlands of Arizona, to develop a highly innovative narrative synthesis that locates itself at the various and causally interrelated scales of town, region, nation, and the transnational. Her work reminds us that there is a difference between a mere local study and a microhistory. The local histories of villages, towns, and cities, so common in the 1970s, tended to use global concepts but within artificially bounded fields of inquiry. One of the most famous of them all, Kenneth Lockridge's study of Dedham, Massachusetts, offered an isolated inwardness as a principal finding, although it was a finding that derived [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 53Hine and Faragher, American West, 358-60. 54 Hine and Faragher, American West, 395-97, 414.

Mostly, her account is the story of the arrival and fate of Catholic orphans from New York who were to be placed in Catholic homes. The homes were Mexican as well as Catholic, and that was the problem and the focus of conflict. The conflict played out along class, ethnic, religious, and gender lines, and it eventually reached the Supreme Court. It is a compelling and very human narrative, but one that also addresses a whole range of analytical and interpretive issues of broader interest to historians. Bringing the issues of gender, class, and race into relation with each other allows for an appraisal of their relative importance in this particular historical explanation. I think that her story reveals class to be more important than her conclusion argues, but the real point to be made is that only a narrative synthesis that brings diverse threads together will enable the historian and the reader to make this kind of judgment. These complex ends are achieved in part by her adoption of an imaginative literary strategy. Gordon's book is constructed of two types of chapters. One is quite often a broad frame for local events. In these chapters, her perspective as narrator is exterior to the action. The issues addressed are frequently structural and, as often as not, extend beyond the community. Here, one gets an analytical explanation of the relation of local experience to larger national and international cultural, political, and economic developments. Between these chapters, she has crafted others that get inside the culture of the community, providing wonderfully rich, thick descriptions of daily life and the development of the conflict. With oral histories as well as fragmentary documentary evidence, she brings the reader very close to the experience and voices of the community. The play between these accounts and the more conventional chapters produces an unusual but powerful synthesis. Whether a microhistory qualifies as a synthesis, even by my generous definition, may be debated. But the singular relevance of this book for the discussion of synthesis concerns not scale but its literary ambition, the literary experiment that gives structure to the book. Those who would write other syntheses-at various scales-will, I hope, be encouraged, even inspired, to experiment with novel narrative strategies in the interest of more powerful representations of the past. Quintard Taylor presents a third version of western history, In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West, 1528-1990 (1998). He offers a broad synthetic account that characterizes the experiences of African Americans over a very long period of time.

Drawing on a substantial body of scholarship, most of it published in the past quarter century, he aims to "reconstruct the history of African American women and men" in the West over five centuries, although mostly his focus is the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Taylor's central themes are the quest for community by blacks and the relative degrees of freedom and opportunity they find in different times and places. The conjuncture of the map of African-American presence and the conventional history of the West that his story brings out compels rethinking of both African-American and western history. He makes the point, for example, that the issue of Texas independence in 1836 was not simply, as myth, even the more recent multicultural version, would have it: Anglos and Tejanos in Texas confronting a despotic government in Mexico. It was also an Anglo effort to preserve slavery.60 More broadly, the map literally reveals that African Americans in the West were overwhelmingly city and town dwellers, and it is that fact that unifies their experience. The kind of synthetic narrative that he has constructed provides an invaluable service at a particular moment, crystallizing a generation of scholarship, making generalization possible. His work not only informs the public of the dimensions of previously unrecognized histories, it also provides a base for the next generation of scholarship. In a similar way, another recent synthesis, one that focuses on a more narrowly defined but also more developed area of scholarship, reveals the harvest of recent scholarship on work and workers. American Work: Four Centuries of Black and Vhite Labor (1998) by Jacqueline Jones at once brings this rich scholarship to a wider audience and proffers a fresh way of framing the field.61 If The American West, In Search of the Racial Frontier, and American Work cover very long chronological spans, books by David M. Kennedy and Fred Anderson address short periods. Their focus is also quite different, since both concentrate on political and military history. Kennedy's Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945 (1999) addresses what might well be called "high politics," while Anderson's The Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 (2000) brings social history and high politics into fruitful play, finding in that interaction the terms of his central argument about the nature of power in the British Empire. At the outset, both books locate their stories in a broad international context. Kennedy's book begins at the close of World War I, and the first character introduced is Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler, who was in a military hospital recovering from a poison gas attack when he heard the news of Germany's surrender.

The geography of Washington, D.C., even that of the White House, and the biographies of three men-Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Hitler-are more important to Kennedy's story than the world beyond the borders of the United States or, for that matter, than the American people of his subtitle. One of Kennedy's aims is evidently to urge upon Americans a greater attention to and sense of responsibility in the larger world, yet with the exception of the excellent discussion of the differing explanations of the economic crisis offered by Herbert Hoover and Roosevelt, there is surprisingly little incorporation of inter- national elements into the dynamic of the story. For all the importance of the larger world, for Kennedy, as for many Americans, whether professional historians or not, the international is a sort of "other," something "over there," if I may reverse the title of one of Kennedy's earlier books.62 Kennedy- also pays little attention to social history, not even to social histories that have sought to better explain the politics of the interwar years.63 Nor does the book address intellectual history, the history of science and technology (except briefly in connection with war production), the states, education, urban history, and much more. In fact, the book would have been more accurately described by the title of William E. Leuchtenburg's classic, F.D.R. and the New Deal, 1932-1940, which is here superseded and extended into the war years.64 So titled, adding the war to the New Deal, one could have no objection to this extraordinarily well-written, deeply researched, and compellingly argued book. But is it a history of "the American people"? Freedom from Fear is a masterful narrative on the terms it has assumed for itself. Yet having said that, historiographical questions remain. Kennedy apparently assumes that three voices are the important ones; not many other voices are heard, even though each of a small clutch of additional figures is presented very effectively as a full human being: Lorena Hickok, Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Raymond Moley, Herbert Hoover, John L. Lewis, and A. Philip Randolph, among a few others. History for Kennedy, unlike for the other authors of these syntheses, is made by select leaders, not by ordinary people. What is remarkable, therefore, is the illusion of synthesis that is achieved. The book was published in a series that promises narrative syntheses of the defining periods of American national history. Most so far published accept traditional definitions of periods, and they are framed as political history, but none is so severely restricted as this one, which won the Pulitzer Prize in part because it was recognized as a work of grand synthesis. Dramatic changes in the historiography of the American field make it seem anachronistic. Yet its success makes the point that political history in the grand [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 62 David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (New York, 1980).

Fred Anderson's Crucible of War again engages us with the question of elites and ordinary people, and it provides -a promising approach. While Kennedy seems quite confident of the importance of a few leaders, Anderson seems to be ambivalent, and that ambivalence enriches his history. Although I think the principal contribution of Crucible of War to our understanding of the British Empire is grounded in the social history of the political and military experience of ordinary Americans, the dramatic focus, as with Francis Parkman's great nineteenth-century narrative, is on two great leaders of the French and Indian War, the marquis de Montcalm and James Wolfe.65 Yet, as Alan Taylor has insightfully insisted, Anderson has rewritten the story of their confrontation in a way that diminishes these actors, especially Wolfe.66 To be sure, Anderson's book goes beyond Parkman in its respect for Native Americans, their agency, and their role in the empire (and the role of the empire and war for them). He also modifies Parkman on a point that is central to the book's contribution to imperial history: unlike Parkman, Anderson not only notices but makes much of the division between English colonials and English metropolitans. These differences in expectation and experience make the war in his view a "theatre of intercultural interaction."67 Like Butler, Anderson seeks to diminish the role of 1776 in understanding the development of what became the United States. Historians, he argues, will better understand the creation of the United States by closely examining the Seven Years' War and, more generally, by challenging the usual tendency to "take as our point of reference the thirteen rebelling colonies, not the empire as a whole."68 Yet, even as he argues the importance of getting behind the Revolution of 1776 so that one can discover the eighteenth century as it was experienced, the revolution remains a touchstone for him. More than anything else, he wants the reader to recognize that the shots fired in the Seven Years' War were the ones with implications around the world. But he keeps de-historicizing his story to use it to diminish the shot of lesser implication (in his view) heard 'round the world in 1775. When one begins the book, there is a sense of excitement. Here is a history of the United States ready to take the globe as its context. Before the narrative even begins, the reader is presented with a portfolio of maps. Only two of eight describe the British colonies; no more than four of them consider North America at all. The portfolio begins with a world map, revealing the global distribution of the battles that marked the Seven Years' War. There are also maps of the Indian subcontinent, Central Europe, and the Caribbean. The introduction promises a book that will make the world, or at least the full extent of the British Empire, its context and subject. We are told that "if viewed from Montreal or Vincennes, St. Augustine, Havana, Paris or Madrid-or, for that matter Calcutta or Berlin-the Seven Years' War was far more significant than the War of American Independence."69 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 65 Francis Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe, 6th edn., 2 vols.

We get very little of Asia (although Manila makes a brief but important comparative appearance), the Caribbean, Africa, and continental Europe. Of course, other European powers are part of the narrative, but they only have walk-on roles. We learn little of them at home or about the ways leaders or ordinary citizens interpret events, while we are, by contrast, led through elaborate accounts of high British politics. The preface, presumably written last, sketches an extraordinary agenda for what would be a stunning book. Unfortunately, Anderson did not write the book he there described. Still, judged in terms of what it did rather than what it proposed to do, it is an outstanding work of craft. It will no doubt be our generation's account of the Seven Years' War. As military history, it is superb, and it contributes importantly-but not so grandly as some of the opening rhetoric promises-to the non-controversial but still unclear issue of the causal relations that connect the Seven Years' War to the coming of the revolution. Anderson in fact offers a rich Anglo-centric narrative that explores and explains the different meaning of the war both as strategic event and as experience for the British of the metropole and in the colonies. It is written with verve and confidence-and a seemingly complete command of the materials, primary and secondary. One of its themes is the misperception of events by political elites; with the exception of William Pitt, surely Anderson's hero in this story, they fail to understand the different meaning of the war and empire for ordinary soldiers and colonial subjects. He thus makes cultural issues the heart of the book. Military and political elites play a dramatic role in the narrative, but causation for Anderson- and here he points to important newer developments in military and diplomatic history-is to be found in the culture of everyday life.70 In making this point, he not only offers an important interpretation of the war (building in part on his previous book on Massachusetts soldiers), he also reveals the empire to be less solid, more a matter of continuous negotiation, than historians often consider such entities, whether empires or nations or states.71 MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN ANDERSON, Ira Berlin, referring to the earliest history of Afro-European North America, and Daniel T. Rodgers, addressing the early twentieth century, incorporate the Atlantic, or at least the North Atlantic, into their narratives of American history. Berlin and Rodgers write very different kinds of history and focus on different periods. Berlin's is a social history, while Rodgers has written an intellectual history, or, perhaps, a history of political culture. Yet both Berlin and Rodgers recognize the complex webs that route movements-of people, of ideas, of money, of things-in the Atlantic world. The transnational terrains that Berlin and Rodgers evoke establish larger and truer frames for national histories than do notions of bounded and self-contained regions or nations. The first section of Berlin's Many Thousands Gone, a portrait of the Atlantic littoral, describes a world framed by cities and the sea, little divided by national [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 70 Anderson, Crucible of War, 453-54. 71 See Fred Anderson, A Peoples' Army: Massachusetts Soldiers and Society in the Seven Years' War (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1984).

Berlin's opening tableau describes the emergence of the Atlantic world as an ever- expanding historical terrain, where the African presence is pervasive on the sea and in the cities, including Lisbon, where they made up 10 percent of the population in the sixteenth century. He evokes a world defined by a network of cosmopolitan cities populated by creolized peoples. African people were not only omnipresent, they were often crucial cultural and economic brokers, helping to knit this new world together. Berlin lets go of this powerful frame and image in his later chapters, where he narrows the focus to regional difference within the bounds of British North America. Still, the book's protean beginning remains in the reader's mind, inviting others to realize its narrative logic and moral meaning.72 In Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (1998), Daniel T. Rodgers also achieves a richer historicism by expanding the space of analysis. One small indication is in the subtitle. He refers to "social politics," not the more usual "welfare state." His approach, examining relations in space as well as over time as fields of contingency, makes the welfare state a problematic common term. When he uses the more general and more mobile term "social politics," he effectively historicizes the concept, lineage, and practice of the welfare state. The development of a social politics has other possible paths and outcomes besides evolution into the national welfare state.73 The national welfare state thus becomes a historically and place-specific invention rather than a universal or, worse, the teleological endpoint of American liberal narratives-an endpoint surely upended by the politics of the last quarter of the twentieth century. Following the pioneering work of James T. Kloppenberg, who also assumed a Euro-American context for progressivism and social democracy, Rodgers ap- proaches this age of reform as at once a transnational and national issue.74 A variety of reforms-from urban planning to social insurance to regulation of capitalism- are examined as products both of general, transnational ideas and of particular, national political cultures. The complex narratives thus developed by Rodgers and Kloppenberg-ones that recognize, especially in the case of Rodgers, the historicity of the balance between national and transnational-are a major advance in the narrative synthesis of a national history. Both Rodgers and Kloppenberg impress on the reader that ideas could cross the Atlantic in either direction. This is salutary; American intellectual history is too often thought by Europeans and Americans as well to be either insignificant or derivative, not quite up to equal participation in an international world of ideas. This common point is handled differently in each book. While Kloppenberg notes [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 72 One hopes this extension of the historiographical terrain will continue and that connections as well as comparisons will be made between the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic and between the Atlantic slave trade and the slave trade that turned to the east, to the Muslim empires of the Mediterranean and today's Middle East. Big as it is, the Atlantic does not capture the logic and dimensions of slavery in this era. 73 See, for example, the argument (somewhat dependent on Rodgers's work) in Thomas Bender, "Cities, Intellectuals, and Citizenship in the United States: The 1890s and 1990s," Citizenship Studies 3 (1999): 203-20. 74 Daniel T.

Rodgers, by contrast, focuses on the specific transit of ideas and emphasizes the way intellectuals and reformers on either side of the Atlantic drew selectively on these ideas, depending on personal taste and local circumstance. The result is a fundamental and valuable reorientation of the way we might understand intellectual history. The conceptual opening they have created invites a yet more radical under- standing of the territory and movement of ideas. Let me go back to the title of Rodgers's book. I think that "Atlantic Crossings" projects too narrow an under- standing of the implications of the book. It emphasizes the movement of people and ideas back and forth across the Atlantic. To that extent, it recalls a much older Anglo-American historiography of "trans-Atlantic influences."75 Rodgers goes well beyond this historiography in showing that, in important respects, Europe was partly Americanized and the United States was partly Europeanized by the phenomena he describes. But his really important accomplishment is to get away from the "influence" model, to displace the linear A to B notion of intellectual history. But he could have gone farther yet. There is more to the circulation of ideas than this framing recognizes. It is more than an Atlantic crossing, more than a link between Western Europe and the United States. The whole Atlantic, South Atlantic as well as North Atlantic, and, indeed, increasingly, parts of the Pacific world better describe the extent of the intellectual network his book evokes. In regard to urban development and reform, an important theme in Rodgers's book, it is clear that there is a global conversation at work. Rather than the linearity of steamship crossings (the dustjacket illustration) between the port cities of Western Europe and New York, I imagine a Great Bazaar of urban ideas, technology, and aesthetics hovering over the Atlantic, with many traders and buyers. This exchange is not, of course, symmetrical, and that itself is an issue, but participation was nearly global in 1900. Progressive ideas, especially those dealing with urban reform and technologies, traveled through many circuits and with different voltage, but nearly the whole world was connected, not only Western Europe and the United States. Simply look at the cities of Eastern Europe, Latin America, parts of Africa, Central and East Asia. Surely, they were part of an international conception of urbanism-and of urban commercial culture. The remnants of the era make it clear that New York and Chicago, no less than Lyons, Cairo, Buenos Aires, or Shanghai, were local instances of a global process of city-making. THESE LAST COMMENTS SUGGEST what I take to be the next challenge of narrative synthesis. But before I conclude, let me briefly review what has been accomplished by the cohort of synthetic histories considered here. These books reveal, even verify, the capacity of narrative synthesis to achieve inclusion and to respect issues of identity. Moreover, it seems possible in synthetic narratives to combine structure [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 75 See Frank Thistlethwaite, The Anglo-American Connection in the Early Nineteenth Century (Philadelphia, 1959).

The volumes here examined reveal many narrative strategies and quite different relations to a wider reading public. There is no single model, and no one volume (yet) does all the things we might fairly expect in a realized synthesis. In addition, these books, both in what they do and do not do, suggest to me the value of embracing a narrative core that is a more explicit and deeper exploration of democracy and difference, freedom and empowerment, contest and justice. Such a focus promises a sharper analytical history, one more historical and less susceptible to teleology, whether of modernity or anything else. It seems plausible to propose that a wider canvas, a supranational context, may in fact enhance the examination of these issues. The work of Hine and Faragher, Berlin, Gordon, and Rodgers in particular enables one to imagine an even more radical synthesis of national history, one that operates on multiple geographical scales, from narratives smaller than the nation to supra-national ones-thus identifying the nation as a product of history as well as an object of historical inquiry. Such a framing of national history will increase awareness of the complexity of the multiple axes of historical interaction, causation, and identity formation. While I mean these concluding comments to suggest an ambitious new agenda for the discipline, we must not overlook an already existing and compelling example. Decades ago, David Brion Davis embarked on a multivolume history that considered all these issues. He brought them together in his majestic synthesis that explores slavery and freedom in the Atlantic world, a history of nearly global reach that is also-and I emphasize this fact-a history of the United States.76 My point, then, is that such histories can be written, have been written, and I trust that more will yet be written. The present moment seems especially propitious for such histories. The relation of the nation to both subnational and transnational solidarities is very much in question. It is a public concern as well as an object of interdisciplinary scholarly inquiry. Historians surely have an open invitation to rethink the boundaries of national histories.77 Colonial historians have been moving in this direction for some time, redefining their field as the Atlantic world long before the globalization talk. Likewise, Rodgers and Ian Tyrrell, both of whom work on the modern period, moved in this direction fairly early and for a different reason: their concern about the claims of American exceptionalism.78 With these various concerns at work, we may fairly expect a movement of American historians and other historians as well toward a wider sense of their fields. National histories will not be so firmly bounded, and the assumption of their national autarky will be softened by the recognition that national histories are [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 76 David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (Ithaca, N.Y., 1966); The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823 (Ithaca, 1975), with the final installment yet to come. 77 See Bender, Rethinking American History in a Global Age; and Thomas Bender, The La Pietra Report (Bloomington, Ind., 2000), also available on the World Wide Web at www.oah.org/activities/ lapietra/index.html. 78 Ian Tyrrell, "American Exceptionalism in an Age of International History," AHR 96 (October 1991): 1031-55; Daniel T.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M. Larson, "'Capacities and Modes of Thinking': Intellectual Engagements and Subaltern Hegemony in the Early History of Malagasy Christianity," AHR 102 (October 1997): 969-1002; Richard Elphick and Rodney Davenport, eds., Christianity in South Africa: A Political, Social, and Cultural History (Berkeley, Calif., 1997); and many other works discussed in David Chidester, Judy Tobler, and Darrel Wratten, Christianity in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography (Westport, Conn., 1997). The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86.

This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject. Elizabeth Elbourne, Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (Montreal, 2002). There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76.

Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm).

The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 448 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh a series of rather peripheral white missionaries. Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843. The LMS Directors overturned the dismissal and censured Philip. 37 An interesting point of contrast is provided by Janet Hodgson, "A Battle for Sacred Power: Christian Beginnings among the Xhosa," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree. The lines 38 Terence Ranger, "The Local and the Global in Southern African Religious History," in Hefner, Conversion to Christianity, 65-98. 39 Karel Schoeman, A Thorn Bush That Grows in the Path: The Missionary Career of Ann Hamilton, 1815-1823 (Cape Town, 1995); LMS-SA, 8/3/B: Robert Moffat to LMS, Lattakoo, July 12, 1821.

In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410.

Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work. Taylor is of course a Christian Hegelian, whose view of the emergence of the modern self is certainly influenced by Hegelian dialectics, in however inexplicit a fashion.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Abstract: Excavating Victoriansbrings out very clearly the discomfort the newly discovered vast expanse of geological time gave the Victorians and examines some of the writings that helped shape responses to it. Though the book may not be of particular relevance to the historian focusing closely on Victorian geology or archaeology, for the historian of science who examines wider cultural or literary phenomena it is an important guide to the stimulus that the writings of geologists and archaeologists gave other mid-Victorian writers. Nevertheless, the specialist or narrowly focused historian of science will probably find it frustrating rather than helpful, since the overviews of Victorian geology and archaeology are brief and there are distracting errors, such as the attribution of theNinth Bridgewater Treatiseto William Buckland rather than to Charles Babbage (p. 18). The chapters on Tennyson and Dickens are both interesting and illuminating, although a reader accustomed to historical argument and with limited knowledge of the techniques of literary criticism may find them faintly bewildering in places. Nonetheless, it is in this part of the analysis that the work provides valuable guidance to the historian of science.<br>

Author(s): Mrozik,  Susanne<br>
Abstract: This second, more normative dimension of Mrozik’s project opens up some challenging questions. If it is the case, as she suggests, that a sympathetic reading of the
   Compendium of Trainingcan provide valuable intellectual resources for contemporary ethical reflection, it remains unclear to me how our engagement with this text should proceed, given the significant disparities in cosmological assumptions (e.g., karmic causation and rebirth) and forms of practice that separate Mrozik’s contemporary readers from the text’s original audience. The text, moreover, appears less concerned with advancing particular truth claims than with creating a distinctive kind of religious subjectivity through ascetic and ritualized practice. Can we assess the value of the text’s ethical ideals apart from the forms of discipline and practice with which they were linked in medieval India? IfVirtuous Bodiesleaves such questions open to further exploration and analysis, its nuanced reading of theCompendium of Trainingbrings into sharper focus the centrality of human embodiment in South Asian Buddhist religious discourses and encourages us to reflect deeply on its implications for our own ethical inquiry.<br>

            Theodramatik(Einselden: Johannes, 1980), 3:363–78.

Abstract: It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
            Adaptation—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case thatAdaptation“undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on Film,” inBooks in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship, ed. Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up tosomething, and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average movie we find easier to read. In fact,Adaptationhas only solidified Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.<br>

Abstract: In sum, this is one of the most important books on selves or the practical side of personhood in the last decade. It is also well written; the particular arguments are virtually always clear, and it is not too hard to keep track of their role within in the larger argument of the book. Some portions rise to an almost literary style and provide a rich survey of key ideas in twentieth-century French philosophy, while others engage quite originally with scholarship in moral psychology and theories of self-knowledge that will be more familiar to analytic readers. This work also complements the more detailed ethical theory on Larmore’s other books. Despite its relative inattention to volitional aspects of practical identity, and some questionable moves in the critique of authenticity, then, this work is still highly recommended.<br>

Abstract: In sum: while it has it flaws, this book is one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date surveys of the field of theories of religion around. It is worth the cover price for that alone, which makes it definitely recommendable. Those who want to learn about the current state of theory, especially if they tend in the realist direction, will find this book very useful. Constructivists acquainted with theory will likely find it less so.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: Critchley uses the term in a discussion of Levinas and politics. Noting that government tends to become tyrannical when left to itself, Critchley commends the way Levinas’s ethical ideas can cultivate forms of “dissensual emancipatory praxis” that “work against the consensual idyll of the state, not in order to do away with the state or consensus, but to bring about its endless betterment” (“Five Problems in Levinas’s View of Politics,” 183).<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Abstract: Conventional views of text/music relationships in early Italian opera focus on the imitation of affections. But by dealing exclusively with the referential meanings of texts (e.g., emotions, images, and concepts) these views overlook an important aspect of music's interaction with language. In opera, music also imitates language's contextual and communicative functions—i.e., discourse, as studied today by the subfield of linguistics called pragmatics. In his operas Monteverdi fully realized Peri's ideal of “imitating in song a person speaking” (“imitar col canto chi parla”) by musically emphasizing those context-dependent meanings that emerge especially in ordinary language and that are prominent in dramatic texts, as opposed to poetry and prose. Such meanings are manifest whenever words such as “I,” “here,” and “now” appear— words called “deictics”—with the function of situating the speaker/singer's utterances in a specific time and place. Monteverdi highlights deictics through melodic and rhythmic emphases, repetition, shifts of meter, style, and harmony, as part of a strategy to create a musical language suited to opera as a genre and to singers as actors. In
         Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patriaandL'incoronazione di Poppea, this strategy serves large-scale dramaturgical aims with respect to the relationships among space, time, and character identity, highlighting issues also discussed within the contemporary intellectual context.<br>

Abstract: Review of Robert D. Romanyshyn's The Wounded Researcher: Research with Soul in Mind, New Orleans, Louisiana: Spring Journal Books, 2007. Robert Romanyshyn has written a treatise on the question of understanding that brings together the fields of phenomenology and depth psychology. Following the thought of C. G. Jung, Romanyshyn has presented an archetypal view of the dilemma of psychological research that he sees as a story of loss, mourning, descent, re-search and homecoming expressed in the mythical image of Orpheus. Going deeper into the actual process of psychological research, Romanyshyn looks to the ancient art of alchemy as providing a model of the attitude and action of imagination that most closely suits psychological life.<br>

Abstract: At the heart of this essay is the suggestion that variation can be understood as a vital mode of Mozart's musical thinking, an impulse evident not merely in movements labeled "theme and variation," but in his output as a whole. Accordingly, I begin by sketching a more general theoretical context for the interaction of this variation impulse with the more teleological formal dynamics of sonata.<br>

Abstract: The
         Left Behindnovels by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins have become a major publishing phenomenon in recent years. The novels have succeeded in part because they address the anxieties of their readers, using apocalyptic language to depict a future world in which evildoers are punished, and the faithful reverse the tables on their cultural marginality. The novels, however, also speak to the "here and now," articulating in narrative form the beliefs and actions that place one among either the saved or the damned. The novels accomplish this through the issuance of marks. Both believers and the followers of Antichrist have distinctive marks, which prove less than reliable. At stake, ultimately, is an evangelicalism open to the ambiguity and uncertainty of contemporary life, and a reactive fundamentalism that insists, metaphorically, on the rigidity of marks—a quest for certainty ill-advised in a world characterized by relentless change.*<br>

Abstract: Abstract: Vico's theory of metaphor is best understood as a monster in the tradition of classical rhetorical invention. It is the mutant offspring of metaphor characterized as "necessary" (an "ear" of com, for example) and metaphor characterized in terms of analogy. From the perspective of his method. Vico marries these apparently incompatible forms inherited from Aristotle and thereby identifies a third type of linguistic metaphor. I argue that the metaphor identifies a stipulatory definition taken out of context. In order to situate this claim, I outline Vico's genetic analysis and elaborate in general terms what metaphor and definition share. Most importantly. Vico insists that beings, actions, and events are linguistically identifiedin some particular diseursive context. Indeed, in many cases that context alone determines whether the expression can be called a definition or a metaphor. Like Cicero's ideal jurist, Vico's hero employs motivated words and realizes possibilities available to common sense. Henee Vico's theory of metaphor is both "constructivist"—language has the power to makes things—and "humartist"—it must do so in a form appropriate to history and culture. Vico's theory is consequently important to us because it challenges the proper/figurative distinction championed in the philosophy of language and adds a pragmatic dimension to contemporary views of metaphor at work in literary theory.<br>

Abstract: In the
         Rhetoric, Aristotle identifies "bringing-before-the-eyes" as a capacity that is crucial to metaphors because it allows rhetors to actualize actions immediately before audiences, leading those audiences to insight. Because this description suggests that metaphors activate cognitive mechanisms on the part of their listeners, "bringing-before-the-eyes" has been considered a key element within Aristotle's theory and the nexus of that approach to metaphor and contemporary conceptual ones. Yet, no study has probed these claims to any degree. Accordingly, this paper examines Aristotle's references to "bringing-before-the-eyes" as well as to two associated concerns,energeia/actualization and sense perception. This examination demonstrates that "bringing-before-the-eyes" is not explicitly cognitive but instead a perceptive capacity. In this, Aristotle's theory anticipates recent approaches to language because it allows the audience to participate in the persuasive process at a level that extends its role beyond the traditional Aristotelian understanding that it is the target of emotional appeals.<br>

Abstract: Using data from an ethnographic study of
         tarot divination, occult claims to knowledge are analyzed and interpreted. Attention is focused on theproceduresparties to occult divination employ to claim and sustain what they regard as extraordinary knowledge. This view of occult knowledge stands opposed to efforts to discredit occult claims as unscientific or the result of psychosocial conditions like deprivation and marginality. Like knowledge in general, occult knowledge is a product of sociohistorical influences, interactional negotiation, and interpretation. The challenge for sociology therefore is the pursuit of the social interactional and historical processes whereby knowledge and interpretation are accomplished in everyday life.<br>

Abstract: Many sociologists have tried in vain to find the “true” meaning of the classic works in the discipline. An interactionist perspective suggests that this search is not a valid one for sociologists, especially symbolic interactionists. Although there can be no “true” meaning, some authors use conventions of writing that make their work more
         orless clear. Using Mead'sMind, Self and Societyas an example, we discuss the dimensions of clarity. We then argue that the sociological classics should be read to (I) simulate new theories and research (pragmatic analysis), (2) determine how sociologists have used that classic to support or refute particular theories or perspectives (rhetorical analysis), and (3) provide information about the sociological concerns of the author and his/her contemporaries (historical analysis).<br>

Abstract: There are two ways of reading Goffman--as a theorist of trust and ritual accommodation, that is, as a theorist of the interaction order, or as a theorist of deception. I suggest a way of making these two readings compatible, by arguing that Goffman was interested in what I call the “production of credibility.” Credibility is the quality of being believable, and this quality is integral to both trust and deception. Viewed in this way, Goffman explored the ways in which people make their actions convincing to other people. Although Goffman's analysis of the interaction order did not need a theory of the self, his work actually contains two quite different theories of the self: one linked to role analysis, one to his analysis of mental illness. I argue for the latter at the expense of the former. I conclude that Goffman both initiated substantive work about the interaction order and contributed to a synthesis of a theory of the interaction order and a theory of the self.<br>

Abstract: This article combines a narrative approach on life histories, inspired by Paul Ricoeur, with the symbolic interactionist approaches of George Herbert Mead and Erving Goffman. It focuses on "negotiations" in qualitative interviews with alcoholics, that is, narrative sequences in which the interviewee's line comes into conflict with the line of the interviewer. From a larger study of drinking careers among alcoholics in Copenhagen, two interviews are singled out for a more detailed analysis. The two interviewees did not live up to the (implicit) expectations of the study: the presumptions (a) that persons contacted at institutions for heavily addicted alcoholics do indeed identify themselves as alcoholics and (b) that alcoholics are interested in structuring their life histories according to the development of their drinking problems. By struggling to defend an alternative identity for themselves than the one the interviewer had in readiness for them, the interviewees laid bare the (problematic) therapeutic framework of the study.<br>

Abstract: In this cranky and arrogant chapter I consider several aspects of my use of symbolic interactionist perspectives on my research and thinking. The following are the elements of the chapter: (1) the historical context of my initial encounter with symbolic interactionism (SI); (2) my interpretation of key ideas of SI; (3) its relation to specific research of mine; (4) the relation of other perspectives to my research; and (5) some critiques of SI. I conclude with a truncated discussion of my dissatisfaction with the overtheorizing and overscientizing of sociology. Seeking balance, I end with predictions of a grand and glorious future.<br>

Abstract: Drawing on observation and reflexive introspection, this article analyzes the practice of club DJing and reggae DJing in an attempt to shed light on the semiotic dynamics of music-making. To understand the historical, semiotic, and interactionist significance of the musical beat in the social world of club reggae DJing, empirical and analytical attention is paid to changes in technology, in aesthetic conventions, and in the meanings of subcultural practices.<br>

Abstract: Sociology and neighboring disciplines have produced different analytic tools to examine the dialogical relationship between individuals and society ("narrative work," "identity work," "moral career," "moral breakdown"). However, the question of how individuals negotiate the interpretation of personal experience over their lifetimes in a changing cultural context remains unexplored. This article introduces narrative elasticity as a feature of narrative work and as a time-sensitive analytic tool for conducting inquiries into processes of temporal retraction and expansion of what storytellers conceive as the normal order of significance. The application of this tool to the analysis of mature and elderly Chileans' life stories shows how cultural change occurs at the individual level, considers factors that motivate and inhibit processes of reinterpretation of personal experience, and identifies different levels at which it operates.<br>

Abstract: The study of teachers' personal practical knowledge is an emerging orientation that focuses on the way teachers' understanding of their world affects the way they structure classroom experience and interact with students, parents, colleagues, and administrators. I argue that several recent articles on this topic are developing greatly enriched models of cognition, meaning, understanding, and knowledge. These models emphasize nonpropositional, pre-reflective dimensions of meaning that arise in our spatio-temporal orientations, perceptual interactions, and bodily movements. To take these experiential dimensions seriously requires new models of cognition and thus marks out a new territory for curriculum inquiry.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur and Clifford Geertz have been concerned with the notion of human action as text. This text, like all texts, has manifest and hidden meanings. The hidden meanings indicate a "semantic" function of social activities, in the sense that they provide members of a society with readings of their experience, by telling them about themselves, their values, beliefs, and cultures. Ricoeur's and Geertz's ideas are used to examine the notion of "education as text". Because Ricoeur and Geertz stress hidden meaning, their ideas lead us to an analysis of the "hidden curriculum". The hidden curriculum is a reading of an educational text, normally performed by students. However, as Ricoeur argues, texts can be read by anyone. The question then arises: which sort of hidden curriculum is read not only by the students, but by all members of society? What sort of reading of society's experience is provided when education is a text read by all? I propose the hypothesis that education then becomes a text about society's myths and sacred beliefs.<br>

Abstract: Archaeological periodization constructs narratives with beginnings, middles and ends. But the material culture on which such narratives are built is also involved in narratives according to which past agents lived their lives. According to Ricoeur, such lived narratives are also related to agents' practical experience of time. As archaeologists we have to 'read' past narratives through the rhetoric by which they were expressed. While Hayden White's scheme for temporal cycles of rhetoric is rejected, the sequence of material culture at Sitagroi is examined in order to explore the relationships between the plots written by archacologists and those lived by past agents at the site. Past and present concepts of time are embedded in different narratives and expressed through different rhetorics, but some interaction between the two is possible.<br>

Abstract: History, like a vast river, propels logs, vegetation, rafts, and debris; it is full of live and dead things, some destined for resurrection; it mingles many waters and holds in solution invisible substances stolen from distant soils. Anything may become part of it; that is why it can be an image of the continuity of mankind. And it is also why some of its freight turns up again in the social sciences: they were constructed out of the contents of history in the same way as houses in medieval Rome were made out of stones taken from the Coliseum. But the special sciences based on sorted facts cannot be mistaken for rivers flowing in time and full of persons and events. They are systems fashioned with concepts, numbers, and abstract relations. For history, the reward of eluding method is to escape abstraction. (Barzun 1974, 95)<br>

Abstract: Longterm trends are examined for the population mass that occupied the central highlands of Palestine during the Iron Age. After 1200 B. C. the landscape of this sparsely populated "frontier" changed as newcomers established hilltop villages, cultivated intermontane valleys, and terraced the slopes. Spatial patterning within villages and certain toponyms were influenced by patrilineal kinship. Heads of household and their lineage mates exercised rights over inheritance and succession in landholding. Inequalities developed within "tribal" Israel long before the monarchy, probably through a process of "lineage capture;" and clientship, with its dyadic relationships between superiors and inferiors, became more common. Tensions developed within Israelite society from the interactions of kinship, clientship, and kingship. As the population grew under the monarchy, the highland frontier was effectively closed, and opportunities for acquiring new land diminished. Thus, many unmarried males had to look elsewhere for patrons and positions. From the ranks of these noble "youths" came recruits for the military, the government, and the priesthood.<br>

Abstract: The use of theories of Sanskrit syntax by Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta to explain the action of monistic Śaiva myth and ritual is examined. These thinkers develop a distinctive approach to syntax that reductionistically emphasizes the role of the true Self/Śiva as omnipotent agent, in opposition to the denigration of agency by the majority of Hindu as well as Buddhist philosophies. An analogy to the Indian discussions is seen in the typological effort of Kenneth Burke's "Grammar of Motives," and it is suggested that indigenous theories of action syntax would be a useful focus for comparative research.<br>

Abstract: In a practice environment that unswervingly promotes the systematic tendencies of efficient architectural productivity, to the detriment of architectural creativity, it becomes increasingly important for studio pedagogy to recover and sustain an imaginative engagement with the richness and ambiguity of lived reality. Inhabiting the Chasm is a studio project that attempts to deny the urge to rationalize program and structure and any unchallenged participation in the prevailing apparatus of conventionalized graphic depiction. The project focuses on the simultaneously unfathomable yet familiar reality of two individuals in love. It encourages a perception of the architect as place maker, as interpreter of dynamic human events, and as creator of the settings for the unraveling of dramatic human action.<br>

Abstract: The study of metaphor provides valuable insights into the workings of thought and understanding. This article addresses the important question of what the study of metaphor has to say about the design process and design teaching. We include the findings of a series of studies involving architectural design students who were asked to report on their own design experience and that of colleagues in the context of specific projects. Our conclusions are that (1) there is a close relationship between design and metaphor that provides insights into effective design education; (2) metaphor operates through privilege, directing concern and the identification of difference; and (3) design involves the generation of action within a collaborative environment in which there is the free play of enabling metaphors.<br>

Abstract: The question raised in the title has been much debated by past and present interpreters of Zoroastrianism. In the first two parts of this paper we present some dualistic and monotheistic interpretations of the religion. The interpretations can be labeled as follows: 1. DUALISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks Omnipotence And Omniscience (Dhalla, Henning) 2. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks A Physical Nature (Shaked, Boyce) II. MONOTHEISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The Created Spirits View (Zaehner, Fox, Gershevitch) 2. The Transformationist (Maskhiyya) View 3. The Zurvānite View 4. The View That Good And Evil Are Coeternal Only In A Logical Sense (Moulton, Bode and Nanavutty, Duchesne-Guillemin) We present each of these views and discuss it critically in light of the following criteria: (1) textual evidence; (2) the continuity of the religion throughout its history, including the present time; (3) philosophical cogency; and (4) religious satisfaction. Our conclusion is that each of the above positions, despite its elements of strength, falls seriously short of one or more of these criteria, and hence that there is need for a more adequate interpretation of Zoroastrianism than any of them can offer. Accordingly, we present another interpretation in order to provoke further discussion and, hopefully, to advance the cause of trying to gain a more precise grasp of the teachings of this remarkable religion. In brief, the interpretation we favor is that Zoroastrianism combines cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism in a manner unique to itself among the major religions of the world. This combination results in a religious outlook which cannot be categorized as either straightforward dualism or straightforward monotheism, meaning that the question in the title of this paper poses a false dichotomy. The dichotomy arises, we contend, from a failure to take seriously enough the central role played by time in Zoroastrian theology. Zoroastrianism proclaims a movement through time from dualism toward monotheism, i.e., a dualism which is being made false by the dynamics of time, and a monotheism which is being made true by those same dynamics of time. The meaning of the eschaton in Zoroastrianism is thus the triumph of monotheism, the good God Ahura Mazdā having at last won his way through to complete and final ascendancy. But in the meantime there is vital truth to dualism, the neglect of which can only lead to a distortion of the religion's essential teachings. We develop this interpretation in the last part of our paper and argue for its satisfaction of the four criteria.<br>

Author(s): Rauschenbusch Walter<br>
Abstract: Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis, viewed by many as the masterpiece of the social gospel movement, has been confined to the dusty shelves of the library. Can we catch no glimpse of what astounded its massive reading public, no glimmer of Rauschenbusch's own sense of the work as a "dangerous book" written in fear and trembling? This article suggests that a generic analysis of Christianity and the Social Crisis might lead to surprising disclosures. Any generic analysis involves the discussion of a group of texts. Consequently this study proceeds via a comparison of the structure of Christianity and the Social Crisis with those of other works of a similar type which were produced between 1890 and 1915. The genre is isolated by utilizing the techniques of Tzvetan Todorov. Certain negative traits are specified which separate the genre from its neighbors. The positive leitmotif of a dual crisis-a crisis affecting society as a whole and the ramifications of that crisis within the Christian churches-is specified as the decisive trait of the genre. To deal with this leitmotif a specific structure was generated by the works under consideration. They provided-to pirate the words of Clifford Geertz in his landmark essay on modern ideologies-"maps of problematic reality" and "matrices for the creation of collective conscience." In designing their maps of problematic reality our authors worked along two separate but related vectors. The first of these vectors was constituted by a historical analysis of the origins of the present crisis, while the second consisted of a systemic analysis of the present social order. Each of these elements of the genre is examined in turn. The mapping of problematic reality by means of a historical and a structural analysis was geared towards provoking as well as defining the crisis. Crisis, once defined, demanded decision. Nevertheless the "permanent basis for action" which Rauschenbusch and others sought could not be grounded upon ideological conviction alone. It required both concrete guidelines for praxis and the creation of an institutional matrix to mobilize the moral forces of the society, to form public opinion. These works then as ideological matrices for the creation of collective conscience were also designed to precipitate the transformation of the Church into an agent of human emancipation. The art of the genre was also an act. But in an age noted for "writing-as-action" the exemplars of the genre laid a complexly interwoven, carefully stressed foundation for Christian involvement in social change. Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis appears at the end of this analysis as the unsurpassed formulation of this distinctive genre.<br>

Abstract: Creativity is seen as inherent in the developmental potential of the individual and of society as well. This "yen for becoming" is felt at all ages, and is in fact recognized as associated with the realization of the profoundest aspirations of man. Its origin is detected in early childhood. It is deeply rooted in the associative trend of thought and action, a trend which tends to perpetuate itself in the direction of unending abundance and novelty. The process assumes passage from awareness to memory, and even to the subconscious. The thought of the moment dips into the past, awakens memories, even those seemingly forgotten, reactivates all that is pertinent for the creation of new structures. It is believed that this tendency is essentially dynamic, endowed with energy which drives toward endless realizations. Nothing dies in the subconscious, as Freud pointed out. Each past experience is apt to return into consciousness and engage in a double process of homogenization and heterogenization, of convergent and divergent currents. Here the combinations, or commutations and permutations, are indefinite, an array which defies any computer. Creativity calls into play all energized experiences, present and stored, cognitive and affective, perceptual and conceptual, sensory and motoric, verbal and non-verbal, taxonomic and functional, real and symbolic; it constantly provokes new patterns. The richer the content of experience, the greater the possibility of innovation. The creative construction starts with the activation of readily available knowledge, the elements of which trigger related material in the memory and the subconscious. The movement is derived from active associations that continue to connect the units, and is oriented toward specific goals, leading to eventual syntheses, which may be expressed in either action or discourse. Here we face an unfurling, which coincides with interpretation, the unlocking of the new meaning built from the past upon the first meaning. This event, really never-ending, is a basic condition of life; it stimulates the spirit in a posture of perpetual emergence.<br>

Abstract: This paper focuses on the need for educational researchers to recognise the dialectic between theory and method. A methodology described as quasi-historical and based on a theory of social action is discussed in the first section. The second section proposes a means whereby the meaning of actions can be understood. A schema for the interpretation of text evidence is then outlined. This schema or methodology draws upon the theoretical work of Giddens, Thompson and Habermas and the interpretation theory of Ricoeur. The proposed schema avoids a theory-method dichotomy and offers researchers a form of disciplined enquiry.<br>

Abstract: In recent years personal construct theory has become increasingly used to underpin research into teachers' thinking, and a number of researchers have opted to give methodological prominence to the repertory grid. This paper points to the limitations of the theory in respect of research outside the domain of psychotherapy and to some of the problems associated with repertory grid studies. It is argued that repertory grids are inherently positivistic and are thus in philosophical tension with the theory on which they are based, a tension that is not removed by researching in a 'conversation paradigm'. The importance of events in personal construct theory is discussed, and it is suggested that an emphasis on events requires the researcher to adopt an approach that is informed by phenomenology and the philosophy of history. Finally, a return is made to the level of research practice,i and a methodological approach is outlined which is-to a greater extent than the repertory grid-consistent with the main thrust of personal construct theory. Stress is given to the importance of the quality of the relationships between constructs, since these have implications for connections between construing and action-an issue which is of crucial importance is the study of teachers' thinking.<br>

Abstract: Economics is privileged in contemporary government policy such that all human transactions are seen as economic forms of exchange. Education has been discursively restructured according to the logic of the market, with education policy being increasingly colonised by economic policy imperatives. This paper explores some of the consequences of this reframing which draws upon metaphors from industrial and business domains. This paper examines a significant dimension of teaching that currently has marginal presence in official discourse: social contingency. We argue that social contingency is characterised by a variety of distinctive features that include unpredictability, relationality and ethical demands. The significance of social contingency is highlighted by a comparison with industrial production, which is organisationally contingent, and craft production, which is characterised as materially contingent. We argue that the different nature of contingency in these domains makes them inappropriate as metaphors for teaching. We explore the nature of social contingency and some of the practical and ethical consequences of the failure to articulate this in official discourse. Its absence in such discourse is illustrated by consideration of competence statements in the Initial Teacher Education context. We argue that the neglect of social contingency is founded on assumptions of teacher sovereignty that are both philosophically and ethically unsustainable.<br>

Abstract: Notre analyse repose sur deux hypothèses générales complémentaires. La première hypothèse affirme l'existence non pas d'une crise de la pensée politique mais de trois situations critiques auxquelles doit faire face le pensée politique et qui déterminent des formes d'incertitude spécifiques, irréductibles les unes aux autres. La deuxième hypothèse affirme que l'intelligibilité des crises que connaît la pensée politique passe par celle des conditions politiques dans lesquelles s'exerce cette pensée. Pour préciser ces deux hypothèses nous faisons appel à un modèle construit à partir de la structure d'une action. Trois formes d'incertitude sont ainsi repérées: une incertitude concernant les valeurs, une incertitude concernant l'état des choses et une incertitude portant sur les voies d'action. Transposées sur le plan ou la dimension de la structure sociale, ces trois formes d'incertitude sont à saisir et à examiner respectivement comme crise au niveau du système de légitimation et de motivation, comme crise au niveau du système organisationnel ou des institutions et comme crise au niveau des stratégies ou système "opérationnel". Nous localisons la première forme de crise dans les sociétés du capitalisme "central", la deuxième dans les formations sociales socialistes et la troisième dans les sociétés du capitalisme "périphérique". A partir d'une analyse des conditions politiques qui ont rendu possible l'émergence de ces formes spécifiques de crise nous essayons de déterminer au moins certaines conditions nécessaires--mais non pas suffisantes--de leur dépassement. /// Two general complementary hypotheses underlie this analysis. The first contends that, although political science does not confront a crisis, it faces three critical challenges giving rise to uncertainty in the discipline. The second hypothesis asserts that to understand the present challenges testing political theory, it is necessary to relate the latter to the prevailing political context. To clarify the two hypotheses a model is presented, growing out of the structure of action. Three forms of uncertainty are thus identified, relating respectively to values, the state of affairs, and the means of action. These three uncertainties, seen in terms of social structure, are to be understood and examined in turn, in terms, respectively, of questions of legitimization and motivation, at the level of institutional and organizational arrangements, or with respect to strategy and "operational" systems. The first are identified in societies under a "central" capitalism, the second with socialist social organization, and the third with "peripheral" capitalism. On the basis of an analysis of political conditions which have facilitated the emergence of these specific forms of challenges, an effort is made to determine conditions which are necessary--but not sufficient--for these challenges to be dealt with.<br>

Abstract: This paper concerns the problem of how to give historical explanations of scientist's decisions to prefer one theory over another. It is argued that such explanations ought to contain only statements about the beliefs and preferences of the agents involved, and, in particular, ought not to include evaluative premises about the theories themselves. It is argued that Lakatos's attempt to build into such historical explanations premises of an evaluative kind is deficient. The arguments of Laudan to the effect that such explanations depend crucially upon evaluative assumptions about the rationality or irrationality of decisions are examined. It is argued that they do not establish the need for such assumptions. Similar criticisms are then shown to be applicable to a version of the 'hermeneutical' model of explanation for human actions.<br>

Abstract: Analysis of records of women at risk for abuse showed that though information about abuse was present, emergency room physicians rarely utilized it. The doctor-patient interaction tended to obscure rather than elucidate knowledge of abuse. Medicine's epistemologic model of care reconstructs abusive relationships through a medical encounter in which what is most significant is not seen. Nurses are less affected by the model but are under institutional constraints that lead to similar outcomes.<br>

Abstract: This essay takes up the claim made recently by Simon Critchley in The Companion to Continental Philosophy that a "feature common to many philosophers in the Continental tradition" is the "utopian demand that things be otherwise." The general question I pursue has to do with whether or not such a claim includes movements within Continental philosophy that do not self-identify with the utopian (like critical theory). The particular question has to do with whether or not the movement of phenomenology is utopian or does it, because of its other commitments, view the utopian as the antithesis to its orientation, which makes that claim that phenomenology is utopian seem strange. My thesis is that phenomenology can be seen as a utopian tradition but that some account must be given that demonstrates this connection to the utopian. In particular, I argue that Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology provides an understanding of the utopian, which I call a non-conventional view, that is vastly different from the one assumed by most when they see or hear the word "utopian," which I lable conventional. I show that such a non-conventional understanding can be developed in a way that neither requires us to view the utopian solely as opposed to finitude and contingency, nor a form of thought and action from which we necessarily need to dissociate ourselves. It is this non-conventional view of the utopian that in the end enables us to understand how Continental philosophy in general and phenomenology in particular are important bearers of the utopian demand that things be otherwise.<br>

Abstract: While it is clear that the Gadamer-Habermas debate has had a major influence on Paul Ricoeur, his commentators have had little to say about the nature of this influence. I try to remedy this silence by showing that Ricoeur's account of tradition is a direct response to the Gadamer-Habermas debate. First, I briefly explain the debate's importance and describe Ricoeur's reaction to it. Next, I show how his discussion of tradition in Time and Narrative steers a middle course between Gadamerian hermeneutics and Habermasian Ideologiekritik. Finally, I raise some critical questions about the adequacy of Ricoeur's middle course. Specifically, I argue that it rests on an implausible distinction between the form and the content of tradition.<br>

Abstract: This paper provides a phenomenological account of the writing of a young woman diagnosed with schizophrenia. The method of interpretation is to put ourselves in the place of the author drawing upon a combination of sympathy, reason, common-sense, experience, and "an intersubjective world, common to us all" (Schutz, 1945: 536). The result is the recognition of the person as also capable of putting herself in the place of others so as to understand their behavior. This "role-taking success" identifies the limits of the current sociological understanding of insanity's significance in social interaction as an instance of "role-taking failure" (Rosenberg, 1992).<br>

Abstract: The new scientific cosmology which has emerged over the past forty years seems to be forcing philosophers and theologians alike to rethink the traditional theistic conception of God in which God is pictured as a First Cause designer of the universe in favor of what Joseph Campbell more mystically calls an "immanent ground of being, transcendent of conceptualization." The central thrust of these reflections is that we encounter that "immanent ground of being" through the experience of wonder and awe. Since actual experience is involved, then a phenomenological description of exactly what it is in the new cosmology (and the universe) which induces such wonder is possible. The basic thesis is that we experience wonder in the face of the remarkable and transcendent (beyond finite predicates and understanding) coming-into-being of nature over twelve to fifteen billion years. Wonder is the human reaction to and appreciation for the astounding fact that nature and all of its parts actually are. It is; we are; such is the ineffable beyond in our midst.<br>

Abstract: The concept of political culture embraces some of the most basic, perennially fascinating concerns in behavioral political science; because of certain ambiguities in its theoretical formulation, however, there has been a tendency for the term to grow fuzzy with continued use. Its connection with related concepts, such as political psychology, political structure, and political language, has remained unclear, with the result that political culture has been difficult to isolate as an independent variable. Thus it has come to occupy a position on the periphery of politics, and is usually presumed to reinforce the status quo. This paper re-examines previous formulations of the concept and proposes a theoretical synthesis. The analytical framework is derived from semiological theory, a branch of science specifically designed for the analysis of meanings. The central variable is the political symbol. By analyzing the interactions of political symbols within a comprehensive semiological framework, the traditional concerns of political culture can be accommodated in a more precise and systematic way.<br>

Abstract: In his philosophy of nothingness, Kitarō Nishida illuminates the matrix of transformation of the world "from the Created to the Creating" (tsukuru mono kara tsukurareta mono e) through shintai, or the body. In this matrix, shintai enters into the stage of an action-sensation continuum and emerges as the immaculate iconic tool of nothingness to create new figures as extended self. This idea of shintai has resonance with the development of postwar art in Japan. The "Space of Transparency" put forth by Ufan Lee, the leader of Monoha, is the principal example. This essay investigates Nishida's notion of shintai and its influence on Lee's theory of art.<br>

Abstract: Two philosophical traditions with much in common, (classical) pragmatism and (Heidegger's) hermeneutic philosophy, are here compared with respect to their approach to the philosophy of science. Both emphasize action as a mode of interpreting experience. Both have developed important categories -- inquiry, meaning, theory, praxis, coping, historicity, life-world -- and each has offered an alternative to the more traditional philosophies of science stemming from Descartes, Hume, and Comte. Pragmatism's "abduction" works with the dual perspectives of theory (as explanation) and praxis (as culture). The hermeneutical circle depends in addition on the lifeworld as background source of ontological meaning and resource for strategies of inquiry. Thus a hermeneutical philosophy of research involves three components: lifeworld (as ontological and strategic), theory (as explanatory), and praxis (as constitutive of culture).<br>

Abstract: This article offers an alternative to classical hermeneutics, which focuses on discursive products and grasps meaning as the play of difference between linguistic signs. Pragmatist hermeneutics reconstructs meaning through an indefinite triangulation, which brings symbols, icons, and indices to bear on each other and considers a meaningful occasion as an embodied semiotic process. To illuminate the word-body-action nexus, the discussion identifies three basic types of signifying media: (1) the symbolic-discursive, (2) the somatic-affective, and (3) the behavioral-performative, each one marked by a special relationship between signs and their objects. An argument is made that the tension between various type-signifying media is unavoidable, that the pragmatic-discursive misalignment is an ontological condition, and that bridging the gap between our discursive, affective, and behavioral outputs is at the heart of ethical life.<br>

Abstract: In this article I consider "narrative mind reading," the practical capability of inferring the motives that precipitate and underlie the actions of others. Following Jerome Bruner, I argue that this everyday capacity depends on our ability to place action within unfolding narrative contexts. While Bruner has focused on narrative mind reading as a within-culture affair, I look to border situations that cross race and class lines where there is a strong presumption among participants that they do not, in fact, share a cultural framework. Instead, interactions often reinforce actors' perceptions of mutual misunderstanding and cultural difference. Drawing on a longitudinal study of African American families who have children with severe illnesses, I examine narrative mind reading and misreading in one mother's interactions with the clinicians who treat her child. I further explore how narrative misreadings are supported through chart notes and "familiar stranger" stories. The focus on miscommunication grounds a theory of the reproduction of cultural difference in interactive dynamics and brings Bruner's emphasis on narrative into dialogue with contemporary anthropology of cultural borderlands.<br>

Abstract: L'AERES dialogue avec certains organismes de recherche pour tenir compte de leurs missions
spécifiques dans le système d'évaluation. Mais cette démarche ne semble pas, au moins pour le moment,
devoir être formalisée ou étendue. Ce dialogue est facilité par le nombre restreint des organismes et c'est
évidemment plus difficile de le mener avec les quelque deux cents autres établissements d'enseignement
supérieur que l'agence doit auditer. Mais on peut imaginer quelques options entre lesquelles les établisse-
ments auraient à choisir. Et ceux qui souhaiteraient une évaluation encore plus spécifique pourraient être
amenés à en assumer une partie du coût.<br>

Abstract: Although the Thai-Lao peasants living in rain-fed agricultural communities in northeastern Thailand have experienced some improvements in their socioeconomic situation as a consequence of the growth of the Thai economy since the mid-1950s, these peasants still constitute the poorest sector of the population of Thailand. Moreover, the socioeconomic position of the rural northeastern Thai populace has actually declined relative to that of the urban populace and that of the rural populace living in central Thailand. The economic disadvantageous position of Thai-Lao peasants is linked with a sense of being an ethnoregional minority within a polity that has been highly centralized since reforms instituted at the end of the nineteenth century. Much of the social action of Thai-Lao peasants with reference to the political-economic constraints on their world can be understood, as long-term research in one community reveals, as having been impelled by rational calculation aimed at improving the well being of peasant families. The ways in which peasants have assessed in practice the justice of these constraints as well as the ways in which they have assessed the limits to entrepreneurship must be seen, however, as being rooted in moral premises that Thai-Lao villagers have appropriated from Theravada Buddhism as known to them in their popular culture.<br>

Abstract: Dopo un periodo, negli anni Sessanta e Settanta, in cui la fortuna di Lovejoy sembrò
declinare, lo studioso è tornato d'attualità negli anni Ottanta, con la ripresa della di-
scussione teorica intorno alia storia intellettuale. Nel 1987 il «Journal of the History of
Ideas» dedicò un numero per celebrare il mezzo secolo della Great Chain of Being, con
articoli di D.J. Wilson, G. Gordon-Bournique, E.P. Mahoney, F. Oakley e Melvin Ri-
chter (cfr. Lovejoy, «The Great Chain of Being» and the History of Ideas, in «Journal of
the History of Ideas», 48, 2, 1987). Contributi importanti sono inoltre venuti da Donald
R. Kelley, Tattuale editor del «Journal». Tra questi citiamo D.R. Kelley, Horizons of In-
tellectual History: Retrospect, Circumspect, Prospect, in «Journal of the History of Ideas»,
48, 1, 1987, pp. 143-169; e, sempre di Kelley, What is happening to the History of Ideas?,
in «Journal of the History of Ideas», 51, 1990, pp. 3-25. Proprio quest'ultimo articolo
rappresenta a tutt'oggi uno dei piú equilibrad tentativi di bilancio della history of ideas,
e al tempo stesso una meditazione sui futuro della disciplina da parte di uno degli «ere-
di» di Lovejoy. Significativamente Kelley propone di utilizzare Tespressione intellectual
history, e non piú history of ideas, proprio a voler allontanare i «fantasmi» di idealismo
impliciti nella scelta di fare della storia della filosofia il referente privilegiato della di-
sciplina (un'attitudine che era certamente di Lovejoy). Intellectual history è secondo Kel-
ley «doing a kind, or several kinds, of historical interpretation, in which philosophy and
literature figure not as controlling methods but as human creations suggesting the con-
ditions of historical understanding» [What is happening, cit., p. 18). L'approccio inter-
disciplinare, che era stato uno dei punti centrali del programma lovejoyano, rimane an-
cor oggi secondo Kelley valido, anche se ciò non deve significare Tadozione di strumenti
critici «alla moda» propri di altre discipline. A questo proposito si pone per Kelley il
problema dell'atteggiamento da tenere nei confronti di studiosi come Hayden White,
Dominick LaCapra, David Harlan, teorici del linguistic turn, un modo di fare storia che
si awale delle indicazioni provenienti dall'ermeneutica di Gadamer e Ricoeur, da Hei-
degger e dai suoi discepoli francesi Foucault e Derrida, e che rifiuta ogni reale possibi-
lità di giungere a una determinazione delle intenzioni dell'autore, cioè di un «significa-
to», della verità di un'opera, e del contesto entro cui Topera è stata composta. Per Kel-
ley non era possibile evitare le implicazioni che il linguistic turn poneva, tanto piú che
esso si rivelava utile soprattutto nel rivelare risorse, strutture, memorie culturali conser-
vate nel linguaggio (topoi, tropi, metafore, analogie), non soltanto dell'alta cultura ma
anche delle forme di espressione irriflessa, o popolare (anche questo secondo un'indica-
zione di Lovejoy). Se è però vero che il significato di un testo non è univoco, è altret-
tanto vero secondo Kelley che la ricerca delle intenzioni dell'autore è premessa indi-
spensabile di qualsiasi lavoro di storia intellettuale. Quanto alia questione dell'attenzio-
ne al «contesto», che i sostenitori del linguistic turn denigrano, Kelley prende atto che
non è certamente possibile giungere alia ricostruzione dell'intera rete di relazioni entro
cui un'opera si colloca. Ciò non significa pero che il testo o l'autore studiato non pos-
sano essere collocati in un «contesto», e che quindi, attraverso lo studio del linguaggio
di un'epoca, non si riesca a ricostruire le condizioni di possibilità per la nascita di
un'opera.<br>

Abstract: The dictatorship in Chile perpetrated massive human rights violations for 17 years, causing a rupture in social processes and engendering fear in the population. Data being gathered in an ongoing participatory action research study of the población (shanty-town) La Pincoya show that while memory can be debilitating to most persons, it may empower others. Memories of the practices of the military regime continue to cause fear in some of the population, affecting community cohesion and participation in local organizations. This has led to the dismantling of social networks in the community, robbing members of their ability to be the protagonists of their own lives.<br>

Abstract: A recurrent misconception about the concept of utopia fails to realize fully that its essential endeavor constitutes a speculative act involving the distribution of power and resources. Consequently, utopian desire is closely linked to structures of power and can be manipulated by interests in positions of influence within these structures. It is these connections to the machinations of power that bring utopian visions their potential for social/political influence. However, these same types of links also provide avenues for these conceptions to be cynically influenced in ways that can usurp individual autonomy. The role of power and utopia can be analyzed in the formative process of a specific social structure as well as in their contribution to the conception of a common heritage or history. The "historical perspective" often serves as the foundation for the production of propaganda seeking to capture the imagination of a populace either to instigate positive social change or to legitimize an oppressive regime. Through the lens of Collingwood's philosophy of history, this article investigates the connection that the "historical consciousness" has to the attributes of power and utopia as well as the role that this relationship plays in the formation of a collective mentality. In short, it studies the essential characteristics of the bond between individuals that allows a community or collective to perpetuate itself. It also explores how the attributes of power and utopia can use latent historical perceptions to strengthen the process of ideological integration that underlies any social action or formal structure of authority.<br>

Abstract: Drawing attention to the complex reciprocal relationship between commercialized leisure and commercial literature in the so-called "Age of Wit," this essay reconceives of the witty and witless in two important ways. Taking for granted, first of all, that wit is usually analyzed in terms of the efficacy of verbal language, the essay examines how and why debates concerning true and false wit were played out in physical terms—in this case, through the motions, gestures, and attitudes of the dancing body. Second of all, the essay attempts to account for the enduring, if unwitting, attractions of "false wit" by likening it to the tricks and transformations of contemporary English pantomime. Satirists of the 1720s, 1730s, and 1740s frequently invoke the unmeaning motion of Harlequin as a visual way of proscribing the verbal excesses of extravagant language. At the same time, apologists for pantomime associate Harlequin's "dumb Wit" with truth, reason, and the pattern of nature, claiming that the genre's corporeality allowed it to transcend the limitations and equivocations of words. The essay concludes that the popularity of pantomime contextualizes the Augustan reaction against false wit, in that it identifies a source of aesthetic pleasure in the public's eagerness to be duped by apparent sameness in difference. Early eighteenth-century readers enjoy luxuriant, illogical, and mixed metaphors, forced similes, and trifling jibes and quibbles for the same reason that early eighteenth-century spectators delight in the unexpected turns of pantomimic entertainment: in a world under the sway of Harlequin's magical slapstick, audiences derive satisfaction from being deceived.<br>

Abstract: In recent years, sociologists and anthropologists have conducted significant studies of modern life using concepts and perspectives derived from symbolic anthropology. This paper discusses the theoretical and methodological problems entailed, including the distinction between symbolic and nonsymbolic actions. Research on three major areas of behavior is reviewed: (a) studies of institutions, especially politics, law, and social control; (b) studies of ceremonial events, including life-cycle rituals, sports, and festivals; and (c) studies of everyday life, including consumer goods and food, and popular culture. We conclude with a discussion of the methodological issues of location and dimensionality and the different forms of symbolic analysis.<br>

Abstract: Experiences that do not fit squarely into known categories pose a challenge to notions of organizational learning that rely primarily on scientific or experiential approaches. Making sense of, responding to, and learning from such unusual experiences requires reflection and novel action by organizational actors. We argue that narrative development processes make this organizational learning possible. By developing narratives, organizational actors create situated understandings of unusual experiences, negotiate consensual meanings, and engage in coordinated actions. Through the accumulation of narratives about unusual experiences, an organization builds a memory with generative qualities. Specifically, through narratives, actors evoke memories of prior unusual experiences and how they were dealt with, and this generates new options for dealing with emerging unusual experiences. We outline a framework detailing how narrative development processes enable organizational learning from unusual experiences and conclude by summarizing how this approach differs from and yet builds upon scientific and experiential approaches to learning.<br>

Abstract: This essay is a comparative study of the tributes paid to the American philosopher John Rawls, in France and the United States, after his death in November 2010. Whereas in the U.S. tributes to Rawls appeared in scholarly journals, in France they did in political magazines and general interest media. Besides, the focus in U.S. journals on Rawls's philosophical commitments is at odds with the emphasis placed by the French media on the political interpretations of his theory of justice. The contrast between Rawls's French and U.S. "funerals" is a consequence of the way intellectual fields in France and the U.S. differ in their relation to politics. While Rawls conformed with what was expected of him in the American academia by staying away from politics almost all his life, he was seen in France as an intellectuel engagé, the typical figure of intellectual life since the Dreyfus case. The contrast between the French and American reactions to Rawls's death is also related to the fact that those who first got interested in his theory of justice in France were supporters of the anti-totalitarian left or center-right, rather than academic philosophers.<br>

Abstract: Though the process of meaning construction is widely recognized to be a crucial factor in the mobilization, unfolding, and outcomes of social movements, the conditions and mechanisms that allow meaning construction and cultural transformation are often misconceptualized and/or underanalyzed. Following a "tool kit" perspective on culture, dominant social movement theory locates meaning only as it is embodied in concrete social practices. Meaning construction from this perspective is a matter of manipulating static symbols and meaning to achieve goals. I argue instead that meaning is located in the structure of culture, and that the condition and mechanism of meaning construction and transformation are, respectively, the metaphoric nature of symbolic systems, and individual and collective interpretation of those systems in the face of concrete events. This theory is demonstrated by analyzing, through textual analysis, meaning construction during the Irish Land War, 1879-1882, showing how diverse social groups constructed new and emergent symbolic meanings and how transformed collective understandings contributed to specific, yet unpredictable, political action and movement outcomes. The theoretical model and empirical case demonstrates that social movement analysis must examine the metaphoric logic of symbolic systems and the interpretive process by which people construct meaning in order to fully explain the role of culture in social movements, the agency of movement participants, and the contingency of the course and outcomes of social movements.<br>

Abstract: The work of literary structuralists, particularly Roland Barthes, provides sharper insights into ethnomethodology than symbolic interactionism, labeling theory, or phenomenology. Further, it suggests that the metaphor of text may be fruitful for analysts of everyday life. Greater theoretical benefits derive from that metaphor, however, if one applies it using the ideas of literary theorists outside the structuralist tradition.<br>

Abstract: This article draws on ethnographic examples to examine how rural Maya-speakers in the Mexican state of Yucatán ground the experience of identity politics in quotidian engagements with pre-Hispanic objects and utterances in the Maya language. My argument is intended as a revision of models of critical scholarship that have been influenced by poststructuralism and that place an overwhelming emphasis on discourse as a modality through which politically viable identities are created and performed. Specific examples show how vernacular multiculturalism is shaped by the agency of forms of language use and physical objects that have been a part of local life-worlds long before the popularization of Mayan identity politics. This offers some potentials for collaborative work that have not been fully explored in poststructural critiques of representation. L'auteur s'appuie sur des exemples ethnographiques pour étudier la manière dont les locuteurs du maya vivant dans les zones rurales de l'état mexicain du Yucatán fondent leur expérience de la politique identitaire sur une interaction quotidienne avec les objets et énoncés préhispaniques de la langue maya. Son argumentation se veut une remise en cause des modèles universitaires critiques influencés par le poststructuralisme, qui mettent lourdement l'accent sur le discours en tant que modalité permettant de créer et de réaliser des identités politiquement viables. Des exemples concrets montrent comme un multiculturalisme vernaculaire se constitue par l'action des formes d'usage du langage et des objets matériels qui faisaient partie de la vie locale longtemps avant que la politique identitaire maya se popularise. Cette approche offre un potentiel de travail en collaboration qui n'a pas été complètement exploré par les critiques poststructuralistes de la représentation.<br>

Abstract: Schwartz argues for the later rabbinic development of practices related to death: "Indeed, if it
is the case that even strongly 'Jewish' Jews were often buried without the accompaniment of Jewish
iconography—that despite what we are accustomed to think about such liminal moments as birth,
death, marriage and so on, death was not yet generally an occasion among Palestinian Jews for
strong public affirmation of group identity—then Beth Shearim shows that the judaization of
Jewish burial practice was now (third-fourth century) underway in some circles" (2001: 154).<br>

Abstract: This paper offers a discussion of contemporary theories of moral development. At present, these theories are at odds regarding the origins of morality. One camp has proposed a cognitive basis, while the other claims that morality consists in affectivity. Both these positions are discussed, and a third alternative is proposed for their resolution, based upon the model of the subject within communicative relations, whose life involves constructing reality through social procedures with others. This model is described and contrasted with the model of the self-reflecting individual which seems to underlie most current theories. In addition, a number of studies are reviewed in order to show more clearly how this third alternative provides insight into the social basis of moral judgment. Throughout the paper, two themes remain central: (a) that rationality can be considered to result from consensual validation which is obtained through communication; and (b) that sense of community, the grounds for moral action, is not incompatible with establishing or maintaining one's own individual identity.<br>

Abstract: Building on 25 months of fieldwork in eastern Germany from 1991 to 2003, this article explores the interpenetration of aesthetics and politics, and questions them as theoretical categories. A multilayered description depicts aesthetic perception and action, guided by an imagery of façade, as constituted and reproduced by state policies, positioned experiences, and subversive responses. Moving beyond the Cold War legacy, aesthetics' potency and politicization is dated back to early nation building and Protestant and Romantic influences. Being essential to and controlled by shifting, largely authoritarian regimes, aesthetics simultaneously provided a 'shadow life' and a 'lingua franca', cross-cutting verbal and non-verbal mediums and everyday and high culture, as people juggled with, distrusted, and decoded surfaces, expressing and in search of deeper, hidden truths. I argue that historically generated aesthetic perceptions and praxis not only mark east German political culture but also emerge in Habermas's public sphere theory and, moreover, offer arguments to revise it.<br>

Abstract: This paper presents an historical outlook on the macro-micro distinction in modern sociology. It links the genesis of social interactionism and microsociology to the rise of Romantic philosophy and attempts to elaborate methodological principles dividing macro- and microscopic perspectives in sociology. Six ideal-typical distinctions are considered: natural vs. social universality, emergent properties vs. emergent processes, morphological structuralism vs. genetical interactionism, choice among socially structured alternatives vs. structuring appearance into reality, structural vs. emergent directionality, operational vs. hermeneutical analysis. The complementarity of the languages of macro- and microsociological theories is advocated as a foundation for the further elaboration of conceptual links between the two levels of analysis.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in confusing motives with causes; irrationalism, which advocates a "liberté d'indifférence", basing itself on the same premise as rationalism, and confusing motives with causes, is wrong in seeing the negation of the very existence of motives as the one way of saving human freedom. Both views disregard the fact that human action is impossible and cannot be understood without motives and that this, in turn, does not mean a determination of man in a mechanical way, for motives are not a part of nature but rather an organic element in a specific human situation—voluntary action. Human freedom is the freedom peculiar to a finite being immersed in time. Both those who stress passivity and receptivity and those who stress the dynamic creating ability of the self are wrong; both those who thought that freedom is possible only on the basis of clear and distinct motives and that action is nothing but the end of deliberation (St. Thomas) and those who thought that freedom is possible only by an irrational emergence of the vital ego (Bergson) or by negating the existence of any previous determination of the self (Sartre) are mistaken. A true human decision is composed of two elements; given motives and values on the one hand, and non-intellectualist spontaneous choice on the other. Duality is peculiar to human action. This is made more explicit in dealing with the more fundamental involuntary elements; character, sub-consciousness and life. Man acts freely from a finite and determined point of view; he acts in a clear and transparent way on the basis of confused and amorphous data; he lives his freedom when thrown into life. Necessity is inherent in man; it is one of his modes of being. There is no "inner freedom" on the one hand and "objective" causal necessity on the other. This conception of human action as both activity and passivity is reminiscent of Merleau-Ponty's statement in his "Philosophie du perception": "Le monde est déjá constitué, mais aussi jamais complètement constitué.... Il n'y a donc jamais déterminisme et jamais choix absolu, jamais je ne suis chose et jamais conscience nue". There is no dilemna between determinism and irrationalism, just as there is none between extended substance and thinking substance; there is dialogue.<br>

Abstract: »Die räumlichen und zeitlichen Schichten der Globalgeschichte: Überlegungen zu einer globalen Begriffsgeschichte anhand der Ausweitung von Reinhart Kosellecks Zeitschichten in globale Räume«. Recent debates on global history have challenged the understanding of history beyond the nation-state. Simultaneously, they search for non-Eurocentric approaches. This has repercussions on the relation between historical space and time in both historical interpretation and in research design. This article reflects on the possibilities of a global conceptual history by expanding Reinhart Koselleck's theory of temporal layers (Zeitschichten) into global spaces. To this end, it introduces the notion of spatial layers (Raumschichten). First, historicisation and its relation to and interaction with spatialisation and temporalisation is pondered; then, the impact of global spatial and temporal complexities on comparative and conceptual history is considered, before, thirdly, a framework of three tensions of global history - normative, temporal and spatial - is introduced as a way to concretely unfold historical research questions through global conceptual history. Regarding time and space, the main lines of argument in global history have focused either on the question of whether or not European powers were ahead of non-European ones or on the supposedly Western linearity of time as opposed to a non-Western cosmology or circularity of time. Taking its point of departure in Zeitschichten, which break from the linear-vs.-circular logic, this article instead proposes to foreground an actor-based, multi-lingual, global conceptual history to better understand spatio-temporal practices.<br>

Abstract: Although the dual perspective should be used to focus on diversity, it should be applied within the context of an anthropological—ecological framework to prevent stereotyping, to illuminate the universal goals of societal organization underlying human behavior, and to explore the early socialization of children. This view is illustrated with preliminary findings from an ongoing longitudinal study of lower socioeconomic inner-city African American children that examines the importance of a sense of time, its evolution in early socialization, and the relationship of parent-child interactions to the development of a sense of time.<br>

Abstract: The main end of this article is to offer a critical analysis of autonomy conceived as a basic idea in modern educational philosophy. After the tragic experience and dramatic consequences of totalitarianism, is not possible to defend a kantian concept of autonomy as a unique source of moral responsibility and ethical action. After holocaust, we need to defend, on the contrary, the principle of previous value of heteronomy, conceived as the practice of otherness, in its levinasian perspective. So, the authors explore the thesis of the prior value of heteronomy on autonomy, as a source and foundation of moral responsibility in educational relationship, and to reflect the general educational implications of the jewish philosophical tradition of otherness in philosophical educational discourse.<br>

Abstract: Present discourses on technology education are taking a positive and value-neutral approach with utilitarian and vocational overtones. The discourses generally lack discussions of human agency and human responsibility for techno-scientific activities and technological literacy. To support the emergence of a collective civic literacy, we argue in this text that technology education needs to take up critical and value-acknowledging aspects with emphasis on building sustainable relationships among human beings, technology, and lifeworld. To understand the relationship between human agency and modern technology, we examine the nature of technology in the dimensions of technology as causality and technology as a relationship of lifeworld. Discussing Martin Heidegger's perspectives on the causalities of technology, we question how the nature of technology situates human beings in power-related relationships to the world. Understanding technology as process and relationship of lifeworld, the paper extends its discussion of the responsibility of a dialectical human-technology-lifeworld relation based on a socio-technical and ethico-moral framework of technology. By recognizing human responsibility of and for modern technology, we outline a critical and reflective approach to technological literacy. The approach challenges the position of current approaches to technology in the attempt to provide a foundation for a contemporary pedagogy of technological awareness and values. Aujourd'hui, les discours en matière d'enseignement de la technologie sont en train de prendre une orientation positive et dépourvue de jugement de valeur comportant des connotations utilitaristes et professionnelles. En général, les discours n'ouvrent pas assez de discussions sur l'action humaine et la responsabilité humaine dans les activités technico-scientifiques et dans l'alphabétisme technologique. Dans ce papier, afin de renforcer l'éclosion de l'alphabétisme civique collectif, nous ouvrons le débat sur le fait que l'enseignement de la technologie a besoin d'aborder des aspects critiques et de valeur reconnue avec un accent mis sur la construction durable des relations chez les êtres humains, dans la technologie et dans la vie mondiale. Dans le but de comprendre les relations entre l'action humaine et la technologie moderne, nous analysons la nature de la technologie en tant que causalité et en tant que relation de la vie mondiale. Nous discutons des perspectives de Martin Heidegger sur les causalités de la technologie. Nous posons des questions sur la manière que la nature de la technologie situe les êtres humains dans les relations basées sur le pouvoir face au monde. Nous assimilons la technologie comme processus et comme relation de la vie mondiale. L'article élargit les propos sur la responsabilité dune relation dialectale humaine technologie/vie mondiale, fondée sur une structure de technologie sociotechnique et éthico morale. En reconnaissant la responsabilité humaine de et pour la technologie moderne, nous soulignons une démarche critique et réfléchie de l'alphabétisme technologique. La démarche remet en question la position des approches actuelles vers le chemin de la technologie afin d'apporter une base à une pédagogie contemporaine de sensibilisation et de valeurs technologiques.<br>

Abstract: In order to manage our daily lives, we make many decisions based on empirical evidence derived from instrumental action. At the other extreme, we are often attracted by a so-called postmodern solution that invites us to make arbitrary choices. In the education system, the pressing dilemma should not be a choice between standards of competence or unthinking relativism, but how to take action towards intercultural tolerance. Establishing a small teacher training course for a group of British Muslims has shown that communicative action informed by understanding can be disabled by the instrumentality of positivist frameworks, such as those used by government inspectors. In philosophy, Ricoeur offers a provisional dialectic of hope that can be used to show why neither positivist methods, rational analytic philosophy, postmodernity nor any one belief system for interpreting the world should be allowed to exert hegemonic control. The ethicopractical philosophy of Ricoeur also offers a reconstructive view of reality that helps us to rehabilitate belief in human nature and encourages us to seek solutions to conflicts of interpretation in understanding others. It is applied, in this instance, to project work with Muslim women in the UK, in which an ontology of action shows the power of working collaboratively towards an understanding of oneself as another.<br>

Abstract: This article attempts to pose the principles for the use of certain tools, forged in linguistics, for sociological analysis, particularly for the analysis of interviews. Far from being a simple collection of information, the interviews with migrants analyzed here are an arena for intense language activity. With the use of concepts such as annunciation, pragmatism and natural logic, various language functions are identified that sociologists should take into consideration: the construction of representations, negotiation of one's position in an interaction. Contrary to the spontaneous sociology of certain linguistics, language practices are not those of an actor free of all social determinants. On the contrary, by taking into consideration the complexity of language, sociology can construct a plural, heterogeneous and even divided actor. Cet article essaie de poser les principes d'utilisation de quelques outils forgés en linguistique pour l'analyse sociologique, plus particulièrement pour l'analyse des entretiens. Loin d'être une simple collection d'informations, les entretiens analysés ici, qui sont des entretiens de migrants, sont le lieu d'une intense activité langagière. En recourant aux concepts de l'énonciation, de la pragmatique et de la logique naturelle, sont repérés divers fonctionnements langagiers que le sociologue a tout intérêt à considérer: construction des représentations, négociation des places dans l'interaction. Cependant, contrairement à la sociologie spontanée de certaines linguistiques, les pratiques langagières ne sont pas celles d'un acteur libre de toutes déterminations. Au contraire, en prenant en compte toute la complexité du langage, le sociologue peut construire un acteur pluriel, hétérogène, voire divisé.<br>

Abstract: The current methods in psychoanalytic studies of God images and representations have focused almost exclusively on individual, internal processes. This article examines how psychological anthropologists go about formulating symbolic representations of deity in their research, in comparison with the object relations method of God-representations. Drawing on Melford Spiro's integrative proposal for interpreting the mental and collective representations in religious symbol systems, this paper proposes that there is a need for a comprehensive model of the representational process in the Eastern world in order to suit its cultural traditions. The author uses both theoretical and historical materials as well as personal narrative throughout its entirety to balance the two in a mutual and coherent flow of understanding. Noting the culturally patterned interactions with culturally postulated God-symbols, the object relations method of God-representations will be utilized to probe how God is both created and found on a collective (cultural) level as well as individual level.<br>

Abstract: The contemporary philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, has characterized the dominant trend in modern interpretative thought as the 'school of suspicion', whose most significant 'masters' are Freud and Nietzsche. For them, to seek meaning—whether in a text, dream, discourse, or institution—is, first and foremost, to suspect 'truth as lying'. It is my contention that Ricoeur could well have named Dostoevsky as a third master of this modern school of interpretation, for he, too, was preoccupied with exploring the possibility of 'truth as lying', whether to others or to oneself. The general concern of my essay is to clarify Dostoevsky's relation to the modern 'hermeneutics of suspicion' in a manner which is mutually illuminating. The particular focus is on Dostoevsky's hermeneutics of suspicion as employed in The Brothers Karamazov, especially with the object of deciphering the avowed 'love of humanity' which motivates Ivan Karamazov's famous 'rebellion' against God. Ivan's humanism is highly ambiguous, as his words and actions (of omission and commission) throughout the novel demonstrate. I attempt to show that the ambiguity of Ivan Karamazov can be illumined as an exercise of suspicion on Dostoevsky's part which distinguishes between the manifest sources of Ivan's moral stance and what is in reality its hidden basis. And, in order to situate Dostoevsky in relation to the modern 'school of suspicion', his interpretation of the ambiguous text of modern humanism is compared with that of Nietzsche. The dialogue which the essay sets up between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky on the problem embodied by Ivan Karamazov reveals areas of convergence and divergence: the former apparent in a shared suspicion of a secular humanism which affirms the love of humanity apart from religious faith; and the latter apparent in their different understandings of love—whether of humanity or of God. The comparison between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, then, highlights the distinction between a hermeneutics of suspicion which is ultimately reductive in intent, and one which can be said to be ultimately 'recollective'.<br>

Abstract: Is liability insurance simply a necessary evil in today's climate of litigation? Or does it have greater implications beyond its social and economic remit? In this article, I argue that when the insurance policy is viewed hermeneutically as a text, its negligence-based definition of action supplants the understanding of responsibility, therefore having theological and philosophical implications. Insurance, in this sense, comes 'in between' humanity and its relation to others and fundamental ontological questions concerning the meaning of uncertainty and suffering.<br>

Abstract: In the world of Korean shamanism, there is a particular god, called taegam, which is allegedly famous for its love of money and its abundance of greed for material wealth. During the shamanic ritual of chaesu-kut, the rites for good fortune and luck, this god is popularly worshipped as the Deity of Wealth and is typically symbolized by money placed all over its face and spirit costumes. Nonetheless, as money has the two sides of heads and tails, taegam also has two very different faces—so-taegam and taegam. This article explores the ambiguity of the two taegam gods, focusing on the symbolic action of money-offerings and how its meaning is taken from the perspective of the ritual actors, in the hope of shedding light on the place of Korea's traditional popular religion of shamanism in today's transformed urban landscape. By discussing the semantics of "money is the filial child" (a remark made by so-taegam) and "money is the enemy" (as remarked by taegam), statements I often heard during my fieldwork in Seoul, I suggest that the ambivalent symbolic nature of taegam should be seen as an indispensible vehicle for understanding ritual life, as well as everyday life, of urban Korean people since it is closely related to both normative orientations and the contradictory aspects of the material culture of contemporary urbanites inhabiting the borderless, globalized, and fluctuating modern capitalist market. This conclusion is reached partly with reference to existing sociological theories of money and anthropological inquiries into the ambivalent aspects of taegam.<br>

Abstract: Unsere Literaturübersicht diskutiert die Frage, ob und inwieweit eine reife Liebesfähigkeit Erwachsener von entsprechenden Früherfahrungen abhängt bzw. inwieweit Liebe und Partnerschaft eine Korrektur ungünstiger emotionaler Erfahrungen der frühen Kindheit ermöglichen. Bestimmte Partnerschaftsstörungen stehen zu konkreten familiären Gegebenheiten der ersten Lebensjahre in keinem zwingenden Bezug. Sind Partnerschaftsstörungen nach traditioneller psychoanalytischer Auffassung als Folge eines ungelösten infantilen Konfliktes anzusehen, so greifen neuere Ansätze angesichts des weitgehenden Fehlens einer psychoanalytischen Interaktionstheorie bei der Beschreibung und Erklärung interpersoneller Phänomene zunehmend auf systemische Ansätze zurück. Äußerungen psychoanalytischer Autoren zur Entwicklung der Liebesfähigkeit reflektieren im historischen Überblick wesentliche Veränderungen der Theoriebildung. Neuere empirische Arbeiten weisen auf Korrektur- und Kompensationsmöglichkeiten ungünstiger Früherfahrungen von mittlerem Schweregrad hin. Dafür aber dürfte die warme und bedürfnisgerechte Zuwendung durch eine oder mehrere feste Bezugspersonen (möglichst durch die liebevoll und partnerschaftlich aufeinander bezogenen Eltern) in den ersten Lebensjahren eine grundlegende Voraussetzung erwachsener Liebes- und Partnerschaftsfähigkeit sein. In this survey of literature on the subject, we discuss the question of whether or not and if so to what extent a mature, adult ability to love depends on relevant early experience, or whether it functions as a corrective to unfavorable emotional experience in early childhood. There is no compelling connection between certain disturbances of partner relations and concrete family circumstances in the first years of life. Such disturbances are regarded by traditional psychoanalysis as the result of an unresolved infantile conflict; however, since there is no psychoanalytical interaction theory for the description and explanation of interpersonal phenomena, recent discussions have drawn increasingly on a systematic approach. From an historical point of view, psychoanalytical discussions reflect essential changes in theories about the ability to love. More recent empirical studies point to a possible involvement of corrective and compensatory mechanisms for unfavorable early experiences of a medium degree of seriousness. Nevertheless, warm affection based on needs during the first years of life (at best from loving parents with a partner-oriented relationship) provides a basis for the adult's ability to love and form partnerships.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Abstract: Through ethnographies in Immanuel and interviews with its residents, this article examines the unique influences of the environment on social relationships and actions taken by individuals and groups. The findings of the ethnographies illustrate the dramatic heterogeneity of the population in Immanuel (made up of ultra-Orthodox Ashkenazim and Mizrahim, newly religious Mizrahim, a group of newly religious ex-convicts, and a group of "drifters"), and show the blatant disregard of the members of the various groups for each other. They also reveal the large number of deserted apartments and buildings in the town. The findings from the interviews present explicit definitions of Immanuel as "a different place." They report the dialectics between the general "invisibility" of Immanuel in the media as compared to its visibility when critical incidents occur (such as terrorist attacks, the Immanuel controversy, and reports of sexual harassment). They also stress the yearning of the interviewees to leave Immanuel, and the paradoxicality of the environment (manifested by the simultaneity of cultural prejudices and protest). With this background in mind, we suggest using the heterotopian concept of Michel Foucault for the complex comprehension of the Immanuel environment. The discussion indicates the "otherness" of Immanuel (heterotopia), and the relationships between social control, heterogeneity, and social protest.<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to examine the development of the notion of "The Other" and to trace the implications of its effect on the dialoguic Philosophy. In "I and Thou" this category was not developed, at best it was suggested only vaguely, for in this text Buber does not carry out any ontological explication of this category. But such an explication was necessary and was later formulated gradualy by Buber. The clearer the ontological explication, the sharper the category of "the Other" is delineated. It is this category which establishes the I-Thou relationship. This development is expressed in Buber's writings with great tension, and we analyze it in detail, for the category of "the Other" and the central position which it occupies undermine the significance of the I-Thou relationship as it is presented in the book "I and Thou". Together with an acceptance of the primacy of "the Other" in this relationship, we must also assert the primacy of the "I" as the subject of reflective action, of the recognition of the other in his otherness. In this situation it is not the relationship which comes first but the detachment and the aloneness which exist between the I and Thou. We now have to rewise the notion of the dialogue from that purety of an event without content to that of an action of mutual assertion between I and the Other, where each one asserts the other in his otherness, where at the same time each is conscious of being asserted by the Other.<br>

Abstract: The article deals with the problem of revelation in Levinas' writings. The first part of the article analizes Levinas' ideas on the Same and the Other, more particularly the topics of the face and of discourse, as these come to the fore in the first section of Totality and Infinity. Investigating the non-totalising relationship between the Same and the Other presents us with the suitable framework for understanding the relation between the finite and the Infinite. Leaving out any ontotheological speech, Levinas shows how Metaphysics is enacted in the ethical relation. The second part cootinues with a description of Levinas' position on revelation in the Jewish tradition. The active Interpretation of Biblical texts "beyond the verse" represents an opportunity of hearing the divine word today and to enter into a more primordial Order than the Order of the Same. In the course of the article, we point to affinities and striking similarities between E. Levinas' and F. Rosenzweig's view on revelation. We also demonstrate how Levinas Orients his Jewish writings to his philosophy of the Other and vice versa. In writing on revelation, Levinas' main concern seems to be the description of the possibility of a fracture in the immanent order of totality and in the self-sufficiency of reason which is its correlative. This fraction is produced by the command "thou shalt not kill", calling the Same to open itself to the Other.<br>

Abstract: Un autre exemple de trivialité : au début de son texte, Badiou évoque un conflit, une
« guerre abstraite » actuellement en cours entre vision juive et vision chrétienne de l'histoire;
et donc, selon lui, la Mémoire... s'inscrit dans cette rivalité pour conquérir la « direction spiri-
tuelle du camp "démocratique" ». Et attention, Ricœur vise à « rien moins qu'une victoire »!
Le déclin de l'influence chrétienne et le brio de la pensée juive au sens large (sans garantie de
durée!) dans la culture française et européenne sont patents, mais ce constat accrédite-t-il une
vision paranoïaque de la vie intellectuelle? D'autres exemples dans le Siècle, op. cit., par
exemple une parole d'un poème de Celan inspiré de la mémoire d'Auschwitz, rapportée par
Badiou aux slogans des manifestants de décembre 1995 pour leur retraite, à Roanne-Trifouillis-
les-Oies : « Tous ensemble, tous ensemble, ouais! » (p. 139).<br>

Abstract: Cette réflexion sur l'homoparentalité comme révélateur des changements de la parenté en
général, et ouvrant vers la question de la pluriparentalité dans le droit contemporain de la
famille, est entamée depuis de longues années. On peut se reporter en particulier à la conclu-
sion de mon article « Pacs, sexualité et différence des sexes », Esprit, octobre 1999, qui mettait
en cause la logique « identitariste » (opposant deux grandes classes substantielles d'individus,
les homosexuels versus les hétérosexuels) au profit d'une approche « relationnelle » de l'égalité
(impliquant de transformer le droit commun de la famille dans un sens pluraliste en instituant
le couple de même sexe et non pas seulement le couple de sexe opposé).<br>

la Démocratie délibérative, une anthologie, Paris, Hermann, 2010 : la délibération repose sur une
éthique normative particulièrement exigeante et les critères d'une parole juste, impartiale, libre,
égale, rationnelle, argumentée, sont rarement rencontrés sur les forums de discussion, même en
l'absence de tout troll.<br>

Abstract: L'action humanitaire a eu vingt ans l'an dernier. Au-delà de savoir si elle a triomphé ou échoué, mieux vaut s'interroger sur ce qui déchire ses principaux acteurs et comprendre les conflits qui opposent les pères fondateurs (Kouchner, Malhuret, Emmanuelli, Brauman). Plutôt que d'opposer abruptement l'humanitaire et la politique, on aura sûrement beaucoup à gagner à imaginer un triangle de l'humanitaire où les pôles juridique, éthique et politique se renforcent mutuellement.<br>

Abstract: Daß die Verstiegenheiten und Mißbräuche, welche die Scholiasten der Spätantike seit
der Kaiserzeit mit der Etymologie getrieben haben, aller ernsten Grundlagen entbehrten
und reine Fabrikation ebenso mittelmäßiger wie phantasievoller Wichtigtuer darstellten,
die sich „Philologen" und „Grammatiker" nannten und noch bis in die byzantinische Epoche
hinein fortwirkten, ist allgemein bekannt (s. zum Beispiel die vielfachen Entlarvungen dieses
durch die Jahrhunderte mitgeschleppten Ballastes von Pseudogelehrsamkeit bei W. G. Ruther-
ford, A Chapter in the History of Annotation, Being Scholia Aristophanica, Bd. III, London
1905, S. 392 etc). Daß die ebenso irrationalen und vielleicht noch geschmackloseren ety-
mologischen Spekulationen, die man im 20. Jahrhundert auf die Wortgruppe έρμηνεία, έρμη-
νεύειν, ερμηνευτικός anwendete und immer noch anwendet, im gängigen akademischen Lehr-
betrieb heute ernst genommen werden und sich professoraler Autorität erfreuen, ist nicht
nur ein bildungsgeschichtliches curiosum, sondern ein Zeugnis irrationaler Aushöhlung der
„geisteswissenschaftlichen" Fakultäten. Als Beispiel seien nur erwähnt Karl Kerényi, Her-
meneia und Hermeneutike, Ursprung und Sinn der Hermeneutik in ders., Griechische Grundbegriffe,
Fragen und Antworten aus der heutigen Situation, Zürich 1964, 42-52, und F. K. Mayr, Der
Gott Hermes und die Hermeneutik in Tijdschrift voor Filosofie, 30, 1968, 525-635. Wie der Autor
des zuletzt genannten Artikels selbst, auf Heideggers Formulierung zurückgreifend, sagt,
ist das „Spiel des Denkens verbindlicher als die Strenge der Wissenschaft"... Wohin eine
im Banne Heideggers stehende „Begriffsgeschichte" führt, kann man bei der Lektüre dieses
Schwalls besser „verstehen"... Wie wenig Tragweite die immer wieder angeführte (Techné)
hermeneutike in der Epinomis 975 c hat, sagt der Text selbst: bei der Kunst Orakel zu inter-
pretieren, die weder Seelengröße noch Weisheit hervorbringt, weiß der „Interpret" nur,
was er sagt, ob es jedoch wahr ist, hat er nicht gelernt (τό λεγόμενον γάρ οίδεν μόνον, εΐ
δ' αληθές, ούχ έμαθεν). Übrigens kommt das Wort έρμηνευτική in den pseudo-platonischen
Definitiones in seiner sonst gebräuchlichen Bedeutung vor, 414 d 4: "Ονομα διάλεκτος άσιλιθετος
έρμηνεντική τοϋ τε κατά τής ουσίας κατηγορουμένου και παντός του μή καθ' έαντοϋ λεγομένου.
(Nomen, zuzusammengesetzte Ausdrucksweise für etwas seinem Wesen entsprechend
Bezeichnetes, sowie auch für alles von diesem Ausgesagtes). — Pierre Chantraine, Dictionnaire
Etymologique de la Langue Grecque, Histoire des Mots, Paris, 1970, S. 373, sagt ausdrücklich,
„Terme technique sans étymologid'. Vgl. auch F. Solmsen, Ein dorisches Komödienstück in Rheinisches
Museum für Philologie NF 63, 1908, 329-340. (dort s. 336 f über den ionischen Ursprung
der Worte έρμηνεΰσα, έρμηνεύς).<br>

Abstract: Jan Edward Garrett meint, daß es bei Gadamer zwei verschiedene Begriffe der Horizont-
verschmelzung gäbe, d. h. eine schweigende Horizontverschmelzung und eine explizite und ab-
sichtliche, die der ersteren folge. Die Horizontverschmelzung ist aber in Wirklichkeit ein Phäno-
men nach der Entstehung des historischen Bewußtseins, während die Vermittlung der Vergangen-
heit mit der Gegenwart ein allgemeines Phänomen darstellt, das immer geschieht, obwohl die Ho-
rizontverschmelzung eine spezifische Form der Vermittlung ist. Garrett verwechselt die Hori-
zontverschmelzung mit der Vermittlung überhaupt. Die „schweigende Horizontverschmelzung"
ist ein attributiver Widerspruch, weil die Horizontverschmelzung eine mit dem historischen Be-
wußtsein vollzogene, absichtliche und „kontrollierte" (312) Vermittlung ist. Die Vermittlung
überhaupt beginnt vom Anfang des Verstehens an, während die Horizontverschmelzung erst an
seinem Ende stattfindet. Vgl. J. E. Garrett: Hans-Georg Gadamer on „Fusion of Horizons".

Abstract: Le présent article s'inscrit dans le prolongement d'une recherche en cours portant sur la compréhension et l'analyse des usages de jeux vidéo en ligne par des personnes en situation de handicap. En soulignant les apports épistémiques et méthodologiques d'une ethnographie en ligne, il pointe les limites heuristiques de la classique distinction entre un monde supposé réel qui se verrait redoublé par son pendant virtuel. L'exemple précis des jeux vidéo permet ici non seulement de questionner la dichotomie virtuel / réel mais aussi la définition traditionnelle du jeu élaborée à partir du modèle de la règle distincte de son effectuation concrète. L'analyse des pratiques ludiques de personnes en situation de handicap pointe enfin la nécessité d'une attention portée sur les modes d'appropriation corporelle d'un dispositif techno-communicationnel. En conséquence, il s'agit d'envisager les formes d'expériences vidéo-ludiques comme des « instances de procuration » autorisant l'exploration sensible de mondes moins disjoints les uns des autres qu'en interaction constante. This article is a continuation of ongoing research to understand the uses of online gaming by people with physical disabilities. By emphasizing the epistemic and methodological contributions of online ethnography, it points to the heuristic limits of the traditional distinction between a supposedly real world and that which would be repeated in the virtual. The specific use of video games in this example, makes it possible not only to question the virtual–real dichotomy, but also to question the traditional definition of the game which starts from the premise that the rule is distinct from its concrete execution. Analysis of the recreational practices of disabled people also points to the need for attention to modes of bodily appropriation of techno-communication devices. In the end, it is a question of considering video entertainment experiences like "instances of proxy," authorizing the sensitive exploration of worlds that are less disconnected and instead are in constant interaction.<br>

Abstract: Dès ses premières réflexions portant sur le volontaire et l'involontaire, Ricœur aborde frontalement l'énigme du mal. Si celle-ci croise la tradition biblique et la philosophie, elle ne conduit pas la pensée à souscrire à une théodicée mais à élaborer une pensée de l'agir. Pour Ricœur, l'être est acte plutôt que substance car il engage à l'action pour répliquer au mal.<br>

Abstract: Si comme Foucault lui-même le souligne, la question de la vérité occupe dans
toute sa recherche une place à différents égards cruciale (Foucault 1994 III : 30-
31, IV : 693), ce n'est qu'à partir des années 1980 qu'elle devient ensemble à
la problématique du sujet la préoccupation principale du philosophe. En effet,
déjà dans ses recherches sur la sexualité, Foucault s'est intéressé à une forme
particulière d'assujettissement à l'œuvre dans la pastorale chrétienne et qui sera
par la suite un modèle exemplaire pour les actions disciplinaires (Foucault 1994
III: 256-257, IV: 125-129, 148, 383-385, 783-788). Le sujet est contraint
d'avouer la vérité sur sa vie la plus intime, et notamment celle sexuelle, « pour
mieux renoncer à lui-même et se soumettre à son directeur de conscience » (Granjon
2005 : 42). Il s'agit d'un processus de formation du sujet dans un rapport à soi
aliéné. Selon FOUCAULT (1994 III : 551), ce modèle de formation du sujet est à
l'œuvre également dans « toutes les grandes machines disciplinaires : casernes,
écoles, ateliers et prisons [...] qui permettent de cerner l'individu, de savoir ce
qu'il est, ce qu'il fait, ce qu'on peut en faire, où il faut le placer, comment le
placer parmi les autres ». En 1980 lors d'une leçon au Collège de France pour
le cours intitulé « Du gouvernement des vivants », Foucault (2012 : 80-81) refor-
mule la question de la formation du sujet dans les termes de « régimes de vérité ».
Les années 1980 représentent un tournant dans les orientations analytiques du
philosophe. Dans un article paru en 1981, FOUCAULT (1994 IV : 693) annonce son
projet de recherche à venir, toutefois interrompu par sa mort prématurée. Il
reviendra à plusieurs reprises sur ce changement de thème directeur en essayant
aussi de montrer qu'il était sous-jacent dans ses recherches antérieures.<br>

Abstract: On fait référence à la différence entre éthique et morale proposée par P. Ricœur
(1990) : « Je réserverai le terme d'"éthique" pour la visée d'une vie accomplie
sous le signe des actions estimées bonnes et celui de "morale" pour le côté
obligatoire, marqué par des normes, des obligations, des interdictions. » Dans ce
sens, selon une perspective éthique, la migration devrait pouvoir se justifier
comme action estimée bonne pour tous. Il ne serait pas nécessaire de recourir
à une légitimité morale octroyée pour des raisons de force majeure (la pauvreté,
la guerre, les besoins familiaux).<br>

Abstract: While identity researchers are utilizing a variety of methods, the potential advantages of combinations of qualitative and quantitative methods remain largely unexploited. This article discusses the interplay of methods, theoretical content and meta-theoretical assumptions in identity research and calls for the use of mixed methods. The article applies a symbolic interactionist perspective and discusses what aspects of identification different methodological approaches provide insight into. It is discussed how different methodologies imply different assumptions about identity, particularly regarding the stability of identities, the constitution of identities and the conception of meaning. The influential quantitative Burke–Tully approach is brought into focus and compared to different qualitative approaches, particularly narrative interviews. A quantitative self-report measure neglects the narrative, performative and embodied quality of identification. However, the quantitative approach of Burke and Tully enables the systematic, standardized comparison of individuals making it possible to examine patterns of identification in large populations. Since different methods enable the study of different aspects of identity, while remaining blind to other aspects, mixed methods may contribute to more complete insights into identity processes. Importantly, mixed methods may be used to examine patterns available to the outside observer and the lifeworld of the individual actor and thus to both explain and understand.<br>

pologie historique déjà évoqués au début de cet article, il faut rappeler les fructueux échanges
empiriques que les historiens, en particulier pour le Moyen Âge, ont pu avoir depuis vingt ans avec
différents courants de l'anthropologie, qu'il s'agisse par exemple de l'anthropologie juridique dans
le cadre des débats sur la mutation de l'an mil (cf. les travaux de Dominique Barthélémy [1997,
1999]), de l'anthropologie visuelle de chercheurs comme Hans Belting (cf. Schmitt [2002];
ou Baschet [2008]), de l'anthropologie des pratiques d'écriture dans la lignée de Jack Goody
(pour une présentation synthétique de l'historiographie médiévale dans ce domaine, cf. Chastang
[2008]), de l'anthropologie économique (avec Feller, Gramain & Weber [2005]), ou encore des
réflexions de Maurice Godelier ou de Louis Dumont (mobilisés par Iogna-Prat [1998, 2006]).<br>

Abstract: Interestingly enough it appears that the structural features of reconciliation show a re-
versed version of the structural features of evil. Resolving the evil I do toward the other re-
quires that I am able to say what I have done wrong (the reverse of silence and the
tinspeakable), that I recognize my guilt (which is incompatible with splitting) and that I ask for
forgiveness (which is very shameful, but may résolve shame when penitence is accepted and
forgiveness is given); see Glas (in press); Muφhyand Hampton (1988); Volf (1996).<br>

possible usurpation of divine sovereignty (GB 268).<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

worldview. Whether or not we realize it, we all have certain presuppositions and biases that
affect the way we view all of life and reality. A worldview is like a set of lenses which taint our
vision or alter the way we perceive the world around us.' (http://christianworldview.net/,

Abstract: By inquiring into the translatability of Judaism and philosophy, we reawaken an ancient problem that asks after philosophy’s relation with religion:
         What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?Translation is a rejuvenated means of wrestling with this irksome question, which seeks to understand how multiple approaches to meaning and being can exist concurrently or whether any interaction forfeits multiplicity for the primacy of one form over all others. The specific issue that linguistic versions of the problem address is whether or not the languages that Judaism and philosophy speak are separate and distinct and if those distinctions are established on deeper, non-linguistic ground. For this reason, translation not only raises the problem of articulacy and context in interlingual translations, it also alludes to an ontological or metaphysical separation that speaks of different, non-shared worlds. Whether or not a translation theory addresses, repairs or upholds the opposition between religion and philosophy is in question, and translation becomes a vehicle for discussing what Jerusalem has to offer Athens and what Athens has for Jerusalem. In this essay, I examine the translation problem as an attempt to repair or re-gloss the relation between Judaism and philosophy by way of Michael Fagenblat’s recovery of Emmanuel Levinas’ thought in his work,A Covenant of Creatures: Levinas’s Philosophy of Judaism(2010).<br>

Abstract: Societies, like individuals, strive to have positive self-concepts. They endow stories of their origin and associate their course through history with ethical principles that attest to who they are and how they want to be seen. Such principles define the society for its members and for the world at large. But all societies must at some time confront evidence of actions undertaken in their name that violate their fundamental principles and conflict with their desired self-image. Following a glance at the basic elements of the politics of history and identity, the author suggests two sources of the tensions between "bad acts" and positive self-concepts. Both relate to shifts in developmental time. First, actions not considered wrong when they were undertaken in the past are inconsistent with current expectation. Second, transsocietal differences in normative frameworks lead to cross-boundary criticisms of behavior in which the critics' societies likely engaged at an earlier time. Accusations or criticisms generally meet with defensive, often hostile responses. Hypocrisy tends to rule in most cases, with little or no normative learning.<br>

Abstract: The myth of an economy where nobody could have a predominant position, has lost its credibility. The presentiment of a high risk of social explosion makes companies undertake tentative moral legitimation. Thus, a new paradigm develops according to which the firm has to care for the satisfaction of public interest if "it wants to try to win forgiveness" for misbehavior towards the decorum rules of the atomicity of competition. Thus, there is a wave of "business ethics industry" building up. However, the stock exchange performances considered as ethical, are not different from others! The market does not seem to be able to say why it might be interesting to invest in stock considered as ethical. Moreover, opinion polls reveal a very significant discrepancy between the characterization of "the responsible company" as defined by itself or by notation agencies and, on the other hand, the hierarchy of criteria according to the answers of polled people. When companies and agencies favor sustainable development and good governance, rejecting child labor and so on, polled people consider that the paramount criterion of ethical conduct is personnel management. The problem is right here. Such is the view of a positively critical economist, situated at the point where macroeconomics meets corporate management.<br>

Abstract: On September 11, 2001, the passengers and crew members aboard Flight 93 responded to the hijacking of their airplane by organizing a counterattack against the hijackers. The airplane crashed into an unpopulated field, causing no damage to human lives or national landmarks beyond the lives of those aboard the airplane. We draw on this story of courageous collective action to explore the question of what makes this kind of action possible. We propose that to take courageous collective action, people need three narratives-a personal narrative that helps them understand who they are beyond the immediate situation and manage the intense emotions that accompany duress, a narrative that explains the duress that has been imposed upon them sufficiently to make moral and practical judgments about how to act, and a narrative of collective action-and the resources that make the creation of these narratives feasible. We also consider how the creation of these narratives is relevant to courageous collective action in more common organizational circumstances, and identify how this analysis suggests new insights into our understanding of the core framing tasks of social movements, ways in which social movement actors draw on social infrastructure, the role of discourse and morality in social movements, the formation of collective identity, and resource mobilization.<br>

Abstract: La réflexion offerte dans cet essai s'inscrit dans une entreprise d'approfondissement de la compréhension générale que nous avons de l'activité politique (parler, écrire, revendiquer, mettre en scène), et particulièrement de la relation que cette activité entretient avec l'idée de l'émancipation. Plus précisément, il s'agit de prendre pour objet d'exploration théorique le fait de parole, défini en termes d'articulation performative des espaces-temps humains, et d'en faire le paradigme de toute action politique. L'analyse de ce paradigme, au terme, permettra de pointer vers une matière utopique qui se qualifie à la fois comme événement et comme permanence du commun. /// In this article, the author seeks a better understanding of the modalities of political action (speaking, writing, claming, staging), and more specifically of the relation between political action and the idea of emancipation. To do so, the author proposes that the speech act, comprehended as the performed articulation of lived space/time, is to be taken as the paradigm of political action. Further analysis of this paradigm, as developed in the article, compels the manifestation of a philosophical object which qualifies both as event and as the manifestation of the perennially of the common.<br>

Abstract: Families of squatters who had settled in a quiet neighborhood of Paris wished to send their children to the local school. Our ethnohistorical inquiry explores how the mobilization in favor of schooling the children was embedded in other controversies and mobilizations that arose from the squatters' presence in the occupied building. Many collective social actors (associations, unions, administrations, and politicians) were involved in conflicting mobilizations in an ongoing struggle of competing arguments. The contemporary crisis of the French model of political representation has enabled the emergence of new forms of collective protest: new ways of defining social problems and a new repertory of civil actions, that is, the "mediatization" of social action and the recourse to litigation. Our study suggests some of the possible extensions and limitations of this movement, especially in the context of action taken by teachers' unions and parents' associations.<br>

Abstract: The onset of dementia raises troubling questions. Does the person with dementia still recognize you? If someone cannot recognize you, can they still care about you? This essay takes such questions as the entry point for a broader inquiry into recognition, its linkages to care, and how claims to social and political "recognition" are linked to, or premised on, the demonstrated capacity to "recognize" people and things. In the words and actions of her severely impaired mother, the author finds guidance toward a better, more compassionate question to ask about dementia: how can we best strive to "keep the cares together"?<br>

Abstract: This essay traces the involution of anthropological understanding from the 1950s to the present. It is shown that as the conception of "doing ethnography" changed from sensing patterns to reading texts, and from reading texts to writing culture, so too did the content of anthropological knowledge change from being multi-sensory to being self-centred. The essay also proposes a way of escaping the tunnel-vision of contemporary (post-modern) ethnography — namely, by treating cultures as constituted by a particular interplay of the senses which the ethnographer must simulate before making any attempt to describe or evoke the culture under study. /// Cet article trace l'enchevêtrement qu'a subi l'étude de l'anthropologie depuis les années cinquante à nos jours. L'auteur démontre que le concept de "faire de l'ethnographie" a changé radicalement — de la perception sensorielle à la lecture des textes et de cette lecture à l'acte d'écrire une culture. Également, le contenu des connaissances anthropologiques a subi un changement du multi-sensoriel à l'égocentrique. L'article propose comment s'éloigner du champ de vue plutôt étroit de l'ethnographie contemporaine (dite post-moderne) en suggérant que les ethnographes traitent les cultures telles que constituées par l'action réciproque particulière des sens qui doivent être simulés avant que les ethnographes puissent essayer de décrire ou d'évoquer la culture en question.<br>

Abstract: This paper argues against the all too common dichotomy of globalization into a process of homogenization or a process of significant diversification. The paper seeks to bridge this dichotomy by arguing for the relative autonomy of culture with respect to global political-economy, for the plurality of voices that constitute ongoing social interaction, and for a vision of actors operating in fields of power that position human agents differentially. The essay makes use of world systems theory to illustrate the merits and problems of global analysis while focussing on the ethnographic examples of French and Michigan wine growers. /// L'article s'inscrit en faux contre la vision dichotomique et récurrente de la mondialisation selon laquelle il s'agit soit d'un processus d'homogénéisation, soit d'un profond processus de diversification. L'article cherche à surmonter cette dichotomie en soutenant l'existence d'une autonomie relative des cultures face à l'économie politique mondiale, d'une pluralité des voix qui constituent les interactions sociales en cours et d'une vision qui situe les acteurs au sein de cercles de pouvoir qui leur imposent des positions différentielles. L'essai se sert de la théorie des systèmes-monde pour illustrer le bien-fondé et les défauts des analyses de niveau mondial. Il met l'accent sur des exemples ethnographiques de viticulteurs de la France et du Michigan.<br>

Abstract: Much archaeological scholarship on consumption has approached its subject matter as the means to an end—e.g., as a way of studying socioeconomic status—rather than as a proper object of study in its own right. The "consumer choice" school, and, more recently, advocates of consumer behavior studies, have supported approaches that emphasize quantitative methods, at the same time downplaying the "qualitative" or symbolic aspects of consumption. A considerable body of literature on the symbolic aspects of consumption exists both in historical archaeology and other fields. The intention of this essay is to draw together this recent literature on consumption and combine it into a single approach that emphasizes shopping as the meaningful action at the very heart of consumption. With the emphasis on agency, this approach presents shopping as that crucial moment of transformation where identity, intention, and symbol combine in the decision to purchase, to own, an object.<br>

Abstract: Recent attempts by geographers to explore the human experience of space have focused on overt behavior and its cognitive foundations. The language and style of our descriptions, however, often fail to speak in categories appropriate for the elucidation of lived experience, and we need to evaluate our modes of knowing in the light of modes of being in the everyday world. Phenomenologists provide some guidelines for this task. They point to the preconsciously given aspects of behavior and perception residing in the "lifeworld"-the culturally defined spatiotemporal setting or horizon of everyday life. Scientific procedures which separate "subjects" and "objects," thought and action, people and environments are inadequate to investigate this lifeworld. The phenomenological approach ideally should allow lifeworld to reveal itself in its own terms. In practice, however, phenomenological descriptions remain opaque to the functional dynamism of spatial systems, just as geographical descriptions of space have neglected many facets of human experience. There are certain avenues for dialogue between these two disciplines in three major research areas: the sense of place, social space, and time-space rhythms. Such a dialogue could contribute to a more humanistic foundation for human geography.<br>

Abstract: How places are made is at the core of human geography. Overwhelmingly the discipline has emphasized the economic and material forces at work. Neglected is the explicit recognition of the crucial role of language, even though without speech humans cannot even begin to formulate ideas, discuss them, and translate them into action that culminates in a built place. Moreover, words alone, used in an appropriate situation, can have the power to render objects, formerly invisible because unattended, visible, and impart to them a certain character: thus a mere rise on a flat surface becomes something far more-a place that promises to open up to other places-when it is named "Mount Prospect." The different ways by which language contributes toward the making of place may be shown by exploring a wide range of situations and cultural contexts. Included in this paper are the contexts of hunter-gatherers, explorers and pioneers, intimate friendship, literary London, Europe in relation to Asia, and Chinese gardening and landscape art. There is a moral dimension to speech as there is to physical action. Thus warm conversation between friends can make the place itself seem warm; by contrast, malicious speech has the power to destroy a place's reputation and thereby its visibility. In the narrative-descriptive approach, the question of how and why language is effective is implied or informally woven into the presentation, but not explicitly formulated or developed. Ways of making place in different situations-from the naming of objects by pioneers, to informal conversation in any home, to the impact of written texts-are highlighted and constitute the paper's principal purpose, rather than causal explanations, which must vary with each type of linguistic behavior and each situation.<br>

Abstract: On peut noter que Jean-Francois Billeter etablit une distinction generale entre les
deux systemes de pensee, grecque et chinoise, qui recoupe, dans ses grandes lignes, celle
exposee par Jullien: "On peut apercevoir [...], me semble-t-il, une difference fondamen-
tale entre la pensee grecque et la tradition intellectuelle qui en est issue d'une part, et
l'ensemble (ou presque) de la pensee chinoise de l'autre. Notre tradition intellectuelle a
eu tendance a privilegier la conscience thetique et la conscience reflechie, qui font toutes
deux abstraction du mouvement, du changement, des transformations dans lesquels nous
sommes continuellement pris dans les faits. [...] La philosophie a par consequent eu dans
notre civilisation une vocation "theorique," contemplative. La pensee chinoise me parait
avoir ete, dans l'ensemble, beaucoup plus fidele aux donnees de lexperience commune, au
rapport spontane que nous entretenons avec nous-memes et avec les choses dans le cours
de nos activites. Elle a donne la priorite aux formes que notre vie consciente prend lorsque
nous nous mouvons, que nous agissons, etc., et a celles que la realite a pour nous dans ces
moments-la" ("Comment lire Wang Fuzhi?" 111-12).<br>

Abstract: Beckett's aggressiveness in crossing generic lines paradoxically accompanied a keen sensitivity to genre and medium differences that often constrained his writing. My argument here is that this combination of abandon and respect was founded in a recognition not just of formal differences in art but of differences in the ways we think. In the wake of groundbreaking work by Jerry Fodor and Howard Gardner, there has been a great deal of research advancing (and qualifying) a modular conception of how the mind evolved and how it continues to work in modern humans. This work puts new light on both the formal differences between mimesis and diegesis, and on Beckett's approach to these two different ways of rendering narrative. Particularly it makes clear why Beckett should have so radically subordinated character and action to staged diegesis in his later work.<br>

Abstract: How does international interaction shape states' patterns of thought, emotion, and action? This paper examines the processes by which motives and practices feed each other in reproducing historical structures. An artificial intelligence model defines state-subjects as cultures combining special meanings that produce causal attribution, state self-identification, emotions, and action motives. These special meanings are built from subjective cultural categories describing social acts and group character of the self and others. Anger, pride, fear, and relief motivate action. A collection of such subject-cultures may produce a pattern of actions that reiterates the cultures. The model discriminates between those combinations of elements in special meanings which reproduce subjects and historical structures, and those which do not. The meanings discovered in such reproduction analysis can be validated by discourse analysis.<br>

Abstract: Dans cette perspective, toute pratique de lecture
peut être décrite comme un mouvement en trois temps :
«avant lire »/«lire »/«après lire». Des «intérêts
à la lecture » qui trouvent leur origine dans la situation
du lecteur - « avant lire » - incitent à un « faire » - « lire » -
qui porte à conséquences, immédiates ou différées
- «après lire» - et qui consolident en retour les «intérêts
à la lecture ». L'accent mis classiquement sur la seconde
phase (« lire ») - qui est aussi la plus difficilement
accessible à l'enquête - est alors déplacé sur les deux autres.<br>

Abstract: The past decade has brought advanced information technologies, which include electronic messaging systems, executive information systems, collaborative systems, group decision support systems, and other technologies that use sophisticated information management to enable multiparty participation in organization activities. Developers and users of these systems hold high hopes for their potential to change organizations for the better, but actual changes often do not occur, or occur inconsistently. We propose adaptive structuration theory (AST) as a viable approach for studying the role of advanced information technologies in organization change. AST examines the change process from two vantage points: (1) the types of structures that are provided by advanced technologies, and (2) the structures that actually emerge in human action as people interact with these technologies. To illustrate the principles of AST, we consider the small group meeting and the use of a group decision support system (GDSS). A GDSS is an interesting technology for study because it can be structured in a myriad of ways, and social interaction unfolds as the GDSS is used. Both the structure of the technology and the emergent structure of social action can be studied. We begin by positioning AST among competing theoretical perspectives of technology and change. Next, we describe the theoretical roots and scope of the theory as it is applied to GDSS use and state the essential assumptions, concepts, and propositions of AST. We outline an analytic strategy for applying AST principles and provide an illustration of how our analytic approach can shed light on the impacts of advanced technologies on organizations. A major strength of AST is that it expounds the nature of social structures within advanced information technologies and the key interaction processes that figure in their use. By capturing these processes and tracing their impacts, we can reveal the complexity of technology-organization relationships. We can attain a better understanding of how to implement technologies, and we may also be able to develop improved designs or educational programs that promote productive adaptations.<br>

Abstract: Rational choice theory and the critical theory of Jurgen Habermas exclude important social categories from their analyses of strategic interaction. Successful strategic action in many contexts, however, depends upon the irreducibly intersubjective categories of the lifeworld. I defend this claim by analyzing the use of focal points to solve the multiple equilibria problem in coordination games, reconstructing both the generation of the salience behind focal points as well as the strategic rationality of using them. The goal of this reconstruction is to demonstrate the compatibility of what appears to be mutually hostile research traditions, validating the intuition that together they provide a better understanding of politics than either school can on its own.<br>

Abstract: Two traditions have been vying for supremacy in the area of cultural analysis. The first sees culture as encompassing the totality of socially learned human phenomena; the second restricts the term to shared mental-primarily cognitive-properties. David Schneider has achieved a dominant positon in the latter school. In this paper I examine critically Schneider's approach to culture, with special attention to the problems raised by his perspective with respect to intracultural consistency and contradiction. While agreeing that the ethnographer must attempt to shun prior assumptions as to the nature of symbolic and conceptual domains recognized by the people under study, that it is incumbent on the anthropologist to comprehend reality from the natives' point of view before attempting to formulate laws or generalizations, that the symbolic systems and their associated meanings plays an essential part in making sense of any human action system, I shall argue that cultures do not exhibit the degree of integration, consistency, and articulation assumed by Schneider, that in his attempt to render culture wholly integrated and consisten he strips the concept of its analytic utility, that social action and symbolic systems are empirically and epistemologically more closely intertwined than he would lead us to believe, and that the very debate over what culture "really" is constitutes an exercise in reification.<br>

Abstract: The argument of Evans-Pritchard's classic The Nuer has been subject to conflicting interpretations. We examine these interpretations and then present a reading of the work that treats it as a whole. A key conclusion is that Evans-Pritchard distinguishes among three aspects of the "systems" he describes: (1) logical possibilities immanent in all forms of action, (2) cultural or local idioms in terms of which action is formulated and expressed, and (3) conditions and patterns of action. With this framework he develops, through an examination of the way interests in cattle are translated into political practices, an analysis in which the central theoretical problem is the relationship of structure to human agency. Our reading raises questions about the utility of standard classifications of theoretical orientations in social and cultural anthropology, particularly of the category of structural-functionalism, of which The Nuer is taken to be a central text.<br>

Abstract: The recollections of elderly men of work in a time of full employment are the focus of this paper. It is based on in-depth qualitative interviews with men who were young parents in the mid-1950s. Drawing on literature about masculinity, post-war Fordism and the constitution of self-identity through narrative, it explores their themes of how central security was to their identity as providers, and examines what satisfactions they got from working. The narrative bookends of their experience are strong memories of their parents in the Depression, and acute awareness of the contemporary insecurity of their children and grandchildren.<br>

Abstract: The conflict between President John F. Kennedy and the management of the steel industry in April, 1962 has been interpreted in an unsatisfactory manner. Many of Kennedy's reactions appear to be inexplicable and do not conform with the impression of him either as an "idealist without illusions" or the calculating cynic of recent revisionist writing. This paper is an attempt to provide another understanding of Kennedy's behaviour. We argue that Kennedy was neither hero nor villain, but a practising politician aware of the obligations and function of his profession in a liberal democratic polity. We suggest that Kennedy was aware of the sensibilities of his constituency and that he possessed a finely attuned ear to the language and discourse of American politics in the early 1960s. Consequently Kennedy realised the peril, in the steel crisis, to his political standing and thus felt compelled to embark on a dramatic and potentially dangerous course of action. We attempt to sustain this argument by closely examining the political language of the participants, relying heavily for our analysis on the writings of the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, the Italian semiologist, Umberto Eco and the Russian linguist V.N. Volosinov.<br>

Abstract: In his theory of communication Schutz exhibits a significant tension between two fundamental perspectives, phenomenology and pragmatism, and in the long run he fails to reconcile the contradictory implications these perspectives have with regard to his model of interaction. The main problem seems to be the notion of sense-constitution. Schutz develops two distinguishable accounts of constitution: an egological one and a model based on the phenomenon of direct interaction of empirical subjects. Two key concepts are related to these different modes of constitution: the model of appresentation with regard to language, symbols and signs, and the model of synchronisation as triangulation of streams of consciousness and outward action sequences. They are analyzed as significant for two different methods and two different theories of communication. I propose some reasons for Schutz's insistence on a phenomenological account of the ego and the constitution of sense, and offer a brief sketch of an alternative strategy that is implicit in Schutz's theory.<br>

Abstract: This article begins by presenting experimental evidence that remains unexplained by standard and utility-extended economic models: experimental subjects tend to honor their promises even on occasions when an assessment of consequences asks them to defect; subjects voluntarily contribute to collective goods, and this contribution is highly conditional on others contributing as well; subjects evaluate and value the intentions behind actions as well as the consequences of actions. Arguments are sought for in moral philosophy that would more plainly explain the collected experimental evidence and that would help economists revise their explanatory frames. The hypothesis advanced is that the observed behavior may be interpreted as resulting from the moral strength of indignation and justice norms.<br>

Abstract: Although studies in organizational storytelling have dealt extensively with the relationship between narrative, power and organizational change, little attention has been paid to the implications of this for ethics within organizations. This article addresses this by presenting an analysis of narrative and ethics as it relates to the practice of organizational downsizing. Drawing on Paul Ricoeur's theories of narrative and ethics, we analyze stories of organizational change reported by employees and managers in an organization that had undergone persistent downsizing. Our analysis maintains that the presence of a dominant story that seeks to legitimate organizational change also serves to normalize it, and that this, in turn, diminishes the capacity for organizations to scrutinize the ethics of their actions. We argue that when organizational change narratives become singularized through dominant forms of emplotment, ethical deliberation and responsibility in organizations are diminished. More generally, we contend that the narrative closure achieved by the presence of a dominant narrative amongst employees undergoing organizational change is antithetical to the openness required for ethical questioning.<br>

Abstract: « Le temps présent est devenu éphémère, irréversible et insaisissable »,
dit A. Y. Gourevitch. Il est aussi homogène et orienté. L'historien sovié-
tique ajoute : « Pour la première fois, l'homme a constaté que le temps dont
il ne décelait le cours qu'à travers les événements, ne s'arrête pas, même en
l'absence d'événement. » A. Y. Gourevitch réintroduit ici une acception
métaphysique du temps, s'il entend bien par événements des phénomènes,
alors que dans le reste de sa contribution, il paraît convaincu de la maté-
rialité du temps. La preuve expérimentale de l'existence du temps hors des
phénomènes n'a pas été fournie et ne peut l'être. Les temps dans lesquels
nous vivons, sont celui de notre existence même, celui de notre société, celui
des mouvements des astres, etc. L'homme ne « constate » donc pas que le
temps ne s'arrête pas même en l'absence d'événement, ces événements lui
sont cachés par l'usage d'un temps quantitatif qui se réfère à l'un d'entre
eux exprimé par les horloges, devenu la référence unique, apparemment
« dématérialisé » par son omnipotence et occultant l'existence des autres
temps.<br>

Abstract: Par exemple, Claude Allègre était bien considéré par la presse de droite, tandis
que celle de gauche s'est montrée plus critique à son égard. La raison en est que le
ministre de l'Education nationale s'était mis à dos le personnel enseignant, considéré
comme majoritairement à gauche. /-<br>

Abstract: Si la Danse du Lion ne présente pas en soi un caractère religieux, les v ux
(offerts contre des dons en argent) sont proférés devant des autels, et prennent ainsi
un vague caractère de bénédiction. Ces autels installés dans les boutiques, sont le
plus souvent dédiés au Dieu du sol (ou « Maître des lieux ») mais aussi à d'autres divinités
dont les effigies sont promenées dans les défilés mis en place dans la Petite Asie au cours
des années 1990. Pour une description détaillée de la Danse du Lion, cf. Raulin, 2000,

Abstract: This article explores Arendt's approach to narrative in theory as well as practice. The first part looks at Arendt's use of philosophical sources from the tradition—Aristotle, Augustine and Hegel—with an eye to how her appropriation of these figures differs from that of contemporary philosophers of narrative. Three of Arendt's typically bold and rich claims about narrative action emerge as important: the notion of action as revealing an agent's own daimõn; the condition that such action be revealable within a world or shared public space which has resilience yet vulnerability; and the potential for agents revealed within such a world to discover some form of narrative rebirth in their efforts at story-telling. The second section examines the extent to which Arendt herself allowed those claims to be tested and thought through in her own attempts (in Men in Dark Times, Rahel Varnhagen and elsewhere) at constructing biographical narratives<br>

Abstract: Individual agency is necessary for the possibility of rhetoric, and especially for deliberative rhetoric, which enables the composition of what Latour calls a good common world. Drawing on neurophenomenology, this essay defines individual agency as the process through which organisms create meanings through acting into the world and changing their structure in response to the perceived consequences of their actions. Conceiving of agency in this way enables writers to recognize their rhetorical acts, whether conscious or nonconscious, as acts that make them who they are, that affect others, and that can contribute to the common good. Responsible rhetorical agency entails being open to and responsive to the meanings of concrete others, and thus seeing persuasion as an invitation to listeners as also always agents in persuasion.<br>

Abstract: Dans Les Chemins du paradis, Gorz est plus précis. En fait, il n'y a pas deux niveaux (macro-
social hétéronome et individuel autonome), mais trois (les deux précédents plus un niveau micro-
social autonome). Résumons ces trois niveaux: « 1) le travail macrosocial hétéronome, organisé
à l'échelle de la société tout entière et qui assure le fonctionnement ainsi que la couverture des
besoins de base [de l'ensemble des membres de la société] ; 2) les activités microsociales, coopéra-
tives, communautaires ou associatives, auto-organisées à l'échelle locale et qui auront un caractère
facultatif et volontaire, sauf dans les cas où elles se substituent au travail macrosocial pour couvrir
des besoins de base ; 3) les activités autonomes correspondant aux projets et désir personnels des
individus, familles ou petits groupes. » (Gorz [1988], p. 125-126.)<br>

Abstract: Literature discussing rhetoric is mainly concerned with rhetoric per se - its structure, and the categorization of arguments by kind. Rarely do rhetorical studies examine the actual effects on audiences, and auditors' reactions. On the other hand, sociological studies of scientific controversies look at rhetoric - or argumentation - in action, but with few references to rhetorical studies. The purpose of this paper is to integrate rhetorical studies into the sociology of technology in order to integrate the concept of action into discourse analysis. I intend to show how the use of discourse to enroll actors in a health technology is intimately linked to action. I deconstruct the promoters' strategy into two discursive components - the utility component and the fear-reduction component - to show how the rhetoric of expectations (utility) and representations (fear) contingently shape the fate of a technology.<br>

Abstract: Ruskin's complex attitude toward women has long been important to feminist and Victorian studies; over a quarter-century ago Kate Millett published Sexual Politics and its famous attack on Ruskin's essay "Of Queens' Gardens." She charged Ruskin with promoting a sugar-coated but perfidious system of separate spheres for men and women. Yet shortly after Ruskin produced that idealized vision of housewife-queens in 1865, he created a new ideal queen in his mythological study The Queen of the Air (1869), this time elaborated from Athena. Through his mythopoesis, Ruskin disrupts both conventional gender categories and his own implication in them. Ruskin presents a series of binary oppositions that he immediately conflates: Athena and Medusa, air and earth, bird and snake, formation and destruction, science and myth, male and female. Ruskin documents the instability of his oppositions through a bizarre "natural language" where real-life creatures such as birds and snakes serve as eternal hieroglyphs, signifying universally recognizable abstractions. That seemingly fixed signs in Athena's hieroglyphic code inevitably change is clear from Ruskin's acknowledgment of Darwin's evolutionary theory. But evolution slips into a wild image of degenerative metamorphosis, where all the divisions that Ruskin has so laboriously noted dissolve. Since Ruskin identifies Athena with each seemingly opposed animal signifier in his language of living hieroglyphs, he subverts all linguistic difference and ultimately feminizes signification itself. Through myth Ruskin creates a mutable language, one where genders as well as signs become mobile rather than fixed.<br>

Abstract: This paper discusses semantic aspects of noun incorporation in Akwesasne Mohawk, one of six Northern Iroquoian languages spoken today. Meanings of verb stems with incorporated nouns are shown to range from literal referents of transitive action to abstract, nontangible metaphors. NI is examined as the structural means through which novel semantic units are formed. These new units expand the interpretative range of basic meanings as part of creative linguistic and conceptual processes. Metaphors are created to fulfill lexical and poetic functions. Data are presented and analyzed from body part and other semantic domains.<br>

Discourse:
I propose, without insisting on the obvious reasons for my choice of terms, to
use the word story for the signified, or narrative content (even if this content
turns out, in a given case, to be low in dramatic intensity or fullness of incident),
to use the word narrative for the signifier, statement, discourse or narrative text
itself, and to use the word narrating for the producing narrative action and, by
extension, the whole of the real or fictional situation in which that action takes
place. (27)<br>

Abstract: Since contending methodological perspectives and different types of research products are founded on irreconcilable philosophical assumptions, the sharp, recurrent debates over social science research methods are likely to be fruitless and counterproductive. This article begins by exposing some of the philosophical assumptions underlying the most recent calls for a unified social science methodology and seeks to help develop a common appreciation of how different kinds of methods and research products advance our understanding of different aspects of social life at different levels of abstraction. Such commonly posited dichotomies as deductivist/inductivist logic, quantitative/qualitative analysis, and nomothetic/idiographic research products are shown to obscure significant differences along a continuum of strategies through which context-bound information and analytic constructs are combined to produce interpretations of varying degrees of complexity or generality. Durkheim's conception of "organic solidarity" in a social "division of labor" serves as a useful metaphor here to capture the complementary roles performed by various research products as well as the trade-offs arising from the strengths and weaknesses of various methodological approaches (ranging from formal and statistical approaches to various case-based and interpretive approaches). Thus, sharp claims regarding the strengths and limitations of particular methods are transformed into elements of an overarching agnostic understanding of the trade-offs and complementarities among these methods. Finally, a distinctive role is identified for an ideal-typical "middle-range" comparative-historical approach in fostering greater communication among a more inclusively defined community of methodologically diverse social scientists.<br>

Abstract: When religious orders are compared on differences in belief described as Pre-Vatican and Post-Vatican they also differ significantly in their preference for certain theologians and their preferences for types of works. Although age also explains this difference, even with age held constant the difference remains. Those with Post-Vatican beliefs express reading preferences and choice of works which affirm action to transform society as distinct from action to adjust to existing patterns.<br>

Date: 4 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Yaroshevsky Peter<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the notion of meaning, particularly as applied to acts of producing and reading texts. The analysis is grounded in principles of activity theory and cultural semiotics and focuses on the ways in which reading takes place among readers and texts in a culturally mediated, codified experience characterized here as the "transactional zone." The author builds on Vygotsky's work to argue that meaning comes through a reader's generation of new texts in response to the text being read. As a means of accounting for this phenomenon, examples are provided from studies illustrating, for instance, Vygotsky's zones of meaning, the dialogic role of composing during a reading transaction, and the necessity of culturally constructed subjectivity in meaning construction. The author concludes by locating meaning in the transactional zone in which signs become tools for extending or developing concepts and the richness of meaning coming from the potential of a reading transaction to generate new texts. "When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean-neither more nor less." (Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass)<br>

Abstract: Assessing the limits of evolutionary and cognitive approaches to the study of culture goes to the heart of an issue that tends to divide humanists and scientists. The issue is how far, in dealing with complex cultural texts and the complex transactions we perform as readers, can we advance by scientific reduction? The issue is vexed by the fact that at times the complexity and novelty of humanistic discourse is little more than obfuscation and strained ingenuity. But such failings discredit neither the search for novelty, nor the earned perception of irreducible complexity, nor the immense importance of work that is necessarily, and terminally, speculative.<br>

Abstract: I discuss several conceptual problems raised by current understandings of political violence, especially as they pertain to actions, motivations, and identities in civil wars. Actions "on the ground" often turn out to be related to local and private conflicts rather than the war's driving (or "master") cleavage. The disjunction between dynamics at the top and at the bottom undermines prevailing assumptions about civil wars, which are informed by two competing interpretive frames, most recently described as "greed and grievance." Rather than posit a dichotomy between greed and grievance, I point to the interaction between political and private identities and actions. Civil wars are not binary conflicts, but complex and ambiguous processes that foster the "joint" action of local and supralocal actors, civilians, and armies, whose alliance results in violence that aggregates yet still reflects their diverse goals. It is the convergence of local motives and supralocal imperatives that endows civil wars with their particular and often puzzling character, straddling the divide between the political and the private, the collective and the individual.<br>

Abstract: Recalling several profound disagreements about business ethics as it is currently discussed in Western societies, I emphasize the need for business ethics as an academic discipline that constitutes the "backbone" for both teaching business ethics and improving business practice (section 1). Then I outline a conceptual framework of business ethics that promotes a "bottom-up" approach (section 2). This "problem- and action-oriented" conception appears to be fruitful in terms of both practical relevance and theoretical understanding. Finally, I argue for (section 3) the relevance of discussing goals at all levels of human action (i.e., individuals, organizations, systems) as well as the indispensability of human rights, and propose Amartya Sen's "goal-rights-system" approach as a normative-ethical framework for business ethics that integrates these two fundamental aspects.<br>

Abstract: There can be ethical understanding of organizational policy issues and that is important. However, there can be policy understanding about what the organization should do without understanding of individual level responsibility. There can be cognitive understanding of both policy and individual level ethics responsibilities and that is important. However, there can be cognitive understanding without affective, emotive concern. intellectual understanding without affective concern can lead to understanding without motivation. There can be cognitive understanding and affective concern and that is important, but not enough. There can be cognitive understanding and affective concern without effective political method. An action-learning approach to organizational ethics can join cognitive understanding of policy and individual level issues with both affective concern and effective political method. Joining of cognitive understanding, affective concern, and effective political method can stimulate and enable ethical character.<br>

Abstract: Shaftesbury's deism, widely representative of eighteenth-century liberal theology, may be profitably viewed as a reaction against Puritanism in particular and Pauline theology in general. Seen from this perspective, it implies, without explicitly asserting, a reduction of moral standards from the infinite conception of moral law characteristic of Protestantism. Shaftesbury showed no appreciation of the need for redemption or forgiveness, and changed the emphasis in religion from devotion to God above all else to a purely anthropocentric morality which God merely supported. But, in spite of the crudity of his theology and the dubious implications of his ethics, Shaftesbury sought to combat some of the harmful psychological effects to which Paulinism might lead when received in the wrong spirit, and manifested genuine religious insight in this effort.<br>

Abstract: The essay sets forth a historical style in ethics. At the center is the explication of meanings forming the life worlds of representative actors in concrete situations. The sense of life world is sketched in terms of intentionality, intersubjectivity, temporality and embodiment. The essay then delineates the kinds of interpretative activity relevant for understanding life situations: the application of received conventions; suspicion of those conventions as distortions of underlying personal/social dynamics; and a dialectical interplay between a retrieval of one's own traditions, and hospitality to understandings of others differently oriented to the situations in question. The goal is the achievement of common ground which enables us to determine "fitting" action, or at least to keep open the wholeness it promises.<br>

Abstract: The authors distinguish three perspectives to be found in contemporary religious social ethics, which stem from three different views of the source and nature of the ethos: the ontological approach, the actional approach and hermeneutic ontology. They trace the implications of each view for both theory and practice; and they consider the prospects for an integrative discipline of religious social ethics which can accommodate all three perspectives.<br>

Abstract: Three approaches to bio-medical ethics are identified: one weighs the values/disvalues of the probable "total" outcome of contemplated actions (value-dominant); the second gives privileged consideration to the likely impact of actions on the "rights" of human subjects involved (obligation-dominant); the third gives pre-eminence to the discretionary judgment of moral actors for the concrete resolution of moral problems (virtue-dominant). The three approaches are clarified through a commentary on the recommendations regarding fetal experimentation of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects. The recommendations are read as virtue-dominant; the essay in contrast argues for an obligation-dominant perspective.<br>

Abstract: The field of library and information science (LIS) has built its practice and research perspective on a logico-analytic philosophy, which has generated useful, tangible technologies. Lately there is interest in nonempirical philosophies, such as hermeneutics and critical theory, to fulfill better LIS' service-oriented mission of providing "information" to user populations. One dimension of critical theory, Jürgen Habermas' theory of communicative action, can expand LIS' conception of information and supplement logico-empirical research methods and research practices. This article examines how LIS, particularly research into librarian-patron interaction and information system design, favors an empiricist view of language and, as a consequence, may be limiting its effectiveness. It proposes how the field might expand to include communicative action in fulfilling its mission and research agenda.<br>

Abstract: Vico maintained that metaphor is a fundamental process of human mental life which bridges the gap between emotion and cognition. This Vichian perspective is reflected in areas of critical theory treating metaphor and other tropes, particularly their use in narrative. In psychology too, the significance of metaphor is increasingly recognized despite the Cartesian emphasis on literal thought and language in contemporary psychology's central paradigm, cognitive science. The paper compares the Cartesian and Vichian perspectives and suggests that the former limits the integrated treatment of cognition and emotion. This is illustrated with an example of how a child's feelings about a distressing situation are both revealed and changed in storytelling. The Vichian perspective is more appropriate to understanding this therapeutic interaction of cognition and emotion through metaphoric narrative play. This perspective has significant echoes in psychoanalytic and textual studies suggesting how sensitivity to the latent content of narrative metaphors offers both speaker and hearer a unique insight into the experience of the narrator.<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo expone los principales resultados de una investigación realizada con el objeto de analizar el papel que cumplen las emociones colectivas en el mantenimiento del orden social. En concreto, trata de explicar el hecho de que las noticias más importantes que aparecen en los medios de comunicación sean noticias de horror, es decir, noticias en las que la muerte siempre aparece en el primer plano de la escena. Los informativos de los medios de comunicación expresan y fomentan la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. Ahora bien, para entender esta cultura es preciso determinar previamente la naturaleza emocional del horror, así como establecer una definición sociológica de este sentimiento. El horror es una emoción compleja compuesta por sentimientos de terror, de asco y de conmoción. El horror, sociológicamente, puede entenderse como "la emoción mediante la que un orden social señala sus límites más extremos". El estudio concluye señalando que existen dos modos alternativos de mantener el orden y la cohesión en el seno de un sistema social. El primer modo de legitimación, característico de las sociedades centrípetas, funciona mediante la gran potencia atractiva que ejerce sobre el campo social un núcleo central de valores sociales positivos. El segundo, característico de las sociedades centrífugas, funciona mediante la gran potencia repulsiva que ejercen sobre el campo social las transgresiones flagrantes del orden moral. El modo típico en el que las sociedades centrífugas regulan el orden social explica la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. /// This article sets out the main results obtained from a research study carried out for the purpose of analysing the role that collective emotions play in maintaining social order. In specifíc terms, it attempts to explain the fact that the most important items of news that appear in the media are news of horror, in other words, news in which death always appears in the foreground. The news programmes of the media express and encourage the culture of horror that is characteristic of our advanced societies. However, in order to understand this culture, we must first establish the emotional nature of horror and also establish a sociological definition of this feeling. Horror is a complex emotion made up of feelings of terror, disgust and shock. Sociologically speaking, horror can be understood as "the emotion through which a social order indicates its outermost limits". The study concludes showing that there are two alternative ways of maintaining order and cohesión within the bosom of a social system. The first method of legitimation, which is characteristic of centripetal societies, works through the great power of attraction it exerts over the social field of a central nucleus of positive social values. The second, which is characteristic of centrifugal societies, works through the great power of repulsion exerted by flagrant transgressions of moral order over the social field. The typical method in which centrifugal societies regulate social order explains the culture of horror that is characteristic of our advanced societies.<br>

Journal Title: Philosophy of Music Education Review<br>
Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i40013929<br>
Date: 4 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Fink-Jensen Kirsten<br>
Abstract: In this paper Kirsten Fink-Jensen suggests how a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective can contribute to the knowledge of learning and teaching processes in music education in school The philosophical frame is Danish philosophy of life, represented by Knud Ejler Løgstrup, and Merleau-Ponty's philosophy of body, both pointing to the wholeness of mind and body in all kinds of actions. Within this framework interpretation is an epistemological, practical-hermeneutic activity based on different analytical methods. Phenomenologically, experiences of music are constituted in an intertwinement of personal, cultural, and local meaning. The challenge facing the teacher is then to understand what becomes meaningful to persons in a given situation. 'Bodily dialogue' is a metaphor of a hermeneutic process of understanding that highlights the importance of bodily aspects in the teacher's answer to a child's musical attuned articulations. This focus can facilitate children's learning processes and change and qualify the teacher's didactic reflections on the impact and progression of music lessons.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we use concepts from actor-network theory (ANT) to interpret the sequence of events that led to business process change (BPC) failure at a telecommunications company in the United States. Through our intensive examination of the BPC initiative, we find that a number of issues suggested by ANT, such as errors in problematization, parallel translation, betrayal, and irreversible inscription of interests, contributed significantly to the failure. We provide nine abstraction statements capturing the essence of our findings in a concrete form. The larger implication of our study is that, for sociotechnical phenomena such as BPC with significant political components, an ANT-informed understanding can enable practitioners to better anticipate and cope with emergent complexities.<br>

Abstract: How can we understand the social impact of cognitions of a projected future, taking into account both the institutional determinants of hopes and their personal inventiveness? How can we document the repercussions, often contrary to intentions, "back from" such projected futures to the production and transformation of social structures? These are some of the questions to be addressed by a cultural sociology that attempts to look seriously at the effects of a projected future as a dynamic force undergirding social change. In this essay I discuss some of the reasons why the analysis of the future has been so neglected in sociological theory and research, and then sketch a possible framework for reincorporating it that specifies some of the cognitive dimensions of projectivity. In the process, I will show how a focus on future projections can help us make a link between cognition and action in a manner that has so far been neglected in the sociological literature.<br>

Abstract: While concepts of a postinternational politics properly highlight the constant variance of entities in play in international relations, the approach lacks an ontology that shows how such an unstable variety of types of players can coexist in a common field in the first place. This article draws upon Deleuze's philosophy to set out an ontology in which the continual reformulation of entities in play in "postinternational" society can be grasped.This entails a strategic shift from speaking about the "borders" between sovereign states to referring instead to the "margins" between a plethora of entities that are ever open to modifications of identity. The concept of the margin possesses a much wider reach than borders, and focuses continual attention on the meetings and interactions between a range of indeterminate entities whose interactions may determine both themselves and the types of entity that are in play.<br>

Abstract: This paper is the text of an inaugural lecture given as Professor of Modern History in the University of Oxford on 7 November 2008. It arises from a research project entitled Around 1968: Activism, Networks, Trajectories', which involves a team of historians examining samples of activist networks in fourteen European countries, in order to understand ways of becoming an activist, being an activist and making sense of activism. The key terms of this project are transnationalism – tracing resonances and interactions between activists and activist networks across frontiers – and subjectivity – using oral testimony to understand the phenomenon of activism. The framing and presentation of the project incited a rethink of the methods of oral history, not least because the project originated in Oxford, where scepticism persists about the credibility of oral history as a discipline. To persuade this audience of the power of oral history, the approach was taken to locate it at the confluence of three recent developments which have impacted on the study of history as a whole: the linguistic turn, memory studies, and interest in subjectivity, intersubjectivity and the unconscious. These reflections are then used to illuminate evidence drawn from French activists interviewed in the course of 2007 and 2008.<br>

Abstract: The lawyer's crucial role in the contractual process has not been adequately addressed. Transaction cost economics provides a promising approach for doing so, but does not fully account for the lawyer's motivations or intentions. To do so, a more comprehensive theory of human behavior is required. Husserl's phenomenology, specifically his analysis of the natural attitude, provides such a theory. This article describes the role of lawyers in drafting complex entertainment contracts and explains that role in terms of both transaction cost economics and phenomenology. It argues that the two explanations are consistent, but that phenomenology offers additional insights and more fully explains the lawyer's actions.<br>

Abstract: Intertwining ethnographic and literary accounts, this article explores the mutual relationship between suffering and agency. The article describes how young Vietnamese women use narrative to find meaning in the suffering that a late-term abortion causes. Seeking to further develop anthropological use of the concept of social suffering, the article argues that existing scholarship has tended to neglect the importance of human agency and imagination, hinging as it does on suffering as entrenched within structural forces. The article contends that this neglect must be understood in the context of the particular epistemological and ethical conditions under which anthropological studies of human suffering are produced, and that closer attention to the human engagements out of which ethnographic accounts are fashioned may bring into analysis not only the harm that social forces can inflict on people, but also their capacities for action and imagination. / Mêlant ethnographic et récits littéraires, l'article explore la relation réciproque entre souffrance et agency. Il décrit comment les jeunes femmes vietnamiennes utilisent la narration pour trouver un sens à la souffrance causée par une fausse couche tardive. Visant à élargir l'utilisation anthropologique du concept de souffrance humaine, l'auteur montre que les études tendent à négliger l'importance de l'agency et de l'imagination, qui s'articule sur la souffrance enracinée dans les forces structurelles. L'auteur affirme que cette négligence doit être comprise dans le contexte de conditions épistémologiques et éthiques particulières dans lesquelles sont produites les études anthropologiques de la souffrance humaine, et qu'une analyse plus attentive des engagements humains desquels sont issus les récits ethnographiques peut introduire dans la réflexion non seulement le mal que les forces sociales peuvent infliger aux individus, mais aussi les capacités d'action et d'imagination de ceux-ci.<br>

Abstract: La sociabilité méridionale offre l'occasion d'un débat pluri-transdisciplinaire dont l'auteur, à la suite des historiens et des ethnologues, a tenté d'établir une typologie. Il s'agira d'approfondir la dimension politique dont certains cercles de villages font preuve, tant par leur action au sein d'une démocratie participative que par un ensemble de pratiques recourant à la notion de légitimité. Parmi ces mécanismes de contre-pouvoir, le patrimoine politique dont le cercle est le symbole recouvre la notion d'un imaginaire qui trouve à la fois ses sources dans l'histoire locale et dans la mémoire nationale. The southern sociability offers the opportunity of a pluri-transdisciplinary debate of which the author, following historians and ethnologists, tried to establish a typology. The purpose here is to better define the political dimension of some village circles revealed both through their action within a participative democracy and a set of practices appealing to the notion of legitimacy. Among these counterpower mechanisms the political heritage symbolised by the circle covers the notion of imagination rooted both in the local history and the national memory. Die südfranzösische Geselligkeit bietet die Gelegenheit einer inter- und transdisziplinären Debatte. Der Autor hat versucht, deren Typologie zu erstellen, dabei Historikern und Ethnologen folgend. Es handelt sich hier darum, die politische Dimension näher zu bestimmen, die einige Dorfkreise durch ihre Tätigkeit innerhalb einer partizipativen Demokratie sowie durch eine Gesamtheit von Praktiken aufzeigen, die den Begriff der Legitimität in Anspruch nehmen. Unter diesen Gegenkraftsmechanismen umfasst das durch den Kreis symbolisierte politische Erbe den Begriff der Vorstellungswelt, die in der lokalen Geschichte und dem nationalen Gedächtnis gewurzelt ist.<br>

Abstract: L'auteure présente un outil d'exploration des situations sociales : l'arrêt sur image. Elle revient sur ses diverses contraintes techniques et méthodologiques et démontre leur intérêt au sein d'une enquête inspirée par la sociologie de l'action. C'est en tenant compte de la temporalité des actions humaines que l'image semble pouvoir évoluer d'un rôle d'illustration à celui d'outil d'analyse. En passant indifféremment d'image animée à image statique, l'enregistrement vidéo permet un choix de séquences filmées et une lecture multiple des contextes observés. Il aide à suivre finement les activités des acteurs, et à mettre en évidence la différence entre les normes du groupe et celles de l'individu. The author présents a tool for explorating social situations : freezing on the frame. She evokes its various technical and methodological limits and shows its interest for a survey inspired by action sociology. By taking into account the temporality of human actions the image can be more than illustrative and become an analysis tool. By passing indiscriminately from an animated image to a static one video recording permits a sélection of filmed séquences and a multiple reading of the observed contexts. It helps to follow minutely the actors' activities and to show the différence between group norms and individual norms. Die Autorin stellt ein Beobachtungsmittel der sozialen Lagen dar : das Standbild. Sie beschreibt seine verschiedenen technischen und methodologischen Beschränkungen und zeigt sein Interesse für eine von der Handlungssoziologie inspirierten Erhebung. Durch die Berücksichtigung der Zeitlichkeit der Menschenhandlungen ist das Bild mehr als illustrativ und kann zum Analysemittel werden. Beim unterschiedslosen Übergehen von einem belebten zu einem statischen Bild bietet die Videoaufnahme eine Auswahl von gefilmten Bildfolgen und ein vielfaches Lesen der beobachteten Kontexten. Sie hilft dazu, den Unterschied zwischen Gruppennormen und individualen Normen hervorzuheben.<br>

Abstract: Le combat juif pour la mémoire du génocide et la reconnaissance finalement obtenue sont devenus un modèle et un cadre référentiel pour d'autres populations persécutées. Mais l'ampleur de cette effervescence mémorielle suscite à son tour des réactions critiques. Quant au modèle, il est parfois contesté de façon virulente par la dérive minoritaire d'une compétition victimaire. Après avoir rappelé le processus à travers lequel ce phénomène mémoriel s'est progressivement imposé, on analysera son rôle référentiel, les critiques qu'il soulève et les controverses dont il fait l'objet. The Jewish fight for the genocide's memory and the recognition it eventually reached have become a model and a referential frame for other persecuted people. Yet in return some react critically to this rising memorial effervescence. As victims compete and minorities conflict, the Shoah model is in itself more and more contested. This article retraces how this memorial phenomenon has progressively settled and analyses its referential, yet controversial, role. Der jüdische Kampf um eine kollektive Erinnerung an die Vernichtung und ihre letztliche Anerkennung sind im Laufe der Zeit zu einer Art Modell und zu einem Bezugsrahmen für andere verfolgte Bevölkerungsgruppen geworden. Jedoch erzeugt die Omnipräsenz der Erinnerungen vielfach auch Kritik. Das Erinnerungsmodell wird von Seiten bestimmter Minderheitenströmungen innerhalb des herrschenden « Opferwettbewerbs » oftmals heftig angegriffen. Zunächst analysiert dieser Artikel den Prozess der Durchsetzung des Phänomens des Sich-Erinnerns, im Anschluss daran wird seine Referenzwirkung diskutiert sowie die Kritik und die Debatte die es hervorruft.<br>

Abstract: Partant du constat que les faits sociaux de mémoire sont portés par des actes de communication, il s'agit ici de dégager les pratiques qui alimentent les formes de « l'agir » socio-mémoriel, aujourd'hui présent en France et ailleurs. Quels processus sont a l'œuvre dans des situations post-génocidaires, souvent aussi post-migratoires, comme dans la Shoah (« Khurbn » en yiddish) par exemple ? Dans le cas d'Ashkénazes, il s'agit d'une reinscription qualitative au sein des cartographies de la parenté, mais aussi d'une reconnexion avec des périodes antérieures au genocide et à l'ethnocide à travers des événements culturels. Since the work of memory cannot exist without inter-subjective exchanges, this paper introduces in the study of memory the concept of « social acting » created by Weber. Attempting to point out the plurality of the practices that feed the various forms of socio-memorial movements present today in France and elsewhere. Which are the processes taking on a very particular aspect in post-genocidal as in post-migratory situations such as after the Shoah (Khurbn in Yiddish) ? In the case of the Ashkenase, these processes are also post-ethnocide and consist in a qualitative re-inscription within genealogical mapping and simultaneously in the long development of a history in which the genocide constitutes a memorial screen as well as actions of re-inscribing and re-connecting with cultural markers associated to periods antedating the genocide and ethnocide. Da Erinnerungsarbeit nicht ohne das Betrachten von zwischenmenschlichem Austausch und sozialer Praxis erfolgen kann, soll im Rahmen dieses Artikels das Webersche Konzept des « Sozialen Handelns » in die Untersuchung von Erinnerungen einbezogen werden. Ausgehend von der Tatsache, dass soziale Erinnerungen durch Kommunikation ausgedrückt werden, möchte dieser Artikel die Vielfalt der Praktiken zeigen, die heute in Frankreich und anderswo die Vielzahl der gesellschaftlichen Erinnerungsbewegungen prägen. Die Erinnerungsprozesse verdeutlichen vor allem die soziale und zeitliche Beziehung zum Anderen. Besonders interessant zu analysieren ist sind Post-Shoah-(Khurbn auf Jiddisch) und Post-Auswanderungs-Erinnerungenen. In diesem Artikel richtet sich das Augenmerk vor allem auf Ashkenasische Juden aus Deutschland, Zentral-und Osteuropa, deren Situation nach dem Ethnozid betrachtet wird. Dabei ist eine qualitative Wiederaufnahme der Lebenspraxis der Elterngeneration zu beobachten ; ebenso wie ein Anknüpfen im Rahmen bestimmter kultureller Riten an die Zeit vor dem Völkermord.<br>

Abstract: Tout au long de l'histoire de la psychologie, la revolution cognitive n'a pas cessé de progresser. Celle qui a cours aujourd'hui cherche à expliquer comment les individus parviennent a donner des significations au monde complexe qui les entoure : il est temps à présent de comprendre différents modes d'élaboration du sens. Quatre modes distincts sont suggérés. Le premier, le mode intersubjectif, concerne l'établissement, le façonnement et le maintien de l'intersubjectivité. Le deuxième, le mode actionnel, concerne l'organisation de l'action. Le troisième, le mode normatif, intègre les éléments particuliers dans des contextes normatifs et s'exprime en imposant des contraintes aux deux premiers modes. Les trois modes ont en commun d'être fortement dépendants du contexte: Les narratifs — ou les récits — sont l'instrument par excellence permettant d'ancrer les trois premiers modes d'élaboration du sens dans un ensemble plus structuré. On peut supposer que le quatrième mode d'élaboration du sens, le mode propositionnel, vise à décontextualiser les trois modes précédents en les soumettant à la vérification et aux justifications logiques. Throughout the entire history of cognitive psychology, a cognitive revolution has always been in progress. The current cognitive revolution began to explain how individuals come to make meaning out of a complex world ; it now needs to turn more vigorously to different forms of meaning making. Four modes are suggested. The first one is directed to the establishment, shaping and maintenance of intersubjectivity. A second form, the actional mode, is concerned with the way action is organized. The third form, the normative mode, construes particulars in normative contexts ; it expresses itself by imposing constraints on the first two modes. These three modes of meaning making have in common to be context dependent. Narratives or stories are the vehicles par excellence for entrenching the first three modes into a more structured whole. It is suggested that the fourth mode of meaning making, the propositional mode, is directed to the decontextualization of the preceeding three modes by imposing verifiability and logical justification. A brief account of how this set of meaning making processes might have grown out of human evolution is discussed. In conclusion : no reductionist theory on mind will do it proper justice.<br>

Abstract: L'idée de laïcité n'est pas soustraite à l'histoire. C'est pourquoi il est illusoire de postuler son sens dans l'absolu. Aujourd'hui, comme en d'autres époques, sa valeur politique tend à se polariser sur une opposition binaire entre une acception libérale et une acception anti-libérale dite républicaine. Toutefois, trois traits semblent particuliers aux années 1990 : — une disjonction entre l'acception politique dominante de la laïcité et sa force juridique, gagée par la Constitution et cadrée par des instruments juridiques internationaux ; — l'orientation nationalitaire du débat, pointant vers les populations issues de l'immigration musulmane, et questionnant leur appartenance à la nation ; — enfin, l'inscription du débat dans la problématique globale de la modernisation des formes scolaires, laquelle véhicule à la fois une epistemologie constructiviste et interactionniste, et une éthique laïque ef libérale. Les « affaires de foulards » sont un analyseur de cette complexité. Secularity concept must not be taken away from history. So it would be illusory to think about it as an abstract notion. Presently, as in older times, its political value tends to be focusing on a binary opposition between a liberal notion and an anti-liberal, so-called republican one. However three characteristics are specific of the nineties : — the split between main political meaning of secularity and its strength in legal terms, provided by the Constitution and by international legal tools ; — a debate focusing on nationality issues, with questions related to national belonging or muslim immigrants ; — last, the integration of this debate into the global issue of school modernization, which is concerned with a constructivist and interactionist epistemology and a liberal, secular ethic, as well. « Headscarves cases » are an indicator of this complexity.<br>

Abstract: L'alternance entre les trois pôles de la formation (auto-hétéro-oïko) présente dans les pratiques de formation alternée (variété des situations d'apprentissage et des acteurs) renvoie à la différenciation des trois personnes pronominales (je-tu-il) du langage courant et s'inscrit dans l'épistémologie ternaire de la sémiotique initiée par Peirce. L'intelligence pratique et rusée (la métis des Grecs), repérée chez des artisans grâce à l'expression régionale « le biais du gars », met en scène une logique ouverte où transduction et abduction s'articulent à déduction et induction. Une « raison expérientielle » , dialogique, écologique, à visée éthique, est ainsi forgée. C'est une rationalité pratique cherchant à actualiser le potentiel de la situation. Elle est empreinte de sagesse et de « prudence » en action, au sens d'Aristote (phronésis). L'éc(h)oformation qui émerge de cette raison expérientielle, de ce regard interactionnel, est indissociable de la boucle étrange entre deux autres raisons : la raison sensible et la raison formelle, entre spontanéité et habitude. The tripolar concept of training (auto-hetero-oïko), foundation of alternating courses practice (with multiple learning situations and actors), draws us back to the differenciation between the three main persons singular (I, You, He) expressed in common language as the compound epistemology of semiotics put forward by Peirce... Practical intelligence (close to the "metis" of the Greeks) can be noticed among craftsmen when they refer to the "biais du gars" bespeaking an open logic where transduction and abduction are linked to deduction and induction. A constructive reasoning, interactive ans ecological, with ethical objectives, is created. It's a practical rationality aiming at actualizing the potentiality of the situation and marked by sagaciy and prudence in action in the Aristotelian sense (phronesis). The "ec(h)otraining" emerging from the wisdom of experience, this interactive vision of things is necessarily included in the chain linking two other thoughts : the intuitive thought and the formal thought, between spontaneity and habit.<br>

Abstract: Il s'agit d'éclairer plusieurs déplacements qui se sont produits dans les trente dernières années. Tout d'abord la création d'un milieu d'experts intermédiaires entre la politique, l'administration et la recherche. Ensuite un changement du cadre à l'intérieur duquel se situe la réflexion. Il s'agit moins de penser la cohésion d'une société dans un cadre national qu'à la manière dont le pays peut maintenir son rang dans la compétition internationale. Enfin un changement d'orientation politique : le souci de la formation de l'élite redevient primordial même s'il ne s'agit plus de maintenir une tradition culturelle mais de sauvegarder ses parts de marché. Le texte étudie ces évolutions en France en distinguant trois périodes : une période de « politique à l'état gazeux » où la gauche tente de transformer les idéaux libertaires de 1968 en programme de gouvernement ; une tentative de passage à l'état solide avec la loi d'orientation de 1989 et la création de la Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective ; une déstabilisation de ce système par le ministre Claude Allègre qui jette le système éducatif français dans le grand bain de la concurrence internationale. Il s'ensuit une période à la fois « sous influence » et d'incertitude. The idea is to explain several moves that have happened in the last thirty years. First of all, the creation of a body of experts, middlemen between politics, government and research. Then a change in the setting of the thinking process. It is less to think about social cohesion within a national setting than the way the country can live up to its ranking when competing at the international level. Finally, a change in political orientations: teaching the elite becomes a crucial problem again even if it does not mean keeping cultural traditions alive any more but securing market shares. This article studies those changes and defines three periods: firstly, a period of politics in "gaseous-state" in which the left tried to change 1968's libertarian ideals into a political agenda; secondly, an attempt to change to solid state with the 1989's Orientation Act (act laying down the basic principles for government action in education) and the creation of the "Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective" (assessment & futurology office); finally, the destabilisation of this system by Claude Allègre, the then French education secretary who put the French educational system into the picture of international competition. A period of doubts "under influence" followed right after. Es handelt sich darum, mehrere in den letzten 30 Jahren vorgefundenen Verwandlungen aufzuklären: zunächst die Gründung eines Expertenmilieus zwischen Politik, Verwaltung und Forschung. Dann einen Wandel des Rahmens, in dem die Überlegung stattfindet: es geht nämlich weniger darum, über den Zusammenhalt einer Gesellschaft in einem internationalen Rahmen nachzudenken als über die Art und Weise zu überlegen, wie das Land seinen Platz im internationalen Wettbewerb behalten kann. Schließlich einen Wandel der politischen Orientierung: die Bemühung um die Bildung einer Elite wird wieder vorrangig, auch wenn es nicht mehr darauf ankommt, eine kulturelle Tradition zu behalten, sondern seinen Marktanteil zu retten. Der Text bearbeitet diese Entwicklungen in Frankreich und unterscheidet dabei drei Perioden: erstens eine Zeit der „gasförmigen” Politik, in der die Linksparteien versuchen, die anarchistischen 1968er Ideale in ein Regierungsprogramm umzusetzen; zweitens ein Versuch der Verfestigung mit dem Orientierungsgesetz 1989 und die Gründung des Bewertungs- und Forschungsamtes (Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective); drittens eine Destabilisierung dieses Systems durch den Erziehungsminister Claude Allègre, der das französische Schulsystem mit der internationalen Konkurrenz konfrontiert. Darauf folgt eine „unter Einfluß" stehende und zugleich unsichere Periode. Se trata de aclarar varios desplazamientos que se produjeron en los treinta últimos años. Primero, la creación de un medio de expertos intermediarios entre la política, la administración y investigación. Después, un cambio del marco dentro del que se sitúa la reflexión. No se trata tanto de pensar la cohesión de una sociedad en un marco nacional como de la manera en que el país puede mantener su rango en la competencia internacional. Por fin, un cambio de orientación política : la preocupación por la formación de lo más selecto vuelve a ser primordial aunque ya no se trata de mantener una tradición cultural sino de proteger sus cuotas de mercado. El texto estudia estas evoluciones en Francia distinguiendo tres períodos : un período de « política en estado gaseoso » en el que la izquierda intenta transformar los ideales libertarios de 1968 en programa de gobierno ; un intento de pasar al estado sólido con la ley de orientación de 1989 y la creación la Dirección de la evaluación y de la prospectiva ; una destabilización de este sistema por el ministro Claude Allègre que echa el sistema educativo francés en el gran baño de la competencia internacional. De ahí resulta un período a la vez «bajo influencia » y de incertidumbre.<br>

Abstract: Cet article (1) présente une réflexion théorique sur la notion de genre, de ses définitions et ses usages en sciences sociales. S'opposant à l'approche dominante qui conçoit le genre comme identité ou attribut socialement construits des personnes, conception qu'elle considère comme essentialisante ou substantialisante, l'auteur argumente en faveur d'une approche relationnelle du genre conçu comme modalité des relations sociales. Elle se fonde pour cela sur des travaux d'anthropologie comparative et historique qui contraignent à reconsidérer le dualisme du moi et du corps constitutif de l'idéologie individualiste de la personne, et critique I'hypostase du Moi comme homoncule constitué à partir d'une absolutisation de la première personne. Analysant le système sexué des trois personnes grammaticales, elle soutient que, n'étant pas référentiel, « le je de l'interlocution n'a ni sexe, ni genre ». Les apports croisés de l'anthropologie et de la philosophie analytique la conduisent à revoir la notion de personne pour mieux penser la capacité proprement humaine de se reconnaître comme d'un sexe sans être jamais assigné à celui-ci. This article presents a theoretical work on the idea of gender, its definitions and uses in social science. The author objects to the mainstream approach that sees gender as an identity or an attribute that some people socially construct. She sees that idea as essentializing or substantializing. She argues in favor of a relational approach of gender conceived as mode of social interactions. Her approach is based on comparative and historical works of anthropologists that lead to consider the dualism of the ego and the body which make the individualistic ideology of a persona, and she criticizes the hypostasis of the ego as homunculus made up from absolutizing the id. Analyzing the gender system of the three grammatical persons, she asserts that, as it is not a reference, the other person's "I" does not have a sex nor a gender. The contributions from both anthropology and analytic philosophy lead her to reconsider the notion of persona so as to better grasp the capacity—specifically human—to see ourselves belonging to a sex group without having ever been assigned to it. Este artículo presenta una reflexión teórica respecto a la noción de género, de sus definiciones y sus usos en ciencias sociales. Oponiéndose al enfoque dominante que concibe el género como identidad o atributo socialmente construidos de las personas, concepción que considera como esencializante y sustancializante, la autora argumenta a favor de un enfoque relacional del género concebido como modalidad de las relaciones sociales. Para ella, se basa en los trabajos de antropología comparativa e histórica que obligan a reconsiderar el dualismo del yo y del cuerpo constitutivo de la ideología individualista de la persona, y critica la hipóstasis del Yo como homúnculo constituido a partir de una absolutización de la primera persona. Al analizar el sistema sexuado de las tres personas gramaticales, sostiene que al no ser referencial, "el yo de la interlocución no tiene ni sexo, ni género". Los aportes convergentes de la antropología y de la filosofía analítica lo llevan a reconsiderar la noción de persona para pensar mejor la capacidad propiamente humana de reconocerse como de un sexo sin nunca ser asignado a él. Dieser Artikel bietet theoretische Uberlegungen über den Begriff Gender, seine Definitionen und seinen Gebrauch in den Sozialwissenschaften. Die Autorin setzt sich gegen die meist verbreitete Auffassung des Genders als sozial aufgebaute Identität oder Attribut des Einzelnen, denn sie betrachtet sie als eine essentialisierende bzw. substantialisierende Definition. Dagegen argumentiert sie für eine beziehungsmäßige Herangehensweise an das Gender, die es als eine Modalität der sozialen Beziehungen erfasst. Sie bezieht sich dabei auf vergleichenden und historischen Anthropologiearbeiten, die uns dazu zwingen, das Dualismus des Ichs und des Körpers zu überdenken, der einen Bestandteil der individualistischen Ideologie des Menschen darstellt, und kritisiert dazu die Hypostase des Ichs als Einzelnen, der auf Grund einer Absolutisierung der ersten Person geschaffen wird. Indem sie das geschlechtliche System der drei grammatikalischen Personen analysiert, behauptet die Autorin, dass auf Grund seiner Unbezüglichkeit „das Ich in der Interlokution weder Geschlecht noch Gender hat". Die Beiträge der Anthropologie und der analytischen Philosophie führen zu einer Überdenkung des Begriffs Mensch, um die rein menschliche Fähigkeit besser zu erfassen, die darin besteht, dass man sich einem Geschlecht anschließt, ohne dass es einem je zugewiesen wird.<br>

Author(s): ZizekAbstract: Arguing that without a differentiated and relational notion of the cultural, the social sciences would he crippled, reducing social action to notions of pure instrumentality, in this article, I trace the growth of cultural analysis from the beginnings of modern anthropology to the present as a layered set of experimental systems whose differential lenses create epistemic objects with increasing precision and differential focus and resolution. Arguing that culture is not a variable-culture is relational, it is elsewhere or in passage, it is where meaning is woven and renewed, often through gaps and silences, and forces beyond the conscious control of individuals, and yet the space where individual and institutional social responsibility and ethical struggle take place-I name culture as a set of central anthropological forms of knowledge grounding human beings' self-understandings. The challenge of cultural analysis is to develop translation and mediation tools for helping make visible the differences of interests, access, power, needs, desires, and philosophical perspective. In particular, as we begin to face new kinds of ethical dilemmas stemming from developments in biotechnologies, expansive information and image databases, and ecological interactions, we are challenged to develop differentiated cultural analyses that can help articulate new social institutions for an evolving civil society.<br>

This museum was a reaction to the passing of an age when industrial and urban environments were intrinsically linked. Through this description of how the past is collected and recollected in a museum, this article attempts to determine if this duty of remembrance is not, to a certain extent, a strategy of forgetfulness. Is cultural regeneration-the staging of history fading into oblivion-our society's sole response to industrial regeneration?<br>

Abstract: Das Mārchen als Psychologe— Eine Hommage an Max Lüthi This essay was wtitten in honor of Max Lūthi, the renowned Swiss folklorist, who died in 1991. The starting point is an article by Lüthi in which he coined the term "the fairy tale as psychologist." In contrast to the psychoanalytic approach of Freudians and Jungians, Schmölders demonstrates how Lüthi drew a line between literature and psychology in his works. First, Lüthi studied the hero in the fairy tale from an anthropomorphological viewpoint. Second, Lūthi analyzed the style of fairy tales by examining the moral, aesthetic, and economic aspects of the action. Third, Lūthi also dealt with "the legend as psychologist." Using Lüthi's notions, Schmōlders stresses the dialogic strategies and anthropomorphological concerns of the tales within the domain of psychological object-relations theory, and it is in this regard that Lūthi's term "the fairy tale as psychologist" assumes its importance.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo traz uma reflexão sobre o método etnográfico enquanto encapsulando o tema da identidade narrativa do antropólogo, em especial, enfocando o problema ético-moral da busca da coerência interna de sua produção etnográfica através da análise do processo de construção do conhecimento antropológico. Trata-se de pontuar, neste processo, o que está verdadeiramente em jogo, ou seja, o ato de configuração e reconfiguração do tempo que encerra a ação interpretativa em Antropologia. This article brings a reflections about the ethnographic method while encapsulating the identity theme describes by the anthropologist, in special, focusing the moral-ethic problem of the searching of the internal coherence of its ethnographic production through the study of the process of the anthropologic knowledge construction. It is to point, in this process, that is really in the play, or, the act of configuration and reconfiguration of time that stops the interpretative action in anthropology.<br>

Author(s): Voloshinov Michelle Z.<br>
Abstract: I begin by introducing the Ilongots and some of their attitudes toward speech. Whereas most modern theorists think of language as a tool designed primarily to "express" or to "refer," Ilongots think of language first in terms of action. They see commands as the exemplary act of speech, displaying less concern for the subjective meanings that an utterance conveys than for the social contexts in which utterances are heard. An ethnographic sketch thus outlines how Ilongots think of words and how their thought relates to aspects of their practice -- providing an external foil for theorists found closer to home. Speech Act Theory is discussed and questioned first on internal grounds, as an approach that recognizes but slights important situational and cultural constraints on forms of language use. A consideration of the application of Searle's taxonomy of acts of speech to Ilongot categories of language use then leads to a clarification of the individualistic and relatively asocial biases of his essentially intra-cultural account. Last, I return to Ilongot directives. A partial analysis of Ilongot acts of speech provides the basis for a statement of the ways in which indigenous categories are related to the forms that actions take, as both of these, in turn, reflect the sociocultural ordering of local worlds.<br>

Abstract: At present there is under utilization of maternity service provision in Nigeria, with only a third of childbearing women electing to deliver in healthcare facilities. This is relevant since Nigeria's maternal mortality rate is second highest in the world and is estimated at 1,100 per 100,000 live births. To date, studies have sought cause and effect and have neglected the opinion of the people about what they perceive to be problematic and what they believe constitutes satisfactory maternity service provision. An exploratory qualitative study was carried out to identify pregnant women in a rural Niger Delta community's perceptions of conventional maternity service provision. Participants included 8 pregnant Niger Delta women from differing sub-groups within the homogeneous population. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore informants' views of what constitutes satisfactory maternity service provision, what comprises inadequate care, barriers that obstruct delivery of maternity care, and what promotes positive outcomes. Five major themes emerged from the data. These included: (1) Women's requirements for information; (1a) nutritional and dietary advice, (1b) how to recognise developing complications, (1c) appropriate fetal development, (1e) importance of attending clinics; (2) Staff services required: (2a) availability, (2b) well managed, and (2c) good quality; (3) Apparatus: (3a) equipment available, (3b) adequate infrastructure; (4) Affordability; (5) Place of traditional and spiritual methods. The interviewed childbearing Niger Delta women voiced several factors that they considered altered their satisfaction with maternity service provision. Finding out more about what causes satisfaction/dissatisfaction in childbearing women facilitates maternity care professionals to improve standards of care and allocate resources more effectively. Policy changes are driven by initiatives that reinforce strengths of current specification and recognise weaknesses. In addition, the WHO recommends that working towards improving health related culture is important. A l'heure actuelle, il y a une sous utilisation de services de gynécologie-obstétricaux au Nigeria, étant donné qu'un tiers des femmes en âge de procréer optent pour accoucher dans des établissements de santé. Les études antérieure ont recherché la cause et l'effet et ont négligé les opinions des femmes concernant ce qu'elles croient être la bonne prestation de services de gynécologie-obstétricaux. Nous avons mené une étude qualitative exploratrice pour identifier 8 femmes enceintes à partir des perceptions d'une communauté rurale du Niger Delta à l'égard de la prestation de services de gynécologie-obstétricaux conventionnels. Des interviews semi-structures ont exploré les opinions des enquêtées sur ce qui constitue la prestation de services de gynécologieobstétricaux satisfaisant, ce qui constitue les soins insuffisants, les obstacles qui entravent la prestation de soins de gynécologieobstétricaux et ce qui avance les résultats positifs. Cinq thèmes importants ont émergé à partir des données : (i) Les besoins des femmes pour les renseignements ; 1a) le conseil nutritionnel et alimentaire, 1b) comment reconnaître des complications qui se préparent, 1c) le développement approprié des fétus, le) la nécessité de fréquenter les cliniques, 2) bien gérer, 2c) la bonne qualité 3) appareil 3a) l'équipement disponible, 3b) l'infrastructure adéquate ; 4) s'ils sont abordables ; 5) la place des méthodes traditionnelles et spirituelles. Les femmes enquêtées ont mentionné plusieurs facteurs qui ont modifié leur satisfaction avec la prestation de service de gynécologie-obstétricaux. La recherche supplémentaire concernant les causes de la satisfaction ou du mécontentement rend facile la tâche des professionnels de soins de maternité leur permettant d'améliorer la qualité de soin et d'affecter des ressources plus efficacement.<br>

Abstract: The essay refers to a concern for social justice in the origins of public health, borne in part by religious commitments, and to more recent expressions of a similar concern in debates about health equity. Equity, moreover, is affected by discursive power relations (dominant/hegemonic versus local/suppressed), which are discussed in relation to current research in the African Religious Health Assets Programme on the interaction of particular 'healthworlds' (a conceptual innovation) that shape the choices and behaviour of health-seekers. Two background theoretical positions guide the argument: Amartya Sen's claim that development is linked to freedom (including religious freedom); and, building on Sen's and Martha Nussbaum's human capabilities theory, an asset-based community approach to the building or reconstruction of public health systems. On this basis, it is argued that health systems and health interventions are just to the extent that they mediate between the necessary leadership or polity from 'above' (techné) and the experience and wisdom (métis) of those who are 'below', taking into account the asymmetries of power that this equation represents. Because difference and diversity are so often expressed in what we might reasonably call 'religious' terms, I specifically emphasize the continuing persistence of religion and, hence, the importance of accounting for its pertinence in social theory generally, and in relation to discourses of health and justice in the African context specifically. Acknowledging the ambiguities of religion, I nevertheless argue that an appreciative alignment between public health systems and religious or faith-based initiatives in health promotion, prevention and care is crucial to sustainable and just health systems in Africa.<br>

Abstract: The article develops an understanding of public deliberations during a peace process, focusing on the interaction between the elite level negotiations and the "public peace process." It does so by examining the dialogical mechanisms that are set to work in the public sphere once the elite consider the possibility of identifying the former enemies as allies or friends. These dialogical mechanisms, the author argues, add up to a shift in the manner the public interprets the discourse that regulates its relationship with the elite toward what the author calls, following Paul Ricoeur, 'hermeneutics of suspicion.' Thus, the peace process generates a need for the public to re-examine the terms of understanding that defined its relationship with the former enemy. However this same process might also lead the public to re-examine the terms by which it understands its relationship with the elite.<br>

Abstract: President Obama's commencement address on the University of Notre Dame campus evoked substantial controversy, providing public demonstration of rhetorical differences and demands generated by differing provincial and cosmopolitan positions. Icontend that public civic rhetoric, in an era of narrative and virtue contention, must address the creative interplay of both provincial and cosmopolitan perspectives. In this essay I examine reactions to the Obama address from news sources connected with the local Catholic diocese, as well as the South Bend and University of Notre Dame newspapers. I argue that Obamas address is an example of a public civic speech that openly engaged the interplay of provincial and cosmopolitan understandings of a controversial communal common center. Obamas Notre Dame speech framed discourse that walks within a world of tension and difference on the public stage, highlighting the communal rhetorical constitution of a speech moment shaped through the interplay of provincial and cosmopolitan commitments.<br>

Abstract: An increasing number of individuals worldwide are receiving home nursing care from loved ones. Many healthcare professionals are exploring the use of narrative to help family caregivers meet the personal demands of this work. Citing Ricoeur's notion of narrative identity as a social process in which cultural norms and values are negotiated between speaker and audience, this paper argues that health care professionals can assist their clients by viewing narrative as collaboration, not autonomous construction. Collaboration in construction of narrative identity was observed in interactions between family caregivers and public health workers on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. There, caregivers were supported by a dialogic process in which interlocutors explored the cultural values that define and delimit the possibilities for living as caregivers.<br>

Abstract: Causal explanations of social actions are central to modern as well as to classic sociology. Even in its revised form. the most influential causal theory -- the covering law theory -- has not proved particularly fruitful for the study of social action. But there are alternative and potentially more fruitful theories. This article presents Weber's methodology and critical realism as two different contributions to a generative view of causality in social science which both try to transcend the protracted controversy between a hermeneutic interpretive sociology and a positivistic causal-explanatory sociology. From the generative standpoint. causal explanations are directed not towards the production of empirical correlations between variables or towards the making of predictions on the basis of empirical laws, but towards the uncovering of causal properties and the processes whereby social actions arise out of the complex interaction of internally related mental dispositions. meanings. intentions. social contexts and structures.<br>

Abstract: A theory of the embodiment of action is proposed. Reflections on relations between human intentions, the human body and the notion of agency lead us to argue that phenomenological analysis is not sufficient for such a theory. Our consideration, that the most fundamental level of embodied agency is that of life itself, brings us to the philosophy of biology and the theory of the organism: briefly, certain parts of the natural environment are intrinsic to the constitution of organisms and, in their more sophisticated configuration, as agents. Action is embodied in the sense that certain physiological processes are internal in relation to it and play a constitutive role in its performance. The way in which environment, context and consciousness affect and constitute the nature of agency at personal and sub-personal levels is elaborated. We see that human agents perceive and act upon their world through a complex shifting between those levels. A summary of the ways in which the social sciences can be enriched by this more comprehensive view of human agency provides the basis of justification for claiming Actor-Network Theory (ANT), originally developed by sociologists studying science and technology, as a promising framework for the continuation of this reasoning.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we attempt to show the fruitfulness of the theory of communicative action for memory studies. Specifically, we intend to demonstrate that concepts characteristic of the discipline, such as "history," "memory," and "dialogue," reflect three types of universal validity claims: "memory" formulates claims to authenticity, "history" formulates claims to truth, and "dialogue" formulates claims to Tightness. Thus, it is possible to introduce a seminal Habermasian notion of rationality that rests on validity claims. This notion can serve to integrate, enrich, and identify blind spots in memory studies. Our purpose is to demonstrate the relevance of collective memory to social cohesion (cultural reproduction, social integration, and socialization) and the public sphere (its development and atrophy, rationalization, and colonization).<br>

Abstract: The study ’The meaning of action, the action of meaning’ raises the theoretical question of the relationship between the intent and meaning, the self-referentiality and referentiality of the literary text. It sets out from the hypothesis that a literary text has not only a self-referential, but also a referential character. Unlike non-literary texts whose function is their intent, the referentiality of a literary text is open. The ambiguity and polysemy of the text then results from the non-obviousness of reality itself. The concept that captures this difference between literary texts and texts with other functions is that of meaning. The study uses the concrete example of the thematicisation of the metamorphosis of a puppet, a monster or an animal into a man in Kleist, Collodi and Grass to illustrate the difference between mechanical intent founded upon efficiency and living meaning, founded on ambiguity and non-functional complexity. An analysis of Pavel Vilikovský’s novel Kôn na poschodí, slepec vo Vrábroch (’Horse Upstairs, Blind Man in Vráble’) shows how, in its thematic, ostentatiously self-referential action, meaning is born as an expression of the polysemic re fe re n tia lity of the text. The analy sis shows that behind this self-referentiality the text is also created in the referential action of meaning to such an extent that it is precisely the open action of meaning which becomes the r » on-obvious sense of the action of the text.<br>

Abstract: This study represents a Chapter from a section devoted to the composition of a literary work and is part of a larger project called ‘The Poetics of a Work of Literature in the Twentieth Century’, which is being undertaken by the Theory Department of the Institute of Czech Literature. The fragment and fragmentariness in a twentieth-century literary work are a manifestation of a marked tendency towards discontinuity or in some cases towards continuity of a certain kind. There exist works of art that for various reasons remain fragments without, however, being preceived as such (the novels of Kafka and Ladislav Klíma’s Velký román, are cases in point); on the other hand, the fragment, that is to say an intentional fragment (such as a sketch or a synopsis), becomes an independent genre whose roots go back to Romanticism (for instance Novalis’s fragment). The fragment and fragmentarieness that manifests itself in the text in the widest possible number of ways (intentional incompleteness and sporadicity, ‘blank spots’ in the Story, the mixing of heterogeneous elements, the alternating of various genres within one work, and so on), we understand as a reaction to the idea about the work as a complete, inlernally unified and accomplished whole with a clear and single Sense, an idea that Classicism molleyeoddled, which was then to a large exient done by Realism and with it all so-called decadent literature (including tendencious, Socialist-Realist literature). The fragment and fragmentariness (with which is linked the idea of a sense that continuously defies being pinned down to any one definition, which follows from its quality of not being fully told, from suggestion, hints, silence, gaps and ‘ holes’) are, in the literature of the twentieth century, perceived as both a genre and also as approaches that can express the open nature of being and of the world better than the whole work can. Because fragmentary works often represent a work in a nascent state or in a state of transformation, they become a picture of a world that is, as Ladislav Klíma pointed out, ‘continuously creating itself’.<br>

Abstract: Bohumil Nuska points out the predominant limited conception of rhythm, which is usually linked only with acoustically symbolized and aurally perceived rhythms, while the rhythms that are optically symbolized and visually perceived are utterly ignored. In lyric verse, the double, parallel mental construction, which stems from the opposition of syllable and morpheme as constituents of a higher construct of the word, creates parallel Iines of mixed mental spaces of linear and non-linear rhythms (the rhythm of verse, the rhythm of the situation; the atmosphere of the verse, and the atmosphere of the situation). Shared abstract structures in generic spaces within individual mixed spaces of lyric rhythm are shared axiological structures, represented at the highest level of abstraction by tension and relaxation (detension). The dynamic nature of these structures stems from the asymmetric distribution of tension and relaxation with regard to the dualistic symmetrical model of the axiological system. And thus deviations from its axial scheme emerge, creating these four parallel rhythmicized lyric structures (in terms of form). Similarity amongst the individual mixed mental spaces is only possible in a fractal dimension. In this theory, presented as a working hypothesis, it is assumed that the forms of the rhythm of the verse, the rhythm of the situation, the atmosphere of the verse, and the atmosphere of the situation, will be similar to each other, and their fractal mutual similarity emerges from the text.<br>

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Abstract: A survey of recent books on Reader-Response, broadly defined as any literary theory that investigates the process of reading. This includes not only books by Norman Holland, Stanley Fish, and Wolfgang Iser, long regarded as central figures in the area of Reader-Response, but also discussions of the contribution to this area made by Jacques Derrida and Mikhail Bakhtin. A widespread reaction is observed against the impersonality of much literary theory and the dangers of reducing reading to a science, but alternative models that stress the therapeutic, self-enhancing, or playful elements in reading are also exposed to critical analysis.<br>

Abstract: L'article qui suit envisage quelques unes des questions que soulève aujourd'hui la notion d'identité aussi bien individuelle que collective dans le politique. En prenant appui notamment sur les réflexions d'Ernst Tugendhat dans Conscience de soi et autodétermination, je suggère que les préoccupations identitaires et les interrogations autour d'une crise de l'identité gagnent à être abordées à partir de la notion de projection et de détermination de la volonté et des actions plutôt qu'en termes de traits définitionnels statiques. Je suggère aussi que l'étude doit prendre en compte non seulement la situation dans ses dimensions individuelles et collectives mais aussi les conditions de désorientation que produit désormais l'incertitude concernant l'idée de l'humain elle-même. In this paper I consider some of the issues raised by the notion of identity in the political area to-day. Drawing upon the reflections of Ernst Tugendhat in his book Selbstbewusstsein und Selbstbestimmung, I suggest that contemporary problems of identity, individual and collective as well, and namely the idea of a postmodern crisis of political identities, are better understood when we view them in terms of projects and determination of actions. I also suggest we have to take into account not only individual and collective aspects of identity but also our inability to define our idea of what it is to be human.<br>

Abstract: The problem being dealt with in this paper is whether a text has only one legitimate meaning, or no meaning at all. The question becomes even more acute when the contexts of sender and receiver are different. Polysemy and ambiguity are well-known obstacles to communication on the level of the word. The necessity of a general semiotic theory is stressed, and explains the difference between denotation and connotation. The functionality of metaphor in biblical language points to the interpretive value of polyvalency. The impression of unlimited indeterminacy created by the recent emphasis on the active role of the reader, is in a sense misleading since author and reader function as a textual strategy. On the other hand, the actualization of the textual expression as the content of the text by applying the various codes and subcodes, implies a continuous interaction between intensional and extensional approaches. In this respect topics, thematics, ideological and world structures are operative. Since interpretation and application are not to be separated in a pragmatic context, as is the case with the text of the Bible, there inevitably remains the possibility of multiple interpretations due to the interpreting and applying of the text of the Bible in a concrete situation. Yet this interpretation and appropriation should always be done as comprehension of the text and in continuity with the tradition.<br>

Abstract: Giuseppe Capograssi (1889-1956) was an important legal philosopher and had a lively influence on the development of legal studies. The centre of his reflections lay in his many investigations into the concept of experience, which aimed to supersede the prevalent orientation in Italy, focussed on vertexes, emphasizing instead the importance of practices, both on the theoretical level and in the analysis of legal activity and political reality. Capograssi therefore paid great attention to the relationship between state and society viewed in a dynamic and pluralist perspective. No less illuminating are Capograssi's investigations into the value of the constitution and the principle of legality. During the Fascist period, Capograssi upheld the values of individual liberty and democratic principles, seeing as indispensable the continual involvement of citizens in the development of political action. This perspective played a further, particularly important role in the "ideas of Capograssi", after the war and the advent of the republican legal order. According to Capograssi, more space needed to be given to social life and to the spiritual links on which political community is based. In this sense, Capograssi found the teachings of Catholicism fundamental. His Catholicism placed great emphasis on freedom and solidarity and contained a lively, underlying sense of the cultural and spiritual, inspired by the ideal of "charity".<br>

Abstract: In Arendt's interrogations of political modernity, the concepts of history and politics have an ambiguous relation. On the one hand, she insisted that the performative character of politics as action was bound to its narrative aspect as remembrance. She was also a fervent proponent of integrating the historical sense into political understanding. On the other hand, Arendt characterized the modern historical sensibility from the point of view of politics as a "ghastly absurdity," and asserted that the political thought of our times needed to free itself both "from history" and "from thinking in historical terms." This paper explores the different meanings that Arendt granted to "history" as a (anti) political force and to historical sensibility as the basis for political understanding. It argues that not only were Arendt's rejection of the modern concept of history and its politics of history central for her critique, but that it was one of the key concerns that shaped the articulation of her own theory of action. The paper also examines the problem against the background of the intellectual tradition of Arendt's youth and in particular its uncompromising antihistoricism.<br>

Abstract: The role of nonhumans in social life has recently generated significant scholarly interest. The two main paradigms for explaining the sociological significance of nonhumans are constructivism and actor-network theory. We propose a pragmatist synthesis inspired by George Herbert Mead, demonstrating how interactions with nonhumans help constitute the social self—that is, the identity one constructs by imaginatively looking upon oneself as others would. Drawing upon observations of humans interacting with objects, animals, and nature, we identify two complementary ways that nonhumans organize the social self and enable people to experience group membership in absentia: (1) by molding how one is perceived by others and constraining alternative presentations of self and (2) by acting as a totem that conjures up awareness of, and feelings of attachment to, a particular social group. This formulation moves beyond constructivist claims that nonhumans reflect people's self-definitions, and it offers a corrective to actor-network theory's neglect of sociality.<br>

Abstract: In Britain, as in France, 'mainstream' anthropologists were hesitant to acknowledge studies within their own country as proper subjects for anthropological enquiry. British social anthropology defined itself as the study of 'other cultures' and became entrenched in a tradition in which Otherness was confused with manifest difference. This naivete, elevated into a scientific principle, precluded the recognition of 'self as anything other than a scientific instrument; but also led to the invention of a generalisable Other, and thereby ignored the complexity of variation within the cultures it studied. By the same token, it blinded anthropologists to heterogeneity within their 'own' local cultures as well, and was finally changed only by a series of related paradigm leaps. Our understanding of culture changed from a set of prescriptive influences which integrated society, to a ragged and non-systemic array of interpretive tools which aggregated society. Consequent upon this change, symbols were acknowledged as vehicles of expression and of negotiable meaning rather than as having stipulated and invariant referents. The demise of modernist theories liberated anthropology from its scientific illusions and positivistic pretensions, enabling it to acknowledge the personal and speculative nature of the enterprise. This admission of the subjective, of the anthropologist's self, was necessary in order to see Otherness as inhering in 'person' rather than in an abstraction such as 'culture' and, therefore, to be enabled to recognise diversity within cultures rather than merely between them. This enhanced perception of internal heterogeneity clearly places the Self of the anthropologist at the centre of the stage and has led to the contemporary debates about the nature of ethnographic writing and the status of ethnographic 'authority'. It has also had obvious consequences for anthropological research, including the raising anew of the relationship of individual to society; and the extension of anthropological research into the urban and industrial heartlands of the ' developed' world. These substantive consequences have established incontrovertibly the appropriateness and potency of anthropology in the study of such societies; and have also provided a basis from which to inform the core debates and central concepts of the discipline. These developments are evident in recent studies of kinship, social identity and symbolism. The reflexivity which is an essential ingredient of research on these topics (until recently noted with more eloquence and alacrity in France than in Britain) calls attention to the inevitable, and desirable, intrusion of the Self into anthropological research. It also demands the explicit incorporation of the complex Self-Other opposition in the fomulation of anthropological 'problems' — not as a baring of the post-modernist soul, but as an interpretive resource. An important illustration of the power of this resource may be found in the study of ethnic and local identities which are thereby revealed to be a matter of internal discourse (among Selves, so to speak) as well as of relativistic counter-definition. It is in precisely this way that research in anthropologists' 'parochial' or local milieux will contribute to the maturation of anthropology generally.<br>

Abstract: Serge Lifar built his career during the 1930s, a decade crucial to understanding his 'années noires'-or 'black years', as the French historian Henry Rousso called the period of the German occupation of Paris (1940—1944). Lifar's powerful and respected position at the Paris Opéra, the social connections he had built and maintained and the psychological impact of exile: all these elements help clarify Lifar's accommodating attitude towards the German occupants of his adopted city. During the 1930s Lifar came to be accepted in French intellectual society as the 'heir' of Serge Diaghilev. Through his publications he made a powerful contribution to the process by which Diaghilev's Ballets Russes assumed its paramount position in the development of modern ballet, a process set in motion by the impresario himself. Lifar played this role chiefly in France. In the English-speaking world, where relatively few of his books appeared in translation, other writers served to canonise the Diaghilev endeavour, albeit for somewhat different ends. A list of Lifar's publications in Russian and other languages (French above all) displays the growing influence of his actions and authority, the power of his connections (inherited primarily from Diaghilev), and his relentless will to overcome the problems of emigration as he secured not only success as a dancer and choreograph but also a public reputation as an intellectual. The recent discovery of new evidence has led to the identification of the respected Pushkin authority Modeste Hofmann as the writer whose unacknowledged work enabled Lifar to establish himself as an historian. This evidence, provided by Hofmann's grandsons André and Vladimir Hofmann, raises serious questions about the authority of Lifar's books. An interplay of subjective relationships is woven into the texture of these narratives in which survival and ambition, a paternal attitude and filial respect, exist in constant tension. Neither the making of these books nor the myth of Russian dance which they espouse can be understood without placing their authors in the milieu they shared in Paris as Russian émigrés.<br>

Abstract: The renewal of a dialog between landscape design and garden history demands a renewal of the questions and methods of garden history. This essay studies how garden reception and garden creation interact. It considers three main issues: first, it explores the domain of cultural expectations framing the engagement with a garden shared by users and creators at a given time—the poetical texture of gardens; second, the role of garden creation in exploiting, expanding or subverting this shared frame of expectations; and third, it proposes an approach—garden pragmatic—to study the broader interactions between garden creation and reception on the one hand, and social and cultural change on the other. The question of intersubjectivity—how do we share our sense and experiences of the world with others, and how do we transform them—is at the root of all the little stories—the fragments of a poetic of gardens—that propose new directions for garden history. Many of these stories have been presented during the last 15 years at symposia at Dumbarton Oaks where the author is presently the director of Garden and Landscape Studies. The general philosophy however had never been presented until the Fall 2004 when he published his "Essais de Poétique des Jardins." They were never made explicit at Dumbarton Oaks where each story only played its part in the theme of the symposium. Yet the whole course of ideas presented here results from these many exchanges with other scholars. This is why many footnotes make explicit references to their works. So, following the lead offered by this text or choosing a personal route, each reader may access many different voices that make garden history at present into a lively resource for pondering about the role of landscape creation in a multicultural world. These fragments of history are written to stimulate the designer's imagination, not to outline the course landscape design should follow.<br>

Abstract: The issues raised by different kinds of oral-historical research are explored here through a dialogue between two projects. In one case, the Alderley Sandhills Project, this work has been completed; in the other, the Ardnamurchan Transitions Project, the oral-historical research is in its early stages. Through a series of interactions, this article raises a number of different questions that oral-historical research posed at Alderley Sandhills, and it considers the ramifications of and the possible differences in these questions in the case of Ardnamurchan. Adoption of a nonlinear structure echoes one of the many fascinating aspects of oral-historical research itself.<br>

Abstract: Ethnomethodology captures ordinary events in ways that retain their dynamic and collaborative character. Ethnomethodologists identify people's methods for developing a practical objectivity that can render their local affairs meaningful and orderly, and they closely scrutinize the local details of mundane affairs in order to describe how a local cohort of cooperating parties concert themselves in providing an intelligibility for their social interaction, local work that is naturally occurring and depends upon the reflexive character of any emerging sense.<br>

Abstract: Psychology has uncritically adopted the individual person as its object of study without examining the concept and role of personhood within contemporary society and Western culture more generally. We examine three perspectives that challenge this familiar and unexamined object of our disciplinary inquiry: (1 ) Critical Theory's concept of the bourgeois individual as psychology's subject of ideology; (2) Poststructuralism's challenge to the concept of personhood as an integrated and self-present center of consciousness and action; (3) System Theory's alternative epistemology in which relations rather than entities have primacy. Each perspective introduces a concept of personhood that significantly differs from our present understanding of psychology's subject and that lays the foundation for a new subject of psychological inquiry: a multicentered, multidimensional subject.<br>

Abstract: This essay analyzes Carver's incorporation of African American characters into his short stories. Considering moments of black and white interaction in Carver's stories both enables a fuller understanding of the function of race in his writing and provides an examination of the many ways discourses of race shaped by white Americans' ideas about blackness were embedded in 1970s and 1980s America.<br>

Abstract: The first-generation literature on policy design has made considerable contributions over the last 30 years to our understanding of the process, politics and implications of policy design and instrument choice. This literature, however, has generally treated institutions as a black box and has not developed a coherent set of frameworks, theories and models of how institutions matter to policy design. In this paper, I unpack the black box of institutions using transaction cost and mechanism design to show how regulations can be better designed in developing countries when institutions are weak, unaccountable, corrupted or not credible. Under these conditions, I show that efficient regulatory design has to minimize transaction costs, particularly agency problems, by having incentive compatible (self-enforcing) mechanisms. I conclude with a second-generation research agenda on regulatory design with implications for environmental, food and drug safety, healthcare and financial regulation in developing countries.<br>

Abstract: Disciplinary specialties and boundaries may impede as well as facilitate understanding. Standard scholarly orientations to the study of Navajos and other ethnic populations manifest many biases of ethnocentrism and a general tendency to stereotype. Specific observer-related tendencies to distort are noted, among them tendencies to understate social dynamics and the degree to which Navajos are functioning parts of wider social systems. The literature on Navajos is a product of changing tools in the hands of changing observers applied to changing communities in the context of ongoing change in the wider societies of both observer and observed. It is argued that "multiplying glimpses," or increasing the number and types of observers and the variety of disciplines and paradigms represented, may reduce observer and position biases that distort existing views of Navajo society. An overview of the massive literature on the Navajo leads to the identification of 21 distinct genres. These genres and other Navajo texts may profitably be viewed in the perspective of textual analysis, broadly defined. Issues of meaning and interpretation are considered, including the reality-language-text nexus, construction of texts, text-context patterns, and the interaction of text, situation, and analyst in interpretation. Appropriate use of existing texts is socially responsible "green research" and should not be professionally stigmatized. It substitutes resource-efficient recycling of discarded and underanalyzed texts for the old expensive, obtrusive colonial patterns of work.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines key implications of praxis theory for applied anthropology. I am concerned with applied anthropology as a communicative and collaborative process and with a critical understanding of the anthropologist's role as consultant, practitioner, and analyst in processes of planned change. The use of praxis as a central analytic leitmotif places "practical" activity, informed by theory, at the center of applied research. The analysis is illustrated through a description of a multi-disciplinary, community-based health research and planning project in seven native communities in Ontario. I examine how practical knowledge and action constrains and transforms academic models of community based development.<br>

Abstract: Can a historical event, such as Partition, be understood as an action that "resulted" from complex, wide forces of history or also as an event continually brought into being by the play of subject memories? A relationship of complementarity exists between the problems internal to history and the demands and desires of memory, so much so that together they form integral parts of a single operation, the historiographical operation. Yet memory sometimes appears the obverse of history making. Human action, as this article remonstrates, sometimes overcomes the bounds of passivity imposed by memory and this is also what determines history.<br>

Abstract: This paper suggests that the vocabulary and meaningfulness of 'evil' can be re-articulated, and to some extent redeemed from the extremes of fundamentalism and relativism. It uses intellectual resources from Nigel Wright, Walter Wink and Rene Girard to reconstruct some foundations for a reworking of evil in human geography. It then presents an account of the reappearance of evil 'after postmodernism' in event, narrative and praxis, arguing that working through and acting against evil reveals its present nature in terms that defy the excesses of right-wing religious fundamentalism and the bland tolerance that can stem from an over-reliance on relativistic thinking. The paper considers how geographies of postsecular practice in areas such as homelessness emerge in response to discernment both of the spiritual interiorities and the exteriorities of landscapes of power, and of the ability of human action to influence these landscapes.<br>

Author(s): Jennings Theodore W.<br>
Abstract: Ritual studies is a new discipline within the field of the study of religion. Liturgical theology is, in the West, a recent development within the Held of systematic theology. The article describes each and indicates ways in which they may contribute to the work of the other while retaining their separate identities. The development of methods for describing and analyzing ritual action may enable liturgical theology to construct its own analyses upon a more broadly phenomenological base. At the same time theology's insight into the history of liturgical action may enable ritual studies to overcome an excessively synchronie perspective and to attend to the normative character of ritual gesture.<br>

Author(s): Brown Gavin<br>
Abstract: This paper, theoretical in nature, discusses how the study of ritual has been re-conceptualized in terms of performance theory. This involves firstly defining the difficult term 'performance' and then proceeding to explore how ritual can be recast as a (cultural) performance. Building on this discussion, it is argued that recasting ritual as performance has led the scholar of ritual to pay closer attention to how indeterminacy inheres within all ritual performances. This is explored in two senses. Firstly, by 'privileging the moment' in ritual analysis, the essentially indeterminate nature of meaning in ritual performances becomes evident. Secondly, working with Victor Turner's idea of ritual anti-structure and cultural reflexivity, I explore how rituals are constituted by cultural indeterminacy, a condition most discernible in the execution of ritual action, that is, in performance.<br>

Author(s): van DongenAbstract: In this article, I consider narratives told within a clinical setting. I argue that personnel in a day center for people with acquired brain damage are constantly involved in narrating about the disabled participants. The negotiation of who the participant is, and foremost will be, is in constant negotiation in regard to issues of hope. I further argue that hope is a meaning-making process and, as such, it has been defined as crucially connected to time. Hope has been said to enable a connection between the present and the future, because action taken in the present could bring about (positive) change in the future. However, I show that hope, in relation to narratives told about people with severe disabilities that are considered "incurable," must be understood within a realm of narrative foreclosure. Time seems to have lost the openness of its horizon for these people, and a narrative that tells of immediacy rather than chronology is created, resulting in hope being established within the present.<br>

Abstract: In this article we develop philosophically Cronbach's (1982) suggestion that the evaluator is an educator. The motivation for this article arose from problems encountered by us on a major evaluation project and from dissatisfaction with the existent philosophical underpinnings of evaluation theory. We propose, and provide a justification for, a model of evaluation based upon the notion of the evaluator as educator, which is sufficiently broad philosophically not only to subsume scientistic and humanistic models, but also to transcend them. Within this broad philosophical model we develop a particular theory of evaluation, based essentially upon Wittgenstein, and in which the notion of a learning community is taken as central. Finally we consider some practical implications of this theory of evaluation.<br>

Abstract: Northrop Frye's recent criticism confronts the contemporary problem raised most powerfully by the Vietnam War-can we find a telos or definition of man on which we can ground our moral reactions and our visions of human development. Frye establishes this telos by an analysis of origins. Contained in a civilization's statements of "concern," in its imaginative treatments of its own condition, one can find an underlying structure of desire which defines the ends of man. This structure and the recurrent images it produces then can serve as the middle terms people use to justify and value their actions. Frye shares his treatment of mediation with contemporary Hegelians like Sartre, Lukács, and Ricoeur, but grounds his absolute in tradition rather than in ideal absolutes or posited evolutionary patterns. Frye's idea of mediation also provides an ethical model for literary criticism: the critic tries to combine literature as product and as cultural possession by interpreting his materials as projections of imaginative desire. Furthermore, we can use Frye to criticize the relativist denial of origins in structuralist critics like Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.<br>

Abstract: Whereas the spoken word is part of present actuality, the written word normally is not. The writer, in isolation, constructs a role for his "audience" to play, and readers fictionalize themselves to correspond to the author's projection. The way readers fictionalize themselves shifts throughout literary history: Chaucer, Lyly, Nashe, Hemingway, and others furnish cases in point. All writing, from scientific monograph to history, epistolary correspondence, and diary writing, fictionalizes its readers. In oral performance, too, some fictionalizing of audience occurs, but in the live interaction between narrator and audience there is an existential relationship as well: the oral narrator modifies his story in accord with the real-not imagined-fatigue, enthusiasm, or other reactions of his listeners. Fictionalizing of audiences correlates with the use of masks or personae marking human communication generally, even with oneself. Lovers try to strip off all masks, and oral communication in a context of love can reduce masks to a minimum. In written communication and, a fortiori, print the masks are less removable.<br>

Abstract: Starting with Raglan's suggestion that Falstaff may be a "holy fool" and with Auden's belief that he is a comic symbol of charity, this essay explores the medieval tradition of wise fool, and especially Falstaff's always canny use of biblical allusion. His various jests, if read in relation to the political action of the main plot, reveal him as characterizing England's time of day and parodying the unchristian behavior of Hotspur, Henry, and Hal. By the time he dies mumbling Psalm xxiii to an uncomprehending Nell Quickly, there have accumulated many hints that he is, in fact, a candle to his age, a professional Fool with the heart of a faithful Lazarus, and destined to join Mowbray in Abraham's bosom. The merriment for which readers have found him lovable amid his masquerades of vice has its mysterious basis in his covertly Christian understanding of England's neo-Roman Caesars.<br>

Abstract: This article is an ethnographic exploration of the process through which citizens come to conceptualize their identities as political subjects in rapidly changing contexts. The focus of the article is the lifting, in 2003, of a ban on crossing between the northern and southern parts of the island of Cyprus, which had been instituted in 1974. The article examines how this new political change affected state rhetoric, and concentrates on the reactions of Greek-Cypriot citizens to this shift. These data are related to the wider discussion on the political theory of subjectivity and the concept of 'event', where, it is argued, anthropology has a significant contribution to make. / Le présent article est une exploration ethnographique des processus par lequel les citoyens en viennent à conceptualiser leurs identités comme sujets politiques dans des contextes de changements rapides. Il est centré sur l'abolition, en 2003, de l'interdiction de passage imposée en 1974 entre les parties Nord et Sud de L'île de Chypre. L'auteur examine la manière dont ce nouveau changement politique a affecté la rhétorique étatique, et se concentre sur les réactions des Chypriotes Grecs à cette évolution. Ces données sont replacées dans un cadre de discussion plus large sur la théorie politique de la subjectivité et le concept « d'événement », auquel l'anthropologie peut, selon l'auteur, apporter une contribution importante.<br>

Abstract: In his Narrative (1845), Frederick Douglass constructs a self based on conversion rhetoric and binary logic. In the greatly expanded My Bondage and My Freedom (1855), he complicates this textual self by both imitating and criticizing tropes conventionally used in the slavery debate, such as metaphors related to animals. Christianity, and manhood. Emphasizing the constructed nature of mimesis and metaphor, Douglass demonstrates his ability to escape the bondage of reductionist language even as he claims the power associated with linguistic mastery. This revision of self emerges from his experience of northern racism, manifested in his limited role in William Lloyd Garrison's organization. Douglass's renunciation of Garrisonian dogma and his entry into political action-including his striking textual reinterpretation of the United States Constitution-coincide with the stylistically "modernist" self of the second autobiography.<br>

Abstract: Analysis of a sequence of literary frames suggests that a heightened experience of interactional reality is also anomically constructive of the frame. In each of 16 frames, Durkheimian anomie neither destroys the frame's integrity nor renders its routine grounds unintelligible, as Goffman and Garfinkel would claim it must. Paradoxically, anomie ritually intensifies the frame. The selves in the paper's sequence of highly ritualized frames are not routine selves, however. They are 'strangers to themselves'. The analysis shows how Mead's 'I' can re-emerge from Goffman's ritual thinking - where the 'I' is collapsed into an interactionally-bound 'me' - as an original manifestation of great importance to interactants, and therefore to society as well. (Parenthetically it is also argued that selves need an element of rituality in order to be selflike and that it is interactional rituality which guarantees the evolution of social life beyond given frames, corpora, cultural repertoires, and collective representations.) The idea that interactants can be strangers to themselves is an advance on Goffman's and Garfinkel's accounts of interactional selfhood, but one that problematizes the prosecution of the interaction sociology that Goffman and Garfinkel pioneer, since strangers to themselves disappear in normal sociological appearances.<br>

Abstract: This paper offers a dialectical interpretation of place. It argues that much of the confusion in the literature on place stems from its failure to engage with the ontological nature of place. This has led to much research implicitly accepting a restrictive Cartesian view of socio-spatial reality. Entrikin's (1991) 'betweenness of place' thesis is a notable recent illustration. In this paper I suggest that the problematic nature of place and its relationship to space can be resolved through a dialectical mode of argumentation. The spatialized dialectic of Henri Lefebvre offers a fruitful framework for reconciling the interaction between place and space insofar as it strives to overcome dualistic conceptions of capitalist spatiality. Lefevbre's dialectical approach will be counterposed to Entrikin's argument. The paper concludes by outlining the implications of the respective perspectives for robust place theorization and place politics.<br>

Abstract: A detailed narrative performed by a Gros Ventre elder is analyzed for its significance in the construction of cultural identity. In the context of these analyses, it is argued that narrative performance can be central to the active construction of cultural identity for individuals engaged in social interaction. In the present instance, certain performative features of the narrative involve a discursive identification by the narrator with the narrative protagonist that affords a personal resolution of a cultural crisis-in-meaning. Finally, this discursive identification by the narrator results in the re-creation of narrative events that involve the audience as participants in ways that powerfully impact the cultural identities they too will construct.<br>

Abstract: This article describes how the people of Cartago, Costa Rica -- compelled, like each of us, to create -- incorporate the material culture of their town's market and plaza into social situations. In so doing, they move from the physical reality of simply being there to the distinctive social realities of being-in-the-market and being-in-the-plaza. The juxtaposition of these two complementary realities, the article concludes, constitutes the dialectic through which Spanish American culture becomes.

Abstract: In any field of experience anthropologists are confronted by spates of signs, many of which they fail to perceive. By way of an analysis of the mundane activities associated with riding a Songhay bush taxi in the Republic of Niger, this article probes the reflexive process through which anthropologist and ethnographic other learn to interpret the signs that comprise the discourse of social action. Having been confronted repeatedly with the signs of the other's universe, anthropologists may not only gain a new awareness of the sociocultural systems they seek to uncover but may also realize the limitations of their knowledge. Through what Dilthey called the hermeneutic, anthropologists will be more able to proceed profoundly and accurately toward an understanding of those signs that give substance and order to the complexities of social universes.

Abstract: Narrative, self, and face-to-face interaction all intersect in everyday storytelling practices in which children and caregivers make claims to personal experiences. This article examines such practices as a site for the social construction of self in early childhood. Drawing upon excerpts of narrative talk from a variety of cultural traditions in the United States, we describe the self-relevant meanings and processes entailed in three particular narrative practices.

Abstract: The relationships among texts, readers, and moral community are explored in order to understand the dissonance and interplay of personal and textual authority in local Islamic practice (Sunni, Shaf'i branch) among Malagasy-speaking villagers of Mayotte (Comoro Islands, East Africa). A political economy of knowledge approach is linked to an analysis of recitation as a ritual activity in which illocutionary force exceeds referential meaning. The discussion has relevance for the understanding of the relationship between religious knowledge, power, and action in Islamic societies as well as of the interface between the oral and the written more generally.

Abstract: Sumbanese descriptions of the "traditional house" as a microcosm and emblem of local identity are neither unproblematic expressions of a cultural totality nor simply objectifications imposed by ethnography or modernity. One way the house is able to serve as a discursive object reflects, in part, specifically Sumbanese models of action and beliefs about language as refracted in changing historical circumstances. In ritual, speakers seek to engage and elicit responses from powerful others, whereas current religious and political developments reframe ritual words as means of describing a cultural world. Both sets of practices draw on the authority of "entextualized" language but interpret it in different ways. Emerging representations of cultural meaning are shaped by long-standing speech genres and by recent social and cultural transformations, mediated by shifting language ideologies.

Abstract: An ethnographic study of the words and actions common to a shelter for people considered homeless and mentally ill shows how distinct forms of reasoning and personal agency relate to a set of practical concerns and political exigencies. Whereas the shelter's staff rely on and promote a referential language and direct, active forms of agency, its residents depend on tactical, persuasive uses of language and oblique, reactive forms of agency. Yet because the staff have the upper hand politically, their orientations to language, thought, and action take a more central role in encouraging people to act in sincere and reasonable ways. The residents draw on ideas of sincerity, reason, and personal accountability, but in makeshift ways, with the result that the ideas are caught up in the rhetoric of self-presentation. The article's findings underscore the need for anthropologists to attend to the diverse means, and political, linguistic, and cultural grounds, of human reason and agency.

Abstract: Recent changes within social and cultural anthropology have made history a key issue, but in this essay I argue that the field has yet to develop the resources that are required to deal with temporality. This point is made through an extended examination of Jean and John Comaroff's work on Christianity and colonialism in southern Africa. Arguably, the Comaroffs read history backward and then present its unfolding as a kind of inexorable logic. In doing so, they homogenize missionary and Tswana "cultures" and attribute agency to abstractions rather than to people acting in particular material contexts. In contrast, I argue for a narrative approach to historical anthropological explanation. The emergent qualities of events - and the variable ways in which capitalism, hegemony, Protestantism, and vernacular modernisms relate - require narrative for explanation, narrative that encompasses within itself the narratives of social actors themselves.<br>

Abstract: Introduced in France since a decade, the work of Moishe Postone appears as a global new interpretation of Marx. It hinges on the thesis according to which Marx does not propose a criticism of capitalism from the angle of work, but a criticism of work under capitalism. This article assesses the significance of this heterodox Marxism by trying to situate its epistemological background between a structuralist interpretation and a phenomenological interpretation of Marx. It shows that Postone builds an original structuralism, combining Althusser and Hegel, but struggles to link it up with a theory of subjectivation and action up to a thought which aims for the social transformation of and the emancipation from capitalism.<br>

Abstract: Résumé. Ce texte démontre le genre de questions qui se présentent aux études sur la condition des personnes handicapées informées par la sociologieen interrogent les interactions qui émergent autour des luttes pour «l'accès» dans un milieu de travail scolaire/ académique. Au cours de mes expériences dans un des plus grands édifices dans une des plus grandes universités au Canada, j'ai amassé des paroles quotidiennes qui justifient l'exclusion des personnes handicapées. J'ai rassemblé des narratifs représentants ce-qui-est possible-de-dire aujourd'hui sur la lutte pour l'accessibilité. En utilisant une approche sociologique interprétativiste, ce texte illustre la façon dont les significations de l'incapacité sont générés par un discours qui rends légitime la construction exclusive ainsi que les structures inaccessible de la vie universitaire. Dans ce texte, je démontre que l'accès n'est pas synonyme de justice mais, par contre, est un point de départ pour la réflexion critique où les relations sociaux entre corps et espace peut être considéré à nouveau. Ce texte contribue aux études sur la condition des personnes handicapées informées par la sociologie en analysant la façon dont la narration ordinaire et quotidienne de l'incapacité peut continuer à, en même temps que l'environnement physique change, agir comme pouvoir social qui reproduit le statuquo.<br>

Abstract: Cet article est issu d'une étude ethnographique menée à l'Université de Cape Town. Il explore la dynamique d'une intervention permettant au personnel de l'université de s'engager dans une voie alternative à celle de l'apartheid en Afrique du Sud. Il traite de la politique sociale qui apparut entre l'intervention, ses participants et non-participants imaginaires par rapport à la vision « transformatrice » de l'université. L'intention des interventionnistes a été retravaillée par les participants des principaux symboles qui mettent en forme les motifs de leurs comportements et donnent un sens à leurs expériences. Utilisant le modèle d'Ortner (1973) de reconnaissance et de symboles-clés, je soutiens que la « transformation » et « l'espace sûr » représentent une élaboration symboles, en ce sens qu'ils ont le pouvoir d'action et d'élaboration conceptuelle. Ces symboles d'élaboration fonctionnent en relais avec une sorte de logique qui « cristallise l'engagement » des participants vers l'intervention d'une manière émotionnellement puissante et relativement indifférenciée. Ce faisant, ils font de l'intervention un symbole capable d'exprimer ce que leur expérience signifie pour eux en tant que communauté imaginée par rapport aux autres.<br>

Abstract: Evaluative terms are a crucial part of the environmental discourse. These terms, and the evaluative frameworks in which they are imbedded, serve as important guides to action. “Natural,” a term commonly used as a positive evaluation, is problematic because it can both justify unfair social relations and obscure the connections between humans and the rest of nature. “Sustainable,” another popular term, is extremely malleable, and is too often elaborated in frameworks that are neither socially nor ecologically responsible. The term “sustainable” is sometimes used in the framework of ecosystem health, but even this approach can fail to highlight the interconnectedness of social and ecological systems. The framework of ecosocial flourishing, introduced in this article, is better suited for highlighting the interconnected nature of the world and for drawing attention to questions of environmental justice. Evaluative terms (like “natural”) and frameworks (like “ecosocial flourishing”) are part of larger narratives that help people make sense of their interactions with, and emotional responses to, the non-human world.<br>

Abstract: This article analyzes the social construction of silence in early-nineteenth-century Europe, focusing on France and the Netherlands. In both countries, the newly installed Restoration monarchies propagated a “politics of forgetting” of the problematic recent past of the revolution and the Napoleonic era as an essential part of attempts to build a stable and legitimate political order. This official forgetting was contested in both countries. On the basis of the “letters of adhesion,” the article examines the close interaction between the individual reconstruction of the personal past and social forgetting. Finally, it relates the rise of a historicizing culture in the early nineteenth century to the culture of silence in Restoration Europe.<br>

Abstract: This paper scrutinizes the fundamental assumption governing Gunther Teubner's theory of societal constitutionalism, namely that societal constitutions are ultimately about the regulation of inclusion and exclusion in global function systems. While endorsing the central role of inclusion/exclusion in constitutions, societal or otherwise, I argue that inclusion and exclusion are primordial categories of collective action, rather than functional categories. As a result, the self-closure which gives rise to a legal collective is spatial as much as it is temporal, and subjective no less than material. Inasmuch as legal orders must establish who ought to do what, where, and when, this entails, or so I argue, that any legal order we could imagine—including a global legal order such as cyberlaw—is necessarily bounded in space, time, content, and membership. This impinges directly on the inclusion/exclusion difference: that there can be no inclusion without exclusion entails, most fundamentally, that there can be no (il)legality without alegality, i.e. comportment that contests, sometimes radically, how a legal order draws the distinction between legality and illegality. In this fundamental sense, all legal orders have an outside—literally. Building on this insight, I suggest that the functional cosmopolitanism advocated by a theory of societal constitutionalism retains a residue of the logic of totalization it seeks to overcome. I conclude by exploring how a first-person plural theory of law both supports and transforms the insight that constitutions regulate the inclusion/exclusion difference by putting into place constitutive and limitative rules.<br>

Abstract: This article treats Mexican
         retablos(devotional paintings) in relation to people's actions. Retablos serve as a basis for seeing, talking about, and interpreting events born from oppressive, modern conditions. Actions and artful representation indicate, respectively, proximity to reality, from near to far—a difference that outlines a space for aesthetic production. I argue that retablos contribute to an aesthetic that orients the senses and the mind against oppressive conditions and toward a positive vision of what the world might be.<br>

Abstract: Recent scholarship has given considerable attention to lyric poetry as a form of sensuous knowledge. This approach emphasizes the corporeal origins of poetry, its genesis in the body or in language viewed as material. The question of sensuous knowledge is central to the larger theoretical issue of modernity itself, in which lyric holds a central yet ambiguous status. The question of sensuous knowledge is ultimately a question of meaning. However, modern thought — thought pertaining to “modernity” — is fundamentally circular. This would seem to establish an epistemological impasse for aesthetics. But I argue that this circularity offers an important, and necessary, way to limit knowledge and thereby ground an ethical subjectivity. My essay places formalism at the heart of sensuous knowledge. In this essay I develop an account of the importance of abstraction in sensuous knowledge by way of Kant's concept of
         Darstellung, “presentation [of sensory experience].” The “presentation” is the object as it has undergone a structural process of internalization and been made available for psychic use as meaning; that requires a recognition of loss. Where this is important for literature is that twentieth-century American poetry frequently uses very personal images of family life as a way of conveying sincerity about corporeal experience. I use this discussion of circularity in modern aesthetic thought to argue that there is a risk to taking shortcuts to meaning through images of the material bodies of children. In these contemporary poems by Gary Snyder, Sharon Olds and Rita Dove, the poets reject loss in favor of a very modern “affirmation” of the material. But affirmation and the visual image as a sign of affirmation cannot alone bind meaning to us. That meaning must be internalized through theworkof poetic presentation.<br>

Abstract: This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of the “(as yet) untold story” to consider the relationship between James Joyce's 1904 short story “Eveline” (in
         Dubliners) and Colm Tóibín's award-winning 2009 novel,Brooklyn. Although Tóibín has denied the influence of Joyce in general, there are many similarities in the storyworlds of the two protagonists, Eveline Hill and Eilis Lacey: Eveline wishes to leave her father's home in Dublin but stays, whilst Eilis would prefer to remain at home but is forced to emigrate. Both act according to their perception of their mother's wishes and the rightness of their decisions has preoccupied readers. Through close analysis of thought and speech presentation, this essay shows that interpretive responses to the actions of Eveline and Eilis are inextricably linked to the formal qualities of each text.<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: Is SPEP the city of God? This would be going too far. Not even the theological turn in French Phenomenology would make this claim. Dick Howard already threw in a troubling question: “diversification that perhaps gives more breadth than depth?” he asked. And there are plenty more troubling questions. SPEP is now a big operation. It has committees and subcommittees, multiple simultaneous sessions, blind review. All these developments are signs, perhaps inevitable ones, of its success, but all have familiar downsides: bureaucratization, diversification for its own sake, what Habermas would call
   Unübersichtlichkeit. This is what happens when outsiders become insiders, the antis become their own sort of establishment. You can't blame some of us for feeling nostalgic for our long-lost innocence, even though we all know—you don't have to be a philosopher of history to know this—that we can't go there. History has rendered a judgment, but Dick Howard said, “Historywilljudge.” That's one problem with history: It's always rendering judgments, but they are never final. You'd have to be at the end of history for that, and despite the claim of some philosophers, we aren't there yet. The slaughter bench of history looks very different today from the early 1960s, but it's still in some ways a slaughter bench. So how will the SPEP of the early twenty-first century look to the philosopher-historians of 2061—or is it 2062?<br>

Abstract: Our plight, then, is not simply that we are all in the same boat, let alone on the same ocean. Yet we are still bound by the responsbility of inhabiting the same planet. What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Abstract: No doubt the rise of religion has not only posed a particular dilemma for critical theory but also provided a curious place to end this reflection. Having started my career doing philosophy of religion it is somewhat surprising to meet religion again as I turn to what surely must be at least a later phase of my career. I am reminded of Antonio's line from the Italian film
            C'eravamo Tanto Amati, translated asWe All Loved Each Other So Much: “We thought we could change the world, but the world changed us.” “Philosophers only interpret the world, the point is to change it,” so said Marx. But in a curious way those who would change the world are changed by it.<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: I want to conclude with one more argument from my own work. I have very often argued that philosophers of technology, regarding the expectations of society and their own traditions and habits, may come “too late” to technologies. They too often undertake their reflections
            afterthe technologies are in place. Rather, I argue, they should reposition themselves at what I call the “R&D” position where technologies are taking developmental shape, in think tanks, in incubator facilities, in research centers. Only then can truly “new” and emerging technologies be fully philosophically engaged.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: The articles collected here represent the richness and diversity of philosophical work presented at SPEP and thus serve to vindicate Steinbock's vision, expressed in his Co-director's Address, of SPEP as an organization that is grounded in a fundamental openness to experience that leads it to continually push against its own limits and thus to reimagine itself.<br>

Abstract: Adopting a hyperbolic perspective is also certainly a way to argue as well as a way to examine other “texts” because it is a trope and figure of thought that reveals those moments within discourse when one is attempting to transcend the bounds of reality because the extraordinary nature of a given situation or subject matter requires the use of an excessive prophetic voice or an ardent polemical exaggeration. As Mileur posits, “The work is a hyperbole, the intersection of other hyperboles, and the subject is, insofar as he can be written about at all, another hyperbole” (1990, 86). Rather than circumventing it, understanding hyperbole as the focus of thought and action can create significant moments of
      inventioas well aselocutiofor the hyperbolist and critic alike. By approaching a particular text, a critical term, and even a piece of criticism itself from a hyperbolic perspective, one might (re)consider and (re)interpret these “texts” as a stretching of discursive limits that leads one toward a re-presentation of the extraordinary—an attempt to communicate the ineffable or transgress the expressible.<br>

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: The recent pragmatic-contextual theory of fiction entails the possibility of changes between fact and fiction over the course of time. It is also perhaps commonplace to state that this process can be reversed—that fictional texts may cease to be fictional. The question of generic fiction-to-fact transition, however, is rarely confronted in the theory of fiction. This essay investigates the generic expectations attached to texts that make a full-scale transition from fiction to nonfiction difficult, both culturally and psychologically. “Fiction” is understood here in a limited, pragmatic sense of a work of fiction, a text known and categorized as fiction. The discussion is structured around five interrelated reasons that contribute to the difficulty: (1) the commonness of as-if structures in everyday life; (2) the generic combinations among literature, fiction, factual representation, and narrative; (3) the relative stability of the communal values and ways of checking facts that determine the categories of fiction and fact (the fact convention); (4) the popularity, in fiction, of metalepsis and the theme of transworld travel between different ontological spheres; (5) and the fictionalization of literature in the historical perspective.<br>

Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>

Abstract: Flush with the juices of adolescence, American philosophy declared independence from its European parentage in the work of Ralph Waldo Emerson and his generation. In 1837, Emerson addressed the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa Society on the occasion of its inaugural meeting for the year, which he called a "holiday." Emerson began: I greet you on the recommencement of our literary year. Our anniversary is one of hope, and, perhaps, not enough of labor. We do not meet for games of strength or skill, for the recitation of histories, tragedies, and odes, like the ancient Greeks; for parliaments of love and poesy, like the Troubadours; nor for the advancement of science, like our contemporaries in the British and European capitals. Thus far, our holiday has been simply a friendly sign of the survival of the love of letters amongst a people too busy to give letters any more. Perhaps the time is already come when it ought to be, and will be something else; when the sluggard intellect of this continent will look from under its iron lids and fill the postponed expectations of the world with something better than the expectations of mechanical skill. Our day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close. The millions that around us are rushing into life, cannot always be fed on the sere remains of foreign harvests. Events, actions arise, that must be sung, that will sing themselves.<br>

Abstract: Medical humanities and ethics are getting more and more important in Europe as essential disciplines of the core curriculum for health-care professionals. The idea of the physician as a technician shows itself to be unbearable because of the global historical changes we daily face in caring settings. We deal with chronic diseases, which require a sensitive physician/patient covenant and a good performance in communication skills1 because a whole life-style transformation is often necessary. Moreover, citizens are more informed about both the technological progress and their civil rights, so that a shared decision has to be prepared and implemented by exploring the emotional reactions to illness, by explaining the effects of different ways of treatment, and by revealing in advance the choices that could be taken.<br>

Abstract: In this article, Ilya Kliger and Nasser Zakariya treat Lev Tolstoi’s conception of brotherhood from a narratological perspective. In the process, they trace the outlines of late Tolstoian narrative poetics, situating it within a variegated landscape of Tolstoi’s own more properly “realist” literary practice, and offering broader suggestions on the workings of narrative in its capacity to model social relations and ethical action. A narratological focus here allows them to elucidate how stories take part in contemporary understandings of social influence, human connectedness, and alienation—not only on the level of themes but also, and more deeply, on the level of the narrative organization of events. Their main focus is on one of Tolstoi’s late novellas “The Forged Coupon” and his last novel
         Resurrection.<br>
