  Abstract: In chapter 4, we described the movement of the Palestinian people from a symbol system based to varying degrees on Arab, Islamic, and nationalist impulses toward a Palestinian Arab identity and movement rooted in myth. By 1937, the Palestinians had developed a symbol system that was based on ideological and mythic foundations that collapsed the scene (Palestine) and the agent (the Palestinian Arabs) into a consubstantiation. In this chapter, we examine the trajectory of Palestinian symbol use from the 1940s to 1960s.<br>

  Hospitality as Interruptive Practice from:

  Author(s) ZACCARIA PAOLA<br>
  Abstract: Hospitality has emerged as a key concept in our contemporary era of global migration. The
                  Oxford English Dictionarydefines hospitality as “the act or practice of being hospitable; the reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers, with liberality and goodwill.” The host (from the Latin,hospes), the individual agent who practices or gives hospitality, is “a man who lodges and entertains another in his house.”¹ Whether it is an ethical, political, or juridical concept, a matter of philanthropy or a matter of right, the central gesture of hospitality is that of opening, more precisely, to open oneself up to<br>

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, eac~<br>

  The Allowing Conditions of Metaphor from:

  Abstract: Someday I’d like to write an article on the rhetoric of book and chapter titles, a fairly typical example of which you see above. We are drawn towards this kind of hinged twofold structure: there is a metaphoric or playful gesture on one side, and a discursive statement on the other telling us what the work is “really” about. The two halves are related: the discursive element participates in its metaphoric resonances, with the metaphoric resonances grounded in the discursive ballast. The colon represents an axis, a bonding agent in the juxtaposition, metaphor as part of the grammar of thinking.<br>

  Book Title: Exodus and Resurrection-The God of Israel in the Theology of Robert W. Jenson<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Nicol Andrew W.<br>
  Abstract: Exodus and Resurrection establishes the important place God’s identity as the “God of Israel" has in the systematic theology of Robert W. Jenson. The work demonstrates that the identification of the God of Israel as the agent of Jesus’ resurrection functions as a foundational premise in Jenson’s Trinitarian theology. Andrew W. Nicol argues that a central characteristic of Jenson’s work is not merely his recognition that the same God who rescued Israel from Egypt raised Jesus from the dead, or the related yet distinct step of renovating his theology in a nonsupersessionist fashion, but also his attempt to conceive of the full implications for doing so in Christian theology, in the church’s self-understanding, and in the church’s relation to Israel and continuing Judaism. In this, Exodus and Resurrection provides a clear and critically appreciative account of Robert W. Jenson’s work and offers a new vital architectonic map of Jenson’s systematic vision.<br>

  Book Title: Into the Far Country-Karl Barth and the Modern Subject<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Long D. Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Into the Far Country is an investigation of Karl Barth’s response to modernity as seen through the prism of the subject under judgment. By suggesting that Barth offers a form of theological resistance to the Enlightenment’s construal of human subjectivity as “absolute," this piece offers a way of talking about the formation of human persons as the process of being kenotically laid bare before the cross and resurrection of Christ. It does so by reevaluating the relationship between Barth and modernity, making the case that Barth understands Protestantism to have become the agent of its own demise by capitulating to modernity’s insistence on the axiomatic priority of the isolated Cartesian ego. Conversations are hosted with figures including Fyodor Dostoevsky, Rowan Williams, Gillian Rose and Donald MacKinnon in the service of elucidating an account of the human person liberated from captivity to what Barth names “self-judgment," and freed for creative participation in the super-abundant source of life that is the prayerful movement from the Son to the Father in the Spirit. Therefore, an account of Barth’s theology is offered that is deeply concerned with the triune God’s revelatory presence as that which drives the community into the crucible of difficulty that is the life of kenotic dispossession.<br>

  Abstract: Satan is part of the myth of evil and if we assume that the story is one way to approach the reality of evil, we need to examine the myth in more detail. From a secular viewpoint, any metaphysical approach to the question of evil does not work. The responsibilities for all human actions lay, since Kant, in the agent’s will and accordingly, so does the decision to commit an evil deed. Nevertheless, despite all efforts to explain human behavior with psychology, sociology, biology, and psychoanalysis, there seems to be an explanatory gap when it comes to actions that hurt<br>

  Abstract: Following the aforementioned definition, which corresponds also to theoretical approaches of embodiment and its perception (Merleau-Ponty 1964, 159–90; Lesure 2005), it is argued that the built environment demonstrates from prehistoric times an anthropogenic system of closed and open spaces for hosting every-day life, economic, social and symbolic activities. It represents, therefore, an agent through which the needs, abilities and habits of humans are embodied, but also the field for economic and social interaction. Moreover, built environment — domestic, funeral, and sacred — displays the existential ground of culture that allows the identification of its cognitive creator and owner.<br>

  Book Title: Metaphor, Morality, and the Spirit in Romans 8-1–17<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Robinson William E. W.<br>
  Abstract: In this innovative book, William E. W. Robinson takes the reader on a journey through Romans 8:1-17 using Conceptual Metaphor Theory and Conceptual Integration Theory. Robinson delineates the underlying cognitive metaphors, their structure, their function, what they mean, and how Paul's audiences then and now are able to comprehend their meaning. He examines each metaphor in the light of relevant aspects of the Greco-Roman world and Paul's Jewish background. Robinson contends that Paul portrays the Spirit as the principal agent in the religious-ethical life of believers. At the same time, his analysis demonstrates that the conceptual metaphors in Romans 8:1-17 convey the integral role of believers in ethical conduct. In the process, he addresses thorny theological issues such as whether Spirit and flesh signal an internal battle within believers or two conflicting ways of life. Finally, Robinson shows how this study is relevant to related Pauline passages and challenges scholars to incorporate these methods into their own investigation of biblical texts.<br>

And if all the New Testament references are amassed, from the lowliest human agent to the powers in high places, from the Sadducean party to the Beast rising out of the sea, the preponderance of them report demonic agencies, a host in rebellion against God.

  Book Title: Sonata Fragments-Romantic Narratives in Chopin, Schumann, and Brahms<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Davis Andrew<br>
  Abstract: In
      Sonata Fragments, Andrew Davis argues that the Romantic sonata is firmly rooted, both formally and expressively, in its Classical forebears, using Classical conventions in order to convey a broad constellation of Romantic aesthetic values. This claim runs contrary to conventional theories of the Romantic sonata that place this nineteenth-century musical form squarely outside inherited Classical sonata procedures. Building on Sonata Theory, Davis examines moments of fracture and fragmentation that disrupt the cohesive and linear temporality in piano sonatas by Chopin, Brahms, and Schumann. These disruptions in the sonata form are a narrative technique that signify temporal shifts during which we move from the outer action to the inner thoughts of a musical agent, or we move from the story as it unfolds to a flashback or flash-forward. Through an interpretation of Romantic sonatas as temporally multi-dimensional works in which portions of the music in any given piece can lie inside or outside of what Sonata Theory would define as the sonata-space proper, Davis reads into these ruptures a narrative of expressive features that mark these sonatas as uniquely Romantic.<br>

At first glance, this identification of time as his “essential theme” seems counterintuitive, given his steadfast focus on the nature of responsibility and the subject’s relation to alterity. However, how we understand time shapes how we understand the self, and Levinas argues that a formal conception of time supports the modern ideal of autonomous subjectivity.

Choosing to testify to an experience or event that others, or the established narrative of a culture, may contest may alter the rest of a person’s life. Witnessing is not without cost to both the agent bearing witness and also possibly to the audiences, the secondary witnesses hearing or observing the testimony.

  Book Title: The Machine Question-Critical Perspectives on AI, Robots, and Ethics<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Gunkel David J.<br>
  Abstract: One of the enduring concerns of moral philosophy is deciding who or what is deserving of ethical consideration. Much recent attention has been devoted to the "animal question" -- consideration of the moral status of nonhuman animals. In this book, David Gunkel takes up the "machine question": whether and to what extent intelligent and autonomous machines of our own making can be considered to have legitimate moral responsibilities and any legitimate claim to moral consideration. The machine question poses a fundamental challenge to moral thinking, questioning the traditional philosophical conceptualization of technology as a tool or instrument to be used by human agents. Gunkel begins by addressing the question of machine moral agency: whether a machine might be considered a legitimate moral agent that could be held responsible for decisions and actions. He then approaches the machine question from the other side, considering whether a machine might be a moral patient due legitimate moral consideration. Finally, Gunkel considers some recent innovations in moral philosophy and critical theory that complicate the machine question, deconstructing the binary agent--patient opposition itself. Technological advances may prompt us to wonder if the science fiction of computers and robots whose actions affect their human companions (think of HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey) could become science fact. Gunkel's argument promises to influence future considerations of ethics, ourselves, and the other entities who inhabit this world.<br>

  Abstract: Moral philosophy has typically, in one way or another, made exclusive decisions about who is and who is not a legitimate moral agent and/or patient. We have, in effect, sought to determine the line dividing who or what is considered a member of the community of moral subjects from who or what remains outside. And we have done so by, as Thomas Birch (1993, 315) explains, assuming “that we can and ought to find, formulate, establish, institute in our practices, a criterion for (a proof schema of) membership in the class of beings that are moral

  Book Title: The Subject in Crisis in Contemporary Chinese Literature-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Cai Rong<br>
  Abstract: Post-Mao China produced two parallel discourses on the human subject in the New Era (1976–1989). One was an autonomous, Enlightenment humanist self aimed at replacing the revolutionary paragon that had dominated under Mao. The other was a more problematic subject suffering from either a symbolic physical deformity or some kind of spiritual paralysis that undermines its apparent normalcy. How do we explain the stubborn presence, in the literature of the 1980s and 1990s, of this crippled agent who fails to realize the humanist autonomy envisioned by post-Mao theorists? What are the anxieties and tensions embedded in this incongruity and what do they reveal? This illuminating and original critical study of the crippled subject in post-Mao literature offers a detailed textual analysis of the work of five well-known contemporary writers: Han Shaogong, Can Xue, Yu Hua, Mo Yan, and Jia Pingwa. The author investigates not only the literary characters within the texts, but also their creators—real subjects in history, Chinese writers whose own agency was being tested and established in the search for a new subjectivity. She argues that, reenacting the Maoist legacy, the literary search failed to provide a viable model for a postrevolutionary China. In addition, the deficiency and inadequacy of the subject cannot always be contained in the Communist past—a history to be transcended in the design of modernity after Mao. The representation of the problematic subject thus punctured post-Mao optimism and foreshadowed the eventual abandonment of the move to rethink subjectivity in the 1990s. By diving beneath the euphoria of the 1980s and the confusion and frustration of the 1990s, these critical readings offer a unique perspective with which to gauge the complexity of China’s quest for modernity and a fuller understanding of the self’s multifaceted experience in the post-Mao era.<br>

Beyond the obvious train of events, the monotonous and predictable taking of decisions (which is often no more than assuming one’s own destiny, what is given to us and what we can accommodate only with decorum),¹ on a very few exceptional occasions the dull cadence of action is interrupted and, with a flash of proof, with an almost luminous character of revelation, the agent is shown the emptiness of his existence, the irreparable hollowness of his existential becoming.<br>

  Abstract: Paradoxically, after 1989 Marx’s political philosophy can be read not only as philosophical but also as political. If Marxism is not (in Sartre’s famous phrase) the “unsurpassable horizon of our times,” it remains a rigorous confrontation with modernity and a challenging attempt to understand its novelty.¹ This is because, despite Marx’s intention to provide a theory 
                  of the revolutionary proletariat that would serve for the praxis of that world historical agent, he was and continued to be a philosopher; despite his critique(s) of idealism, Marx remained under its spell.

Abstract: This latest book by France’s preeminent sociologist provides a compact presentation of his concerns, methods, and leading concepts. The book, first, engages in a sustained critique of the illusions that philosophy falls into when it ignores the historical, social, and economic conditions of its objects and its own existence. He is particularly concerned with the errors that arise from collapsing practical, embodied, everyday ways of knowing into theoretical models of knowledge, though he also criticizes forms of false universalism in morality and aesthetics, which ignore the empirical realities of differential distributions of economic and cultural capital and of access to the requisite dispositions and interests required for political and cultural participation. Second, the book provides a critique of current social‐scientific methodologies, while promoting Bourdieu’s preferred “reflexive realism,” intended to avoid both objectivism and relativism through a radical historicization of social‐scientific reason itself. Unfortunately, this section lacks the sustained, careful argumentation that philosophers of social science might wish for. Third, the last three—and strongest—chapters present Bourdieu’s leading concepts and basic social analyses: “habitus” as an agent’s embodied, affectively conditioned practical knowledge and dispositions; social space as differentiated into fields of symbolic struggle over cultural capital; the reproduction of social order through dialectical attunement between objective structures and habitus; and the symbolic violence arising from differential access to the means and sites for defining the categories and stakes of symbolic fields. The book will be an excellent introduction to Bourdieu’s fruitful thought for philosophers and social theorists.<br>

Abstract: Of course literary scholars have analyzed style at least as much as have sociologists. Kenneth Burke’s influential scholarship (
         1945), for example, discovers a stable style of representing action across a wide range of literary, philosophical, and popular works, from Ibsen to Lenin. Discourses always identify the act, the scene, the agent, the means of agency, and the purpose of the action. The question for him, then, is how different discourses combine these elements in different ways. Burke (1945) offers crucial insights into the ways people createstories or arguments aboutaction—what he calls “a grammar of motives.” But to understand how collective representations become meaningful in everyday life, social researchers need to observe howgroupscoordinate themselves, not only how individuals or texts conceive of action (illuminating as that is for other purposes; see, e.g., Benoit2000).<br>

Abstract: 2. How sharp is the distinction between paradigms?As with any other form of narrative accounthistory is no exceptionI am quite aware that I was an important agent in the construction of the historical realities I have been trying to depict. It is sufficient to read Murrays (1998) discussion of what he calls (in the title but not throughout his book) American sociolinguistics to find a historical account based on some of the same sources I evoke that is somewhat different from mine. At the same time, I believe that there is sufficient evidence that something quite dramatic happened in the 1960s with the birth of sociolinguistics and the ethnography of communication and something equally dramatic happened in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the influx of new conceptual tools and the wider availability and adoption of new recording technologies.<br>

Abstract: Another example of objectification occurs when I am defined as an object reduced to the parameters seen by economic theory—when I become the famous “economic agent,” supposedly summed up by the calculation of my needs, by the evaluation of these needs in numbered costs and the balancing of these costs against purchasing power, and finally by the purported rational calculation of a correspondence between the costs of the objects of the needs and this purchasing power. In order to attain even an approximation of rigor, this stage‐by‐stage reduction assumes that choices are made according to the laws of exchange and thus that the economic agent proceeds strictly according to self‐interest, in short, that I only know and practice business, which is to say strict exchange according to the iron law of a selfishness that is no longer moral, but epistemological. Thus there disappears from economic analysis everything that escapes exchange and commerce, but which doubtless makes them possible and flows over them in every direction: the gift and all the forms of social gratuity that have not yet been rendered economic. For if economy economizes on the gift, then more fundamentally, gratuity economizes on economy itself.

Abstract: Refiguration, or reauthoring, “marks the intersection of the world of the text and the world of the hearer or reader” [
            14, p. 71]. It is the intersection of the world as configured by the text and the world of action, or it can be understood as the return to the world of action by the individual agent or reader. “Narrative has its full meaning when it is restored to the time of action and of suffering in mimesis3” [14, p. 70]. Entry into a practical field in this sense involves entry into a field of references that themselves are part of the process. (Note that “suffering” is defined as the counterpart to the action of another; hence, the meaning is broader than that found in everyday language.)<br>

Abstract: Yet while mutual recognition of free agency ensuring equal participation—recognition of “participatory parity,” to borrow Nancy Fraser’s term—is a necessary and indispensable precondition of there being a polity free of overt institutional domination and exclusion, it in and of itself is not sufficient to bring that polity into being as a genuine community animated by a spirit of solidaristic acceptance of one another, as Axel Honneth argues.
         23My recognition and letting go of the other as a free agent, when reciprocated by the other, may lead to an uncoerced consensus on the conditions of peaceful coexistence, but that by itself does not guarantee that the consensus reached would be anything other than merely expedient and self‐interested compromises grudgingly agreed to by either or both of the parties involved. What can be missing here is a genuine recognition of the worth of the other, without which what could prevail in the relationship between the two is the suspicion that the other’s act of recognizing my free agency is mere “tolerance” that is actually a thinly veiled contempt of who and what I am.<br>

Abstract: At the end of this avalanche of metaphorical connections, of “marvelous” associations, what final and conclusive role do we assign to the shroud, to the figure marked with the Word’s sympathetic blood? Emanuele Tesauro daringly states that in the beginning was the Father’s Metaphor, the Son, who became figure to share the metaphorical idiom of our “mirror,” the intellect. The dialogue between the divinity and human beings exists as reflecting metaphors. The blood of Christ is the quintessential manifestation of the intrinsically metaphorical nature of the real and of his infinite compassion. If we are mirrors blinded by the marvel constantly disclosed by divine compassion, our exegesis is a maze of hypothetical reflections, of hypothetical metaphorical comparisons. Paul’s words are clear: “Now we see only reflections in a mirror.”
      127In allowing the image of the crucified Word, the metaphor of the Father, to reflect its marvel on our beclouded mirror, we are invited to fathom our own metaphorical nature, our being nothing but visible echoes of the Father’s original metaphor. Christ is our biography. Like the martyr Maurice, the shroud’s “agent,” we are reflections of a luminous marvel of salvation.<br>

Abstract: Yet, while this site cannot become one of collective experience, let alone collective memory, by subjecting it to this analysis I am dealing with it as a historical fact or place. In a different context, Susan Crane asked: “When is the personal historical?” She replied to her own question: “Whenever one is thinking about oneself historically.”
         98Crane herself was concerned primarily with the nature of historical consciousness as perceiving individually but signifying collectively and with the fine line running between autobiography and historiography. By both looking at myself as a historian describing and reflecting on a certain period and approaching myself as an agent of this period who is utilizing my own living memory as a historical source, I inevitably make some of the personal historical. For the duration of this text, at least, even the pharmacy assumes some historical meaning—metaphorically embodying, with its makeover from medical to clothing store, and with the physical although not functional presence of its former designation, the complex story of rupture and continuity between the Communist and post‐Communist era.<br>

Abstract: By the time of Thomas’s
         Summa Theologica, the distinction of poetics from ethics is fully taken for granted. In the brief sections he devotes to it, Thomas directly and explicitly follows Aristotle to argue that “art is the ‘right reason of things to be made’; whereas prudence [that is, phronesis] is the ‘right reason of things to be done.’ … Now ‘making’ and ‘doing’ differ … in that ‘making’ is an action passing into outward matter, e.g. ‘to build,’ ‘to saw,’ and so forth; whereas ‘doing’ is an action abiding in the agent, e.g. ‘to see,’ ‘to will,’ and the like.”9Again, since moral virtue is judged according to its internal habit or end, it is of an entirely different nature than art or creativity, whose goodness or worth is defined principally by the external form of its product.<br>

Abstract: A defense of a strong version of intellectual freedom is proposed by Tony Doyle. Doyle rests his argument on utilitarianism, especially on John Stuart Mill’s liberalism. There is much in Mill’s thought that presents cogent points in favor of freedom, most notably that a free society benefits in multiple ways from a free and open exchange of ideas. Because of the many benefits, it is thus better for society to allow all works to circulate; those that have no utility will be recognized for their shortcomings. Doyle says, “The utilitarian will concede that some things would be better left unexpressed, unpublished, unseen, and unread. The trouble is, we cannot know beforehand precisely which set of ideas or images, if published, would do more harm than good” [
      26, p. 69]. There are no reasonable grounds for ignoring the consequences of actions. Utilitarianism has, over the years, encountered substantive criticism and numerous challenges. Two in particular can be mentioned here as a means of demonstrating that utilitarianism is not an adequate practical and normative ethical position. Samuel Scheffler argues for an agent‐centered prerogative that must be infused into any ethical theory and that is absent from all consequentialist theories. Recognition of individual integrity, according to Scheffler, is vital to realization of human agency and authenticity. Based on that recognition, agents must be free to not always produce the best results or outcomes for society as a whole [27]. Fallis and Mathiesen, responding to Doyle, state, “The question is what will have worse consequences from the point of view of utilitarianism: (a) censoring some material that ought not to be or (b) not censoring some material that should be. This is an empirical question. And there may be extremely compelling evidence that certain material is so potentially harmful … that it is better to have some benign material censored along with it than to have it not censored at all” [28, p. 438].

Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: At this juncture let me return to the Platonic motif of the care of the soul and the first awakening of responsibility that is the core idea of European life, but with which the Christian understanding of the responsible self must also, according to Patočka, make a clear break. Let us thus once again remind ourselves that knowledge of what is eternal—justice, beauty, the Good—is the basis of Greek responsible life. Responsibility itself is something public because it is based upon knowledge, to which everyone has access in principle. It is possible to account for the concept of responsibility and to universally establish what responsibility and being responsible consist of, but such an understanding of responsibility also implies that the responsible self must be able to give reasons for any of his or her actions and beliefs, publicly whenever possible. According to this Platonic conception of responsibility, “not knowing, having neither a sufficient knowledge or consciousness of what being
      responsiblemeans, is of itself a lack of responsibility. In order to be responsible it is necessary to respond to or answer to what being responsible means” (GD,p. 25). To the extent that the Platonic conception of the care of the soul is the first awakening of and to responsibility and hence that this understanding of responsibility is the first moment in the genealogy of responsibility in (or as) Europe, this demand that knowledge be involved in responsible decision making is at the heart of the history of the concept. It dominates the thought on responsibility in Europe from Plato’s to Husserl’s reflections on an absolutely self‐responsible universal science. Derrida refers to this Greek moment and endorses it, thus highlighting a certain continuity between his own thought and that of Husserl on this issue when he writes that responsibility consists, “according to the most convincing and most convinceddoxa, inresponding, hence in answering to the other, before the other ~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: When combined with passages such as Chāndogya 6.1 that speak of brahman as the cosmological substrate, this affirmation of brahman as an intelligent, deliberative causal agent results in a concept of brahman utterly transcending human powers of intuitive comprehension. A transcendent conception of brahman is generated from the juxtaposition of two logically irreconcilable claims. We witness this emergence of transcendence out of contradiction in the topical section, or
         adhikaraṇa, consisting of the five sutras of I.4.23–27. Here Śaṅkara affirms brahman as the world’s material (upādāna) as well as efficient (nimitta) cause. The problematic dealt with in thisadhikaraṇapresupposes the result of I.1.5ff., namely, that brahman, against the claims of the Sāṃkhyas, is a deliberative causal agent. Thepūrvapakṣinappeals to this result in arguing that only efficient causality can be plausibly attributed to brahman (nimittakāraṇatvam eva brahmaṇaḥ). Causality preceded by deliberation is observed only with respect to efficient causes like potters and goldsmiths.41Moreover, efficient causality exempts the changeless and pure brahman from the requirement that the (material) cause share the same defiled nature as its effect.42<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: For the protagonist to become his own lack, of course, is only a felt castration if he feels he has something to lose. And, thanks to Amy, Arthur doesn't realize that anything has been lost, that there has been any story to compare with hers, any love like it, or even one as strong in another and more fundamental way. Yes, in giving up the name Dorrit just before the close of her namesake novel, Amy has become her own antithesis in Mrs. Clennam, agent in turn of the same suppression, with the result that the most insidious role reversal yet, the real identity transfer, is that of Arthur for his own silenced maternal origin. Unprocessed mourning cannibalizes the other whose absence it cannot accept, whose very recognition the narrative has blocked in order to transmute it. As narratography (rather than narratology) is scaled to register along the lexical, syntactic, and figurative terrain of fictional prose itself, the arc of Dickensian plotting cannot afford in full view to lament its founding victim, nor let its hero elegize her, nor let the heroine acknowledge her let alone (and because of) the place she holds in her stead. And not being able to love the mother, or mourn her,
         the son has become her.Here lies the keenest if quietest violence of the novel: the double silencing of male as well as female energy even in their most defining of adult relations and the foisting of all connubial desire onto a life of communal duty instead.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 592372<br>
Date: 01 2009<br>
Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Augustine’s apology for Christianity and the idea of just war suggests a point that he and his interlocutors presumed as obvious, namely, that there is an ethics of memory—a duty to remember justly for the sake of history, self‐understanding, and narrative recollection. He thus invites us to consider the obligations and virtues of what Ricoeur calls a “just memory.”
         82Augustine’s ethics is, as I noted above, “agent‐referring”: it attends to the moral effects of an action on the character of the person carrying out that action. He developed his agent‐referring concerns, moreover, not by looking at the morality of individuals as isolated monads but as situated and affected by cultural forces that help shape character over time. The temporal quality of character and culture led him naturally to consider the virtues that surround memory, both individual and collective.83Given the intimate connection between memory and identity, there is an obvious obligation to remember for Augustine, a responsibility to remember truthfully. He thus worried about whether what people remember about themselves is prone to self‐aggrandizement and, with that, self‐deception. For these reasons, we can say that an Augustinian ethics of war is, among other things, an ethics of memory. That Rome’s morality “proceeded to bloody strife of all parties and then to the social and civil wars” is not his own personal judgment; it is, in his words, “the witness of history.”84<br>

That fact has been a reason for my work on the theme of responsibility. An ethics of responsibility, I contend, insists that human beings exist within patterns of interaction, with environments laden with values, to which they must respond and in which environments and agents reflexively shape each other. The capacity to have actions imputed or ascribed to an agent is with respect to the power to respond to environments—some of those environments are composed of other agents—that sustain but also limit action. Imputing and ascribing responsibility and so identifying agents are of course exceedingly complex processes, and I cannot explore them in this lecture. Still, responsibility is about the exercise of power in response to other powers, human and nonhuman, in which that is always and already laden with orienting goods, with values.

Abstract: Through this notion of being‐for‐God, we can see more clearly how prayer functions in the above notebook entries. In 1810, Coleridge had argued that prayer mediated between conscience and action: this makes sense, as prayer attests and bears witness to one’s sense of responsibility to God. It is the act of recognizing the demand of conscience and answering it, even if the only human answer that is truly faithful and appropriate sometimes seems to be guilt itself, tangled in its very attitude toward the promise of grace: “Mercy! mercy!” (N6244, fol. 74v). In 1827, the terms in question are those of activity and passivity: how can the human will bend itself into accord with the divine will? The answer is that the “I” must wrestle with the narcissism of its own being in order to attest to its being‐for‐God. In prayer, the human subject can be both “agent” and “patient”—that is, one who acts freely as a self but through this very act recognizes and accepts the self as for another, even as a gift from that other. Hence, this is the heart of Coleridge’s philosophy of prayer: being for and before God, “turning your thoughts into acts by connecting them by an act with the idea of the Redeemer God.” In prayer, a phenomenological intentionality directed solely toward our sense of responsibility—“a conscious will‐effected sense of his presence” (N6155)—can at least help orientate our being before and for God. This is why Coleridge can assert that in prayer alone is the life or will united with the idea of God (e.g., N5228, N5383) and why it can be a way out of the gnarled condition of sin. If one at least acknowledges one’s being‐for‐God, even if only in contemplating one’s abandonment of it in all other acts and intentionalities, then the economy of Christian salvation can be initiated: “O for the
         powerto cry out for mercy from the inmost / That would be Redemption!” (N3353).<br>

Abstract: Gauchet's is a decidedly “political history of religion” that attaches paramount importance to the state. The rise of this “sacral transforming agent” imposed the otherness that once characterized the gods of the first religions on and in society. As a result, the divine appeared ever more remote as an “organizing principle,” and humans were left in a position to “reappropriate” the world. This theologico-political transformation ushered in a long procession of events culminating in the emergence of Christianity, the religion that functioned as a theological conduit for departing from religion. The final act of Gauchet's passion play of the sacred unfolds during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with the Protestant and Catholic Reformations and the rise of political absolutism; the former enshrined the freedom of the conscience, while the latter completed the process of cleaving the terrestrial from the divine sphere. Ultimately, individuals came to assert themselves in the void left by a transcendent divinity: “God's greatness, taken to the highest level, puts humans on an equal footing with the mystery of creation and validates their independence as cognitive subjects.” The appearance of the modern individual and the modern state signaled the completion of what Gauchet calls a “revolution in transcendence,” predicated on human reoccupation of the space once entirely controlled by the divine. Nevertheless, the self's past alienation from its origins was not simply overcome but instead transferred to psychological, social, and political dualities that persist both within and among individual selves. As Gauchet observes, “Leaving religion is not like waking from a dream. We originated in religion, we continue to explain ourselves through it, and always will.”

Abstract: There are also evident similarities between Larmore’s account and Korsgaard’s analysis of “self-constitution” via the unity of reasons (theoretical and practical) that one acknowledges and maintains. Larmore’s book first appeared in French in 2004 and thus was presumably composed around the same time as Korsgaard’s Locke Lectures—and Larmore’s analysis of reasons develops themes already introduced in his
      The Morals of Modernity(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996, esp. chap. 5). But Larmore’s view is clearly distinguished from Korsgaard’s and Sartre’s (which is discussed in detail) by his cogent arguments that reasons which hold together a self (92) cannot get their normative force merely from the agent’s choice or endorsement (95) but require an authority that comes from the apparent objective worth of their objects. Like Gary Watson, Eleonore Stump, Susan Wolf, and others, he also rightly applies this modification to Harry Frankfurt’s account, noting that a second-order desire (or volition) only has the requisite authority if it “embodies an evaluation of the desires to which it refers” (98). Larmore might have clarified this by referring to Charles Taylor’s concept of “strong evaluation,” but he obscures Taylor’s distinction by arguing that all desires involve a normative element. His account is notable for this detailed “Normativist Conception of the Mind” (chap. 4), his related reconstruction of “first person authority” (chap. 5), and his sustained critique and reconstruction of “authenticity” ideals (chaps. 1–3). I begin with brief comments on the narrative account of chapter 7.<br>

Abstract: Between these two camps there are what we might call the “compatibilists”—critics who recognize both Satan and Eve as sources for the dream and do not feel compelled to frame the discussion in terms of an either/or. Northrop Frye saw the dream both as satanically influenced and as a kind of “wish-fulfillment” on the part of Eve—an argument echoed by Patrides: “The dream, though instigated by Satan, is yet a projection of her innermost desires and aspirations.”
         
               More recently, N. K. Sugimura has taken up the question, and while she begins by claiming that “Satan, not Eve herself, gives rise to the distempering; spirits enter from the outside,” she quickly adds that on another reading the dream “gestures at a notion of defilement occurring less from an agent entering in from the outside than from a process of actualizing, or realizing, what is already present on the inside.”17
            
               Like the internalists these critics point to something already inside Eve that facilitates the seduction, but they generally do not see this as evidence that Eve was fallen before she fell. Compatibilists are simply more comfortable with the dream’s lack of a single point of origin and the subtle dialectic it involves. As Irene Samuel puts it, “however much [the dream] was18
            induced by Satan, it wasproduced by Eve’s own mind.”

Abstract: For Scarry, metaphorical descriptions demonstrate a fundamental problem in the expression of pain. She identifies two particular types of metaphors that those in pain often use: one that specifies an “external agent” of the pain, as in “It feels like a hammer coming down on my spine”; and a second that specifies “bodily damage,” as in “It feels as if my arm is broken … and [the bone is] sticking through the skin.” Both types of metaphors are made visible in the works in
      The Pain Exhibit. The trouble with these images—of “weapon” and “wound”—is that they are not identical with pain but rather are used “associatively” to describe characteristics of an otherwise nonreferential experience. Such language is inherently unstable and “permits a break in the identification of the referent and thus a misidentification of the thing to which the attribute belongs.”
            In other words, if we move the agency of pain outside the body through an image like Robinson’s screwdriver, or locate pain in a wound that does not actually exist like the razor blade lacerations on Collen’s plaster foot, we risk separating the experience from the body who suffers through it. In the context of Scarry’s work—modern torture and warfare—this abstraction of pain from the real bodies involved can impede empathetic and humanitarian response to such atrocities.7<br>

Abstract: Leading American sociologist Robert Gutman conceptualized the term "comprehensive architectural services" as opposed to services that emphasize the artistic aspect of architecture. Comprehensive services privilege the architect's role as the owner's agent and include coordination of consultants and construction administration. See Robert Gutman,
               Architectural Practice: A Critical View(New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 1988), 37. Gutman argued that the AIA made a decisive move toward advocating such services around 1900. For professionalization of architecture, see Mary Woods,From Craft to Profession.<br>

Author(s): Zollschan David<br>
Abstract: The use of theories of Sanskrit syntax by Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta to explain the action of monistic Śaiva myth and ritual is examined. These thinkers develop a distinctive approach to syntax that reductionistically emphasizes the role of the true Self/Śiva as omnipotent agent, in opposition to the denigration of agency by the majority of Hindu as well as Buddhist philosophies. An analogy to the Indian discussions is seen in the typological effort of Kenneth Burke's "Grammar of Motives," and it is suggested that indigenous theories of action syntax would be a useful focus for comparative research.<br>

Publisher: University of Notre Dame<br>
Issue: i261382<br>
Date: 10 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Pangle Fred<br>
Abstract: Recent literature on Heidegger concentrates heavily on his (temporary) involvement in or collusion with Nazi ideology and policies. Without belittling the gravity of the issue, this article shifts the focus somewhat by invoking a distinction which recently has emerged (or reemerged) in political thought: namely, the distinction between "politics" and "the political" or between politics viewed as partisan ideology or policy making, on the one hand, and politics seen as regime or paradigmatic framework, on the other. The main thesis of the article is that Heidegger's promising contributions to political theory are located on the level of ontology or paradigmatic framework rather than that of ideological partisanship. While not neglecting the dismal intrusions of the latter plane, the article probes Heideggerian cues for a "rethinking of the political" by placing the accent on four topical areas: first, the status of the subject or individual as political agent; second, the character of the political community, that is, of the polity or (in modern terms) the "state"; thirdly, the issue of cultural and political development or modernization; and finally, the problem of an emerging cosmopolis or world order beyond the confines of Western culture. In discussing these topics, an effort is made to disentangle Heidegger from possible misinterpretations and to indicate how, in each area, his thought pointed in the direction of an "overcoming" of Western political metaphysics.<br>

Author(s): Rauschenbusch Walter<br>
Abstract: Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis, viewed by many as the masterpiece of the social gospel movement, has been confined to the dusty shelves of the library. Can we catch no glimpse of what astounded its massive reading public, no glimmer of Rauschenbusch's own sense of the work as a "dangerous book" written in fear and trembling? This article suggests that a generic analysis of Christianity and the Social Crisis might lead to surprising disclosures. Any generic analysis involves the discussion of a group of texts. Consequently this study proceeds via a comparison of the structure of Christianity and the Social Crisis with those of other works of a similar type which were produced between 1890 and 1915. The genre is isolated by utilizing the techniques of Tzvetan Todorov. Certain negative traits are specified which separate the genre from its neighbors. The positive leitmotif of a dual crisis-a crisis affecting society as a whole and the ramifications of that crisis within the Christian churches-is specified as the decisive trait of the genre. To deal with this leitmotif a specific structure was generated by the works under consideration. They provided-to pirate the words of Clifford Geertz in his landmark essay on modern ideologies-"maps of problematic reality" and "matrices for the creation of collective conscience." In designing their maps of problematic reality our authors worked along two separate but related vectors. The first of these vectors was constituted by a historical analysis of the origins of the present crisis, while the second consisted of a systemic analysis of the present social order. Each of these elements of the genre is examined in turn. The mapping of problematic reality by means of a historical and a structural analysis was geared towards provoking as well as defining the crisis. Crisis, once defined, demanded decision. Nevertheless the "permanent basis for action" which Rauschenbusch and others sought could not be groun~<br>

Abstract: Il Calendrier des Bergers è erroneamente preso a modello dei calendan popolari del XVII e
XVIII secolo - nei confronti dei quali si trova invece in un'opposizione del genere sacro /profano -
per la mancata considerazione della sua parentela con i libri d'ore in G. Bolleme, Les almanacks
populaires aux XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles. Essai d'histoire sociale, Paris-Le Haye, Mouton, 1969.
L'origine dell'errore risale all'accostamento, per quanto implicito, fatto tra Calendrier des bergers
e almanacchi da R. Mandrou, De la culture populaire aux XVIIe et XVIII siècles. La Bibliothèque
bleue de Troyes, Paris, Stock, 1964. Per il Calendrier historial cfr. E. Droz, Chemins de l'hérésie.

Author(s): Ross Susan A.<br>
Abstract: IN THIS ESSAY I CONSIDER POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF FEMINIST THEOLogy to theological aesthetics and ethics by comparing the work of Hans Urs von Balthasar (1905—88), the predominant figure in theological aesthetics, with that of Elizabeth Johnson and Sallie McFague. Balthasar's emphasis on contemplation and obedience in response to the unexpected revelation of God's glory contrasts with the practicality, mutuality, and creativity of feminist theological ethics. On the other hand, feminist theology's emphasis on appropriate language and images for God suggests an implicit aesthetics. The artistic work of contemporary African women in crisis situations sheds further light on both Balthasar and feminist theology and brings into relief the relationship of beauty and justice. Although Balthasar's emphasis on the transcendent glory of God may leave him with an undeveloped ethics, feminist theology's agent-oriented approach could benefit from greater attention to contemplation and a transformed understanding of obedience. These conclusions urge greater appreciation and development of the aesthetic and imaginative dimensions of feminist theological ethics.<br>

Abstract: En développant la doctrine catholique sur l'identité sacerdotale de chaque chrétien Vatican II explique non seulement la différence essentielle mais aussi l'interrelation essentielle entre les deux modes, commun et ministériel, de participation au sacerdoce unique du Christ. Tout en reconnaissant la différence essentielle entre ces deux modes du sacerdoce chrétien, l'article s'attache à montrer comment ils sont «ordonnés l'un à l'autre» (LG, 10). Cette interrelation est accentuée à plusieurs fins: pour parer à une accentuation exagérée d'un ou de l'autre mode; pour éclairer la nature et fonction irréductible des deux modes à la lumière de leur mission et fin concertée; et pour offrir à la critique moderne une présentation crédible de l'unité dans la diversité du ministère chrétien. On éclaire la relation mutuelle entre sacerdotium commune et sacerdotium ministeriale en distinguant quatre voies d'accès complémentaires de la doctrine qui dans les textes conciliaires se trouvent entremêlées: l'ontologique, l'existentielle, la pratique et sociale, et l'eschatologique. De telle sorte, tel le corps et le noyau d'une cellule vivante organiquement unis tout en étant ontiquement divers, chrétiens baptisés et ordonnés apparaissent dans leur relation mutuelle en tant que (1) participants à l'être du Christ prêtre et médiateur, (2) témoins de la communion dans l'amour du Christ prêtre et frère, (3) promoteurs de la justice du Christ prêtre et libérateur, et (4) initiateurs du royaume du Christ prêtre et messie. Dans l'examen de chaque voie d'approche, le mode commun du sacerdoce est envisagé comme représentant la présence immanente du Christ en tous ses membres, tandis que le mode ministèriel est considéré comme représentant le Christ en tant que tête transcendante de son corps ecclésial. Ainsi donc, les deux formes du ministère chrétien offrent au monde un signe à la fois différencié et concerté de l'être et de l'action sacerdotale du Christ comme médiateur et frère, comme lib~<br>

Abstract: Une fine analyse de la convergence des conceptions du Christ qu'a Origène et de l'Ecriture, met en scène non seulement la consistance interne et le fondement théorique de son exégèse christologique, mais nous présente également le récit que fait Origène de l'histoire du sens chrétien. Selon ce récit, le sens a premièrement une structure trinitaire: le Dieu unique en trois personnes, incorporel, est la source, le fondement et l'épanouissement de l'intelligibilité et de l'existence intellectuelle. Il a deuxièmement une structure christologique: le Fils est le sens ultime, en tant qu'à la fois, contenu objectif ou structure de sens (comme la Sagesse) et agent principal dans le processus subjectif de l'appropriation et de la communication du sens (comme la Parole). Cette simultanéité determine la conception qu'a Origène de la convergence du Christ et de l'Ecriture. Ainsi, le Logos est à la fois la source et le contenu du sens scripturaire, de même que le communicateur principal ou "exégète" de ce sens, cette dernière fonction étant remplie de la manière la plus remarquable dans l'Incarnation, qui est l'indice herméneutique central de l'Ecriture. De manière pratique, cela veut dire que le sens ultime, qui coïncide avec le sens "spirituel" de l'Ecriture est contenu objectivement dans la référence au Christ et subjectivement atteint en ayant "la pensée du Christ"; son accomplissement réside dans la rencontre du lecteur ou exégète avec le Christ.<br>

Author(s): Vaughan Barry<br>
Abstract: Recent desistance research has emphasized the importance of shifts in offenders' identities to explain cessation from crime. Explanatory weight is given to how the agent reflects and acts upon relevant social circumstances rather than seeing desistance as the product of greater control exerted by the obligations of new roles. This kind of self-reflexivity is achieved through an internal moral conversation that is often couched in terms of agents' ultimate concerns and their relationship with others. In so doing, desisters fashion a narrative identity, which acknowledges yet disclaims past actions and commits them to an ideal future self.<br>

Abstract: This paper argues that the role of teacher, in the process of curriculum development, is conceptually dependent on the different curriculum approaches. It has been analysed and discussed the instrumental role (user and implementor) which it has from a technical-scientific approach, the curriculum development agent's role from an interpretative-cultural view, and the role of the institucional development from a critical approach. The potentialities and insufficiencies of a curriculum practical view and the teacher's role have been analysed. We suggest the School Institutional Development as one of the most promising ways for curriculum development.<br>

Abstract: The curriculum for biblical studies in the Israeli public high school system is designated by the official program of the ministry of education to be taught along essentially critical lines based on historical-philological research tools. The aim of this article is to expound on the cultural consequences and hermeneutical problems which are a direct product of this prescription, with emphasis on three major points: first, the fact that the official program of studies has completely disregarded contemporary hermeneutical approaches; second, the import of this hermeneutic deficiency given a literal reading of the biblical text which is meager in descriptive details but is hermeneutically saturated; third, the cultural status of the Bible class as sole agent of socialization pertaining to Jewish knowledge in Israeli public high-schools.<br>

Abstract: Badiou évoque pourtant (p. 23) les réflexions sur le pardon de Jankélévitch (dans l'Im-
prescriptible, Paris, Le Seuil, coll. « Points-Essais », 1996) et de Derrida (Foi et Savoir, suivi de
le Siècle et le pardon, Paris, Le Seuil, coll. « Points-Essais », 2001). Il n'est pas possible de
mener la discussion sur la « nature » du pardon à partir des auteurs impliqués. A mon avis,
Badiou sollicite fortement Derrida pour l'interprétation antiricœurienne qu'il fait. À titre per-
sonnel, j'estime la position de Derrida assez rhétorique : elle rend au fond le pardon impossible,
ce qui ne saurait déplaire à Badiou. Mais on se demande pourquoi ce dernier s'immisce dans
cette discussion, puisque, semble-t-il, le mal relève chez lui de la nécessité spinoziste et rend
donc vain le débat. Quant à décider que la séparation de l'agent et de l'acte est forcément chré-
tienne, cela reste à prouver.<br>

passage, note que cette « modalité ontologique de l'humainement possible
excède ainsi la non-nécessité, à laquelle êtres et phénomènes naturels satisfont
tout autant. Elle désigne ce qui pourrait advenir comme ne pas advenir, cela
parce que sa réalisation est suspendue à l'intervention d'un agent. Dans cette
circonscription de l'objet d'action, l'essentiel tient donc dans le έφ' ήμίν, "ce
qui dépend de nous", plutôt que dans le ένδεχόμενον άλλως εχειν qui
suffirait pour signifier la contingence. »<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>

Author(s): KNIGHT DEBORAH<br>
Abstract: Intentional, 'commonsense,' or 'folk' psychology is, as Jerry Fodor has remarked, ubiquitous. Explanations of what we say and do in terms of our reasons for acting are the stock in trade of intentional psychology. But there is a question whether explanations in terms of reasons are properly explanatory. Donald Davidson and Daniel Dennett, to name two, have defended intentional psychology and its reason-explanations. Still, many philosophers — including Fodor, Davidson and Dennett — fail to pay due attention to the narrative basis of such agent-centered accounts of action. In this paper, I argue that psychological explanation is an agent-centered, narrative-based interpretive practice. To make my case, I present a poetics of psychological explanation: seven elements which collectively describe what makes psychological explanations work. Narrative form allows us to represent the temporal arc of agents' actions — as well as the temporal arc of their reasoning about their actions, both prospective and retrospective. It allows us to negotiate between the canonical and the exceptional in human experience, and thus to account for actions that strike us as puzzling or unusual — whether the puzzle originates in our suboptimal understanding or the agent's suboptimal reasoning. And it allows us to juxtapose different perspectives on any action. Such juxtapositioning gives us a mechanism for coming to see how an action that strikes us as misguided might have been construed by the agent as reasonable given her understanding of her circumstances. After establishing the seven elements of the poetics, I address the objection that narrative-based accounts of intentional action are not properly explanatory.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i25619787<br>
Date: 8 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Cody Francis<br>
Abstract: This essay examines how activists in rural southern India have sought to reshape the field of political communication by encouraging lower-caste women to submit written, signed petitions to district-level government offices, and so represent themselves to the state. I argue that contradictions between democratic recognition and the will to development that inhere to the political structure of contemporary governance in rural India correspond to tensions within the semiotic structure of signature itself, between constative representation and performative creation. Governmentality and the forms of communication that it requires often rest on the notion that written self-representation constitutes an act of political agency. But the limits of a governmental communicative reason that would conflate written subject and agent become especially clear in postcolonial contexts where the construction of those citizens that would be represented is in fact a product of the very act of representation. It is the narrative of development-as-pedagogy that holds out the promise of a future alignment of communicative frameworks, technologies, and participant roles, allowing for the transparent self-representation of an already-constituted citizen. By tracking the ambivalent experience of one group of women in particular, this account focuses on how the logic of signature as self-representation has served to recontextualize the marginality of petitioners as something within the state's broader field of power.<br>

Abstract: This theme issue's call for papers notes that "several prevalent and influential historical practices of the last thirty years have limited agency's significance,.. seeing the human as the patient of History rather than its agent." The questions implicit in this statement are nowhere more urgent than in those practices collectively known as the "linguistic turn." Yet such questions have been explored sparsely enough in relation to this movement that some adherents can still insist that the ideas they favor do not devalue agency, while many simply ignore the issue and incorporate agency as an integral part of their work. By examining a largely unremarked episode in Michel Foucault's highly influential thought and considering its connections to foundational assumptions of the linguistic turn, we seek to demonstrate in detail why the premises that underlie both structuralism and poststructuralism (the theoretical movements most deeply implicated in the direction the linguistic turn has taken in history) logically require the denial of agency as a causal force and ultimately compel the conclusion that no change can occur in realities as interpreted by humans. We illustrate the intractability of these logical problems by analyzing unsatisfactory defenses from some of the few linguistic-turn historians who have discussed relevant issues, after which we conclude by suggesting that attention to current work in linguistics and cognitive science may help resolve such difficulties.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo explora el impacto de la globalización en la memoria, centrándose en el ordenador considerado como agente (y símbolo) de la primera y como instrumento de la segunda. Pero el ordenador también puede considerarse un eslabón de una larga cadena histórica que empezó con la invención de la escritura: ésta es la razón (defiende el artículo) por la que las reflexiones de Platón y Aristóteles sobre escritura y oralidad, memoria y recuerdo, todavía tienen relevancia para nosotros. El artículo trata principalmente de las implicaciones cognitivas de memoria y recuerdo, pero en la última sección aborda brevemente las implicaciones morales y políticas de ambas, refiriéndose al libro reciente de Paul Ricœur, La memoria, la historia, el olvido, así como a las comisiones establecidas en distintas partes del mundo para investigar las violaciones de los derechos humanos del pasado reciente y no tan reciente. /// The paper explores the impact of globalization on memory focusing on the computer, considered as an agent (and a symbol) of the former, and as an instrument of the latter. But the computer can be also seen as a link in a long historical chain which began with the invention of writing: this is why (the paper argues) Plato's and Aristotle's reflections on writing and orality,memory and recollection, are still relevant to us. The paper deals primarily with the cognitive implications of memory and recollection, but the last section addresses briefly the moral and political implications of both, referring to Paul Ricœur's recent book La mémoire, l'histoire, l'oubli, as well as to the commissions set up in various parts of the world to investigate human rights violations of the recent and the not so recent past.<br>

Author(s): Speight Allen<br>
Abstract: This article explores Arendt's approach to narrative in theory as well as practice. The first part looks at Arendt's use of philosophical sources from the tradition—Aristotle, Augustine and Hegel—with an eye to how her appropriation of these figures differs from that of contemporary philosophers of narrative. Three of Arendt's typically bold and rich claims about narrative action emerge as important: the notion of action as revealing an agent's own daimõn; the condition that such action be revealable within a world or shared public space which has resilience yet vulnerability; and the potential for agents revealed within such a world to discover some form of narrative rebirth in their efforts at story-telling. The second section examines the extent to which Arendt herself allowed those claims to be tested and thought through in her own attempts (in Men in Dark Times, Rahel Varnhagen and elsewhere) at constructing biographical narratives<br>

Abstract: An account of character is developed on the basis of Ricoeur's philosophy of the will. Particular attention is paid to the role of the bodily involuntary in the process of character-formation. This augments the interpretation of the moral meaning of sanctification developed by Hauerwas. When interpreted in light of corporeality, sanctification entails not only a perceptual transformation but also an affective change in the agent's value orientation, the competent retraining of the agent's emotions, and the gracious triggering of an adoptive disposition toward the agent's incarnate situation. Finally, the rootedness of character in embodiment, with the attendant problem of automatism, indicates the limits of the usefulness of an "ethics of character" for moral theology.<br>

Abstract: One way into the question of the relation of ethics and liturgy is to focus on a critical issue facing liturgy today: its impoverishment and inability to nurture Christian faith and life. Three aspects of this problem are: injustice within the worshipping community, disagreement regarding forms of Christian service to the world, and the breakdown of symbols. Ethics must move beyond the articulation of formal principles and assertions regarding the importance of liturgy for the moral agent if it is to fulfill its task vis-à-vis these problems.<br>

Abstract: This article aims to explore aspects of the construction by scientific practice of historical-cultural differences. It aims as well to suggest ways to approach ethnic phenomena considering the need to place them historically, and to focus the cultural and political dimensions in new terms; in the challenge that ethnicity represents to today's world. The confrontation with humanity as 'the others' that is talked about, is partial. It is not with all 'humanity' but only with a part of it—substantial indeed—, a 'humanity' with specifities placed in a world divided in ethnocentric and unequal modes. This is the world that Geertz embraces what is 'not properly ours.' We can ask ourselves what is exactly 'properly ours' for those who say it. I add some obvious but forgotten dimensions: the place of the observer, the characteristics of the society where the perceptions and construction of otherness originate and are reproduced. Nowadays the idea of the importance of the 'racial factor', is newly again reinforced. Like in the United States and now in Europe. These differences, more than having a physical or cultural referent, have to do with the dimension of power and with social differences. Ethnicity has never been translated in only one discourse. Therefore, ethnicity should be seen as a process whose meanings can only be understood in context, evolving in the course of history in the specific social circumstances of a given people. Even more, the development of ethnic and class processes in the same social formation adds to the complexity of ethnic processual nature. The articulation of these two processes—ethnicity and class— and their contradictions can only be aprehended by observing the historical dimension in which these take place. By underlining the temporal depth of social processes, the 'ethnographic present' is displaced from this centre of analysis to be come 'a moment' in this processual flow. From this perspective ethnic phenomena are not anymore mere 'acci~<br>

Abstract: Très rares sont les verbes français qui présentent exclusivement un emploi transitif (ex. dévisager) ou intransitif (ex. cabrioler). La plupart sont fondamentalement transitifs (ex. manger) ou intransitifs (ex. penser avec oblique) ou à renversement (ex. chauffer). La perte ou la dégradation, le gain ou la promotion de l'agent et/ou du patient sont des ‹techniques› de la dimension universelle de la Participation dans la conception de H. Seiler (cf. Drossard 1991) et sont vus comme des processus dynamiques affectant les configurations actancielles dans Larjavaara (2000) et Krötsch & Oesterreicher (2002), deux analyses décisives des réarrangements actanciels en français. L'article confronte les types de réarrangements rassemblés par ces auteurs et examine les facteurs propres à favoriser l'emploi absolu de manger (‹décentralisation›) et inversement l'emploi transitif de penser (‹centralisation›).<br>

Abstract: This article looks at the characteristics of "frictions over history" in ROK-Japan relations since the 1990s, with a focus on Korea's responses. It addresses some hypotheses on the characteristics and trends shown in the political process of "blundering" through comparative analysis of sixty-one cases, and additionally presents an in-depth case study on Prime Minister Abe Shinzo's remarks of 2007 concerning the comfort women issue. This research shows that the responses to blunders and the political process were the products of interactions between the agent's speech acts and are a type of language game that is linguistically inter-constituted. Moreover, the 2007 comfort women case study shows that conflicts and the process of negotiations regarding blunders are a type of constructive language game in which the agents construct rules of engagement, modify mutual perceptions, and transform actors themselves through a series of speech acts.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines reasoning and rhetoric about economic recession in selected newspapers. This is an interesting topic for discourse analysis because it is a site of argumentation. We begin by asking: (1) epistemological questions (e.g. What evidential basis is drawn on in rhetoric about recession?) and then (2) ontological questions (e.g. How is recession pictured? and How is recession coordinated with the social world?). We examine the management of evidence and definitions concerning whether or not there is a recession. We then examine the entities invoked, showing how (a) a range of metaphors depict the recession as either an uncontrollable agent or as a controllable thing; and (b) rhetorical strategies used by both critics and supporters of the government collude in picturing the economy as a realm abstracted from social life.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113399<br>
Date: 4 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Haney David P.<br>
Abstract: In the apostrophe to "Imagination" in The Prelude, Book 6, a multileveled usurpation occurs which challenges the rhetorical foundation of Wordsworth's poem. The force of will exhibited in this passage is a paradoxical combination of actively exerted power and effortlessness, forced interruption and passively suffered usurpation, in which both the agent and the object of usurpation are put into question. The essential trope in this gesture is the anomalous figure of catachresis, whose uneasy place in eighteenth-century rhetorical classifications resulted from its combination of absolute propriety and absolute impropriety. For Wordsworth, this trope reveals the paradoxical connection between the powerful ground of the imagination's proper being and the abyss of loss and impropriety which threatens the imaginative will.<br>

Abstract: Les "institutions", comme ensemble préexistant et objectivable de ressources de justification, forment le milieu où puisent les agents économiques, pour gérer leurs problèmes de coordination et/ou leurs conflits de reproduction. Les "conventions" sont des représentations collectives de "monde commun justifié", qui activent les institutions, et légitiment les arrangements locaux, au sein des "organisations", dont la production conjointe de marchandises et de règles va reconstituer ou dégrader le milieu institutionnel de départ. Ce modèle conventionnaliste à trois termes cherche à surmonter les difficultés des autres analyses économiques des institutions. Il pose un agent économique rompu aux défauts de coordination et de reproduction, et impensable hors d'un milieu institutionnel composé au minimum du langage, de la monnaie, et du droit. La pluralité des logiques de justification fonde la diversité empirique des institutions. La dynamique des institutions est étudiée à travers les opérateurs qui font et défont les possibilités de "monde commun" à partir de la "pluralité" : la "concurrence" dans l'espace des prix doit être combinée avec la "critique" dans l'espace des valeurs (normes). L'analyse conventionnaliste du capitalisme remet le projet de Marx à l'endroit en déduisant la théorie de l'exploitation d'une théorie de la justice, plutôt que l'inverse. "Institutions", as a set of pre-existing and objective resources of justification, is the milieu where economic agents can find materials to solve their coordination problems and/or their conflicts of reproduction. "Conventions" are collective representations of "justified common worlds" that activate institutions and legitimise arrangements within "organisations", whose joint production of goods and rules will lead to the renewal -or the degeneracy- of prior institutional milieu. This "three terms conventionalist model" endeavors to face the difficulties encountered by the other economic approaches of institutions. I~<br>

Abstract: Lorsqu'il expose son éthique minimale, Ruwen Ogien se démarque explicitement de toute théorie de l'agent, et particulièrement de l'authenticité. Dans cet article, j'examine une des théories de l'authenticité, celle de Sartre. Je décris ensuite ma compréhension de l'éthique d'Ogien. Je conclus que, loin de s'opposer, ces deux théories présentent des points de contact, notamment l'importance de reconnaître la dimension personnelle de la responsabilité. Ruwen Ogien keeps his minimalist ethics explicitly aloof from any theory of the agent, in particular from authenticity. In this paper, I examine one of the theories of authenticity, namely that of Jean-Paul Sartre. I then describe my understanding of Ogien's ethics. I conclude that, far from being opposite, both theories meet, especially on the importance of recognizing the personal extension of responsibility.<br>

Abstract: For some time, the devouring jaws of these new barbarians have been chewing up and “ruining” a cultural heritage that is ever more planetary.
            —Haroldo De Campos
         
            
         Le plagiat est nécessaire. Le progrès l'implique. (Plagiarism is necessary. Progress implies as much.)
            —Comte De Lautréamont (pseudonym of Isidore-Lucien Ducasse)
         
            “To write, today, in both Europe and Latin America will mean, more and more, to rewrite, to rechew,” declares Haroldo De Campos in his essay “Anthropophagous Reason: Dialogue and Difference in Brazilian Culture.”Oscar Wilde: I wish I had said that.
            James McNeill Whistler: You will, Oscar, you will.
         
            In calling for a literature that devours other literatures rather than imitating them, he is riffing on a founding document of Latin American letters, the 1928 “Cannibalist Manifesto” (“Manifesto Antropófago”). In the manifesto, Brazilian modernist Oswald De Andrade writes, “I am only concerned with what is not mine. Law of Man. Law of the cannibal”1
         
            (“Só me interessa o que nao é meu. Lei do homem. Lei do antropófago”).2
         
            The poetics of cannibalism have pointed politico-aesthetic implications: ingesting and devouring describe the ludic recombination of preexisting cultural elements—or what might be called, more neutrally, innovation through engagement with tradition. At the same time, it constitutes an aggressive program for the construction of a national poetics that draws at will from the world's cultural heritage. De Campos and De Andrade specifically imagine this literary combinatorics, or recycling, as mediated through the body of the writer. Even as the traditionally denigrated figure of the cannibal or New World barbarian—an ignoble savage—has been energetically reclaimed by Latin American artists and intellectuals, the activity of cultural re-mastication empowers the colonial or subaltern cultu~<br>

Abstract: It is also correct that Aristotle did not envisage tragedy as a mere strategy designed to engender fear and trembling just for the sake of horror. Indeed, he explicitly condemns such ploys. Rather he is interested in realistic actions that might have unpleasant consequences for the agent, on the one hand, or pleasant outcomes that we can admire, on the other. Thus he rejects the intervention of gods in the actions of humans. It is in this regard that Aristotle argues that every well-told story has something to teach, and it does so by revealing universal aspects of the human condition in individual agents. In this respect, poetry is more philosophical than history.<br>

Abstract: Like Levinas and Derrida, Kierkegaard gives us a phenomenology of inverted intentionality.
            
                  While objects may be given to us through my gaze or our language games, subjects are given to us as we are seen and (especially) as we are addressed by them. Thus, in Genesis and in25
               Fear and Trembling, Abraham and God have a covenantal relation. It is grounded in a series of promises and commands that God issues to Abraham. This God is thus a personal God, an agent capable of keeping those promises, and a speaking God, capable of such speech acts as making promises and giving commands. Unlike Levinas's God, Abraham's might well be called his Constant Interlocutor. Accordingly, Abraham's faith (the central theme ofFear and Trembling) consists not primarily in a doxastic attitude toward various propositions (belief that …) but in the combination of trust in God's promises and obedience to God's commands.

Abstract: According to Ricoeur, this activity of appropriation occurs in a phenomenological, prepublic realm. To link this realm with the public world, I turn briefly to the vocabulary of constitutive rhetoric. In “Constitutive Rhetoric: The Case of the
         Peuple Québécois,” Maurice Charland explains how certain public texts, in addressing individuals as a group before that group actually exists in the extratextual world, can constitute a collective based on identity and oriented toward action. Charland uses the work of Kenneth Burke in order to shift the focus of rhetorical scholars away from “persuasion” and toward “identification” (1987, 133). Charland argues that public texts constitute subjects that didn't previously exist. In this sense, such texts do notpersuadealready existing individuals; they invite individuals to think of themselves in a manner thatentailscertain actions (1987, 134). This conceptualization extends Ricoeur's insights about appropriation and refiguration into the public world of action. Within this formulation, readers or listeners not only imagine themselves in new ways.
               They14
            actas the world of the text invites them to do and in so doing close the gap between mimesis3and mimesis1, between reading and acting. This is the space that needs to be crossed in order to give the straight line between mimesis1and mimesis3its arc and so enable it to form a spiral. A child reading Patterson's book, for instance, might simply dismiss it as a stuffy story about a famous person long dead. Or, the reader may actively engage the narrator's subtle closing exhortation to “make Dr. King's dream his own” (96). Because of “Dr. King's dream,” the reader may speak up when she hears someone employ racial slurs or stereotypes or intervene when a classmate is unjustly punished or bullied. The reader thus acts her way into Dr. King's proposed world and becomes the kind of agent whose actions may in turn inspire others. Her actions may be so ~<br>

Abstract: In an 1896 review, for instance, he explicitly parallels doctors and actors in their professional practice, beginning by characterizing the former in his usual terms: “The average doctor is a walking compound of natural ignorance and acquired witchcraft, who kills your favorite child, wrecks your wife's health, and orders you into habits of nervous dram-drinking before you have the courage to send him about his business.”
      
            After similarly chastising attorneys, boot makers, and tailors, Shaw asserts that, while we “imagine that these people have professions,” we discover that “what they have is only, in the correct old word, their ‘mystery’—a humbug, like all mysteries. And yet, how we help to keep up the humbug! … Men believe in the professions as they believe in ghosts, because they want to believe in them” (423–24, 425). For Shaw, human beings had redirected their desire for faith in idols and priests toward doctors and marketing men. The commercial theater had also fed upon this need, and even the critic himself is susceptible to their hypnotic prowess. Calling himself the “most ridiculous of all dupes,” Shaw confesses in the review his mistaking of the actor as a skilled craftsman, a “civilizing agent [and] spiritual doctor,” when in fact “it is all a delusion: there is no profession, no art, no skill about the business at all” (425). Just as those who are exploited by the medical industry, Shaw's “desire and hope got the better of [his] observation[, his] imagination of [his] experience” (428). The fraud perpetuated by doctors is akin to the “mystery” of theater; if doctors are ghosts, actors and managers are similar spirits who have offended. For Shaw, then, the critic's job is to “sift the gold of fact and efficiency out of the huge rubbish-heap of professionalism” (425).6<br>

Abstract: Faith does much more than simply indicate the presence of hope. It also endows hope with its motivational import and incipient efficacy. Without faith, hope is like a rocket without a launching pad, or a car without an engine: all potential and no actualization. Faith is the propulsive force behind a vital as opposed to a vacuous or attenuated hope. It gives hope its impetus, its directionality, its capacity to make an impact in the world. Without faith, hope devolves into halfhearted effort, lethargy, or empty wistfulness. Hope can be a potent agent of change, but only if it is driven by faith—only if faith spurs it to action in the service of an anticipated future good. Yes, faith can move mountains, but only because it fires and, through thick and thin, stokes the hope that does the heavy lifting. Nonetheless, we must always take care to hitch our wagons to the right star so that we inoculate ourselves against the harmful pathologies that stem from unexamined commitment: escapist wishful thinking in the case of utopian hope, and misplaced reliance on the fanciful in the case of ideological faith. The path to ruin, as Shaw and Ricoeur knew well, is littered with grand intentions, false prophets, and inhumane creeds. Lest we do great damage to self, others, and the planet, what we hope for, and what we trust in, must have some rational relation to reality.

Abstract: For George Campbell, also an eighteenth-century rhetorician and Protestant clergyman from Scotland, preaching is defined as “the reformation of mankind.” What could be more utopian than that? “Reformation of life and manners—of all tasks ever attempted by persuasion, that which has the most frequently baffled its power.”
         
               For Campbell, the Christian preacher is closest to being Cicero's ideal orator, and he is closest to being a divine agent in bringing about a utopian society with revealed Truth as its underlying pattern of organization.14<br>
