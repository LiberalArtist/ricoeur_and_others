  The Forged Dublin Castle Document 1916 from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt18kcvc1">Enigmas of Sacrifice</a><br>
  Abstract: The third part of the critique is even less concerned with chronology than its predecessors, though these investigated certain sequences of events, personal or public. The brevity of Plunkett’s public career—an almost Christlike three years—argues against too much reliance on any stage-by-stage analysis of cause and effect. In contrast, this chapter presents a number of largely discrete investigations the order of which is neither random nor absolute. Each is intended to illuminate a facet of the sacrifice enigma as it intermittently discloses itself through Joseph Mary Plunkett, antipolitical insurgent and religious poet.<br>

  Author(s) MCARTHUR JO-ANNE<br>
  Abstract: Some 2400 years ago, people belonging to the Iron Age Pazyryk archaeological culture gathered together to lay their dead to rest in burial mounds in the remote Inner Asian Altai Mountains. At these funerals, they sacrificed elaborately costumed riding horses and carefully buried them alongside the deceased (figure 1). While typical burials of this age present only metal and bone for analysis, here the graves subsequently froze in permafrost, preserving wood, leather, fabric, and often the entire bodies of the humans and horses. These unusual burials thus provide an excellent opportunity for exploring the particular connections between these people and<br>

  Abstract: The last issue of this journal included our critique of Lincoln’s Cooper Union Address, and we assume that the neo-classical origins of the analysis were apparent, even though methodological concerns were slighted. A more elaborate statement on methodology appeared in an earlier version, but the editors cautioned that the single article did not offer sufficient scope for both an explication of the rationale and its application. Accepting their advice, we deleted most of the theoretical material, but having offered the critique, we want to explore further its theoretical bases.<br>

  Author(s) Alison James<br>
  Abstract: The subject of this essay is the role of fire and its explicit and implicit understandings in the Hindu and Buddhist traditions. At first glance, this appears to be a useful way of narrowing the scope of an essay that began with the impossible task of producing a mimetic analysis of Indian religions. But the scope thus narrowed is still much too broad to be manageable. As in Christianity, Islam, Zoroastrianism, and Judaism, the understanding of fire in the Hindu and Buddhist traditions is in equal measure heterogeneous, historically contingent, and (in some senses) foundational, which makes for a wide<br>

  Author(s) Ell Theodore<br>
  Abstract: Research work in the humanities in general, and in philosophy in particular, is today looked at with a certain degree of suspicion, for various, and sometimes even opposed, reasons. On one hand, work on subtle epistemological questions and/or historical analysis of the thought of past philosophers is regarded as a navel-gazing activity, otiose at best, wasteful at worst. On the other hand, when philosophy and intellectual analysis come to focus on popular culture phenomena, such as comics, movies, and TV programs, they are regarded as trivializing ideas and as committing themselves to marginal and eventually unimportant work.

  Abstract: The realist is right about one thing: Much of the time, international politics boils down to strategy. The calculation of advantage in the game of nations is the first condition, the final necessity, and—not to be underestimated—the continuing attraction for those who presume to be players. Therefore, it is not enough for post-realists to articulate a broader conception of scientific inquiry; if we are to move beyond realism, we shall have to provide decision makers with better instruments for strategic analysis. It may seem that these two objectives are mutually contradictory. For example, the post-realist perspective exemplifies the<br>

  Abstract: Two of the most important developments of the twentieth century have been the return of large numbers of Jews to Israel (and the creation of the state of Israel following that return), along with the rise of a Palestinian people. In this book, we illuminate these events through an analysis of the trajectories of Palestinian and Israeli symbol use over roughly the last century. Our thesis is that symbolic practices—speeches, essays, poetry, and other public communication—have played a crucial role in shaping each society and the conflict between them.<br>

  Abstract: When I finished graduate school in English in 1970, I had two schemes for writing about modern literature. The first was my dissertation, which was a structuralist analysis of modernism, based almost exclusively on my reading of Lévi-Strauss but alleviated providentially by encountering Edward Said, who was a visiting researcher in 1968 at the Center for Advanced Study at the University of Illinois. I depended heavily on Said’s 1967 delimiting review of

  Abstract: One of the first Westerners to recognize the actual achievement of traditional African art, Frobenius (1873–1938) spent many years in Africa, gathered and translated African oral traditions, and founded the Institute for Cultural Morphology in Frankfurt as a repository for (largely facsimiles of) prehistoric and African paintings and engravings. He was, in anthropological terms, a leading German diffusionist who advocated a complex, multifactorial approach to the analysis of cultural transmission, but in British and American anthropology, for example, his reputation is by now minimal.

  Book Title: i never knew what time it was-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): antin david<br>
  Abstract: In this series of intricately related texts, internationally known poet, critic, and performance artist David Antin explores the experience of time—how it's felt, remembered, and recounted. These free-form talk pieces—sometimes called talk poems or simply talks—began as improvisations at museums, universities, and poetry centers where Antin was invited to come and think out loud. Serious and playful, they move rapidly from keen analysis to powerful storytelling to passages of pure comedy, as they range kaleidoscopically across Antin's experiences: in the New York City of his childhood and youth, the Eastern Europe of family and friends, and the New York and Southern California of his art and literary career. The author's analysis and abrasive comedy have been described as a mix of Lenny Bruce and Ludwig Wittgenstein, his commitment to verbal invention and narrative as a fusion of Mark Twain and Gertrude Stein. Taken together, these pieces provide a rich oral history of and critical context for the evolution of the California art scene from the 1960s onward.<br>

  Book Title: The Cosmic Time of Empire-Modern Britain and World Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Barrows Adam<br>
  Abstract: Combining original historical research with literary analysis, Adam Barrows takes a provocative look at the creation of world standard time in 1884 and rethinks the significance of this remarkable moment in modernism for both the processes of imperialism and for modern literature. As representatives from twenty-four nations argued over adopting the Prime Meridian, and thereby measuring time in relation to Greenwich, England, writers began experimenting with new ways of representing human temporality. Barrows finds this experimentation in works as varied as Victorian adventure novels, high modernist texts, and South Asian novels—including the work of James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, H. Rider Haggard, Bram Stoker, Rudyard Kipling, and Joseph Conrad. Demonstrating the investment of modernist writing in the problems of geopolitics and in the public discourse of time, Barrows argues that it is possible, and productive, to rethink the politics of modernism through the politics of time.<br>

  Abstract: Analytic statements about music inevitably have a hermetic quality. Even the simplest descriptions, say the labeling of an interval or a chord, call on an assumed body of technical knowledge that, at least initially, does not seem to point beyond itself. Those who love music but lack the technical knowledge tend to find analytic descriptions alienating, irrelevant, or intimidating. Those who have the knowledge do not always feel compelled to use it, or to use all of it. Music in the world survives handily without any help from analysis.

Among Evangelical men in Caracas, religion does not begin with disinterest. It begins with dis-ease that is consciously and rationally addressed through religious practice. And this pragmatic quality does nothing to challenge its viability or its sincerity. The smiles and tears, courage and fear are all real. It would be a mistake to regard this as unique to Latin American Evangelicalism. I suspect any close review of empirical research on contemporary religious and cultural practices around<br>

  Book Title: Being There-The Fieldwork Encounter and the Making of Truth<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Hammoudi Abdellah<br>
  Abstract: Challenges to ethnographic authority and to the ethics of representation have led many contemporary anthropologists to abandon fieldwork in favor of strategies of theoretical puppeteering, textual analysis, and surrogate ethnography. In
      Being There,John Borneman and Abdellah Hammoudi argue that ethnographies based on these strategies elide important insights. To demonstrate the power and knowledge attained through the fieldwork experience, they have gathered essays by anthropologists working in Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tanzania, the Canadian Arctic, India, Germany, and Russia that shift attention back to the subtle dynamics of the ethnographic encounter. From an Inuit village to the foothills of Kilimanjaro, each account illustrates how, despite its challenges, fieldwork yields important insights outside the reach of textual analysis.<br>

  Book Title: Reconfiguring Modernity-Concepts of Nature in Japanese Political Ideology<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Thomas Julia Adeney<br>
  Abstract: Julia Adeney Thomas turns the concept of nature into a powerful analytical lens through which to view Japanese modernity, bringing the study of both Japanese history and political modernity to a new level of clarity. She shows that nature necessarily functions as a political concept and that changing ideas of nature's political authority were central during Japan's transformation from a semifeudal world to an industrializing colonial empire. In political documents from the nineteenth to the early twentieth century, nature was redefined, moving from the universal, spatial concept of the Tokugawa period, through temporal, social Darwinian ideas of inevitable progress and competitive struggle, to a celebration of Japan as a nation uniquely in harmony with nature. The so-called traditional "Japanese love of nature" masks modern state power. Thomas's theoretically sophisticated study rejects the supposition that modernity is the ideological antithesis of nature, overcoming the determinism of the physical environment through technology and liberating denatured subjects from the chains of biology and tradition. In making "nature" available as a critical term for political analysis, this book yields new insights into prewar Japan's failure to achieve liberal democracy, as well as an alternative means of understanding modernity and the position of non-Western nations within it.<br>

Since the psychic pain of separation and helplessness often accompanies physical pain, all the fundamental evils will necessarily enter into the discussion. Even though we have already covered quite a bit of the topic in the criticism of theodicy and in the attempt to identify various evils phenomenologically, we have not yet explored the implications of a feminist analysis. If suffering itself has no purpose and if we see separation and helplessness as states that increase suffering, what recommendations can we make about the social management of pain?<br>

  Book Title: Sin Boldly!-Justifying Faith for Fragile and Broken Souls<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): MARTY MARTIN E.<br>
  Abstract: Can faith as trusting God make a difference? Absolutely—by relieving our anxiety over self-justification and the need to scapegoat others. When we discover we don't justify ourselves because God has justified us, we become free. What Sin Boldly! points to is the presence of the crucified and living Christ in the human soul, placed there by the Holy Spirit. And this becomes transformative. Sin Boldly! provides an experiential analysis of the contrast between self-justification and justification by God. Those among us with fragile souls are anxious, and we shore up our anxiety with walls of self-justification that victimize those whom we scapegoat. Those among us with broken souls have lost the very moral universe that makes any kind of justification possible, and this usually leads to anomie and suicide. We must pose the question: how can the gospel of grace provide transformation for both fragile and broken souls? After an exposition of the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, this book proposes the following answer: trusting in the God of grace relieves anxiety and provides a divine vocation that transcends our moral universe with the promise of forgiveness, renewal, and resurrection.<br>

  Book Title: Ostension-Word Learning and the Embodied Mind<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Engelland Chad<br>
  Abstract: Ostension is bodily movement that manifests our engagement with things, whether we wish it to or not. Gestures, glances, facial expressions: all betray our interest in something. Ostension enables our first word learning, providing infants with a prelinguistic way to grasp the meaning of words. Ostension is philosophically puzzling; it cuts across domains seemingly unbridgeable -- public--private, inner--outer, mind--body. In this book, Chad Engelland offers a philosophical investigation of ostension and its role in word learning by infants. Engelland discusses ostension (distinguishing it from ostensive definition) in contemporary philosophy, examining accounts by Quine, Davidson, and Gadamer, and he explores relevant empirical findings in psychology, evolutionary anthropology, and neuroscience. He offers original studies of four representative historical thinkers whose work enriches the understanding of ostension: Wittgenstein, Merleau-Ponty, Augustine, and Aristotle. And, building on these philosophical and empirical foundations, Engelland offers a meticulous analysis of the philosophical issues raised by ostension. He examines the phenomenological problem of whether embodied intentions are manifest or inferred; the problem of what concept of mind allows ostensive cues to be intersubjectively available; the epistemological problem of how ostensive cues, notoriously ambiguous, can be correctly understood; and the metaphysical problem of the ultimate status of the key terms in his argument: animate movement, language, and mind. Finally, he argues for the centrality of manifestation in philosophy. Taking ostension seriously, he proposes, has far-reaching implications for thinking about language and the practice of philosophy.<br>

  Abstract: This is a book about how scholars make sense of what we study.¹ As a field of research whose primary focus is a fixed and finite set of data, biblical studies innovates less by discovering new objects of study than by finding fresh ways—or refining old ways—to examine its basic subject matter. Scholars investigate by designing categories of analysis and interpretation to achieve understanding. Regular assessment of the value of these categories—however recondite it may appear to a field’s outsiders—provokes scholarly self-consciousness and thereby strengthens the quality of research and advances knowledge.<br>

By contrast to the episteme, focused too narrowly on the utterances produced by a society, Foucault’s

  Book Title: The Phenomenology of Prayer-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): WIRZBA NORMAN<br>
  Abstract: This collection of ground-breaking essays considers the many dimensions of prayer: how prayer relates us to the divine; prayer's ability to reveal what is essential about our humanity; the power of prayer to transform human desire and action; and the relation of prayer to cognition. It takes up the meaning of prayer from within a uniquely phenomenological point of view, demonstrating that the phenomenology of prayer is as much about the character and boundaries of phenomenological analysis as it is about the heart of religious life.The contributors: Michael F.

  Abstract: Prayer, both private and public, is one of the most common of human activities. All human history records it; its roots probably go back to before recorded history. Yet when we attempt to submit its most common form, that of petition, to philosophical analysis, we run into difficulties. All too often we pray for things, such as victory or gaining a desired position, and forget that there are losers in such competitions. Prayer, here, seems caught in the “mimetic violence” that René Girard describes. According to Girard, our socialization involves our imitating others. It thus leads us to desire what<br>

  Book Title: Crediting God: Sovereignty and Religion in the Age of Global Capitalism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatter Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Tocqueville suggested that the people reign in the American political world like God over the universe.This intuition anticipates the crisis in the secularization paradigm that has brought theology back as a fundamental part of sociological and political analysis. It has become more difficult to believe that humanity's progress necessarily leads to atheism, or that it is possible to translate all that is good about religion into reasonable terms acceptable in principle by all, believers as well as nonbelievers. And yet, the spread of Enlightenment values, of an independent public sphere, and of alternative projects of modernitycontinues unabated and is by no means the antithesis of the renewed vigor of religious beliefs.The essays in this book shed interdisciplinary and multicultural light on a hypothesis that helps to account for such an unexpected convergence of enlightenment and religion in our times: Religion has reentered the public sphere because it puts into question the relation between God and the concept of political sovereignty.In the first part, Religion and Polity-Building,new perspectives are brought to bear on the tension-ridden connection between theophany and state-building from the perspective of world religions. Globalized, neo-liberal capitalism has been another crucial factor in loosening the bond between God and the state, as the essays in the second part, The End of the Saeculum and Global Capitalism,show.The essays in the third part, Questioning Sovereignty: Law and Justice,are dedicated to a critique of the premises of political theology, starting from the possibility of a prior, perhaps deeper relation between democracy and theocracy. The book concludes with three innovative essays dedicated to examining Tocqueville in order to think the Religion of Democracybeyond the idea of civil religion.<br>

  Book Title: Human Rights, Inc.: The World Novel, Narrative Form, and International Law-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SLAUGHTER JOSEPH R.<br>
  Abstract: In this timely study of the historical, ideological, and formal interdependencies of the novel and human rights, Joseph Slaughter demonstrates that the twentieth-century rise of world literatureand international human rights law are related phenomena. Slaughter argues that international law shares with the modern novel a particular conception of the human individual. The Bildungsroman, the novel of coming of age, fills out this image, offering a conceptual vocabulary, a humanist social vision, and a narrative grammar for what the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and early literary theorists both call the free and full development of the human personality. Revising our received understanding of the relationship between law and literature, Slaughter suggests that this narrative form has acted as a cultural surrogate for the weak executive authority of international law, naturalizing the assumptions and conditions that make human rights appear commonsensical. As a kind of novelistic correlative to human rights law, the Bildungsroman has thus been doing some of the sociocultural work of enforcement that the law cannot do for itself. This analysis of the cultural work of law and of the social work of literature challenges traditional Eurocentric histories of both international law and the dissemination of the novel. Taking his point of departure in Goethe's Wilhelm Meister, Slaughter focuses on recent postcolonial versions of the coming-of-age story to show how the promise of human rights becomes legible in narrative and how the novel and the law are complicit in contemporary projects of globalization: in colonialism, neoimperalism, humanitarianism, and the spread of multinational consumer capitalism.Slaughter raises important practical and ethical questions that we must confront in advocating for human rights and reading world literature-imperatives that, today more than ever, are intertwined.<br>

First, moral theory depends on arguments that do not persuade those outside the hermeneutic circle within which the arguments occur.

  Book Title: God's Mirror: Renewal and Engagement in French Catholic Intellectual Culture in the Mid-Twentieth Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Garfitt Toby<br>
  Abstract: Gathering in one place a cohesive selection of articles that deepen our sense of the vitality and controversy within the Catholic renewal of the mid-twentieth century, God's Mirror offers historical analysis of French Catholic intellectuals. This volume highlights the work of writers, thinkers and creative artists who have not always drawn the attention given to such luminaries as Maritain, Mounier, and Marcel. Organized around the typologies of renewal and engagement, editors Katherine Davies and Toby Garfitt provide a revisionist and interdisciplinary reading of the narrative of twentieth-century French Catholicism. Renewal and engagement are both manifestations of how the Catholic intellectual reflects and takes position on the relationship between the Church, personal faith and the world, and on the increasingly problematic relationship between intellectuals and the Magisterium. A majority of the writings are based on extensive research into published texts, with some occasional archival references, and they give critical insights into the tensions that characterized the theological and political concerns of their subjects.<br>

  Book Title: The Architecture of Concepts: The Historical Formation of Human Rights-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): de Bolla Peter<br>
  Abstract: The Architecture of Concepts proposes a radically new way of understanding the history of ideas. Taking as its example human rights, it develops a distinctive kind of conceptual analysis that enables us to see with precision how the concept of human rights was formed in the eighteenth century. The first chapter outlines an innovative account of concepts as cultural entities. The second develops an original methodology for recovering the historical formation of the concept of human rights based on data extracted from digital archives. This enables us to track the construction of conceptual architectures over time. Having established the architecture of the concept of human rights, the book then examines two key moments in its historical formation: the First Continental Congress in 1775 and the publication of Tom Paine's Rights of Man in 1792. Arguing that we have yet to fully understand or appreciate the consequences of the eighteenth-century invention of the concept "rights of man," the final chapter addresses our problematic contemporary attempts to leverage human rights as the most efficacious way of achieving universal equality<br>

  Book Title: Labors of Imagination: Aesthetics and Political Economy from Kant to Althusser-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mieszkowski Jan<br>
  Abstract: This book is a major new study of the doctrines of productivity and interest in Romanticism and classical political economy. The author argues that the widespread contemporary embrace of cultural historicism and the rejection of nineteenth-century conceptions of agency have hindered our study of aesthetics and politics. Focusing on the difficulty of coordinating paradigms of intellectual and material labor, Mieszkowski shows that the relationship between the imagination and practical reason is crucial to debates about language and ideology.From the Romantics to Poe and Kafka, writers who explore Kant's claim that poetry sets the imagination freediscover that the representational and performative powers of language cannot be explained as the products of a self-governing dynamic, whether formal or material. A discourse that neither reflects nor prescribes the values of its society, literature proves to be a uniquely autonomous praxis because it undermines our reliance on the concept of interest as the foundation of self-expression or self-determination. Far from compromising its political significance, this turns literature into the condition of possibility of freedom. For Smith, Bentham, and Marx, the limits of self-rule as a model of agency prompt a similar rethinking of the relationship between language and politics. Their conception of a linguistic labor that informs material praxis is incompatible with the liberal ideal of individualism. In the final analysis, their work invites us to think about social conflicts not as clashes between competing interests, but as a struggle to distinguish human from linguistic imperatives.<br>

Whether one thinks in terms of an unconscious, a superstructure, or a subtext, the analysis of intellectual and social phenomena begins from the assumption that things may not be what they seem, even where our most tangible intuitions and deeply held beliefs are concerned. From a methodological perspective, this has led to the emergence of what we might call “an archaeology of the presupposition.” An argument demonstrates its rigor by rendering its own aims and procedures as explicit and transparent as<br>

  Book Title: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan-Modernity, Loss, and the Doing of History<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Karlin Jason G.<br>
  Abstract: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan is a historical analysis of the discourses of nostalgia in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japan. Through an analysis of the experience of rapid social change in Japan’s modernization, it argues that fads (ryūkō) and the desires they express are central to understanding Japanese modernity, conceptions of gender, and discourses of nationalism. In doing so, the author uncovers the myth of eternal return that lurks below the surface of Japanese history as an expression of the desire to find meaning amid the chaos and alienation of modern times. The Meiji period (1868–1912) was one of rapid change that hastened the process of forgetting: The state’s aggressive program of modernization required the repression of history and memory. However, repression merely produced new forms of desire seeking a return to the past, with the result that competing or alternative conceptions of the nation haunted the history of modern Japan. Rooted in the belief that the nation was a natural and organic entity that predated the rational, modern state, such conceptions often were responses to modernity that envisioned the nation in opposition to the modern state. What these visions of the nation shared was the ironic desire to overcome the modern condition by seeking the timeless past. While the condition of their repression was often linked to the modernizing policies of the Meiji state, the means for imagining the nation in opposition to the state required the construction of new symbols that claimed the authority of history and appealed to a rearticulated tradition. Through the idiom of gender and nation, new reified representations of continuity, timelessness, and history were fashioned to compensate for the unmooring of inherited practices from the shared locales of everyday life. This book examines the intellectual, social, and cultural factors that contributed to the rapid spread of Western tastes and styles, along with the backlash again~<br>

  Book Title: The Reinvention of Religious Music: Olivier Messiaen's Breakthrough Toward the Beyond-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): van Maas Sander<br>
  Abstract: Present-day music studies conspicuously evade the question of religion in contemporary music. Although many composers address the issue in their work, as yet there have been few attempts to think through the structure of religious music as we hear it. On the basis of a careful analysis of Olivier Messiaen's work, this book argues for a renewal of our thinking about religious music. Addressing his notion of a hyper-religiousmusic of sounds and colors, it aims to show that Messiaen has broken new ground. His reinvention of religious music makes us again aware of the fact that religious music, if taken in its proper radical sense, belongs to the foremost of musical adventures.The work of Olivier Messiaen is well known for its inclusion of religious themes and gestures. These alone, however, do not seem enough to account for the religious status of the work. Arguing for a breakthrough toward the beyondon the basis of the synaesthetic experience of music, Messiaen invites a confrontation with contemporary theologians and post-secular thinkers. How to account for a religious breakthrough that is produced by a work of art?Starting from an analysis of his 1960s oratorio La Transfiguration de Notre-Seigneur Jsus-Christ, this book arranges a moderated dialogue between Messiaen and the music theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar, the phenomenology of revelation of Jean-Luc Marion, the rethinking of religion and technics in Jacques Derrida and Bernard Stiegler, and the Augustinian ruminations of Sren Kierkegaard and Jean-Franois Lyotard. Ultimately, this confrontation underscores the challenging yet deeply affirmative nature of Messiaen's music.<br>

In Missing Link, Jeffery Donaldson unites literary criticism and evolutionary and cognitive science to show how metaphor has been with us since the beginning of time as a seed in the nature of things. With examples from centuries of poets, critics, philosophers, and scientists, he details how metaphor is a chemistry, an exchange of energies forming and dissolving, and an openness in the spaces between things. He considers the ways in which DNA learns how to liken things that have been, how mutation makes errors and then tries them on, and how evolution is hypothesis - nature's way of "thinking more." The mind is a matrix of relations: neural synapses cascade into ever-changing pathways and patterns. Metaphor is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. It is the unbroken thread between matter and spirit. Whether offering analysis of a turn of phrase or chemical reaction, Missing Link presents a vision of literature that is also a vision of the cosmos, and vice versa. It enters the debate between evolution and religion, and challenges scientists, literary theorists, and religious advocates to rethink the relations between their disciplines.<br>

  Abstract: Under what conditions shall we say that a literary text or a work of art contains an allusion to another text or artwork or that a particular allusion succeeds or is understood? These are the main questions I discuss in this essay. Before proposing an analysis of allusions, however, in a more informal and intuitive way I discuss allusions and some related notions and call attention to some demarcation problems, which I hope pave the way for the subsequent discussions.<br>

  Abstract: To place early hominid sexual signaling behavior in the broader context of communication, and in fact in the broader context of an evolutionary semantics, necessitates first of all an examination of similarities—and thus ultimately continuities—in primate sexual signaling behaviors. It furthermore requires an extensive critical analysis of the privileging of human language since preferential treatment of the latter precludes not only an unbiased investigation of the root of the similarities (and continuities) but acknowledgment and analyses of the body which is the dynamic locus of communicative acts. In the course of meeting both requirements, this chapter will show<br>

  Abstract: The first chapter in this part is Ann Margaret Sharp’s “Discovering Yourself a Person.” Here she examines Chapter One of Harry Stottlemeier’s Discovery. In it, Sharp finds that because the first chapter relies heavily on the analysis of concepts like reasoning, reflecting, falsifying, inquiring, and so on, it is an appropriate place for the discovery (or invention, it might be added) of who and what we are. As one watches the characters in Harry begin the process of inquiry and as one watches them stumble toward the formation ofa community, one finds them formulating individual ways or styles of thinking.<br>

  Book Title: Resisting history-Religious transcendence and the invention of the unconscious<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hayward Rhodri<br>
  Abstract: How can historians make sense of visions, hauntings and demonic possession? Do miraculous events have any place in a world governed by cause and effect? In Resisting history, Rhodri Hayward examines the cumulative attempts of theologians, historians and psychologists to create a consistent and rational narrative capable of containing the inexplicable. This lucid and provocative account argues that the psychological theories we routinely use to make sense of supernatural experience were born out of struggles between popular mystics and conservative authorities. Hayward’s lively analysis of the Victorian disciplines of Christology, psychology and psychical research reveals how our modern concept of the subconscious was developed as a tool for policing religious inspiration. He concludes his argument with a vivid study of the Welsh Revival of 1904-5, in which the attempt of thousands of converts to cast off their everyday identity was diffused and defeated using the language of the new psychology. By revealing the politics inherent in such language, Hayward raises questions about its deployment in the work of today’s historians. Written in a clear and accessible style, Resisting history provides a fresh and entertaining perspective for anyone interested in questioning the concepts that underlie historical writing and psychological thought today.<br>

  Book Title: Conrad's Marlow-Narrative and death in 'Youth', Heart of Darkness, Lord Jim and Chance<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wake Paul<br>
  Abstract: Variously described as ‘the average pilgrim’, a ‘wanderer’, and ‘a Buddha preaching in European clothes’, Charlie Marlow is the voice behind Joseph Conrad’s ‘Youth’ (1898), Heart of Darkness (1899), Lord Jim (1900) and Chance (1912). Conrad’s Marlow offers a comprehensive account and critical analysis of one of Conrad’s most celebrated creations, asking both who and what is Marlow: a character or a narrator, a biographer or an autobiographical screen, a messenger or an interpreter, a bearer of truth or a misguided liar? Reading Conrad’s fiction alongside the work of Walter Benjamin, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida and Martin Heidegger, and offering an investigation into the connection between narrative and death, this book argues that Marlow’s essence is located in his liminality – in his constantly shifting position – and that the emergence of meaning in his stories is at all points bound up with the process of his storytelling.<br>

In so doing, she reframes the way we might think about the notions of both grace and innocence particularly as they bear on the issue of the relationship between subjectivity and knowledge. The Fall, as such, is no longer simply meaningful in the brute dichotomy of knowledge versus<br>

  Book Title: Contemporary Violence-Postmodern war in Kosovo and Chechnya<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Moore Cerwyn<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary Violence: Postmodern War in Kosovo and Chechnya draws on several years of field research, as well as interpretive IR theory and analysis of empirical source material so as to shed light on contemporary violence. Drawing on interpretive approaches to International Relations, the book argues that founding events and multiple contexts informed the narratives deployed by different members of each movement, illustrating why elements within the Kosovo Liberation Army and the armed forces of the Chechen republic of Ichkeria favoured regional and local strategies of war in the Balkans and the North Caucasus. The book draws on post-positivist analysis and empirical research so as unravel the relationship between narratives, stories and hermeneutic accounts of International Relations; regional politics and trans-local identity; globalisation and visual aspects of contemporary security; criminality and emotionality; which together illustrate the dynamics within the armed resistance movements in Kosovo and the North Caucasus and the road to war in 1999. The book is a major addition to a small field of genuinely readable studies of IR theory. The book will be of interest to academics, researchers, students, area studies experts and policy-makers seeking to understand the formation of the armed resistance movements in Kosovo and Chechnya. Amongst other things, the book will be of interest to students and scholars of International Relations, Political Studies, Area Studies, as well as those within Cultural and Historical and Sociological Studies.<br>

Building on the last chapter, the analysis engages with localised social networks which informed the armed resistance movements in Kosovo and Chechnya. Firstly we turn to the battle of Gudermes in Chechnya in 1998, and the incursion into Dagestan in 1999. This demonstrates how the former nationalist-separatist movement fragmented in a number of ways, becoming reconstituted around a broader anti-Russian regional narrative.

  Book Title: A.S. Byatt-Critical storytelling<br>

  Author(s): de Campos Amy J. Edwards<br>
  Abstract: This comprehensive study of A. S. Byatt’s work spans virtually her entire career and offers insightful readings of all of Byatt’s works of fiction up to and including her Man-Booker-shortlisted novel The Children’s Book (2009). The authors combine an accessible overview of Byatt’s œuvre to date with close critical analysis of all her major works. Uniquely, the book also considers Byatt’s critical writings and journalism, situating her beyond the immediate context of her fiction. The authors argue that Byatt is not only important as a storyteller, but also as an eminent critic and public intellectual. Advancing the concept of ‘critical storytelling’ as a hallmark of Byatt’s project as a writer, the authors retrace Byatt’s wide-ranging engagement with both literary and critical traditions. This results in positioning Byatt in the wider literary landscape. This book has broad appeal, including fellow researchers, undergraduate and postgraduate students, plus general enthusiasts of Byatt’s work.<br>

  Book Title: Women’s writing in contemporary France-New writers, new literatures in the 1990s<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): WORTON MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: The 1990s witnessed an explosion in women’s writing in France, with a particularly exciting new generation of writer’s coming to the fore, such as Christine Angot, Marie Darrieussecq and Regine Detambel. Other authors such as Paule Constant, Sylvie Germain, Marie Redonnet and Leila Sebbar, who had begun publishing in the 1980s, claimed their mainstream status in the 1990s with new texts. The book provides an up-to-date introduction to an analysis of new women’s writing in contemporary France, including both new writers of the 1990s and their more established counter-parts. The editors’ incisive introduction situates these authors and their texts at the centre of the current trends and issues concerning French literary production today, whilst fifteen original essays focus on individual writers. The volume includes specialist bibliographies on each writer, incorporating English translations, major interviews, and key critical studies. Quotations are given in both French and English throughout. An invaluable study resource, this book is written in a clear and accessible style and will be of interest to the general reader as well as to students of all levels, to teachers of a wide range of courses on French culture, and to specialist researchers of French and Francophone literature.<br>

If narratives provide us, as analysts, a window into how individuals “organize views of themselves, of others, and of their social worlds” (Orbuch 1997, 455), then a critical facet of narrative analysis involves investigating how “women are constructed or construct themselves” within them (Daly and Maher 1998, 4).

  Abstract: The publication of the Vatican II document on Divine Revelation (Dei Verbum) was an exciting and challenging moment for the Church. While honouring the tradition, it also marked a quite dramatic development in the Church’s attitude to modern critical analysis of the Bible and encouraged study and reflection on it by all members of the Church. The golden jubilee of its publication is a timely moment for a book such as this. It contains essays on various aspects of Dei Verbum by authors from around the world. They write from the perspective of their respective disciplines of biblical studies, patristics, theology, liturgy, philosophy, and communications media. They situate the document within the Jewish-Christian tradition, assess its reception since Vatican II, and its implications for the future.<br>

  Abstract: The philosophical work of Jean-Luc Marion has opened new ways of speaking about religious convictions and experiences. In this exploration of Marion's philosophy and theology, Christina M.

She claims that these phenomena do not always appear in the excessive mode that Marion describes and suggests instead that we consider degrees of saturation. Gschwandtner covers major themes in Marion's work-the historical event, art, nature, love, gift and sacrifice, prayer, and the Eucharist. She works within the phenomenology of givenness, but suggests that Marion himself has not considered important aspects of his philosophy.<br>

  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): LLEWELYN JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Focusing on the idea of universal suffrage, John Llewelyn accepts the challenge of Derrida's later thought to renew his focus on the ethical, political, and religious dimensions of what makes us uniquely human. Llewelyn builds this concern on issues of representation, language, meaning, and logic with reflections on the phenomenological figures who informed Derrida's concept of deconstruction. By entering into dialogue with these philosophical traditions, Llewelyn demonstrates the range and depth of his own original thinking. The Rigor of a Certain Inhumanity is a rich and passionate, playful and perceptive work of philosophical analysis.<br>

  Abstract: While Julia Kristeva doubtless did not have in mind the undead corpse of the zombie when she wrote of the abject and how it forces death upon the living, the walking dead undeniably embody abjection. It is not strange, then, that in representations of zombies, in film, literature, television, or other media, the primary focus is on how the humans who have not been infected confront and battle those who have returned from the dead. Those who engage in zombie fighting are necessarily confronting and denying the death (among other things) that the posthuman monster represents. This analysis of Seth<br>

  Book Title: The Cruelest of All Mothers: Marie de l'Incarnation, Motherhood, and Christian Tradition-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dunn Mary<br>
  Abstract: In 1631, Marie Guyart stepped over the threshold of the Ursuline convent in Tours, leaving behind her eleven-year-old son, Claude, against the wishes of her family and her own misgivings. Marie concluded, "God was dearer to me than all that. Leaving him therefore in His hands, I bid adieu to him joyfully." Claude organized a band of schoolboys to storm the convent, begging for his mother's return. Eight years later, Marie made her way to Quebec, where over the course of the next thirty-three years she opened the first school for Native American girls, translated catechisms into indigenous languages, and served some eighteen years as superior of the first Ursuline convent in the New World. She would also maintain, over this same period, an extensive and intimate correspondence with the son she had abandoned to serve God. The Cruelest of All Mothers is, fundamentally, an explanation of Marie de l'Incarnation's decision to abandon Claude for religious life. Complicating Marie's own explication of the abandonment as a sacrifice carried out in imitation of Christ and in submission to God's will, the book situates the event against the background of early modern French family life, the marginalization of motherhood in the Christian tradition, and seventeenth-century French Catholic spirituality. Deeply grounded in a set of rich primary sources, The Cruelest of All Mothers offers a rich and complex analysis of the abandonment.<br>

  Abstract: Transdisciplinary and intermedial analysis of the experience of music Nowadays musical semiotics no longer ignores the fundamental challenges raised by cognitive sciences, ethology, or linguistics. Creation, action and experience play an increasing role in how we understand music, a sounding structure impinging upon our body, our mind, and the world we live in. Not discarding music as a closed system, an integral experience of music demands a transdisciplinary dialogue with other domains as well. Music, Analysis, Experience brings together contributions by semioticians, performers, and scholars from cognitive sciences, philosophy, and cultural studies, and deals with these fundamental questionings. Transdisciplinary and intermedial approaches to music meet musicologically oriented contributions to classical music, pop music, South American song, opera, narratology, and philosophy.<br>

  Book Title: Religion Without Redemption-Social Contradictions and Awakened Dreams in Latin America<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Löwy Michael<br>
  Abstract: The world’s eyes are on Latin America as a place of radical political inspiration and as an alternative to the neoliberal model. Each country in the region deals differently in its method of government, yet there are common cultural themes that tie the continent’s trajectory together. Religion without Redemption looks at the sociology of religion, political philosophy and the history of ideas of the continent, in an attempt to show how Western understanding fails to come close to a correct analysis of how and why political and economic characteristics work as they do. Luis Martínez Andrade focuses on how the centrality of religion for the people of Latin America has influenced how they interact with the changes in the modern economic system. Capitalism, for example, has taken on religious characteristics: it has sacred places of worship (the shopping mall) as well as its own prophets. Martínez Andrade discusses how this form of ‘cultural religion’ accompanies many aspects of life in a contradictory manner: not only does it fulfil the role of legitimating oppression, it also can be a powerful source of rebellion, unveiling thus a subversive side to the status quo. Religion Without Redemption advances the ideas of liberation theory into the 21st century, and challenges the provincialism to which many Latin American thinkers are usually consigned.<br>

The book provides an unparalleled account of theoretical developments in anthropology from the 1920s to the present, including functionalism, structuralism, hermeneutics, neo-Marxism and discourse analysis. There are brief biographies of major anthropologists and coverage of key debates including totemism, kinship and globalisation.

  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>

  Abstract: The study of white ethnicities is becoming increasingly important in the social sciences. This book provides a critical introduction to the topic. Whiteness has traditionally been seen as "ethnically transparent" - the marker against which other ethnicities are measured. This analysis is clearly incorrect, but only recently have many race and ethnicity scholars moved away from focusing on ethnic minorities and instead oriented their studies around the construction of white identities. Simon Clarke and Steve Garner's book is designed to guide students as they explore how white identities are forged using both sociological and psycho-social ideas. Including an excellent survey of the existing literature and original research from the UK, this book will be an invaluable guide for sociology students taking modules in race and ethnicity.<br>

  Book Title: Cities of Affluence and Anger-A Literary Geography of Modern Englishness<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): KALLINEY PETER J.<br>
  Abstract: Providing a compact literary history of the twentieth century in England, Cities of Affluence and Anger studies the problematic terms of national identity during England's transition from an imperial power to its integration in the global cultural marketplace. While the countryside had been the dominant symbol of Englishness throughout the previous century, modern literature began to turn more and more to the city to redraw the boundaries of a contemporary cultural polity. The urban class system, paradoxically, still functioned as a marker of wealth, status, and hierarchy throughout this long period of self-examination, but it also became a way to project a common culture and mitigate other forms of difference. Local class politics were transformed in such a way that enabled the English to reframe a highly provisional national unity in the context of imperial disintegration, postcolonial immigration, and, later, globalization.Kalliney plots the decline of the country-house novel through an analysis of Forster's Howards End and Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, each ruthless in its sabotage of the trope of bucolic harmony. The traditionally pastoral focus of English fiction gives way to a high-modernist urban narrative, exemplified by Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, and, later, to realists such as Osborne and Sillitoe, through whose work Kalliney explores postwar urban expansion and the cultural politics of the welfare state. Offering fresh new readings of Lessing's The Golden Notebook and Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, the author considers the postwar appropriation of domesticity, the emergence of postcolonial literature, and the renovation of travel narratives in the context of globalization. Kalliney suggests that it is largely one city--London--through which national identity has been reframed. How and why this transition came about is a process that Cities of Affluence and Anger depicts with exceptional insight and originality.<br>

  Book Title: Forbidden Fictions-Pornography and Censorship in Twentieth-Century French Literature<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Phillips John<br>
  Abstract: ‘Phillips discusses texts by Apollinaire, Pierre Loüys, Georges Bataille, Pauline Réage, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Tony Duvert, Elizabeth Barillé and Marie Darrieussecq, engaging in different levels of critical analysis so as to emphasize intertextual and parodic elements in one case, or points of possible identification in another.’ TLS French culture has long been perceived by the English-speaking reader as somehow more ‘erotic’ than its Anglo-Saxon equivalent. Forbidden Fictions is the first English-language study devoted exclusively to the wide spectrum of French literary pornography in the twentieth century. John Phillips provides a broad history of the genre and the associated moral and political issues. Among the texts examined in detail – all selected for their literary or sociopolitical importance – are landmark works by Apollinaire, Louÿs, Bataille, Réage, Robbe-Grillet, Arsan, and Duvert. Phillips challenges current politically correct trends in literary criticism and stereotyped censoring discourses about pornography to provide a new reading of each text and to illustrate the genre’s potential for social subversion. Forbidden Fictions addresses the most controversial issues of contemporary sexual politics, such as objectification, sadomasochism, homoeroticism and paedophilia, with particular emphasis on the feminist debate on pornography.

  Abstract: The most common appearance of community within the social sciences, and especially the anthropological literature, has probably been in its most taken-for-granted and unexamined form as a unit of analysis, the location rather than the object of research. But community has also featured as a long-standing vehicle for a broader scholarly interrogation of the dialectic between historical social transformations and social cohesion, and as such was a focus in scholarship as varied as that of Tönnies, Durkheim and Weber writing at the turn of the twentieth century (Chorney, 1990), the ‘Chicago School’ urbanists of the first half of the twentieth<br>

  Abstract: The task of this book is to think through how Caribbean textual representations of performance broaden understandings of personhood. To explore how the genre of performance specifically can intercede in definitions of personhood, this chapter offers a performance analysis of Marissa Chibas’s 2007 one-woman play

Throughout the play, Chibas performs much of the “backstage” work—such as establishing the scene’s time and place, or getting in and out of character—and exposes otherwise unseen labor. In so doing,Daughterdemonstrates how the means of creating theater give us a point of entry into redefining personhood.<br>

  Book Title: Husserl's Missing Technologies-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): IHDE DON<br>
  Abstract: Husserl's Missing Technologies looks at the early-twentieth-century "classical" phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, both in the light of the philosophy of science of his time, and retrospectively at his philosophy from a contemporary "postphenomenology." Of central interest are his infrequent comments upon technologies and especially scientific instruments such as the telescope and microscope. Together with his analysis of Husserl, Don Ihde ventures through the recent history of technologies of science, reading and writing, and science praxis, calling for modifications to phenomenology by converging it with pragmatism. This fruitful hybridization emphasizes human-technology interrelationships, the role of embodiment and bodily skills, and the inherent multistability of technologies. In a radical argument, Ihde contends that philosophies, in the same way that various technologies contain an ever-shortening obsolescence, ought to have contingent use-lives.<br>

  Book Title: Walter Benjamin and Theology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SYMONS STÉPHANE<br>
  Abstract: In the Arcades Project, Walter Benjamin writes that his work is "related to theology as blotting pad is related to ink. It is saturated with it." For a thinker so decisive to critical literary, cultural, political, and aesthetic writings over the past half-century, Benjamin's relationship to theological matters has been less observed than it should, even despite a variety of attempts over the last four decades to illuminate the theological elements latent within his eclectic and occasional writings. Such attempts, though undeniably crucial to comprehending his thought, remain in need of deepened systematic analysis. In bringing together some of the most renowned experts from both sides of the Atlantic, Walter Benjamin and Theology seeks to establish a new site from which to address both the issue of Benjamin's relationship with theology and all the crucial aspects that Benjamin himself grappled with when addressing the field and operations of theological inquiry.<br>

  Abstract: Two decades ago, inquiry into narrative played but a minor role in scholarly deliberation; the relationship between narrative analysis and historiography was little explored; the term “narrative” had scarcely entered the vocabulary of psychological science. Today, the study of narrative concatenates throughout the humanities and the social sciences, and the problems raised by such analyses for our conception of history, along with the historical consciousness of the individual, are profound. Further, there are now many distinct and well-articulated orientations toward narrative: realist, phenomenological, psychodynamic, cognitive, textual, and rhetorical among them. Each raises different implications for our understanding of history, identity,<br>

This notion itself is based on a concept of objectivity which introduces a categorical separation between reality and its description or analysis, and thus gets into the problem of the adequacy of representation and its correspondence to the object depicted.

  Book Title: Death's Following: Mediocrity, Dirtiness, Adulthood, Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): LIMON JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Almost all twentieth-century philosophy stresses the immanence of death in human life-as drive (Freud), as the context of Being (Heidegger), as the essence of our defining ethics (Levinas), or as language (de Man, Blanchot). In Death's Following, John Limon makes use of literary analysis (of Sebald, Bernhard, and Stoppard), cultural analysis, and autobiography to argue that death is best conceived as always transcendentally beyond ourselves, neither immanent nor imminent. Adapting Kierkegaard's variations on the theme of Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac while refocusing the emphasis onto Isaac, Limon argues that death should be imagined as if hiding at the end of an inexplicable journey to Moriah. The point is not to evade or ignore death but to conceive it more truly, repulsively, and pervasively in its camouflage: for example, in jokes, in logical puzzles, in bowdlerized folk songs. The first of Limon's two key concepts is adulthood: the prolonged anti-ritual for experiencing the full distance on the look of death. His second is dirtiness, as theorized in a Jewish joke, a logical exemplum, and T. S. Eliot's "Ash Wednesday": In each case, unseen dirt on foreheads suggests the invisibility of inferred death. Not recognizing death immediately or admitting its immanence and imminence is for Heidegger the defining characteristic of the "they," humanity in its inauthentic social escapism. But Limon vouches throughout for the mediocrity of the "they" in its dirty and ludicrous adulthood. Mediocrity is the privileged position for previewing death, in Limon's opinion: practice for being forgotten. In refusing the call of twentieth-century philosophy to face death courageously, Limon urges the ethical and aesthetic value of mediocre anti-heroism.<br>

  Abstract: In

Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi argues that while attempts to psychoanalyze Freud's text may be potentially fruitful, they must be preceded by a genuine effort to understand what Freud consciously wanted to convey to his readers. Using both historical and philological analysis, Yerushalmi offers new insights into Freud's intentions in writingMoses and Monotheism.He presents the work as Freud's psychoanalytic history of the Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish psyche-his attempt, under the shadow of Nazism, to discover what has made the Jews what they are. In the process Yerushalmi's eloquent and sensitive exploration of Freud's last work provides a reappraisal of Freud's feelings toward anti-Semitism and the gentile world, his ambivalence about psychoanalysis as a "Jewish" science, his relationship to his father, and above all a new appreciation of the depth and intensity of Freud's identity as a "godless Jew."<br>

  Book Title: Wallace Stevens among Others-Diva-Dames, Deleuze, and American Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): JARRAWAY DAVID R.<br>
  Abstract: In Wallace Stevens among Others David Jarraway explores the extraordinary achievement of Wallace Stevens, but in contexts that are not usually thought about in connection with Stevens's work - gay literature, contemporary fiction, Hollywood film, and avant-garde architecture, among others. By viewing the poet among these "other" contexts, Jarraway considers the nature of self-reflection and pays special attention to the discrediting of self-presence as the principle of identity in American writing - a theme that reflects American authors’ abiding concern for subjectivities that engage the world from spaces of distance and difference. By returning to the work of Stevens, Jarraway seeks to refurbish this preoccupation by linking it to the literary theory of French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, whose work applies to American writers from Melville and Whitman to Fitzgerald and Cummings. Jarraway forges the link between Deleuze and Stevens by drawing out the female subjectivity found in each writer’s work to rethink the more static masculinist premises of being. Informed by a deep knowledge of and fluency with the work of Stevens and Deleuze, Jarraway uses these writers as a means of entry into American literature and culture, Wallace Stevens among Others is a sophisticated analysis that will open new directions for future scholarship.<br>

  Abstract: John Evans was a power and a force. His energy, originality and independence prompted colleagues to thought, action, disagreement or all three. His pioneering analyses of molluscan assemblages from the Wessex chalkland remained a feature of his career over five decades. This paper examines the role of molluscan analysis in the interpretation of the fourth millennium cal BC monument complex on Hambledon Hill, Dorset (Mercer & Healy 2008) and its large faunal assemblage, which is dominated by cattle.<br>

  Abstract: The powers’ dynamic autonomization never escapes the grip of providence. The fallen powers are created powers. As neither wholly good, nor wholly evil, the shape of the powers must be discerned. Yoder’s theological method privileges a form of discernment rooted in the practical encounter between specific Christian communities and specific powers. Discernment is ultimately a function of mission. Theologians’ contribution to this mission is limited, according to Yoder, yet indispensable for the discernment process. The theologian’s gifts of linguistic analysis and scriptural and historical memory are useful because they facilitate a comparison of the powers with the way of Jesus.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter we will lay down our anthropological foundation, which will shape our analysis of mental illness as a human phenomenon. Throughout history man has been an enigma, and a paradox, not only in the pages of Scripture, but also to himself and his fellow human beings. Although there have been many studies on every detail of a human’s life concerning his social, psychological, economical, political, physiological, and cultural status in life, one seemingly trivial question that has puzzled philosophers, scientists, and laymen alike, driving the fundamental answer to all aforementioned categories, is

  Abstract: The French Reformed lay theologian Jacques Ellul is probably better known for his original and insightful work in social analysis and critique rather than in theology, and yet his wrestling with issues of hell and universal salvation offer some original insights for contemporary theology. In one sense the focus on his sociological works is not surprising given his area of academic expertise.

  Book Title: The Atheist's Primer-  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Palmer Michael<br>
  Abstract: In The Atheist's Primer, a prominent philosopher, Dr Michael Palmer, reinstates the importance of philosophy in the debate about God's existence. The 'new atheism' of Richard Dawkins and others has been driven by largely Darwinian objections to God's existence, limiting the debate to within a principally scientific framework. This has obscured the philosophical tradition of atheism, in which the main intellectual landmarks in atheism's history are to be found. With an analysis of atheistic thought from the Ancient Greeks to the present day, Palmer explains and comments on the philosophical arguments warranting atheism, discussing issues such as evil, morality, miracles, and the motivations for belief. The emphasis placed on materialism and the limitations of our knowledge might seem disheartening to some; but Palmer concludes on a positive note, arguing – alongside Nietzsche, Marx and Freud and many others – that happiness and personal fulfilment are to be found in the very materialism that religious belief rejects. Michael Palmer first addressed these issues in his student-oriented edition, The Atheist's Creed, of which The Atheist's Primer is a revised abridgement for the general reader. Palmer has now stripped out the primary texts and expanded his commentaries into fluent and concise analyses of the arguments. Free of philosophical jargon and assumptions of prior knowledge, this is an important introduction to a major cultural debate.<br>

  Book Title: Drinking from the Wells of New Creation-The Holy Spirit and the Imagination in Reconciliation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Dearborn Kerry<br>
  Abstract: The Holy Spirit, as God’s abiding presence to draw people to Christ, can cleanse wounds and bring love and hope into our hearts. Kerry Dearborn’s insightful focus on the Holy Spirit transforming our moral imagination and putting us on the path of reconciliation with Jesus Christ is both profound and encouraging. Biblical analysis, historical surveys and references to acclaimed theological authors support Dearborn’s nuanced yet practical application of imagination as a tool for awakening, recovery, and dissolving intellectual or psychological barriers that isolate us from God. She considers effectively how imagination can be connected to reality, and is able to delve deep into this vein of thought with startling clarity. Drinking from the Wells of New Creation provides spiritual guidance for dealing with oppression in society; an issue that affects people both within and outside the Christian faith. The acknowledgement of reconciliation as a creative process provides a fresh outlook and will excite those delving into both theological and psychological studies, as well as those seeking to understand God’s unification of life, regardless of tribe, tongue and nation.<br>

  Book Title: Translating the English Bible-From Relevance to Deconstruction<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Goodwin Philip W.<br>
  Abstract: In his detailed and thought-provoking work, Philip Goodwin conducts a thorough analysis of the challenges facing the Biblical translator, with particular focus on the problematic dominance of the King James Version of the Bible in our imaginations – a dominance which has had a deleterious effect upon the accuracy and originality of the translator's work. Goodwin considers the first two chapters of the Lukan narratives in depth, comparing and contrasting a breadth of widely disparate translations and drawing on a rich body of Biblical scholarship to support his thesis. A wide-ranging discussion of other linguistic issues is also conducted, touching on such vital matters as incorporating the contextual implications of the original text, and the attempt to challenge the reader's pre-existing encyclopaedic knowledge. Goodwin evolves a fresh and comprehensive answer to the difficulties of the translator's task, and concludes by providing his own original and charming translation of the first two chapters of Luke's Gospel. 'Translating the English Bible' provides a fascinating insight into the processes of translation and will interest anyone seeking accuracy and fidelity to the Scriptural message. It will also enlighten readers seeking a challenging translation of Luke that casts off the shackles of the 'Holy Marriage' tradition of Biblical translation.<br>

  Book Title: The Fate of Saul's Progeny in the Reign of David-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Longman Tremper<br>
  Abstract: Cephas Tushima provides a thorough analysis of the fate of Saul's heirs, focussing on whether their tragedies were due to continuing divine retribution, coincidence, or Davidic orchestration. He concludes that David was unjust and calculating in his dealings with the Saulides and, like other Near Eastern usurpers, perpetrated heinous injustices against the vanquished house of Saul. Traditionally readers saw Saul as evil and David as a hero; but more recently scholars have written about Saul as a tragic character and David as a villain, turning the book of Samuel into deeply contested interpretive territory. Tushima provides analysis of the critical literature surrounding this contentious issue and contributes his own study that will prove important to the continuing debate. He assesses David's character by analysing how he treats the surviving children of his predecessor, drawing upon the provisions for justice in the covenant community in the book of Deuteronomy. He demonstrates a connection between Samuel and the Torah through themes and motifs, and develops theological conclusions from them on such issues as the impact of human conduct on the environment, marriage, monarchy and Zion theology.<br>

  Abstract: The first paperback edition of a classic of American constitutional theory. The book is divided into two parts. In Part I Professor Tushnet appraises the five major competing "grand theories" of constitutional law and interpretation, and, argues that none of them satisfy their own requirements for coherence and judicial constraint. In Part II the author offers a descriptive sociology of constitutional doctrine and raises critical questions as to whether a grand theory is necessary, is it possible to construct a coherent, useful grand theory, and is construction of an uncontroversial grand theory possible?Professor Tushnet's new Afterword is organized in parallel fashion to the original text. Part I offers a new survey of the contemporary terrain of constitutional interpretation. Part II provides an extended discussion of the most prominent of contemporary efforts to provide an external analysis of constitutional law, the idea of regime politics. This includes discussion of major court decisions, including

  Abstract: From the time of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, people of British origin have shared the area of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, traditionally called Acadia, with Eastern Canada's Algonkian-speaking peoples, the Mi'kmaq. This historical analysis of colonial Acadia from the perspective of symbolic and mythic existence will be useful to those interested in Canadian history, native Canadian history, religion in Canada, and history of religion.<br>

  Abstract: I began this inquiry by noting that one or another form of alienation appears to have been the experience of all Acadia’s peoples. The bulk of this work has concerned itself with a search for the historical roots of alienation, but it may not have constituted a historical analysis in any familiar sense of the term, since it has consciously focussed upon human religiosity as that which gives meaning to history. History, like religion, is very much a product of the scholar’s own historical context as well as of the scholar’s purpose for writing. In that sense, this historical work<br>

  Abstract: A leading Polish philosopher of the 20th century, Roman Ingarden is principally renowned in Western culture for his work in aesthetics and the theory of literature. Jeff Mitscherling demonstrates, in this extensive work, how Ingarden's thought constitutes a major contribution to the more fundamental fields of ontology and metaphysics. Unparalleled in existing literature, Mitscherling's comprehensive survey of Ingarden's philosophy will give the reader an informed introduction to this major work of phenomenological analysis.<br>

  Abstract: Generalizations about linguistic analysis and ethics are not likely to be very useful; nor, as a general rule, are general descriptions of linguistic methods in philosophy enlightening. Unless one has actually seen some live philosophical tangle unsnarled by such a technique, one will not be very convinced by even a very accurate general description of the methods used. On the other hand, sample analyses of moral concepts often do not make clear their relevance (direct or indirect) to actual moral perplexities.

  Abstract: The question of how and why readers would attribute an ethos to literary characters, narrators, or authors is part of the more general issue of how people make meaning from and with texts. Within the humanities, such issues are traditionally the province of hermeneutics, which encompasses the theory, the method (or the “art”), and the practice of interpreting texts. Alternately, interpretations and their underlying processes are studied from the perspective of literary and aesthetic phenomenology, the sociology of literature, discourse analysis, the reception history of literary works (

  Book Title: Contemporary Comics Storytelling-  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): KUKKONEN KARIN<br>
  Abstract: Applying a cognitive approach to reading comics in all their narrative richness and intricacy,
      Contemporary Comics Storytellingopens an intriguing perspective on how these works engage the legacy of postmodernism-its subversion, self-reflexivity, and moral contingency. Its three case studies trace how contemporary comics tie into deep traditions of visual and verbal storytelling, how they reevaluate their own status as fiction, and how the fictional minds of their characters generate complex ethical thought experiments. At a time when the medium is taken more and more seriously as intricate and compelling literary art, this book lays the groundwork for an analysis of the ways in which comics challenge and engage readers' minds. It brings together comics studies with narratology and literary criticism and, in so doing, provides a new set of tools for evaluating the graphic novel as an emergent literary form.<br>

First, I examine the process of epistemological violence — brainwashing through formal and informal education — as a legacy of colonialism. Second, I study the specificity of women’s experience within the colonial discourse.

  Author(s): Fernández Christian<br>
  Abstract: This edited volume offers new perspectives from leading scholars on the important work of Inca Garcilaso de la Vega (1539-1616), one of the first Latin American writers to present an intellectual analysis of pre-Columbian history and culture and the ensuing colonial period. To the contributors, Inca Garcilaso's
      Royal Commentaries of the Incaspresented an early counter-hegemonic discourse and a reframing of the history of native non-alphabetic cultures that undermined the colonial rhetoric of his time and the geopolitical divisions it purported. Through his research in both Andean and Renaissance archives, Inca Garcilaso sought to connect these divergent cultures into one world.This collection offers five classical studies ofRoyal Commentariespreviously unavailable in English, along with seven new essays that cover topics including Andean memory, historiography, translation, philosophy, trauma, and ethnic identity. This cross-disciplinary volume will be of interest to students and scholars of Latin American history, culture, comparative literature, subaltern studies, and works in translation.<br>

  Book Title: Indebted-Capitalism and Religion in the Writings of S. Y. Agnon<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Sagiv Yonatan<br>
  Abstract: This is the first book to examine the oeuvre of Shmuel Yosef Agnon, 1966 Nobel laureate in literature, through a reading that combines perspectives from economic theory, semiotics, psychoanalysis, narrative theory, and Jewish and religious studies. Sagiv outlines the vital role economy plays in the construction of religion, subjectivity, language, and thought in Agnon's work, and, accordingly, explores his literary use of images of debt, money, and economy to examine how these themes illuminate other focal points in the canonical author's work, excavating the economic infrastructure of discourses that are commonly considered to reside beyond the economic sphere.Sagiv's analysis of Agnon's work, renowned for its paradoxical articulation of the impact of modernity on traditional Jewish society, exposes an overarching distrust regarding the sustainability of any economic structure. The concrete and symbolic economies surveyed in this project are prone to cyclical crises. Under what Sagiv terms Agnon's "law of permanent debt," the stability and profitability of economies are always temporary. Agnon's literary economy, transgressing traditional closures, together with his profound irony, make it impossible to determine if these economic crises are indeed the product of the break with tradition or, alternatively, if this theodicy is but a fantasy, marking permanent debt as the inherent economic infrastructure of human existence.<br>

  Book Title: Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fiction-Explorations in Readers' Engagement with Characters<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): CARACCIOLO MARCO<br>
  Abstract: A storyteller's craft can often be judged by how convincingly the narrative captures the identity and personality of its characters. In this book, the characters who take center stage are "strange" first-person narrators: they are fascinating because of how they are at odds with what the reader would wish or expect to hear-while remaining reassuringly familiar in voice, interactions, and conversations. Combining literary analysis with research in cognitive and social psychology, Marco Caracciolo focuses on readers' encounters with the "strange" narrators of ten contemporary novels, including Bret Easton Ellis's
      American Psycho, Haruki Murakami'sHard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, and Mark Haddon'sThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. Caracciolo explores readers' responses to narrators who suffer from neurocognitive or developmental disorders, who are mentally disturbed due to multiple personality disorder or psychopathy, whose consciousness is split between two parallel dimensions or is disembodied, who are animals, or who lose their sanity.A foray into current work on reception, reader-response, cognitive literary study, and narratology,Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fictionillustrates why any encounter with a fictional text is a complex negotiation of interlaced feelings, thoughts, experiences, and interpretations.<br>

Joas and Knöbl centre their analysis on five interrelated concepts that play a pivotal role in Bourdieu’s work: the concepts of (1)
                  practice, (2)action, (3)the social, (4)cultural sociology,<br>

  Book Title: Metaphor, Morality, and the Spirit in Romans 8-1–17<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Robinson William E. W.<br>
  Abstract: In this innovative book, William E. W. Robinson takes the reader on a journey through Romans 8:1-17 using Conceptual Metaphor Theory and Conceptual Integration Theory. Robinson delineates the underlying cognitive metaphors, their structure, their function, what they mean, and how Paul's audiences then and now are able to comprehend their meaning. He examines each metaphor in the light of relevant aspects of the Greco-Roman world and Paul's Jewish background. Robinson contends that Paul portrays the Spirit as the principal agent in the religious-ethical life of believers. At the same time, his analysis demonstrates that the conceptual metaphors in Romans 8:1-17 convey the integral role of believers in ethical conduct. In the process, he addresses thorny theological issues such as whether Spirit and flesh signal an internal battle within believers or two conflicting ways of life. Finally, Robinson shows how this study is relevant to related Pauline passages and challenges scholars to incorporate these methods into their own investigation of biblical texts.<br>

  Book Title: The Resounding Soul-Reflections on the Metaphysics and Vivacity of the Human Person<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Kimbriel Samuel<br>
  Abstract: It is surely not coincidental that the term “soul" should mean not only the centre of a creature’s life and consciousness, but also a thing or action characterized by intense vivacity (“that bike’s got soul!"). It also seems far from coincidental that the same contemporary academic discussions that have largely cast aside the language of “soul" in their quest to define the character of human mental life should themselves be so – how to say it? – bloodless, so lacking in soul. This volume arises from the opposite premise, namely that the task of understanding human nature is bound up with and in important respects dependent upon the more critical task of learning to be fully human, of learning to have soul. The papers collected here are derived from a conference in Oxford sponsored by the Centre of Theology and Philosophy and together explore the often surprising landscape that emerges when human consciousness is approached from this angle. Drawing upon literary, philosophical, theological, historical, and musical modes of analysis, the essays of this volume vividly remind the reader of the power of the ancient language of soul over against contemporary impulses to reduce, fragment, and overly determine human selfhood.<br>

Linking the interpretative chapters are intriguing brief expositions on time travel, time cycles, time lines, and time pieces, showing the different ways in which human history has been located in time.<br>

  Book Title: Whose Freud?-The Place of Psychoanalysis in Contemporary Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Woloch Alex<br>
  Abstract: One hundred years after the publication of
      The Interpretation of Dreams,Freud remains the most frequently cited author of our culture-and one of the most controversial. To some he is the presiding genius of modernity, to others the author of its symptomatic illnesses. The current position of psychoanalysis is very much at issue. Is it still valid as a theory of the mind? Have its therapeutic applications been rendered obsolete by drugs? Why does it still figure in debates about sexual identity, despite its rejection by many feminists? How does it contribute to cultural analysis?This book offers a new assessment of the status of psychoanalysis as a discipline and a discourse in contemporary culture. It brings together an exceptional group of theorists and practitioners, such partisans and critics of Freud as Frederic Crews, Judith Butler, Leo Bersani, Juliet Mitchell, Robert Jay Lifton, Richard Wollheim, Jonathan Lear, and others.These contributors, who are active in literature, philosophy, film, history, cultural studies, neuroscience, psychotherapy, and other disciplines, debate how psychoanalysis has enriched-and been enriched by-these fields.<br>

  Book Title: Agitations-Essays on Life and Literature<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Krystal Arthur<br>
  Abstract: We disagree. From small questions of taste to large questions concerning the nature of existence, intellectual debate takes up much of our time. In this book the respected literary critic Arthur Krystal examines what most commentators ignore: the role of temperament and taste in the forming of aesthetic and ideological opinions. In provocative essays about reading and writing, about the relation between life and literature, about knowledge and certainty, about God and death, and about his own gradual disaffection with the literary scene, Krystal demonstrates that opposing points of view are based more on innate predilections than on disinterested thought or analysis.Not beholden to any fashionable theory or political agenda, Krystal interrogates the usual suspects in the cultural wars from an independent, though not impartial, vantage point. Clearly personal and unabashedly belletrist, his essays ask important questions. What makes culture one thing and not another? What inspires aesthetic values? What drives us to make comparisons? And how does a bias for one kind of evidence as opposed to another contribute to the form and content of intellectual argument?<br>

  Book Title: Textual Silence-Unreadability and the Holocaust<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): LANG JESSICA<br>
  Abstract: There are thousands of books that represent the Holocaust, but can, and should, the act of reading these works convey the events of genocide to those who did not experience it? In
      Textual Silence, literary scholar Jessica Lang asserts that language itself is a barrier between the author and the reader in Holocaust texts-and that this barrier is not a lack of substance, but a defining characteristic of the genre.Holocaust texts, which encompass works as diverse as memoirs, novels, poems, and diaries, are traditionally characterized by silences the authors place throughout the text, both deliberately and unconsciously. While a reader may have the desire and will to comprehend the Holocaust, the presence of "textual silence" is a force that removes the experience of genocide from the reader's analysis and imaginative recourse. Lang defines silences as omissions that take many forms, including the use of italics and quotation marks, ellipses and blank pages in poetry, and the presence of unreliable narrators in fiction. While this limits the reader's ability to read in any conventional sense, these silences are not flaws. They are instead a critical presence that forces readers to acknowledge how words and meaning can diverge in the face of events as unimaginable as those of the Holocaust.<br>

  Abstract: La presente Tesis estudia las relaciones entre la ciencia y la poesía. Nuestro trabajo aborda el modo en que el conocimiento científico modula la creación literaria, así como algunos de los procedimientos del pensamiento literario. Las hipótesis de investigación reposan sobre dos niveles de la escritura de Lorand Gaspar: la dimensión epistemológica del discurso poético y su valor cognitivo. A partir del análisis de un corpus literario se propone una metodología de estudio que atiende a la complejidad epistemológica y cognitiva de la enunciación poética. Tres apartados teóricos organizan la investigación de algunos de los procesos del pensamiento poético: percepción, emoción y metáfora. Lo anterior se enmarca en una argumentación que favorece la transdisciplinariedad mediante estrategias de análisis literario que integran consideraciones de carácter interdisciplinar.This thesis studies the relations between Science and Poetry. The research approaches the way in which the scientific knowledge modulates the literary creation, as well as some of the procedures of the literary thought. The hypotheses of investigation rest on two levels of Lorand Gaspar’s writing: the epistemological dimension and the cognitive value of the poetic discourse. Based on the analysis of a literary corpus this research proposes a methodology of study that attends to the epistemological and cognitive complexity of the lyrical enunciation. Three theoretical chapters organize the investigation of some of the processes of the poetical thought: Perception, Emotion and Metaphor.

  Abstract: For over a hundred years, Bollywood—India’s Hindi language cinema—has cradled and nurtured the dreams, hopes, and fantasies of its growing audiences. Amid the glorious, larger than life portrayals of human relationships, mighty heroes, complex plots, perfect endings, myriad of traditions, and the glitter and glamour, stands the quintessential

  Abstract: The focus of this chapter is on how I gain knowledge of the processes involved in constructing shifting and overlapping forms of belonging to different kinds of community and how this illuminates experiences of retirement migration. I begin by presenting a discussion of my conceptualisation of retirement migration and then unravel my approach to theory, explaining how women’s experiences and agency are placed within wider structural contexts. I explore how understanding of retirement migration is gained through a thematic and structural narrative analytic approach centring on plot, time, identity or positionality and an analysis of linguistic devices employed.

  Book Title: Personhood, identity and care in advanced old age-  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Gilleard Chris<br>
  Abstract: How do we sustain agency and identity amidst the frailty of advanced old age? What role does care play in this process? Pushing forward new sociological theory, this book explores the theoretical and practical issues raised by age and infirmity. It begins with a theoretical examination of the fourth age, interrogating notions of agency, identity and personhood, as well as the impact of frailty, abjection and ‘othering’. It then applies this analysis to issues of care. Exploring our collective hopes and fears concerning old age and the ends of people’s lives, this is essential reading on one of the biggest social issues of our time.Pushing forward new sociological theory, this book explores the theoretical and practical issues raised by ageing, and the associated problems of mental and physical frailty in later life.<br>

  Abstract: It may seem obvious to say that biographical research differs from all other sociological research. The differences apply to research techniques, procedures of analysing biographical material and something that can be called a ‘style of work’, which covers the very time-consuming research stages of material collection and analysis. These and many other specific features of biographical research are grounded in theoretical and methodological assumptions which vary for particular types of biographical work. However, the outstanding characteristic of this kind of work is that the research material is biography.<br>

  Book Title: Localism and neighbourhood planning-Power to the people?<br>
  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Bradley Quintin<br>
  Abstract: A critical analysis of neighbourhood planning. Setting empirical evidence from the UK against international examples, the Editors engage in broader debates on the purposes of planning and the devolution of power to localities.Governments around the world are seeing the locality as a key arena for effecting changes in governance, restructuring state/civil society relations and achieving sustainable growth. This is the first book to critically analyse this shift towards localism in planning through exploring neighbourhood planning; one of the fastest growing, most popular and most contentious contemporary planning initiatives. Bringing together original empirical research with critical perspectives on governance and planning, the book engages with broader debates on the purposes of planning, the construction of active citizenship, the uneven geographies of localism and the extent to which power is actually being devolved. Setting this within an international context with cases from the US, Australia and France the book reflects on the possibilities for the emergence of a more progressive form of localism.<br>

It brought to the conversation not only a new theme—liberation—but also a new perspective on doing theology and a novel way of referring to God’s being and action in history. Its project to reconfigure the interplay between religious studies, ethics, and politics became a meaningful topic of analysis and dialogue in the general theological discourse.

Writing the interpretation of an earlier historical time, contemporary critics and theorists correctly insist that they see the past through the eyes of the present. But what in our divided and fragmented world governs our visions or perceptions of the past? We insist on the need for self-reflection, on the analysis of our principles, but these are inevitably governed and constricted by the perceptions we have received and constructed.<br>

  Book Title: The Ambiguous Allure of the West-Traces of the Colonial in Thailand<br>
  Publisher: Hong Kong University Press, HKU<br>
  Author(s): Chakrabarty Dipesh<br>
  Abstract: The book brings studies of modern Thai history and culture into dialogue with debates in comparative intellectual history, Asian cultural studies, and postcolonial studies. It takes Thai Studies in new directions through case studies of the cultural hybridity and ambivalences that have emerged from the manifold interactions between Siam/Thailand and the West from 1850 to the present day. Central aims of The Ambiguous Allure of the West are to critique notions of Thai "uniqueness" or "exceptionalism" and locate Thai Studies in a broader, comparative perspective by arguing that modern Siam/Thailand needs to be understood as a semicolonial society. In contrast to conservative nationalist and royalist accounts of Thai history and culture, which resist comparing the country to its once-colonized Asian neighbours, this book's contributors highlight the value of postcolonial analysis in understanding the complexly ambiguous, interstitial, liminal and hybrid character of Thai/Western cultural interrelationships. At the same time, by pointing to the distinctive position of semicolonial societies in the Western-dominated world order, the chapters in this book make significant contributions to developing the critical theoretical perspectives of international cultural studies. The contributors demonstrate how the disciplines of history, anthropology, political science, film and cultural studies all enhance these contestations in intersecting ways, and across different historical moments. Each of the chapters raises manifold themes and questions regarding the nature of intercultural exchange, interrogated through theoretically critical lenses. This book directs its discussions at those studying not only in the fields of Thai and Southeast Asian studies but also in colonial and postcolonial studies, Asian cultural studies, film studies and comparative critical theory.<br>

  Abstract: Points of Departureencourages a return to empirical research about writing, presenting a wealth of transparent, reproducible studies of student sources. The volume shows how to develop methods for coding and characterizing student texts, their choice of source material, and the resources used to teach information literacy. In so doing, the volume advances our understanding of how students actually write.The contributors offer methodologies, techniques, and suggestions for research that move beyond decontextualized guides to grapple with the messiness of research-in-process, as well as design, development, and expansion. Serviss and Jamieson's model of RAD writing studies research is transcontextual and based on hybridized or mixed methods. Among these methods are citation context analysis, research-aloud protocols, textual and genre analysis, surveys, interviews, and focus groups, with an emphasis on process and knowledge as contingent. Chapters report on research projects at different stages and across institution types-from pilot to multi-site, from community college to research university-focusing on the methods and artifacts employed.A rich mosaic of research about research,Points of Departureadvances knowledge about student writing and serves as a guide for both new and experienced researchers in writing studies.Contributors: Crystal Benedicks, Katt Blackwell-Starnes, Lee-Ann Kastman Breuch, Kristi Murray Costello, Anne Diekema, Rebecca Moore Howard, Sandra Jamieson, Elizabeth Kleinfeld, Brian N.

  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oukaderova Lida<br>
  Abstract: Following Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, the Soviet Union experienced a dramatic resurgence in cinematic production. The period of the Soviet Thaw became known for its relative political and cultural liberalization; its films, formally innovative and socially engaged, were swept to the center of international cinematic discourse. In The Cinema of the Soviet Thaw, Lida Oukaderova provides an in-depth analysis of several Soviet films made between 1958 and 1967 to argue for the centrality of space-as both filmic trope and social concern-to Thaw-era cinema. Opening with a discussion of the USSR's little-examined late-fifties embrace of panoramic cinema, the book pursues close readings of films by Mikhail Kalatozov, Georgii Danelia, Larisa Shepitko and Kira Muratova, among others. It demonstrates that these directors' works were motivated by an urge to interrogate and reanimate spatial experience, and through this project to probe critical issues of ideology, social progress, and subjectivity within post-Stalinist culture.<br>

  Book Title: In Praise of Heteronomy-Making Room for Revelation<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
  Abstract: Recognizing the essential heteronomy of postmodern philosophy of religion, Merold Westphal argues against the assumption that human reason is universal, neutral, and devoid of presupposition. Instead, Westphal contends that any philosophy is a matter of faith and the philosophical encounter with theology arises from the very act of thinking. Relying on the work of Spinoza, Kant, and Hegel, Westphal discovers that their theologies render them mutually incompatible and their claims to be the voice of autonomous and universal reason look dubious. Westphal grapples with this plural nature of human thought in the philosophy of religion and he forwards the idea that any appeal to the divine must rest on a historical and phenomenological analysis.<br>

My paper, “Times of the Signs: Modalities of History and Levels of Social Structure in Belau” (Parmentier 1985b), tried to synthesize Fernand Braudel, Meyer Fortes, and Marshall Sahlins by using Charles S. Peirce’s sign theory to argue that<br>

  Abstract: The spectrum of narrative phases discussed in the previous chapter is essentially an extension of the narrative level of analysis outlined in chapter 4. As a result, it is—like the narrative level itself—a deductive taxonomy determined by the general principles of musical narrative and superimposed upon the musical domain. Narrative phases thus enable a greater degree of interpretive subtlety: with expansion of the four basic archetypes according to secondary criteria that vary by degree (instead of by kind), more precise comparisons can be made within the larger categorical frames.<br>

  Abstract: With the hermeneutical demonstration that our never other than life worldly situated self-understanding is always already historical at the origin of its self-worldly significance, the factual analysis of Heidegger’s early work comes to an end, in that for one thing, it makes explicit the point of departure of phenomenological hermeneutics of factical historical life in the wealth of its structures. For another, beyond the fact of placing the starting point in life, the central question of his early work illuminates at the same time how “factical life-experience belongs in a wholly originary sense to the problematic of philosophy,”¹ in that<br>

  Abstract: An analysis of print and televised media in France is key to understanding dominant representations of the figure of the “Arab” in France today. The term is used inconsistently, grounded as it is in a series of confused ideas and ambivalent attitudes surrounding a range of often interchangeable symbolic categories that include
                     immigrant,foreigner,Muslim,Islamist,banlieue youth, andterrorist. In order to grasp the function and functioning of this semantic fog, one must look more carefully at how the “Arab” has been constructed (and reformulated through various discursive practices), beginning in the 1980s.<br>

  Abstract: This book is the follow-up to Thierry Groensteen's ground-breaking
         The System of Comics, in which the leading French-language comics theorist set out to investigate how the medium functions, introducing the principle of iconic solidarity, and showing the systems that underlie the articulation between panels at three levels: page layout, linear sequence, and nonsequential links woven through the comic book as a whole. He now develops that analysis further, using examples from a very wide range of comics, including the work of American artists such as Chris Ware and Robert Crumb. He tests out his theoretical framework by bringing it up against cases that challenge it, such as abstract comics, digital comics and sh?jo manga, and offers insightful reflections on these innovations.<br>

  Book Title: The Signifying Self-Cervantine Drama as Counter-Perspective Aesthetic<br>
  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Henry Melanie<br>
  Abstract: The Signifying Self: Cervantine Drama as Counter-Perspective Aesthetic offers a comprehensive analysis of all eight of Cervantes's Ocho comedias (published 1615), moving beyond conventional anti-Lope approaches to Cervantine dramatic practise in order to identify what, indeed, his theatre promotes. Considered on its own aesthetic terms, but also taking into account ontological and socio-cultural concerns, this study compels a re-assessment of Cervantes's drama and conflates any monolithic interpretations which do not allow for the textual interplay of contradictory and conflicting discourses which inform it. Cervantes's complex and polyvalent representation of freedom underpins such an approach; a concept which is considered to be a leitmotif of Cervantes's work but which has received scant attention with regards to his theatre. Investigation of this topic reveals not only Cervantes's rejection of established theatrical convention, but his preoccupation with the difficult relationship between the individual and the early modern Spanish world. Cervantes's comedias emerge as a counter-perspective to dominant contemporary Spanish ideologies and more orthodox artistic imaginings. Ultimately, The Signifying Self seeks to recuperate the Ocho comedias as a significant part of the Cervantine, and Golden-Age, canon and will be of interest and benefit to those scholars who work on Cervantes and indeed on early modern Spanish theatre in general.<br>

Despite the fact that the dramatist’s writings for the stage clearly flout conventional Lopean parameters, it is not indicative of a theatre which is deficient or inferior. Rather, Cervantes constructs an aesthetic which permits free expression of seditious voices and an alternative stage for those discourses normally quashed by prevailing dramatic monopoly. It is precisely because of the restrictive nature of seventeenth-century Spanish theatre that Cervantes advocates a strategy of authorial liberty. For instance, in<br>

  Book Title: Blood in the Sand-Imperial Fantasies, Right-Wing Ambitions, and the Erosion of American Democracy<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Bronner Stephen Eric<br>
  Abstract: Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, clouds of ash blackened the skies over New York City, Washington, D.C., and rural Pennsylvania. In the wake of the destruction, the United States seemingly entered a new era marked by radical changes in the nation's discourse and in the policies of the Bush administration. With the toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the invasion of Iraq, and saber rattling elsewhere, America's global war on terror began to take shape. Lofty rhetoric about expanding democracy and defending freedom filled the halls of elite power and dominated mainstream media coverage of American politics. Blood in the Sand offers both an incisive analysis and a confrontational critique of America's recent international pursuits and its dominant political culture. Stephen Eric Bronner challenges the notion that everything changed in the aftermath of 9/11. He shows instead how a criminal act served to legitimize political manipulation and invigorate traditional nationalistic enthusiasms for militarism and imperial expansion. Employing his own experiences in the Middle East, Bronner acknowledges -- but refuses to overstate -- recent progressive developments in the region. He criticizes the neo-conservative penchant for unilateral military aggression and debunks the dubious notion of fostering democracy at gunpoint. While Bronner analyzes authoritarian repression, human rights violations, shrinking civil liberties, and severe socioeconomic inequalities, Blood in the Sand is neither a narrow political diatribe nor a futile exercise in anti-American negativism. The author honors America by condemning the betrayal of the nation's finest ideals by so many of those who, hypocritically or naively, invoke those ideals the most. Bronner sheds new light on those who insist on publicly waving the flag while privately subverting that for which it stands. Blood in the Sand sounds a clarion call for revitalizing the American polity and reshaping foreign policy along ~<br>

  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nylund Anastasia<br>
  Abstract: Narratives are fundamental to our lives: we dream, plan, complain, endorse, entertain, teach, learn, and reminisce through telling stories. They provide hopes, enhance or mitigate disappointments, challenge or support moral order and test out theories of the world at both personal and communal levels. It is because of this deep embedding of narrative in everyday life that its study has become a wide research field including disciplines as diverse as linguistics, literary theory, folklore, clinical psychology, cognitive and developmental psychology, anthropology, sociology, and history. In
      Telling Storiesleading scholars illustrate how narratives build bridges among language, identity, interaction, society, and culture; and they investigate various settings such as therapeutic and medical encounters, educational environments, politics, media, marketing, and public relations. They analyze a variety of topics from the narrative construction of self and identity to the telling of stories in different media and the roles that small and big life stories play in everyday social interactions and institutions. These new reflections on the theory and analysis of narrative offer the latest tools to researchers in the fields of discourse analysis and sociolinguistics.<br>

  Book Title: Overcoming Our Evil-Human Nature and Spiritual Exercises in Xunzi and Augustine<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stalnaker Aaron<br>
  Abstract: Can people ever really change? Do they ever become more ethical, and if so, how?
      Overcoming Our Evilfocuses on the way ethical and religious commitments are conceived and nurtured through the methodical practices that Pierre Hadot has called "spiritual exercises." These practices engage thought, imagination, and sensibility, and have a significant ethical component, yet aim for a broader transformation of the whole personality. Going beyond recent philosophical and historical work that has focused on ancient Greco-Roman philosophy, Stalnaker broadens ethical inquiry into spiritual exercises by examining East Asian as well as classical Christian sources, and taking religious and seemingly "aesthetic" practices such as prayer, ritual, and music more seriously as objects of study. More specifically,Overcoming Our Evilexamines and compares the thought and practice of the early Christian Augustine of Hippo, and the early Confucian Xunzi. Both have sophisticated and insightful accounts of spiritual exercises, and both make such ethical work central to their religious thought and practice. Yet to understand the two thinkers' recommendations for cultivating virtue we must first understand some important differences. Here Stalnaker disentangles the competing aspects of Augustine and Xunxi's ideas of "human nature." His groundbreaking comparison of their ethical vocabularies also drives a substantive analysis of fundamental issues in moral psychology, especially regarding emotion and the complex idea of "the will," to examine how our dispositions to feel, think, and act might be slowly transformed over time.

  Abstract: Bridge concepts aim to provoke accounts of widely separated figures in terms of a common set of topics that highlight particular points of similarity and difference. By creating more precise points of contact, the comparativist can provide the basis for an imaginary dialogue between the two positions thus articulated and thereby pursue more substantive investigations of the general topic the bridge concept specifies. Thus a bridge concept like “human nature” can serve to generate what might be called a

  Abstract: Sin and evil are categories traditional to Catholic theology, even if Lonergan’s analysis of them is his own. Bias, an inauthentic orientation caused by and causal of inauthentic actions, decisions, judgments, ideas, and experiences, is a concept more original to Lonergan. It is both the result of sin and a cause of further sin.¹ As such, bias functions in a way I find similar to Aristotle’s bad habits, or vices.² However, while Aristotle discusses vice as an extreme on either side of a golden mean, Lonergan analyzes bias in terms of conscious intentionality, social dynamics, and history.

  Abstract: Writing in the wake of the furor over her account of the Eichmann trial, Hannah Arendt reflects on why truth and politics are, in her words, “on rather bad terms.”¹ Her analysis rests on dividing truth into two different types. The first type, rational truth, is the subject of mathematics and philosophy. It has a long history of tension with politics, going back at least to Plato, who worried about the displacement of rational truth by mere opinion. In the modern age, Arendt says, opinion has generally won the day, rendering rational truth politically irrelevant.² The second type, factual truth,<br>

  Abstract: The concept of community has become central to constructions of Spanish identities since the transition to democracy. Contemporary Spain is witnessing a political, social, and economic resurgence of community, which both cuts across and is prioritized over nation. Yet few studies of contemporary Spanish culture deal with this concept. This book aims to fill a gap in Spanish cultural studies by providing an in-depth analysis of the intersections of theories, narratives, and concepts of community identities across a broad range of media. Literature, film, music, and photography are analysed here in order to explore the diverse means by which community is imagined and constructed.<br>

  Book Title: The Uncertain Sciences-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mazlish Bruce<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging book one of the most esteemed cultural historians of our time turns his attention to major questions about human experience and the attempts to understand it "scientifically." Bruce Mazlish considers the achievements, failings, and possibilities of the human sciences-a domain that he broadly defines to include the social sciences, literature, psychology, and hermeneutic studies. In a rich and original synthesis built upon the work of earlier philosophers and historians, Mazlish constructs a new view of the nature and meaning of the human sciences.Starting with the remote human past and moving through the Age of Discovery to the present day, the author discusses what sort of knowledge the human sciences claim to offer. He looks closely at the positivistic aspirations of the human sciences, which are modeled after the natural sciences, and at their interpretive tendencies. In an analysis of scientific method and scientific community, he explores the roles they can or should assume in the human sciences. Mazlish's approach is genuinely interdisciplinary, and he draws on an array of topics, from civil society to globalization to the interactions of humans and machines, to inform his thought-provoking discussion of historical consciousness.<br>

  Book Title: Metaphysics in Ordinary Language-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosen Stanley<br>
  Abstract: In this rich collection of philosophical writings, Stanley Rosen addresses a wide range of topics-from eros, poetry, and freedom to problems like negation and the epistemological status of sense perception. Though diverse in subject, Rosen's essays share two unifying principles: there can be no legitimate separation of textual hermeneutics from philosophical analysis, and philosophical investigation must be oriented in terms of everyday language and experience, although it cannot simply remain within these confines. Ordinary experience provides a minimal criterion for the assessment of extraordinary discourses, Rosen argues, and without such a criterion we would have no basis for evaluating conflicting discourses: philosophy would give way to poetry.Philosophical problems are not so deeply embedded in a specific historical context that they cannot be restated in terms as valid for us today as they were for those who formulated them, the author maintains. Rosen shows that the history of philosophy-a story of conflicting interpretations of human life and the structure of intelligibility-is a story that comes to life only when it is rethought in terms of the philosophical problems of our own personal and historical situation.<br>

  Abstract: The semiotic study of a literary text is not wholly unlike traditional interpretation or rhetorical analysis, nor is it meant to replace these other modes of response to literary works. But the semiotic critic situates the text somewhat differently, privileges different dimensions of the text, and uses a critical methodology adpated to the semiotic enterprise. Most interpretive methods privilege the “meaning” of the text. Hermeneutic critics seek authorial or intentional meaning; the New Critics seek the ambiguities of “textual” meaning; the “reader response” critics allow readers to make meaning. With respect to meaning the semiotic critic is situated differently. Such<br>

  Author(s): WALDRON SHERWOOD<br>
  Abstract: This important book is a thorough survey of every major study of the efficacy of psychoanalytic treatment. The authors-all well-known psychoanalysts-critically analyze the studies and their findings, discuss the issues that have been and should be explored in such studies, and examine the problems in conducting research into psychoanalytic outcomes. The authors begin by providing a definition of psychoanalysis, establishing central psychoanalytic goals, and determining what questions need to be addressed in assessing whether analysis is effective. They then describe their methods and criteria for evaluating modern research on psychoanalytic outcome and apply these criteria to four major studies of adult psychoanalytic patients, several studies of child and adolescent analysis, and some small-group studies. They find that all the studies show that psychoanalysis is an effective treatment for many patients-and that some cherished assumptions about psychoanalysis are probably wrong. In the final part of the book, the authors address the challenges of collecting empirical data on psychoanalysis and explore the possibilities inherent in the single-case study.<br>

  Book Title: Shattered Voices-Language, Violence, and the Work of Truth Commissions<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Phelps Teresa Godwin<br>
  Abstract: Following periods of mass atrocity and oppression, states are faced with a question of critical importance in the transition to democracy: how to offer redress to victims of the old regime without perpetuating cycles of revenge. Traditionally, balance has been restored through arrests, trials, and punishment, but in the last three decades, more than twenty countries have opted to have a truth commission investigate the crimes of the prior regime and publish a report about the investigation, often incorporating accounts from victims. Although many praise the work of truth commissions for empowering and healing through words rather than violence, some condemn the practice as a poor substitute for traditional justice, achieved through trials and punishment. There has been until now little analysis of the unarticulated claim that underlies the truth commissions' very existence: that language-in this case narrative stories-can substitute for violence. Acknowledging revenge as a real and deep human need,
      Shattered Voicesexplores the benefits and problems inherent when a fragile country seeks to heal its victims without risking its own future. In developing a theory about the role of language in retribution, Teresa Godwin Phelps takes an interdisciplinary approach, delving into sources from Greek tragedy toHamlet, from Kant to contemporary theories about retribution, from the Babylonian law codes to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Report. She argues that, given the historical and psychological evidence about revenge, starting afresh by drawing a bright line between past crimes and a new government is both unrealistic and unwise. When grievous harm happens, a rebalancing is bound to occur, whether it is orderly and lawful or disorderly and unlawful.Shattered Voicescontends that language is requisite to any adequate balancing, and that a solution is viable only if it provides an atmosphere in which storytelling and subsequent dialogue can flourish.

  Abstract: The novels of Paul Auster-finely wrought, self-reflexive, filled with doublings, coincidences, and mysteries-have captured the imagination of readers and the admiration of many critics of contemporary literature. In
      Beyond the Red Notebook, the first book devoted to the works of Auster, Dennis Barone has assembled an international group of scholars who present twelve essays that provide a rich and insightful examination of Auster's writings. The authors explore connections between Auster's poetry and fiction, the philosophical underpinnings of his writing, its relation to detective fiction, and its unique embodiment of the postmodern sublime. Their essays provide the fullest analysis available of Auster's themes of solitude, chance, and paternity found in works such asThe Invention of Solitude,City of Glass,Ghosts,The Locked Room,In the Country of Last Things,Moon Palace,The Music of Chance, andLeviathan. This volume includes contributions from Pascal Bruckner, Marc Chenetier, Norman Finkelstein, Derek Rubin, Madeleine Sorapure, Stephen Bernstein, Tim Woods, Steven Weisenburger, Arthur Saltzman, Eric Wirth, and Motoyuki Shibata.

  Author(s): LEMARCHAND RENÉ<br>
  Abstract: Endowed with natural resources, majestic bodies of fresh water, and a relatively mild climate, the Great Lakes region of Central Africa has also been the site of some of the world's bloodiest atrocities. In Rwanda, Burundi, and the Congo-Kinshasa, decades of colonial subjugation-most infamously under Belgium's Leopold II-were followed by decades of civil warfare that spilled into neighboring countries. When these conflicts lead to horrors such as the 1994 Rwandan genocide, ethnic difference and postcolonial legacies are commonly blamed, but, with so much at stake, such simple explanations cannot take the place of detailed, dispassionate analysis.
      The Dynamics of Violence in Central Africaprovides a thorough exploration of the contemporary crises in the region. By focusing on the historical and social forces behind the cycles of bloodshed in Rwanda, Burundi, and the Congo-Kinshasa, René Lemarchand challenges much of the conventional wisdom about the roots of civil strife in former Belgian Africa. He offers telling insights into the appalling cycle of genocidal violence, ethnic strife, and civil war that has made the Great Lakes region of Central Africa the most violent on the continent, and he sheds new light on the dynamics of conflict in the region. Building on a full career of scholarship and fieldwork, Lemarchand's analysis breaks new ground in our understanding of the complex historical forces that continue to shape the destinies of one of Africa's most important regions.<br>

While numerous texts of the first and second centuries were making exactly this move (as evidenced by our analysis thus far), this was not the only conceptual option available to Christians as they thought about their identity and what its legitimate relationship ought to be to the rhetoric of alienation.

If the analysis of these extremely popular, very big budget entertainment films, produced in the heart of new intermediality, can be based mainly on questions of intertextuality,¹ it can also, far from any definitive definition, be fuelled by a rich and complex network of notions which carries along in its modern rush the term of attraction.<br>

He weaves discussions of work by Keats, Dickinson, and Whitman with quotes from three-thousand-year-old Egyptian poems, Inuit songs, and Japanese love poems to show that writing personal lyric has helped poets throughout history to process emotional and experiential turmoil, from individual stress to collective grief. More specifically, he considers how the acts of writing, reading, and listening to lyric bring ordering powers to the chaos that surrounds us. Moving into more contemporary work, Orr looks at the poetry of Sylvia Plath, Stanley Kunitz, and Theodore Roethke, poets who relied on their own work to get through painful psychological experiences. As a poet who has experienced considerable trauma--especially as a child--Orr refers to the damaging experiences of his past and to the role poetry played in his ability to recover and survive. His personal narrative makes all the more poignant and vivid Orr's claims for lyric poetry's power as a tool for healing. Poetry as Survival is a memorable and inspiring introduction to lyric poetry's capacity to help us find safety and comfort in a threatening world.<br>

  Book Title: The Bioregional Imagination-Literature, Ecology, and Place<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): ZEITLER EZRA<br>
  Abstract: Bioregionalism is an innovative way of thinking about place and planet from an ecological perspective. Although bioregional ideas occur regularly in ecocritical writing, until now no systematic effort has been made to outline the principles of bioregional literary criticism and to use it as a way to read, write, understand, and teach literature. The twenty-four original essays here are written by an outstanding selection of international scholars. The range of bioregions covered is global and includes such diverse places as British Columbia's Meldrum Creek and Italy's Po River Valley, the Arctic and the Outback. There are even forays into cyberspace and outer space. In their comprehensive introduction, the editors map the terrain of the bioregional movement, including its history and potential to inspire and invigorate place-based and environmental literary criticism. Responding to bioregional tenets, this volume is divided into four sections. The essays in the "Reinhabiting" section narrate experiments in living-in-place and restoring damaged environments. The "Rereading" essays practice bioregional literary criticism, both by examining texts with strong ties to bioregional paradigms and by opening other, less-obvious texts to bioregional analysis. In "Reimagining," the essays push bioregionalism to evolve-by expanding its corpus of texts, coupling its perspectives with other approaches, or challenging its core constructs. Essays in the "Renewal" section address bioregional pedagogy, beginning with local habitat studies and concluding with musings about the Internet. In response to the environmental crisis, we must reimagine our relationship to the places we inhabit. This volume shows how literature and literary studies are fundamental tools to such a reimagining.<br>

  Abstract: The history of the southern Colorado coalfields is a complex one involving social interactions among established residents, Anglo-Americans, Hispanos, African Americans, Asians, and newly arriving immigrants from Europe and Mexico. By studying the material culture of immigrants and “in-between peoples,” we can begin to examine their experiences in America and the cultural negotiations that occurred in their lives. The negotiation of culture through the use of the objects of daily life is of interest in this study. Analysis of the use of objects in “facilitating judgment, classification, and self-expression” provides insight into the construction of an individual’s cultural identity (Beaudry,<br>

  Book Title: Seasons of Misery-Catastrophe and Colonial Settlement in Early America<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DONEGAN KATHLEEN<br>
  Abstract: The stories we tell of American beginnings typically emphasize colonial triumph in the face of adversity. But the early years of English settlement in America were characterized by catastrophe: starvation, disease, extreme violence, ruinous ignorance, and serial abandonment.
      Seasons of Miseryoffers a provocative reexamination of the British colonies' chaotic and profoundly unstable early days, placing crisis-both experiential and existential-at the center of the story. At the outposts of a fledgling empire and disconnected from the social order of their home society, English settlers were both physically and psychologically estranged from their European identities. They could not control, or often even survive, the world they had intended to possess. According to Kathleen Donegan, it was in this cauldron of uncertainty that colonial identity was formed. Studying the English settlements at Roanoke, Jamestown, Plymouth, and Barbados, Donegan argues that catastrophe marked the threshold between an old European identity and a new colonial identity, a state of instability in which only fragments of Englishness could survive amid the upheavals of the New World. This constant state of crisis also produced the first distinctively colonial literature as settlers attempted to process events that they could neither fully absorb nor understand. Bringing a critical eye to settlers' first-person accounts, Donegan applies a unique combination of narrative history and literary analysis to trace how settlers used a language of catastrophe to describe unprecedented circumstances, witness unrecognizable selves, and report unaccountable events.Seasons of Miseryaddresses both the stories that colonists told about themselves and the stories that we have constructed in hindsight about them. In doing so, it offers a new account of the meaning of settlement history and the creation of colonial identity.<br>

  Abstract: Traditionally, metaphysics searches for essences, but the post-metaphysical quest leans more toward potentials. Martin Heidegger puts it this way: “Higher than actuality lies
                  possibility.” Metaphysics as a branch of philosophy studies the nature of being and beings, existence, time, space, movement, and causality. It also involves underlying principles and theories that form the basis of a particular field of knowledge. Heidegger conceived the primary task of metaphysics as the clarification ofbeingin his book on phenomenological metaphysics,Being and Time. In the analysis of being, he holds that phenomenology and ontology characterize philosophy itself, and that we can best<br>

  Book Title: A Counter-History of Composition-Toward Methodologies of Complexity<br>

  Author(s): HAWK BYRON<br>
  Abstract: A Counter-History of Compositioncontests the foundational disciplinary assumption that vitalism and contemporary rhetoric represent opposing, disconnected poles in the writing tradition. Vitalism has been historically linked to expressivism and concurrently dismissed as innate, intuitive, and unteachable, whereas rhetoric is seen as a rational, teachable method for producing argumentative texts. Counter to this, Byron Hawk identifies vitalism as the ground for producing rhetorical texts-the product of complex material relations rather than the product of chance. Through insightful historical analysis ranging from classical Greek rhetoric to contemporary complexity theory, Hawk defines three forms of vitalism (oppositional, investigative, and complex) and argues for their application in the environments where students write and think today.<br>

                  querelleconcerned the seemingly arcane issue of metaphoric reference. As we have seen, Paul Ricoeur argues convincingly inLa Métaphore vivethat metaphor is a cognitive tool, that it helps in certain circumstances to articulate our experience of the world. Ricoeur’s analysis is anchored to the established phenomenological precepts of Kant and Husserl, for in order that metaphor may refer, its transgressive character must ultimately be tamed by the master discourse of philosophy. However, according to Jacques Derrida’s deconstructive practice, the philosopher’s discourse is itself shot through with metaphor. It<br>

  Book Title: Spanish Spaces-Landscape, Space and Place in Contemporary Spanish Culture<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): DAVIES ANN<br>
  Abstract: Spanish Spaces is a pioneering study that marries contemporary cultural geography with contemporary Spanish culture. The field of cultural geography has grown both extensively and rapidly, as has the field of cultural analysis and debate on Spanish cultural texts; yet despite a convergence in study between cultural geography (and cultural studies more widely) and cultural texts themselves, this has made little impact to date within the area of contemporary Spanish cultural studies. Yet Spain’s varied terrain, with complex negotiations between rural, urban and coastal (negotiations that have on occasion spilled over into political and violent conflict), and perhaps its very lack of a contemporary landscape tradition familiar to British and German cultural studies, offer the opportunity for fresh insights into questions of landscape, space and place. Drawing on case studies from contemporary Spanish film and literature, Davies explores the themes of memory and forgetting, nationalism and terrorism, crime and detection, gender, tourism and immigration, investigating what it means to think of space and places in specifically Spanish terms.<br>

  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): DUFFY JEAN H.<br>
  Abstract: Thresholds of Meaning examines contemporary French narrative and explores two related issues: the centrality within recent French fiction and autofiction of the themes of passage, ritual and liminality; and the thematic continuity which links this work with its literary ancestors of the 1960s and 1970s. Through the close analysis of novels and récits by Pierre Bergounioux, François Bon, Marie Darrieussecq, Hélène Lenoir, Laurent Mauvignier and Jean Rouaud, Duffy demonstrates the ways in which contemporary narrative, while capitalising on the formal lessons of the nouveau roman and drawing upon a shared repertoire of motifs and themes, engages with the complex processes by which meaning is produced in the referential world and, in particular, with the rituals and codes that social man brings into play in order to negotiate the various stages of the human life-cycle. By the application of concepts and models derived from ritual theory and from visual analysis, Thresholds of Meaning situates itself at the intersection of the developing field of literature and anthropology studies and research into word and image.<br>

This historical narrative arises from detailed rhetorical analysis of the themes and poetics that make up literary images of science. It finds its inspiration in the intellectual preoccupations of the period it encompasses. The irony implicit in a study of multifarious images is that its own imaging of real processes in nineteenth-and twentieth-century Spanish culture remains unavoidably incomplete.

The brightness not only diffused along the route of the Forty Scenes (Sishi jing) but also was composed by each scene.

To answer the question, a historical analysis of the concept of

My contextual and empirical work with audiences is crucial to the conclusion that much of the political power of sentimental postmodernism can be found in the intense identifications that it fosters both within and across sexual identities, genders, and ethnicities. Much of the current critical work about identification has been produced by textual scholars writing from psychoanalytic perspectives.

  Book Title: The Subject in Crisis in Contemporary Chinese Literature-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Cai Rong<br>
  Abstract: Post-Mao China produced two parallel discourses on the human subject in the New Era (1976–1989). One was an autonomous, Enlightenment humanist self aimed at replacing the revolutionary paragon that had dominated under Mao. The other was a more problematic subject suffering from either a symbolic physical deformity or some kind of spiritual paralysis that undermines its apparent normalcy. How do we explain the stubborn presence, in the literature of the 1980s and 1990s, of this crippled agent who fails to realize the humanist autonomy envisioned by post-Mao theorists? What are the anxieties and tensions embedded in this incongruity and what do they reveal? This illuminating and original critical study of the crippled subject in post-Mao literature offers a detailed textual analysis of the work of five well-known contemporary writers: Han Shaogong, Can Xue, Yu Hua, Mo Yan, and Jia Pingwa. The author investigates not only the literary characters within the texts, but also their creators—real subjects in history, Chinese writers whose own agency was being tested and established in the search for a new subjectivity. She argues that, reenacting the Maoist legacy, the literary search failed to provide a viable model for a postrevolutionary China. In addition, the deficiency and inadequacy of the subject cannot always be contained in the Communist past—a history to be transcended in the design of modernity after Mao. The representation of the problematic subject thus punctured post-Mao optimism and foreshadowed the eventual abandonment of the move to rethink subjectivity in the 1990s. By diving beneath the euphoria of the 1980s and the confusion and frustration of the 1990s, these critical readings offer a unique perspective with which to gauge the complexity of China’s quest for modernity and a fuller understanding of the self’s multifaceted experience in the post-Mao era.<br>

  Book Title: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains-Culture and Society in the Highlands of Bali<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Reuter Thomas A.<br>
  Abstract: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains is the first comprehensive ethnography of the Bali Aga, a large ethnic minority that occupies the island's central highlands. The Bali Aga are popularly viewed as the indigenous counterparts to other Balinese who trace their origin to invaders from the Javanese kingdom of Majapait, who have ruled Bali from the fourteenth century A.D. Although Bali remains one of the most intensely researched localities in the world, the Bali Aga have long been overshadowed by the more exotic courtly culture of the south. A closer analysis of the changing position of the Bali Aga within Balinese society provides a key to understanding the politics and social process of cultural representation in Bali and beyond. The process is marked by a blend of representational competition and cooperation among the Bali Aga themselves, among the Bali Aga and southern Balinese, and later among the island's aristocratic elites and foreign colonizers or scholars, and state authorities. The study of this process raises important issues about the establishment and maintenance of status and power structures at regional, national, and global levels. Custodians of the Sacred Mountains explores the marginalization of the Bali Aga in light of a critical theory of cultural representation and calls for a morally engaged approach to ethnographic research. It proposes an intersubjective and communicative model of human interaction as the foundation for understanding the relative significance of cooperation and competition in the cultural production of knowledge.<br>

  Abstract: Traces of a Streamoffers a unique scholarly perspective that merges interests in rhetorical and literacy studies, United States social and political theory, and African American women writers. Focusing on elite nineteenth-century African American women who formed a new class of women well positioned to use language with consequence, Royster uses interdisciplinary perspectives (literature, history, feminist studies, African American studies, psychology, art, sociology, economics) to present a well-textured rhetorical analysis of the literate practices of these women. With a shift in educational opportunity after the Civil War, African American women gained access to higher education and received formal training in rhetoric and writing. By the end of the nineteenth-century, significant numbers of African American women operated actively in many public arenas.<br>

Despite these barriers, Legras reveals a handful of contemporary authors who have attempted in earnest to present marginalized voices to the Western world. His deep and insightful analysis of key works by novelists Juan José Saer

What emerges is an intricate discussion of the clash and subjugation of cultures and the tragedy of a lost worldview.<br>

  Abstract: The act of interpretation occurs in nearly every area of the arts and sciences. That ubiquity serves as the inspiration for the fourteen essays of this volume, covering many of the domains in which interpretive practices are found. Individual topics include: the general nature of interpretation and its forms; comparing and contrasting interpretation and hermeneutics; culture as interpretation seen through Hegel's aesthetics; interpreting philosophical texts; methodologies for interpreting human action; interpretation in medical practice focusing on manifestations as indicators of disease; the brain and its interpretative, structured, learning and storage processes; interpreting hybrid wines and cognitive preconceptions of novel objects; and the importance of sensory perception as means of interpreting in the case of dry German Rieslings.In an interesting turn, Nicholas Rescher writes on the interpretation of philosophical texts.

  Abstract: Given its affinity with questions of identity, autobiography offers a way into the interior space between author and reader, especially when writers define themselves in terms of religion. In his exploration of this "textual intimacy," Wesley Kort begins with a theorization of what it means to say who one is and how one's self-account as a religious person stands in relation to other forms of self-identification. He then provides a critical analysis of autobiographical texts by nine contemporary American writers-including Maya Angelou, Philip Roth, and Anne Lamott-who give religion a positive place in their accounts of who they are. Finally, in disclosing his own religious identity, Kort concludes with a meditation on several meanings of the word

  Abstract: Although among the categories informing the study of politics there are few as fundamental as those demarcating theory and practice, that distinction is highly problematic when applied to the analysis of ideologies. Many traditional as well as current approaches regard political thought as the area in which issues of moral philosophy pertaining to political entities are aired, with the objective of setting defining ethical and validating criteria that are then to be applied to political practice. A grounding of this view may be found in Kant, for whom individuals were subjected to clear and unequivocal moral duties and were

  Abstract: Mimesis is one of the oldest, most fundamental concepts in Western aesthetics. This book offers a new, searching treatment of its long history at the center of theories of representational art: above all, in the highly influential writings of Plato and Aristotle, but also in later Greco-Roman philosophy and criticism, and subsequently in many areas of aesthetic controversy from the Renaissance to the twentieth century. Combining classical scholarship, philosophical analysis, and the history of ideas--and ranging across discussion of poetry, painting, and music--Stephen Halliwell shows with a wealth of detail how mimesis, at all stages of its evolution, has been a more complex, variable concept than its conventional translation of "imitation" can now convey.<br>

Thus, music is meaningful in that it signifies cultural temporalities and themes, from the traditional manly heroism of the hunt to military power to postmodern "polyvocality."<br>

These dreams, with the background and analysis he provides, are absorbing in themselves and partially linked up as autobiography.

  Abstract: I am in substantial agreement with the analysis in John Finnisʹs chapter. Indeed, it is as good a short statement of just war theory within the Catholic natural law tradition as I know of. Given this, I think the most useful contributions I can make are to underline certain points that seem to me to be important, to develop some of the distinctions Finnis makes, and to draw out some of the implications of his analysis. I will also say something more than Finnis does about conscientious objection and the duty of citizens to support their nationʹs war efforts.<br>

  Author(s) Bouchard Gérard<br>
  Abstract: By drawing primarily on historiographical scholarship in Quebec, I intend to present some views on the role of comparison as a process of objectification in building historical knowledge. In very general terms, comparison refers here to any scientific approach which consists in: (1) relating two or several objects of analysis belonging to as many collective settings and (2) foregrounding differences and similarities so as to increase knowledge either of one or of each of these objects. I return to this later. My ideas are intended as a vindication of comparative history; there are, however, several ways to broach the argument.<br>

  Abstract: In recent years there has been a growth of interest, among those concerned with discourse analysis, in narrative. As Seymour Chatman some time ago observed, “[t]he study of narrative has become so popular that the French have honored it with a term —
                     la narratologie.”²But this interest is not limited to professional students of discourse: it seems to have become trendy for intellectuals of diverse types to interlard their discourse with the word “story” — as if to suggest that everything is narrative.³<br>

  Book Title: Russian Experimental Fiction-Resisting Ideology after Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clowes Edith W.<br>
  Abstract: Not advocating its own utopian alternative to current social realities, meta-utopian fiction investigates the function of a deep human impulse to imagine, project, and enforce alternative social orders. Clowes examines the technical innovations meta-utopian writers have made in style, image, and narrative structure that inform fresh modes of social imagination. Her analysis leads to an inquiry into the intended and real audiences of this fiction, and into the ways its authors try to move them toward more sophisticated social discourse.<br>

  Abstract: In recent controversies on evolution one frequently finds references to “Darwin’s theory of evolution”, as though it were a unitary entity.

But quite aside from the fact that it helps understanding of the structure of evolutionary theory, to carry the analysis to the level of the subtheories Darwin adopted, it is important to call attention to the composite nature of the Darwinian theory for three very<br>

  Abstract: In order to avoid the kind of frivolity that holds ethical concerns to be irrelevant in a discussion of the reader in (of) texts, it may be wise to revisit briefly the Russian critical tradition. This tradition has entertained with high seriousness the notion—somewhat disreputable in the West—that literature, and particularly fiction, must be held accountable, since it encodes messages which affect not only the subjective world view of readers, but their attitudes and actions. Novels are presumed capable of endangering (or reinforcing) the structure of society and the legal order.¹ Rufus Mathewson’s analysis of Russian radical poetics<br>

Even in countries where this growth was not very successful, as in Italy and Germany, people acted as if it were. Machiavelli’s penetrating analysis of power in action is based on what he saw of Medici control in Florence, even though the Medicis ruled only a small territory and Italy would not become a unified nation for another four centuries. Machiavelli’s realism contrasts with the cultivated neo-Platonic idealism of the Medici court, but both are direct reflections of an emerging political model that emulated<br>

Elegance, defined as the symbiosis of excellence and magnificence, is the ultimate attribute of any creative endeavour and achieving it is the architect's prime motivation. Using this concept, Lincourt develops a set of archetypes for designing a more satisfactory architecture and provides an in-depth analysis of three examples of architectural elegance: the Palais-Royal and the Fondation Rothchild Workers' Residence in Paris and the Municipality of Outremont in Montreal.<br>

  Abstract: In architecture, as in other problem-solving procedures, analysis always starts with observation. The architect observes the world and scrutinizes his own design activities within it. It does not take long for him to realize that the prime problem of architecture is how to fulfil a client’s needs properly. Every contract he obtains, every mandate he assumes, every proposal he makes, every design he creates, is an attempt to meet one or several of such human habitation needs. As a rule, the architect strives to solve the prescribed problem to the best of his ability.<br>

  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Nesteruk Alexei V.<br>
  Abstract: The Sense of the Universe deals with existential and phenomenological reflection upon modern cosmology with the aim to reveal hidden theological commitments in cosmology related to the mystery of human existence. The book proposes a new approach to the dialogue between science and theology based in a thorough philosophical analysis of acting forms of subjectivity involved in the study of the world and in religious experience. The uniqueness of this book is that it uses recent advances in phenomenological philosophy and philosophical theology in order to accentuate the existential meaning of cosmology as the discourse that ultimately explicates the human condition. The objective of the book is not to make a comparative analysis of the cosmological scientific narrative and that of the Bible, or the Fathers of the Church (in what concerns the structure of the universe), but to reveal the presence of a hidden theological dimension in cosmology originating in the God-given ability of humanity to discern and disclose the sense of creation. The book contributes to the synthesis of appropriation and incorporation of modern philosophical ideas in Christian theology, in particular its Eastern Orthodox form.<br>

  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>

  Abstract: This volume contends against a major lacuna in the story of eschatology in the twentieth century by offering a historical and comparative analysis of Edward Schillebeeckx’s prophetic eschatology and Johann Baptist Metz’s apocalyptic eschatology with the goal of identifying relative advantages and limitations of these divergent eschatological frameworks for rendering a Christian account of hope that prompts action in the public arena. Rodenborn provides a fresh angle on eschatologies of hope, bringing to the fore two Catholic theologians whose influences range from Vatican II to Latin American liberation theology. Hope in Action offers an innovative contribution to the theological account of the emergence of European political theologies and the role of eschatology as a practical and destabilizing theological category.<br>

  Abstract: In chapter 1, we saw that Metz’s eschatological project developed out of his theological analysis of the modern process of secularization, was unduly limited by his transcendental-linear theology of history, and gradually emerged as a practical-critical hope for the future. Now, turning to Edward Schillebeeckx’s efforts to address the apologetic consequences of secularization during the late 1950s through the mid-1960s, we will trace similar developments that unfold over significantly different terrain; Schillebeeckx offered a distinctive response to the same historical challenges, yet during this period the doctrine of eschatology also would move to the center of his theological project.<br>

  Book Title: Postmodernity and Univocity-A Critical Account of Radical Orthodoxy and John Duns Scotus<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Horan Daniel P.<br>
  Abstract: Nearly twenty-five years ago, John Milbank inaugurated Radical Orthodoxy, one of the most significant and influential theological movements of the last two decades. In Milbank’s Theology and Social Theory, he constructed a sweeping theological genealogy of the origins of modernity and the emergence of the secular, counterposed by a robust retrieval of traditional orthodoxy as the critical philosophical and theological mode of being in the postmodern world. That genealogy turns upon a critical point—the work of John Duns Scotus as the starting point of modernity and progenitor of a raft of philosophical and theological ills that have prevailed since. Milbank’s account has been disseminated proliferously through Radical Orthodoxy and even beyond and is largely uncontested in contemporary theology. The present volume conducts a comprehensive examination and critical analysis of Radical Orthodoxy’s use and interpretation of John Duns Scotus. Daniel P. Horan, OFM, offers a substantial challenge to the narrative of Radical Orthodoxy’s idiosyncratic take on Scotus and his role in ushering in the philosophical age of the modern. This volume not only corrects the received account of Scotus but opens a constructive way forward toward a positive assessment and appropriation of Scotus’s work for contemporary theology.<br>

Together with the story line, contextual factors such as the speaker, the audience, and the exigency determine the function of a parable. The argumentative structure is just as important. This chapter presents a comprehensive unplugged analysis of every Lukan parable told by Jesus, focusing on these issues.<br>

  Church as Both System and Institutional Entity? from:

  Abstract: It might initially seem strange to link analysis of the possibility of miracles, that is, special divine interventions into the workings of the natural order, with the longstanding philosophical problem of evil in a book dedicated to a process-oriented understanding of the God-world relationship. For, if the symbiotic relationship between the natural and the supernatural order of events is working properly, then there should be no need for God to suspend or even to tinker with the normal workings of nature so as to help human beings to deal with some catastrophic series of events in the world of nature<br>

  Book Title: Antiochene Theoria in the Writings of Theodore of Mopsuestia and Theodoret of Cyrus-  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Perhai Richard J.<br>
  Abstract: Biblical scholars have often contrasted the exegesis of the early church fathers from the eastern region and “school” of Syrian Antioch against that of the school of Alexandria. The Antiochenes have often been described as strictly historical-literal exegetes in contrast to the allegorical exegesis of the Alexandrians. Patristic scholars now challenge those stereotypes, some even arguing that few differences existed between the two groups. This work agrees that both schools were concerned with a literal and spiritual reading. But, it also tries to show, through analysis of Theodore and Theodoret’s exegesis and use of the term theoria, that how they integrated the literal-theological readings often remained quite distinct from the Alexandrians. For the Antiochenes, the term theoria did not mean allegory, but instead stood for a range of perceptions—prophetic, christological, and contemporary. It is in these insights that we find the deep wisdom to help modern readers interpret Scripture theologically.<br>

  Abstract: This paper explores the prospects of a proactive approach to historical thinking in relation to the paradox of human difference and interdependence in a global context. The dual premise of my analysis is the reality and permanence of cultural (including religious) diversity of human societies, on the one hand, and the imperatives of peaceful and cooperative co-existence in an increasingly globalized environment, on the other. Competing visions of history, I suggest, have always been integral to conceptions of self-identity and relationship to the “other,” in individual and communal interactions.

  Abstract: Undoubtedly, the relevance of a psychoanalytic dimension in historical understanding correlates with the importance that is attributed to anxiety and fantasy in history. In circumstances in which historical agents—both groups and individuals—conduct themselves in what seems to observers and commentators to be a rational manner, the contribution of anxiety and fantasy to their conduct is usually taken to be negligible. Only when rational explanations are no longer considered sufficient will affects such as anxiety or unconscious fantasies play a major role in an historical analysis.<br>

  Book Title: Godless Intellectuals?-The Intellectual Pursuit of the Sacred Reinvented<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Riley Alexander Tristan<br>
  Abstract: The Durkheimians have traditionally been understood as positivist, secular thinkers, fully within the Enlightenment project of limitless reason and progress. In a radical revision of this view, this book persuasively argues that the core members of the Durkheimian circle (Durkheim himself, Marcel Mauss, Henri Hubert and Robert Hertz) are significantly more complicated than this. Through his extensive analysis of large volumes of correspondence as well as historical and macro-sociological mappings of the intellectual and social worlds in which the Durkheimian project emerged, the author shows the Durkheimian project to have constituted a quasi-religious quest in ways much deeper than most interpreters have thought. Their fascination, both personal and intellectual, with the sacred is the basis on which the author reconstructs some important components of modern French intellectual history, connecting Durkheimian thought to key representatives of French poststructuralism and postmodernism: Bataille, Foucault, Derrida, Baudrillard, and Deleuze.<br>

Such an analysis of this ritual activity will help us not only understand evangelical churches and associations, it will also help us understand some key issues in the study of Latin American politics and popular movements.<br>

Qualifying the 'non-historian' as an 'able' interventionist in historical studies, the author explores the relationship between history and theory within the current epistemological configurations and refigurations. He asks how history transcends the obsessive 'linguistic' turn, which has been hegemonizing literary/discourse analysis, and focuses greater attention on historical experience and where history stands in relation to our understanding of ethics, religion and the current state of global politics that underlines the manipulation and abuse of history.<br>

Tragedies, especially when highly shocking, tend to turn into “legendary” narratives, and the more important they are, the harder it becomes to examine them critically.

  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Feyen Stef<br>
  Abstract: The relationship between EU law and national constitutional law, including constitutional law in federalism matters, has been subject to an ongoing scholarly debate. This monograph contributes to this debate in two ways. The author argues for an approach to constitutional law that goes beyond the classic - coined dogmatic - understanding of constitutional case law regarding federalism as expounded in Belgian academia. Building on that basis, he sets out to rethink the framework within which the connection between EU law and national constitutional law can be understood. The analysis delves into the relationship (and sometimes tension) between ‘rule-of-law' values (which may serve as checks upon instrumental forms of reasoning) and the toolbox deployed in constitutional court case law to accommodate several rather pragmatic needs.<br>

  Book Title: A Politics of the Ordinary-  Publisher: NYU Press<br>

  Abstract: In A Politics of the Ordinary, Thomas Dumm dramatizes how everyday life in the United States intersects with and is influenced by the power of events, on the one hand, and forces of conformity and normalcy on the other. Combining poststructuralist analysis with a sympathetic reading of a strain of American thought that begins with Emerson and culminates in the work of Stanley Cavell, A Politics of the Ordinary investigates incidents from everyday life, political spectacles, and popular culture. Whether juxtaposing reflections about boredom in rural New Mexico with Emerson's theory of constitutional amendment, Richard Nixon's letter of resignation with Thoreau's writings to overcome quiet desperation, or demonstrating how Disney's Toy Story allegorizes the downsizing of the American white-collar work force, Dumm's constant concern is to show how the ordinary is the primary source of the democratic political imagination.<br>

  Abstract: The aftershocks of the 2008 financial crisis still reverberate throughout the globe. Markets are down, unemployment is up, and nations from Greece to Ireland find their very infrastructure on the brink of collapse. There is also a crisis in the management of global affairs, with the institutions of global governance challenged as never before, accompanied by conflicts ranging from Syria, to Iran, to Mali. Domestically, the bases for democratic legitimacy, social sustainability, and environmental adaptability are also changing. In this unique volume from the World Public Forum Dialogue of Civilizations and the Social Science Research Council, some of the world's greatest minds - from Nobel Prize winners to long-time activists - explore what the prolonged instability of the so-called Great Recession means for our traditional understanding of how governments can and should function. Through interviews that are sure to spark lively debate,22 Ideas to Fix the Worldpresents both analysis of past geopolitical events and possible solutions and predictions for the future.The book surveys issues relevant to the U.S., Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Speaking from a variety of perspectives, including economic, social, developmental, and political, the discussions here increase our understanding of what's wrong with the world and how to get it right. Interviewees explore topics like the Arab Spring, the influence of international financial organizations, the possibilities for the growth of democracy, the acceleration of global warming, and how to develop enforceable standards for market and social regulation. These inspiring exchanges from some of our most sophisticated thinkers on world policy are honest, brief, and easily understood, presenting thought-provoking ideas in a clear and accessible manner that cuts through the academic jargon that too often obscures more than it reveals.22 Ideas to Fix the Worldis living history in the finest sense - a lasting chronicle ~<br>

Starting from such an actor-based approach, he argues that many of the woes facing the world today were not caused by concepts like “the market” or “the crisis” but rather by a set of interactions among actors.

  Book Title: Biography and turning points in Europe and America-  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Négroni Catherine<br>
  Abstract: This sociological collection advances the argument that the concept of a turning point expands our understanding of life experiences from a descriptive to a deeper and more abstract level of analysis. It addresses the conceptual issue of what distinguishes turning points from life transitions in general and raises crucial questions about the application of turning points as a biographical research method. Biography and turning points in Europe and America is all the more distinctive and significant due to its broad empirical database. The anthology includes authors from ten different countries, providing a number of contexts for thinking about how turning points relate to constructions of meaning shaped by globalization and by cultural and structural meanings unique to each country. The book will be useful across a wide range of social sciences and particularly valuable for researchers needing a stronger theoretical base for biographical work.<br>

To the extent they have, moreover, they also ought to be able to rebalance the weight of these four modes in accordance with the development of dominant problem framings. That is, governance systems ought to be capable of flexible shifts from rule and analysis/instruction learning, to<br>

  Abstract: Time and space have chastened me to limit my topic considerably from the ecclesial role of ὁ πρεσβύτερος to the missional role. This latter choice pressed upon me by the texts themselves, particularly in 1 and 2 John, is itself a rather large focus upon which I can only make a modest and introductory comment.

  Abstract: This project on the identity and role of the Latino/a biblical critic constitutes an exercise in racial-ethnic criticism in general and minority biblical criticism in particular. To express it otherwise: just as minority biblical criticism represents a variation of racial-ethnic criticism, so does an analysis of the critical task as envisioned by minority critics represent a variation of minority biblical criticism. To explain what this variation signifies and entails, it is imperative to conceptualize and formulate its placement within both critical frameworks.

  Intelligibility and Judgment from:

  Author(s) KOSTER EDWIN<br>
  Abstract: This chapter offers an analysis of understanding in biology based on characteristic biological
                     practices:ways in which biologists think and act when carrying out their research. De Regt and Dieks have forcefully claimed that a philosophical study of scientific understanding should “encompass the historical variation of specific intelligibility standards employed in scientific practice” (2005, 138). In line with this suggestion, I discuss the conditions under which contemporary biologists come to understand natural phenomena and I point to a number of ways in which the performance of specific research practices informs and shapes the quality of such understanding.<br>

  Book Title: Liberalism at Its Limits-Crime and Terror in the Latin American Cultural Text<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): RODRÍGUEZ ILEANA<br>
  Abstract: In
      Liberalism at Its Limits,Ileana Rodríguez considers several Latin American nations that govern under the name of liberalism yet display a shocking range of nondemocratic features. In her political, cultural, and philosophical analysis, she examines these environments in which liberalism seems to have reached its limits, as the universalizing project gives way to rampant nonstate violence, gross inequality, and neocolonialism.Focusing on Guatemala, Colombia, and Mexico, Rodríguez shows how standard liberal models fail to account for new forms of violence and exploitation, which in fact follow from specific clashes between liberal ideology and local practice. Looking at these tensions within the ostensibly well-ordered state, Rodríguez exposes how the misunderstanding and misuse of liberal principles are behind realities of political turmoil, and questions whether liberalism is in fact an ideology sufficient to empower populations and transition nation-states into democratic roles in the global order.In this way,Liberalism at Its Limitsoffers a critical examination of the forced fitting of liberal models to Latin American nations and reasserts cross-cultural communication as crucial to grasping the true link between varying systems of value and politics.<br>

The city of Barcelona has been the obvious case study, not just because of its international projection, but also because of its position as a site of symbolic struggles with regards to Catalan identity (see Epps, 2004; Johnson, 2006; Resina, 2008a).

In Spain, tuberculosis contributed to around 7 percent of the general mortality rate between 1901 and 1930, which resulted in about thirty thousand deaths each year. Some contemporaries claimed that deficiencies in the data collection and analysis meant the actual figure was as high as seventy thousand; indeed, some estimates multiplied the official number of deaths from tuberculosis by ten.

Representations oscillate between distance and proximity, between critical summary or analysis and personal experience. For historiography in its narrower meaning as historical writing within the scholarly field of history, representing war seems particularly difficult since historiography is traditionally seen as a secondary narrative discourse, one in<br>

In the desire to narrate was discovered a source of the sacred, a spiritual quality intrinsic to the act of selfdisclosure. In my analysis of the poet’s use of antithesis, I showed how this trope belied the stereotype of psychological inertia and became a source of eurhythmic harmony. So, too, the use of parallelism was seen to bring into focus the problematic of desire and the will, mitigating the presence of<br>

  Book Title: The Unmaking of Home in Contemporary Art-  Publisher: University of Toronto Press<br>
  Author(s): LAUZON CLAUDETTE<br>
  Abstract: In a world where the notion of home is more traumatizing than it is comforting, artists are using this literal and figurative space to reframe human responses to trauma. Building on the scholarship of key art historians and theorists such as Judith Butler and Mieke Bal, Claudette Lauzon embarks upon a transnational analysis of contemporary artists who challenge the assumption that ‘home’ is a stable site of belonging. Lauzon’s boundary-breaking discussion of artists including Krzysztof Wodiczko, Sanitago Sierra, Doris Salcedo, and Yto Barrada posits that contemporary art offers a unique set of responses to questions of home and belonging in an increasingly unwelcoming world. From the legacies of Colombia’s ‘dirty war’ to migrant North African workers crossing the Mediterranean, The Unmaking of Home in Contemporary Art bears witness to the suffering of others whose overriding notion of home reveals the universality of human vulnerability and the limits of empathy.<br>

  Book Title: Texts-Contemporary Cultural Texts and Critical Approaches<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Childs Peter<br>
  Abstract: Being able to analyse different types of text is an essential skill for students of literature. Texts is a new kind of book which shows students how to use literary theory to approach a wide range of literary, cultural and media texts of the kind studied on today’s courses. These texts range from short stories, autobiographies, political speeches, websites and lyrics to films such as The Matrix and Harry Potter and from television’s Big Brother to shopping malls, celebrities, and rock videos.Each chapter combines an introduction to the text and aspects of its critical reception with an analysis using one of sixteen key approaches, from established angles like feminism, postcolonial studies and deconstruction to newer areas such as ecocriticism, trauma theory, and ethical criticism. Each chapter also indicates alternative ways of reading the text by drawing on other critical approaches. Texts:*is the first student guide to examine visual, virtual and performance texts alongside written texts reflecting the broadening range of the contemporary literature syllabus*demonstrates clearly how students can analyse a familiar text in different ways, a core skill which many find difficult*provides a student introduction to contemporary culture via well known popular texts and literary theories.<br>

                  The Production of Space (1974) introduced the idea of ‘social space’, overturning the traditional understanding of ‘space’ as an empty area and replacing it with the view that space is always both occupied and meaningful: is always socially, politically and ideologically constructed and interpreted.

In this chapter, I draw on the traditional understanding of eternity as non-temporal duration.

I have promised to look at the major reasons and arguments (perhaps I should say more neutrally that I will look at ‘major texts’) presented by analytic philosophers who have affirmed or embraced the idea of what Gilbert Ryle called the ‘wide gulf’ between Anglo-Saxon ‘philosophical analysis’ and philosophy on ‘the Continent’.¹ It is now time to do so. The texts I will look at are all from the same period: the late 1950s.² As we shall see, the idea of the gulf was already well established by then,<br>

  Book Title: The Discursive Construction of National Identity-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Unger J. W.<br>
  Abstract: How do we construct national identities in discourse? Which topics, which discursive strategies and which linguistic devices are employed to construct national sameness and uniqueness on the one hand, and differences to other national collectives on the other hand? The Discursive Construction of National Identity analyses discourses of national identity in Europe with particular attention to Austria.In the tradition of critical discourse analysis, the authors analyse current and on-going transformations in the self-and other definition of national identities using an innovative interdisciplinary approach which combines discourse-historical theory and methodology and political science perspectives. Thus, the rhetorical promotion of national identification and the discursive construction and reproduction of national difference on public, semi-public and semi-private levels within a nation state are analysed in much detail and illustrated with a huge amount of examples taken from many genres (speeches, focus-groups, interviews, media, and so forth).In addition to the critical discourse analysis of multiple genres accompanying various commemorative and celebratory events in 1995, this extended and revised edition is able to draw comparisons with similar events in 2005. The impact of socio-political changes in Austria and in the European Union is also made transparent in the attempts of constructing hegemonic national identities. Key Features:*Discourse-historical approach.*Interdisciplinarity (cultural studies, discourse analysis, history, political science).*Multi-method, multi-genre.*Qualitative case studies.<br>

  Abstract: The predominant anthropology for the place of law in international relations, whether on the side of state sovereignty or international organization, or constitution, has been a radically subjectivist, individualist one. The state of nature, in which sovereign states still find themselves, is reinforced by predatory doctrines of pre-emption in the area of national security and of relentless expansion in the area of economic activity, itself continuously dominated by security interests.¹ This analysis may not be disputed by legal internationalists or constitutionalists.

  Book Title: The Lacanian Left-Psychoanalysis, Theory, Politics<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stavrakakis Yannis<br>
  Abstract: In recent years psychoanalysis – especially Lacanian theory – has been gradually acknowledged as a vital resource in the ongoing re-orientation of contemporary political theory and analysis. Of particular note is that the work of Jacques Lacan is increasingly being used by major political philosophers associated with the Left. This indicates the dynamic emergence of a new theoretico-political horizon: that of the ‘Lacanian Left’. However, this has yet to be properly conceived and structured as a field. The Lacanian Left is the first book to bring it into academic consciousness and to draw its implications for concrete political analysis in a systematic way. It offers:• An accessible mapping of its main contours. • A detailed examination of the points of convergence and divergence between the major figures active or at the periphery of this terrain, including Slavoj h the central Lacanian notion of ‘enjoyment’, The Lacanian Left puts forward innovative analyses of political power and authority, nationalism, European identity, consumerism and advertising culture, de-democratisation and post-democracy. It will be of value to everyone interested in exploring the potential of psychoanalysis to reinvigorate political theory, critical political analysis and democratic politics.<br>

  Abstract: If Castoriadis constitutes the (extimate) frontier of the emerging Lacanian Left, two of its pivotal figures are certainly Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe. For a start, they have both exhibited, again and again, their increasing readiness to take on board many crucial Lacanian insights in their innovative analysis of political discourse and in reorienting the political theory of the Left in the direction of a ‘radical and plural democracy’. In their joint work, theoretical affinities with Lacanian thought are evident from at least the time of

I believe Burgin is right to emphasise film’s ability to create an intimate connection with the spectator, in which filmic signs bond with fragments of personal memory in unpredictable and potentially unique ways. Burgin gives the term ‘sequence-image’ to the fragment of remembered film and illustrates the concept with a description of<br>

  Abstract: If conflict is an intrinsic feature of democratic politics, then the manifestations of this conflict should be subjected to critical analysis to assess the extent to which they lend themselves to violence. This is particularly important because modern politics – especially in pious democratic forms – tends to deal with these conflicts in ethical terms constructed on a juxtaposition between democracy and violence. For this reason, evaluation of the ethics of conflict is fundamental to the arguments for and against democracy in contemporary politics, in particular the relationship between violence and democracy.

  Book Title: Happy Endings in Hollywood Cinema-Cliche, Convention and the Final Couple<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): MacDowell James<br>
  Abstract: The Hollywood ‘happy ending’ has long been considered among the most famous and standardised features in the whole of narrative filmmaking. Yet, while ceaselessly invoked, this notorious device has received barely any detailed attention from the field of film studies. This book is thus the first in-depth examination of one of the most overused and under-analysed concepts in discussions of popular cinema. What exactly is the 'happy ending'? Is it simply a cliché, as commonly supposed? Why has it earned such an unenviable reputation? What does it, or can it, mean? Concentrating especially on conclusions featuring an ultimate romantic union – the final couple – this wide-ranging investigation probes traditional associations between the 'happy ending' and homogeneity, closure, ‘unrealism’, and ideological conservatism, testing widespread assumptions against the evidence offered by a range of classical and contemporary films. Key Features: Defines key features of the Hollywood ‘happy ending’ through detailed textual analysis and theoretical debate. Traces the historical development of the scholarly approaches taken towards the cinematic ‘happy ending’ Reassesses the concept of cinematic closure and its relationship to genre, ideology and ‘unrealism’<br>

  Book Title: Post-beur Cinema-North African Émigré and Maghrebi-French Filmmaking in France since 2000<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Higbee Will<br>
  Abstract: Since the early 1980s and the arrival of Beur cinema filmmakers of Maghrebi origin have made a key contribution French cinema's representation of issues such as immigration, integration and national identity. However, they have done so mostly from a position on the margins of the industry. In contrast, since the early 2000s, Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmakers have occupied an increasingly prominent position on both sides of the camera, announcing their presence on French screens in a wider range of genres and styles than ever before. This greater visibility and move to the mainstream has not, however, automatically meant that these films have lost any of the social or political relevance. Indeed in the 2000s many of these films have increasingly questioned the boundaries between national, transnational and diasporic cinema, whilst simultaneously demanding, either implicitly or explicitly, a reconsideration of the very difference that has traditionally been seen as a barrier to the successful integration of North African immigrants and their descendants into French society. Through a detailed study of this transformative decade for Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmaking in France, this book argues for the emergence of a 'Post-Beur' cinema in the 2000s that is simultaneously global and local in its outlook. Its key features include: A comprehensive overview of the key developments in Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmaking in France since the 2000s: counter-heritage cinema and the memorialisation of France’s colonial past; journey narratives and the myth of return; the ‘mainstreaming’ of Maghrebi-French directors and stars; representations of Islam. Detailed case studies of key films from the 2000s that have yet to receive scholarly attention, such as Hors-la-loi, Dernier maquis and Vénus noire.

  Abstract: In the 1980s, just as the textual revolution was entering its secondary phase and sweeping the discipline, a few anthropologists began to question the disembodied nature of much of contemporary ethnography and its conceptual reliance on language-based models of analysis. Their work prepared the ground for a sensual turn in anthropological understanding—that is, a move away from linguistic and textual paradigms toward an understanding that treats cultures as ways of sensing the world. This chapter documents this countertradition within the anthropology of the 1980s and 1990s, which culminated in the emergence of the anthropology of the senses.<br>

  Abstract: Spanning over nine hundred years, Eight Women Philosophers is the first singly-authored work to trace the themes of standard philosophical theorizing and feminist thought across women philosophers in the Western tradition. Jane Duran has crafted a comprehensive overview of eight women philosophers--Hildegard of Bingen, Anne Conway, Mary Astell, Mary Wollstonecraft, Harriet Taylor Mill, Edith Stein, Simone Weil, and Simone de Beauvoir--that underscores the profound and continuing significance of these thinkers for contemporary scholars. _x000B_Duran devotes one chapter to each philosopher and provides a sustained critical analysis of her work, utilizing aspects of Continental theory, poststructuralist theory, and literary theory. She situates each philosopher within her respective era and in relation to her intellectual contemporaries, and specifically addresses the contributions each has made to major areas such as metaphysics/epistemology, theory of value, and feminist theory. She affirms the viability and importance of recovering these women's overlooked work and provides a powerful answer to the question of why the rubric "women philosophers" remains so valuable.<br>

Next, she explores the making of a justice movement in the context of Hindu-Muslim violence in 2002 in the state of Gujarat, India. From there she revisits the Sikh carnage in Delhi of 1984.

  Abstract: The literary and cinematic work of the French philosopher and filmmaker Raymonde Carasco-Hébraud (1939–2009) comprises a thorough analysis of the theoretical and practical circulations, intersections, and interrelations between verbal and audiovisual thinking. Author of sixty articles and three books, two published during her lifetime and one posthumously; editor of two collected volumes; and codirector, with her husband, Régis Hébraud, of sixteen films in both 16 mm and 35 mm, Carasco is perhaps the only professional philosopher to have created such an extensive literary and cinematic body of work.

  Book Title: Commemorating and Forgetting-Challenges for the New South Africa<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): MURRAY MARTIN J.<br>
  Abstract: How is the historical past made to appear in the present? In addressing these questions, Murray reveals how collective memory is stored and disseminated in architecture, statuary, monuments and memorials, literature, and art-"landscapes of remembrance" that selectively recall and even fabricate history in the service of nation-building. He examines such vehicles of memory in postapartheid South Africa and parses the stories they tell-stories by turn sanitized, distorted, embellished, and compressed. In this analysis,

  Abstract: “Labor is the living, form-giving fire,” Marx wrote. “It is the transitoriness of things, their temporality, as their transformation by living time.” How is it, then, that labor, with all its life-affirming potential, has become the means of capitalist discipline, exploitation, and domination in modern society? The authors expose and pursue this paradox through a systematic analysis of the role of labor in the processes of capitalist production and in the establishment of capitalist legal and social institutions. Critiquing liberal and socialist notions of labor and institutional reform from a radical democratic perspective, Hardt and Negri challenge the state-form itself.<br>

  Abstract: Jürgen Habermas is one of the most influential philosophers of our time. His diagnoses of contemporary society and concepts such as the public sphere, communicative rationality, and cosmopolitanism have influenced virtually all academic disciplines, spurred political debates, and shaped intellectual life in Germany and beyond for more than fifty years. In

After examining his intellectual biography, it goes on to illuminate the social and intellectual context of Habermasian thought, such as the Frankfurt School, speech-act theory, and contending theories of democracy. TheHandbookprovides an extensive account of Habermas's texts, ranging from his dissertation on Schelling to his most recent writing about Europe. It illustrates the development of his thought and its frequently controversial reception while elaborating the central ideas of his work. The book also provides a glossary of key terms and concepts, making the complexity of Habermas's thought accessible to a broad readership.<br>

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Jens<br>
  Abstract: Richard Kearney explores these questions with a host of philosophers known for their inclusive, forward-thinking work on the intersection of secularism, politics, and religion. An interreligious dialogue that refuses to paper over religious difference, these conversations locate the sacred within secular society and affirm a positive role for religion in human reflection and action. Drawing on his own philosophical formulations, literary analysis, and personal interreligious experiences, Kearney develops through these engagements a basic gesture of hospitality for approaching the question of God. His work facilitates a fresh encounter with our best-known voices in continental philosophy and their views on issues of importance to all spiritually minded individuals and skeptics: how to reconcile God's goodness with human evil, how to believe in both God and natural science, how to talk about God without indulging in fundamentalist rhetoric, and how to balance God's sovereignty with God's love.<br>

  Abstract: Essays are grouped into four categories: rethinking colonialism and modernity; colonial policy and cultural change; visual culture and literary expressions; and from colonial rule to postcolonial independence. Their unique analysis considers all elements of the Taiwanese colonial experience, concentrating on land surveys and the census; transcolonial coordination; the education and recruitment of the cultural elite; the evolution of print culture and national literature; the effects of subjugation, coercion, discrimination, and governmentality; and the root causes of the ethnic violence that dominated the postcolonial era.<br>

  Abstract: Taking as its starting point the long-standing characterization of Milton as a "Hebraic" writer,
         Milton and the Rabbisprobes the limits of the relationship between the seventeenth-century English poet and polemicist and his Jewish antecedents. Shoulson's analysis moves back and forth between Milton's writings and Jewish writings of the first five centuries of the Common Era, collectively known as midrash. In exploring the historical and literary implications of these connections, Shoulson shows how Milton's text can inform a more nuanced reading of midrash just as midrash can offer new insights intoParadise Lost.<br>

  Abstract: In Kant, the dual question of reference and self-reference is left to be read from his terms “representation” and “reflection”—representation embodying the mind’s movement toward what is not itself, namely, the object; reflection, the mind’s questioning of its own structures. And yet, in the Kantian system, the conjunction of these two notions turns out to be, in the final analysis, impossible. This impossibility is expressed in a strange oxymoron, the use of which causes the entire framework to implode. To demonstrate the incompatibility between these two orientations, I must first bring out the meaning of the term “representation” and<br>

  Abstract: To take the measure of literary writing,
         The Deed of Readingconvenes diverse philosophic commentary on the linguistics of literature, with stress on the complementary work of Stanley Cavell and Giorgio Agamben. Sympathetic to recent ventures in form-attentive analysis but resisting an emphasis on so-called surface reading, Stewart explores not some new formalism but the internal pressures of language in formation, registering the verbal infrastructure of literary prose as well as verse. In this mode of "contextual" reading, the context is language itself. Literary phrasing, tapping the speech act's own generative pulse, emerges as a latent philosophy of language in its own right, whereby human subjects, finding no secure place to situate themselves within language, settle for its taking place in, through, and between them.<br>

  Abstract: Minow firmly rejects the prevailing conception of the self that she believes underlies legal doctrine-a self seen as either separate and autonomous, or else disabled and incompetent in some way. In contrast, she regards the self as being realized through connection, capable of shaping an identity only in relationship to other people. She shifts the focus for problem solving from the "different" person to the relationships that construct that difference, and she proposes an analysis that can turn "difference" from a basis of stigma and a rationale for unequal treatment into a point of human connection. "The meanings of many differences can change when people locate and revise their relationships to difference," she asserts. "The student in a wheelchair becomes less different when the building designed without him in mind is altered to permit his access." Her book evaluates contemporary legal theories and reformulates legal rights for women, children, persons with disabilities, and others historically identified as different.<br>

  Abstract: The limitations of rights analysis were not unknown to the reformers who challenged the institutional treatment of mentally retarded people. They worked within a rights framework but also looked to other disciplines to reimagine the legal entitlements of marginalized people. Litigators developed an argument that the label of mental retardation is a stigma that deprives individuals of their liberty; therefore, the right to due process applies before the label can be assigned.¹ To build this argument, the critics of labeling drew on a theory developed by sociologists and shifted the focus from the deviant person to the process by which<br>

These effects are still visible in our lives today: the conception of happiness as an affect, the ambivalent attitude toward happiness, the structuring of our lives according to the alternation of desire/satisfaction or work/leisure, the ongoing legacy of utilitarianism’s reductive, mathematized conception of happiness.

  Author(s): Adebanwi Wale<br>
  Abstract: Nation as Grand Narrative offers a methodical analysis of how relations of domination and subordination are conveyed through media narratives of nationhood. Using the typical postcolonial state of Nigeria as a template and engaging with disciplines ranging from media studies, political science, and social theory to historical sociology and hermeneutics, Wale Adebanwi examines how the nation as grand narrative provides a critical interpretive lens through which competition among ethnic, ethnoregional, and ethnoreligious groups can be analyzed. Adebanwi illustrates how meaning is connected to power through ideology in the struggles enacted on the pages of the print media over diverse issues including federalism, democracy and democratization, religion, majority-minority ethnic relations, space and territoriality, self-determination, and threat of secession. Nation as Grand Narrative will trigger further critical reflections on the articulation of relations of domination in the context of postcolonial grand narratives.

Daya Kishan Thussu and Des Freedman identify the media in the context of the communication of conflict as a “battleground.”³ Regarding the contemporary world, saturated with the media’s reporting of conflict, Simon Cottle argues that the media-conflict interface needs to be understood through the perspective of “mediatized conflict.”<br>

  Author(s): KERR LINDSAY G.<br>
  Abstract: Co-Winner of the 2014 Publication Prize awarded by the Association of Hispanists of Great Britain and Ireland Kerr traces the processes and paradoxes at work in the late parodic poetry of Luis de Góngora and Lope de Vega, illuminating the correlations and connections between two poets who have more often than not been presented as enemies.The analysis follows the parallel development of the complex parodic genre through Góngora's late mythological parody, from his 1589 Hero and Leander romance through to his culminating parody, La fábula de Píramo y Tisbe (1618) and Lope de Vega's alter ego Tomé de Burguillos, whose anthology, Rimas humanas y divinas del licenciado Tomé de Burguillos, was published a year before Lope's death, in 1634. Working from the premise that parody provides a Derridean supplément to exhausted, dominant genres (e.g. pastoral, lyric, epic), this study asks: what do these texts achieve by their supplementarity, and how do they achieve it?, and, the overarching question, why do these erudite poets turn to parody in an age of decline?

  Abstract: This is an innovative exploration of cultural heritage and the literary traditions that shape the contemporary literary scene in Spain. Through a coalescence of museum studies, metacriticism and traditional literary criticism the study interweaves discussion of museum spaces with literary analysis, exploring them as agents of memorialisation and a means for preserving and conveying heritage. Following introductory explorations of the development of museums and the literary canon, each chapter begins with a "visit" to a Spanish museum, establishing the framework for the subsequent discussion of critical practices and texts. Case studies include examination of the palimpsest and unconscious influence of canonical cores; the response to masculine traditions of poetry and art; counter-culture of the 1990s; and the ethical concerns of postmemory writing.

  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): KENNY NUALA<br>
  Abstract: Josefina Aldecoa, in her treatment of themes such as a woman's place in society under and after dictatorship, mother-daughter relationships, war, and memory, confirmed her unique role as a contemporary novelist concerned with women's identity in Spain and as a writer of the mid-century generation ('los niños de la guerra'). The first volume of her trilogy, Historia de una maestra, was one of the earliest narratives of historical memory to be produced in Spain. In this sense, Aldecoa's work anticipated new developments in gender studies, such as the intersection of feminist concerns and cultural memory. This book offers a comprehensive examination of Aldecoa's trajectory as a novelist, from La enredadera to Hermanas, centring on her primary preoccupations of gender and memory, arguing that Aldecoa's fiction offers a new, more complex understanding of women's identity than previously understood. The work combines the two dominating theoretical components of feminism and cultural memory with close textual analysis of Aldecoa's narratives. Her novels highlight the importance of the details of women's daily experiences and struggles throughout the twentieth century, a period of significant socio-political upheaval and change in Spain's history.

  Book Title: Cultural Capital, Language and National Identity in Imperial Spain-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): BINOTTI LUCIA<br>
  Abstract: This innovative study examines the cultural mechanisms in early modern Spain that led to the translation, imitation and selective adoption of the values embodied by the Italian Renaissance. These mechanisms served to delineate a national tradition that addressed the needs of a changing society and gave a "Spanish" physiognomy to the Italian experience, which ultimately led to the Golden Age. By examining such important texts as the sentimental fictions of Diego de San Pedro and Juan de Flores, the Spanish translation of Orlando Furioso, Don Quixote, and the Polifemo, Binotti first describes the conditions imposed on book production by both the expectations of an elite audience and the limitations of the printing market while outlining the process of the creation of an expressive poetic language and the quest for literary models. She then looks at Ambrosio de Morales' chronicles and Bernardo de Aldrete's Del Origen, showing how a cultural discourse founded on foreign scholarship paved the way for the establishment of innovative-and autochtonous-methods of historical and scientific analysis in the early seventeenth-century.

It was demonstrated, by the analysis of key passages in García Márquez’s novel and Ovid’s poem, that there are many factors that can explain the use of magical realism, ranging from political and cultural to literary traditions. In this chapter, I continue to examine the claims of Latin Americanists, in this instance, focusing upon the aesthetic effect of magical realism, rather than the reasons for its appearance.<br>

  Abstract: In her overview of the symbolism of games in the

  Book Title: El documental cinematográfico y televisivo contemporáneo-Memoria, sujeto y formación de la identidad democrática española<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): ESTRADA ISABEL M.<br>
  Abstract: Este libro evalúa la aportación del documental cinematográfico y televisivo producido en España a partir de los años 90 al debate en torno a la memoria de la represión franquista, por un lado, así como a la construcción de la identidad democrática, en términos más generales. Propongo que tanto los documentales con un enfoque histórico explícito como aquellos cuya mirada retrospectiva se realiza sin referentes tan concretos cuestionan el proyecto político teleológico concebido durante la Transición. La primera parte de mi estudio trata de la memoria histórica de la guerra civil específicamente y, la segunda, de la memoria en un sentido socioeconómico para apuntar el déficit de agencia del sujeto en la democracia neoliberal. En última instancia se reivindica la marginalidad social de la víctima a la vez que se deja al descubierto su obliteración de los procesos democráticos. Isabel M. Estrada is Visiting Assistant Professor, Franklin & Marshall College. ENGLISH VERSION This book examines how a selected group of documentaries made since 1995 for both film and television inform the debate centered on the so-called "recuperation of memory" of the Spanish Civil War and dictatorship. Estrada contends that these documentaries modify Spanish identity as it was conceived by the teleological historical project of the transition. The narrative of mass media should be examined in order to comprehend the process of the "recovery of memory" that culminated in the Law of Historical Memory (2007). She carries out a comparative analysis of the visual discourse of the documentary and the narrative discourses of history and testimony, paying special attention to the relations of power among them. Using theoretical frameworks provided by Badiou, Adorno, Renov, and Ricoeur, this study ultimately sheds light on the status of the victim in the context of Spain's neoliberal democracy. Isabel M.

  Book Title: Narratives of Identity in Alban Berg's "Lulu"-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): dos Santos Silvio J.<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the crossroads between autobiographical narrative and musical composition, this book examines Berg's transformation of Frank Wedekind's Erdgeist (1895) and Die Büchse der Pandora/ (1904) -- the plays used in the formation of the libretto for Lulu -- according to notions of gender identity, social customs, and the aesthetics of modernity in Vienna of the 1920s and 1930s. While Berg modernized several aspects of the plays by Wedekind and incorporated serial techniques of composition from Arnold Schoenberg, he never let go of the idealistic Wagnerian perspectives of his youth. In fact, he went as far as reconfiguring aspects of Richard Wagner's life as an ideal identity to be played out in the compositional process. In the process of composing the opera, Berg also reflected on the most important cultural figures in fin-de-siècle Vienna that affected his worldview, including Karl Kraus, Emil Lucka, Otto Weininger, and others. Adopting an approach that combines a systematic analysis of Berg's numerous sketches for Lulu, correspondence, and the finished work with interpretive models drawn from cultural studies and philosophy, this book elucidates the ways in which Berg grappled with his self-image as an "incorrigible romantic" (unverbesserliche Romantiker) at the end of his life, explaining aspects of his musical language that have been considered strange or anomalous in the scholarship.

  Book Title: El niño en el cine argentino de la postdictadura (1983-2008)-alegoría y nostalgia<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): DUFAYS SOPHIE<br>
  Abstract: Este libro constituye la primera monografía dedicada al papel del niño en el cine latinoamericano. El análisis detallado de una decena de películas argentinas de la post-dictadura dirigidas entre 1983 y 2008, incluyendo tanto clásicas (La historia oficial, Un lugar en el mundo) como olvidadas (Amigomio, El rigor del destino), revela cómo la mirada y el lenguaje del niño son puestos al servicio de una alegoría nostálgica, estructurada en torno a la memoria o al lenguaje verbal y vinculada a la figura del padre ausente. Dufays combina los análisis fílmicos con una amplia reflexión teórica sobre las cuatro nociones clave de alegoría, melancolía, nostalgia y duelo y los articula con una genealogía de la figura alegórica del niño en las tradiciones narrativas latinoamericanas. Este recorrido permite al lector explorar las significaciones simbólicas y discursivas que el personaje infantil, la infancia y la familia han adquirido en el cine y en el contexto postdictatorial argentino. Sophie Dufays es investigadora postdoctoral del Fondo Nacional de Investigación Científica de Bélgica, en la Universidad de Louvain-la-Neuve. This book is the first monograph devoted to the role of the child in Latin American cinema. Through close analysis of about ten Argentine fiction films of the post-dictatorship period directed between 1983 and 2008, including both classic such as The Official Story and A Place in the World) and forgotten works such as Amigomío and El rigor del destino. Dufays shows how the child's gaze and language are a means of focusing a nostalgic form of allegory, structured around either memory or verbal language, and related to the figure of the absent father. In combining these analyses with a wide theoretical articulation of four key notions (allegory, melancholy, mourning and nostalgia) and with a genealogy of the allegorical child character in Latin American narrative traditions, Relatos de infancia allows the reader to explore the meanings that childhood and fa~<br>

  Book Title: Spanish American Poetry after 1950-Beyond the Vanguard<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): SHAW DONALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Providing a basis for understanding the main lines of development of poetry in Spanish America after Vanguardism, this volume begins with an overview of the situation at the mid-century: the later work of Neruda and Borges, the emergence of Paz. Consideration is then given to the decisive impact of Parra and the rise of colloquial poetry, politico-social poetry (Dalton, Cardenal) and representative figures such as Orozco, Pacheco and Cisneros. The aim is to establish a few paths through the largely unmapped jungle of Spanish American poetry in the time period. The author emphasises the persistence of a generally negative view of the human condition and the poets' exploration of different ways of responding to it. These vary from outright scepticism to the ideological, the religious or those derived from some degree of confidence in the creative imagination as cognitive. At the same time there is analysis of the evolving outlook on poetry of the writers in question, both in regard to its possible social role and in regard to diction.

  Book Title: Narrative Deconstructions of Gender in Works by Audrey Thomas, Daphne Marlatt, and Louise Erdrich-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Rosenthal Caroline<br>
  Abstract: By analyzing the works of Thomas, Marlatt, and Erdrich through the lenses of subjectivity, gender studies, and narratology, Caroline Rosenthal brings to light new perspectives on their writings. Although all three authors write metafictions that challenge literary realism and dominant views of gender, the forms of their counter-narratives vary. In her novel 'Intertidal Life', Thomas traces the disintegration of an identity through narrative devices that unearth ruptures and contradictions in stories of gender. In contrast, Marlatt, in 'Ana Historic', challenges the regulatory fiction of heterosexuality. She offers her protagonist a way out into a new order that breaks with the law of the father, creating a "monstrous" text that explores the possibilities of a lesbian identity. In her tetralogy of novels made up of 'Love Medicine', 'Tracks', 'The Beet Queen', and 'The Bingo Palace', Erdrich resists definite readings of femininity altogether. By drawing on trickster narratives, she creates an open system of gendered identities that is dynamic and unfinalizable, positing the most fragmented worldview as the most enduring. By applying gender and narrative theory to nuanced analysis of the texts, Rosenthal's study elucidates the correlation between gender identity formation and narrative. Caroline Rosenthal is Professor and Chair of American Literature at the Friedrich-Schiller University in Jena, Germany. Her book 'Narrative Deconstructions of Gender' was published by Camden House in 2003.<br>

  Book Title: Arturo Pérez-Reverte: Narrative Tricks and Narrative Strategies-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): WALSH ANNE L.<br>
  Abstract: The writings of Arturo Pérez-Reverte, one of Spain's most renowned contemporary authors, have been described as a minefield. This monograph examines the complexities behind the narrative technique employed in creating such a minefield, including an analysis of the role played by both male and female characters, the relevance of the past as a motif, and aspects of the role of storytelling in creating mystery where none should exist. Both Revertian novels and journalistic writing are seen to be part of an over-all game which is played between their author and his readers. Film, too, forms part of the material reviewed as, though Pérez-Reverte is not a script writer, many films have been based on his novels. The text-centred analysis concludes that the themes of interest in all Revertian output revolve around two main areas: the significance of the past, whether historical, cultural, or literary, and the role of the written word in communicating, in rescuing and in challenging versions of that past in order to combat what Pérez-Reverte terms 'dismemory'.

  Abstract: This book provides the most comprehensive study to date of the full range of Marías' writing, including discussion and analysis of his literary and intellectual formation, his development as a novelist and short story writer, and his unique perspective offered in nearly twenty-five years of newspaper columns on topics ranging from religion to football. Above all, Marías is examined as a writer of fictions. As a translator of several canonical works from English to Spanish, Marías came to appreciate the preciseness of words as well as their ambiguity, their capacity to represent as well as their propensity to distort. The author examines Marías's constant awareness of how language can be used to construct stories as the foundation for engaging the world as well as for imagining it. The nature of Marías's storytelling, and the way in which he imagines, form the principal focus of this Companion. David K.

  Book Title: Bones of Contention-The living archive of Vasil Levski and the making of Bulgaria's national hero<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Todorova Maria<br>
  Abstract: This book is about documenting and analyzing the living archive around the figure of Vasil Levski (1837–1873), arguably the major and only uncontested hero of the Bulgarian national pantheon. The processes described, although with a chronological depth of almost two centuries, are still very much in the making, and the living archive expands not only in size but constantly adding surprising new forms. The monograph is a historical study, taking as its narrative focus the life, death and posthumous fate of Levski. By exploring the vicissitudes of his heroicization, glorification, appropriations, reinterpretation, commemoration and, finally, canonization, it seeks to engage in several broad theoretical debates, and provide the basis for subsequent regional comparative research. The analysis of Levski's consecutive and simultaneous appropriations by different social platforms, political parties, secular and religious institutions, ideologies, professional groups, and individuals, demonstrates how boundaries within the framework of the nation are negotiated around accepted national symbols.<br>

  Author(s) Österberg Eva<br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapters I set out to show how premodern love and friendship, both as ideals and in the full diversity of reality, were not only important in private life, but also in public life. The focus of my analysis has been the ways that philosophers, writers, and State and Church thought and spoke about close relationships, and the great changes in these discourses over time.

  Book Title: Remembrance, History, and Justice-Coming to terms with traumatic pasts in democratic societies<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Iacob Bogdan C.<br>
  Abstract: The twentieth century has left behind a painful and complicated legacy of massive trauma, monstrous crimes, radical social engineering, or collective/individual guilt syndromes that were often the premises for and the specters haunting the process of democratization in the various societies that emerged out of these profoundly de-structuring contexts. The present manuscript is a state of the art reassessment and analysis of how the interplay between memory, history, and justice generates insight that is multifariously relevant for comprehending the present and future of democracy without becoming limited to a Europe-centric framework of understanding. The manuscript is structured on three complementary and interconnected trajectories: the public use of history, politics of memory, and transitional justice. Key words 1. Europe, Eastern—Politics and government—1989– 2. Collective memory—Europe, Eastern. 3. Memory—Political aspects—Europe, Eastern. 4. Democratization— Social aspects—Europe, Eastern. 5.

  Abstract: The Presidential Commission for the Analysis of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania (PCACDR—from now on the Commission) was founded in April 2006 by President Traian Băsescu to draft a report on the crimes of the 1945–1989 period. The document would provide the basis for the official condemnation of the Romanian communist regime. The report had to investigate the institutions and methods that made the crimes and abuses of the totalitarian regime possible, as well as to document the role of communist officials in supporting and perpetuating the system.¹ Even after 1989, many communist crimes were concealed and denied.<br>

  Book Title: Serbian Orthodox Fundamentals-The Quest for an Eternal Identity<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mylonas Christos<br>
  Abstract: This book is a comprehensive exposition of the interaction of a national (the Serbian people) and a religiou (the Orthodox Christian faith) content, in the formation of a distinctive national identity and a mode of being. Its interdisciplinary approach, drawing on sociology, social anthropology, theology, political theory, Balkan historiography, and Serbian folklore, is deployed to provide a powerful and original analysis of how Serbian Orthodoxy has resulted in the sacralisation of the Serbian nation by framing the parameters of its existence. Addresses the following questions: what 'makes' a Serb? Are meaningful assumptions possible by introducing Serbian Orthodoxy as the primal point of reference? Why does religion appear to have an especially strong appeal?<br>

  Abstract: More than fifteen years have passed since the change of the political regime in Eastern Europe, but the countries of the former Soviet bloc still face the fundamental challenge of how to deal with the events of their recent past, how to come to terms with the legacy of Socialism and its local versions.

  Book Title: Where Currents Meet-Frontiers of Memory in Post-Soviet Fiction of Kharkiv, Ukraine<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zaharchenko Tanya<br>
  Abstract: Where Currents Meet treats the Ukrainian and Russian components of cultural experience in Ukraine’s East as elements of a complex continuum. This study of cultural memory in post-Soviet space shows how its inhabitants negotiate the historical legacy they have inherited. Tanya Zaharchenko approaches contemporary Ukrainian literature at the intersection of memory studies and border studies, and her analysis adds a new voice to an ongoing exploration of cultural and historical discourses in Ukraine. This scholarly journey through storylines explores the ways in which younger writers in Kharkiv (Kharkov in Russian), a diverse, dynamic, but understudied border city in east Ukraine today come to grips with a traumatized post-Soviet cultural landscape. Zaharchenko’s book examines the works of Serhiy Zhadan, Andrei Krasniashchikh, Yuri Tsaplin, Oleh Kotsarev and others, introducing them as a “doubletake" generation who came of age during the Soviet Union’s collapse and as adults revisited this experience in their novels. Filling the space between society and the state, local literary texts have turned into forms of historical memory and agents of political life.<br>

  Book Title: Utopian Horizons-Ideology, Politics, Literature<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Czigányik Zsolt<br>
  Abstract: The 500th anniversary of Thomas More’s Utopia has directed attention toward the importance of utopianism. Utopian Horizons investigates the possibilities of cooperation between the humanities and the social sciences in the analysis of 20th century and contemporary utopian phenomena. The papers deal with major problems of interpreting utopias, the relationship of utopia and ideology, and the highly problematic issue as to whether utopia necessarily leads to dystopia. Besides reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of contemporary utopian investigations, the papers effectively represent the constructive attitudes of utopian thought, a feature that not only defines late 20th- and 21st-century utopianism, but is one of the primary reasons behind the rising importance of the topic.<br>

  Abstract: One of the most recent and important contributions to Soviet history is that of “Soviet subjectivity” literature. This approach originates in the works of Igal Halfin and Jochen Hellbeck, for both of whom Michel Foucault and post-structuralist theory are major sources of inspiration. Halfin and Hellbeck use the Foucauldian analysis of the creation of subjectivity by power to look at the Stalinist purges in a new way. The self that they write about is not a Cartesian or Kantian self, but rather an intersection of discourses and mechanisms of power. This is a radical version of the linguistic turn in<br>

  Book Title: Constitutions, Courts, and History-Historical Narratives in Constitutional Adjudication<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Uitz Renáta<br>
  Abstract: Emphasizes the role history and historical narratives play in constitutional adjudication. Uitz provocatively draws attention to the often-tense relationship between the constitution and historical precedence highlighting the interpretive and normative nature of the law. Her work seeks to understand the conditions under which references to the past, history and traditions are attractive to lawyers, even when they have the potential of perpetuating indeterminacy in constitutional reasoning. Uitz conclusively argues that this constitutional indeterminacy is obscured by 'judicial rhetorical toolkits' of continuity and reconciliation that allow the court's reliance on the past to be unaccounted for. Uitz' rigorous analysis and extensive research makes this work an asset to legal scholars and practitioners alike.<br>

Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: Lara’s book is thick with references and interwoven arguments and is sometimes hard to follow for this reason. She is concerned with showing the possibilities for a recognition of the importance of self‐fashioning narrative in Habermas’s own work, especially in his early analysis in
   The Structural Transformation of the Public. She takes up discussions of deliberative democracy to show how they are enriched by a recognition of the place of narrative; she takes up postmodern accounts of identity; and she pursues her argument through the work of Paul Ricoeur, Albrecht Wellmer, and Wayne Booth, as well as a host of others. Despite the density of the work, Lara succeeds in illuminating the relation between narrative, identity, and morality. If the question of how we should live is bound up with ideas of who we are, and if we shape who we are with the help of narratives of other lives, these ideas would seem to be an integral part of the normative question that Habermas asks as to how we should live with others. Lara’s book is not only a welcome addition to recent work on Habermas, but also an important participant in current discussions of the relationship between literature and morality.<br>

Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: While Ricoeur suggests that recourse to solidarity can go too far in answering these questions, an appeal to the conditions of solidarity provides the basis for his criticism of Rawls. As his account of the subject of rights would suggest, and agreeing with many in the Anglo‐American world, Ricoeur denies that a procedural theory of justice can substitute for the bonds of an ethical community or replace a collective conception of the good. At the same time, he sees Rawls’s analysis as a brilliant articulation of the deontological level of the structure of moral action. For Ricoeur, Rawls’s revisions of his theory of justice in his later work mark his own recognition of the connection between the deontological and teleological levels of moral action since he now explicitly grounds the theory of justice in a particular sort of political community.<br>

Abstract: “Culture” becomes publicly available and shared in group settings. The meaning of culture depends in part on what it means to participate in a group setting that filters that culture. The concept of culture in interaction brings group life squarely into cultural analysis. To understand culture, we need to know how groups put it to use in everyday life.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: 4. Are the paradigm shifts I identified for the study of language as culture in the United States of more general relevance?This possibility was also raised by psychologists in the audience when I presented an earlier draft of the article at the Universit di Padova in October 2000. In the printed version I purposely left out my own speculations in this direction because I felt that I did not have the data and the expertise to venture into other fields, but this is a worthwhile project for others to pursue. After all, many of the writers I mentioned were or are part of wider networks of scholarship extending to other disciplines and other countries. One in fact might see van Dijks comments as the beginning of a widening of the discussion by a major figure in another field, namely, discourse studies. His complaints about what is typically left out of the analysis in linguistics and anthropology not only underscore the privileging of certain contexts for analysis (e.g., spontaneous talk), which is to be expected, but also remind us that text itself is one of those key terms that can be interpreted very differently across disciplines and, I would add, across paradigms. I suspect that a study of how the term text has been interpreted and used in the humanities and social sciences would be an equally exciting exercise, although it would be difficult to justify the same temporal restriction to the 20th century given the ancient hermeneutical traditions from which our contemporary notions of text derive.<br>

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: Although an influential figure within German social theory for decades, Luhmann has never been an especially popular figure in American circles, perhaps because his theory is in actuality what many sociologists have accused Parson’s of being: a theory reducing social actors to nothing more than epiphenomena of their social system. Hence, Luhmann’s book consists of his application of concepts such as system/environment, medium/form, first‐ and second‐order observation, self‐reference and external reference and above all the distinction between psychic systems (systems of consciousness) and social systems (systems of communication) to the realm of art, thereby conceptually transforming it into the “art system.” One of the ironies in Luhmann’s analysis is that his claim for the “autonomy of art” is seemingly refuted by his own, wholly social, assessment of it. Indeed, reading Luhmann’s book is a little like watching Frankenstein at work: his conceptual apparatus renders the ostensibly organic associations we might have of art as being instead mechanical and clinical. For all of Parsons’s own romance with systems theory and cybernetics, his central concern was always with the cultural product of those systems, which he referred to variously as “instrumental activism” and “institutionalized individualism,” that is, the way in which differentiation led to the production of a more complex and sophisticated individualism within the societal community. This constituted Parsons’s standard for the evolution of societies. Luhmann, meanwhile, consistently held that social systems operate “behind the backs” of actors, operating to reduce complexity for such actors, on the one hand, while furthering systems imperatives, on the other. This contrast between mentor and student becomes most obvious in their respective views of culture: while Parsons never fully unpacked the concept of culture in his own work, his emphasis on values and norms opened the door to what today is known as t~<br>

Abstract: Not only does man know that he does not know himself, even if this were only because within his most intimate depths he discovers an unfathomable memory: “Magna vis est memoriae, nescio quid horrendum, Deus meus, profunda et infinita multiplicitas. Et hoc animus est et hoc ego ipse sum. Quid ego sum Deus? Quae natura sum?” (“Great is the power of memory, an awe‐inspiring mystery, my God, a power of profound and infinite multiplicity. And this is mind, this is I myself. What then am I, my God? What is my nature?”).
         31But above all, man understands, within this impasse, that the one who is alone in knowing him remains for him another, namely, God: “Utrum ita sim, nescio. Minus mihi in hac re notus sum ipse quam tu. Obsecro te, Deus meus, et me ipsum mihi indica” (“Whether I am one or the other I do not know. In this matter I know myself less well than I know you. I beseech you, my God, show me myself”).32Under Augustine’s analysis, man’s incomprehensibility to himself thus takes on yet wider and vaster dimensions. To begin with, as in the Greek fathers, the analysis points out not only the image and likeness of God within man’s incomprehensibility but also a unique privilege held by the human being with regard to all other creatures (which only resemble theirgenus, which is to say, themselves). Next, this incomprehensibility tells man that he goes beyond and exceeds himself, in short that “l’homme passe infiniment l’homme” (“man transcends man”), following the formulation of an exemplary Augustinian: in a word, man passes beyond his own means, man lives above his means.33Finally and above all, according to a strict consequence, only the infinite and incomprehensible can comprehend man, and thus tell him of and show him to himself; only God can reveal man to man, because man only reveals himself by revealing, without knowing it, the one whose image he bears. Not only is it true that “Je est un autre” (I is another), but this other calls himself God within man,~<br>

Abstract: Braudel’s connection with his readers through spectacle, passion, and memory gives life to the numbing facts of his book. Although not of a philosophical or theoretical bent, Braudel began the 1967 introduction to the first volume of
         Ci
            vi
            lisation matérielle et capitalismewith a bow to theory: “A general history always requires an overall model, good or bad, against which events can be interpreted. ‘No theory, no history,’ said Werner Sombart.”85Braudel’s underlying “theory” or original organizational schema inLa Méditerranéegrew out of necessity and distance—the accumulation of masses of material over more than a decade and the enforced separation from his notes and documentary base while a POW. It was a theory grounded ingéographie humaine,the primary discipline supporting French historical instruction from elementary school, and forged in war.86It was more a practice than a theory; it was about war and remembrance, the incantation of memory, as he emphasized in his 1950 inaugural lecture to the Collège de France.87The revised 1966 edition, however, was reconstituted out of a critical rereading and rethinking; for Braudel’s method—the method of the originalAnnalesof Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre—was the criticalcompte rendu,incorporating combats and debates, judgment and analysis in reviewing books and articles. In the 1969 preface to hisOn History,Braudel explained his method of revising his own work: “Since I am not a man of polemic, being concerned only with my own path, my own particular path, and since polemic and dialogue are a double and unavoidable necessity, here I am holding dialogues and engaging in polemic with myself, in a natural process of detachment from texts for which I obviously remain responsible. It was this sentiment which led me recently to rewriteThe Mediterranean.”88<br>

Abstract: The reassertion of a literary norm within the field of informational writing seemed to respond to a perceived decline in the communicative effectiveness of writing that paced the explosion of information and media. The tension between clarity, which posits a hypothetical general reader, and technicity, which assumes a specialized addressee, has never been resolved. The failure of modern writing to achieve clarity brings technicity into disrepute; but technicity is an inescapable requisite of modern writing and is not, in itself, incompatible with clarity or communication. An analysis of informational writing that fails to recognize the complex relation between clarity and technicity is unlikely to yield a composition pedagogy adequate to the demands upon writing in modernity. The reassertion of clarity by the literary professoriate, like the reassertion of brevity, forgets the inaugural act of information genres, forgets the forgetting of rhetoric.<br>

In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since h~<br>

Abstract: McNay’s
      Gender and Agency, while differing fromGender in the Mirrorin focus, shares in Meyers’s vexation with existing approaches to agency. McNay is particularly suspicious of theorists of cultural studies who “impute to certain everyday practices a kind of inherently subversive status” (4). She argues that the widely deployed idea of everyday resistance has no impact when the interplay between individual behavior and social norms is ignored: “This, in turn, indicates the necessity of contextualizing agencywithin power relationsin order to understand how acts deemed as resistant may transcend their immediate sphere in order to transform collective behavior and norms” (4, emphasis added). One can see that McNay is explicitly conscious of the tension that lurks in Meyers’s work, and the point is repeated throughout the book: “Analysis of the way in which certain subversive practices may get taken up and collectivized is important if resistance is to mean anything other than the truism that individuals do not reproduce social norms in a straightforward fashion” (129). Yet even more than Meyers’s, McNay’s argument glides from the language of mandate in her proposals (analogous to Meyers’s “musts”) to the language of possibility and potential in the results: a new theory of contextualized feminist agency could, may, might lead to collective action and greater freedom for women.<br>

Abstract: It is not clear from this quote why the range of Ricoeur’s contribution is overlooked. As Budd [
         3] points out, we should not presuppose a structural analysis, for this presupposition, identified with the mathematical physics approach considered above, reduces our options for action. However, this is not all that Ricoeur [14] has to say. Yes, we must critique his work, but if we limit ourselves to this operation, we miss the possibilities that open up and, hence, are poorer. Words are part of sentences, but much more can be said about this in relation to the process of making meaning. Similarly, sentences are parts of narratives, but, again, more can be said about this. These are levels in a hierarchy of action, which is the process of semantic innovation. Arguably, “library” also belongs in this process as an achievement of and contributor to this hierarchy.<br>

Abstract: See Homi K. Bhabha,
            Location of Culture(London and New York: Routledge, 1994). Following in Fanon’s footsteps, he provides a pertinent analysis of how the identity‐shaping recognitive process within the concrete historical conditions of colonialism and its postcolonial aftermath has worked to suppress the play of difference within each cultural identity. Part of the strategy of colonial rule and ideological justification for the European colonizers, he points out, was always to construct rules and standards of recognition around the notions of “modernity,” “rationality,” and “progress” and to produce a totalizing and hierarchically structured binary opposition between the colonizers and the colonized by recognizing the full presence of modernity and rationality in the former while assigning to the latter their complete absence or merely partial presence. The colonizing Europe accomplished this by disavowing the presence of heterogeneity within itself, such as the feminine and the irrational, and symbolically constructing and representing the colonized cultures as the essentialized Other of its now homogeneous rational self (and civilized, muscular Christianity)—e.g., the bestially sexual Africans, the duplicitous Chinese, and the effeminate and degenerate Hindus. But the artificial construction of such a binary opposition is inherently unstable, Bhabha argues, as can be seen for instance from the self‐contradictory nature of the colonizers’ attempt to convert the subject population to Christianity and to create a class of colonial elites educated in the ways of Europe, which was tantamount to an implicit recognition of the capacity of the colonized for rationality and self‐government, while at the same time deprecating and deriding that recognized presence of the “civilized” qualities in them as mere mimicry or even mockery of the authentic European, Christian identity. According to Bhabha, it is precisely the practice of mimicry on the part of the colon~<br>

Abstract: Ultimately, Frei’s analysis leads to the conclusion that understanding the grammar of the text in terms of its historical linguistic context—in other words, with reference to the culture outside the text itself—divorces the meaning or subject matter of the text from the narrative cohesion of scripture, such that a practice that finds “meaning” in the ascriptive, figural resonances between passages fades from view. “Where hermeneutics and interpretation are governed by the conviction that the interpreter’s unique stance and process of understanding are face to face with that same motion within the discourse to be interpreted, and that this affinity alone (apart from the `linguistic stock’) is the ground for understanding what is being said, such ‘surface’ reading, finding character and society firmly related—a reading, moreover, which discovers the continuity of the narrative in its very contingency—must be viewed as superficial or worse.”
         39In the conclusion toEclipse, Frei suggests that if one divorces grammatical interpretation from its psychological cohort, it may serve as a more appropriate interpretive approach for recovering a narrative sense: “If they are not [united], it still does not necessarily follow that grammatical interpretation can do justice to the obviously narrative features of such realistic texts as the biblical stories. But it does follow that of these two it alone is a candidate, since it alone is concerned with verbal connections.”40<br>

Abstract: Perhaps not so surprising is the fate of traditional literary critics like F. R. Leavis, Elder Olson, and Cleanth Brooks. Cited six or seven times for the first ten years of
      CI’s history, each has been cited one or two times in the last fifteen years. Other literary critics who have fallen out of vogue in the pages ofCIinclude Monroe Beardsley, Harold Bloom, Wayne Booth, Kenneth Burke, Northrop Frye, I. A. Richards, and René Wellek. This shift is indicative both of the change in the discipline of literary studies and, perhaps more importantly, of the change in the identity of the journal from a journal of literary criticism to something more interdisciplinary. While the New Critics and their contemporaries have given way to newer models of analysis, a perhaps more unexpected decline can be found when we turn to the first generation of poststructuralist literary critics. The frequency of citation of the works of Jonathan Culler, Stanley Fish, and J. Hillis Miller drops dramatically over the course of the journal’s history. But perhaps this decline is actually a plateau. When Culler’s books on structuralism and deconstruction first appeared in the 1970s and 1980s, they had an immediate and dramatic impact on the discipline, being cited over and over again. With time, they have been assimilated into the theoretical body and will continue to be cited at a more moderate pace. Similar spikes can be seen in more recent years in the frequency of citation of Judith Butler, Homi Bhabha, James Clifford, and Gayatri Spivak. While the conservative critics at theNew Criterionwould see this as evidence of the trendiness of critical theory, equating the reputations of Butler and Bhabha to other late nineties phenomena such as the Backstreet Boys and Beanie Babies, we read this as a more organic intellectual evolution from assertion to fact. Initially, certain theorists and terms are cited frequently for five years or so, followed by the inevitable backlash and/or assimilation~<br>

Abstract: Yet, while this site cannot become one of collective experience, let alone collective memory, by subjecting it to this analysis I am dealing with it as a historical fact or place. In a different context, Susan Crane asked: “When is the personal historical?” She replied to her own question: “Whenever one is thinking about oneself historically.”
         98Crane herself was concerned primarily with the nature of historical consciousness as perceiving individually but signifying collectively and with the fine line running between autobiography and historiography. By both looking at myself as a historian describing and reflecting on a certain period and approaching myself as an agent of this period who is utilizing my own living memory as a historical source, I inevitably make some of the personal historical. For the duration of this text, at least, even the pharmacy assumes some historical meaning—metaphorically embodying, with its makeover from medical to clothing store, and with the physical although not functional presence of its former designation, the complex story of rupture and continuity between the Communist and post‐Communist era.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur has placed the most interesting discussion of this second chapter at the very end. This is where he skillfully introduces Sen’s seminal work on capabilities and explores the ties between Sen and Taylor. The capabilities approach brings forth a set of social goods which are considered crucial for individual self‐development. In that vein, Taylor proposes an analysis of social goods which may contribute to the capabilities approach. Ricoeur pinpoints this contribution in the “evaluative framework” developed by Taylor: “This [Sen’s] concept of an ‘evaluation of situation’ is close to that of the ‘strong evaluations’ which for Charles Taylor conjoin self‐assertion and an ethical position expressed in terms of the good rather than of obligation” (144). Indeed, a fundamental question at the heart of the capabilities approach is that of the good life: according to this approach, economic agents are driven by the answer to the question “How should I live?” in the form of effective opportunities.<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: Instructive as his book is, Popkin could also have explored in greater depth yet the relationship between historical scholarship and expressions of the self. By focusing on autobiographies alone, he misses an opportunity to examine how such texts and scholarly publications related to (and possibly affected) one another, most notably in their divergent or convergent patterns of self‐representation. The boundary between autobiographical and scholarly writings may be more porous than Popkin intimates. Paul Hollander’s recent study of academic acknowledgments arrives, for instance, at conclusions that mirror Popkin’s regarding self‐representation and professional norms (“Acknowledgments: An Academic Ritual,”
   Academic Questions15, no. 1 [2001–2]: 63–76). Likewise, one could question why Popkin limited himself to the discursive analysis of published sources and “the motives that historian‐autobiographers acknowledge in their texts” (78). Autobiographies are also social practices that call for systematic research outside the text, in archival and published sources (and, perhaps, interviews as well). But Popkin is too good a historian not to know this. His book is by and about historians; it is dedicated to historians, but it is not only for historians. Its chief objective may well be to show how much the historian’s autobiography has contributed “to the literature of personal life writing” (8). In this respect as in many others,History, Historians, and Autobiographyis a success.<br>

Abstract: Indeed, as Hannah Arendt has pointed out, “Goodness in an absolute sense, as distinguished from the good‐for’ or the excellent’ in Greek and Roman antiquity, became known in our civilization only with the rise of Christianity” (Hannah Arendt,
            The Human Condition[Chicago, 1958], p. 73). The analysis of Goodness provided inThe Human Conditionand in which Arendt highlights the constitutive secrecy of good works, which must remain hidden even to the one who performs them—a good deed being good only on condition that it is forgotten at the moment it is done—as well as Goodness’s intrinsic hostility toward the public realm, converges in many respects with what Patočka—a reader of Arendt—says about this notion, as well as with all the implications that Derrida draws in systematic fashion from this conception inThe Gift of Death.<br>

Abstract: Nevertheless, “men” are in a serious predicament. While the JST does not permit the conclusion that, as a consequence of Adam’s sin, the human race is
         massa peccati, it does impute to Adam and Eve the cause of all humanity’s subjugation to death—cast out of God’s presence and destined for physical dissolution. The JST’s largest single addition to the KJV is an account of a people and, more particularly, their prophet Enoch, who overcame both alienation and dissolution and obtained for his posterity the promise of the same. In Smith’s elaboration on the figure of Enoch, Smith orients his Adamic myth toward a future that informs his believing readers’ sense of present meanings and possibilities. Enoch and his ideal city provide the type of Zion to which saints of the latter days are to aspire. For the instant analysis, it is equally important, however, that the promise of Zion is obtained by human petition, not divine fiat. This is the final example of Smith’s baptism of traditional Christianity into his restorationist project. It is possibly an even greater affront to tradition: giving humans a role in the preservation of the divine plan and, in so doing, constituting a means of their progressing toward the divine life itself.<br>

Author(s): Browning,  Don S.<br>
Abstract: This book is based on Don Browning’s most recent work on the relation of Christian ethics and the moral psychologies—a plural that the author uses in order to indicate the pluralist nature of this academic field. Browning states his guiding question as follows: should “moral theologians critique these psychologies and perhaps cleanse both theology and the wider culture of the possible mistaken images of moral responsibility proffered by them?” His “brief answer” is that “
      contemporary moral psychology can contribute to Christian ethics, but only when it does its research with competent pre‐scientific or pre‐empirical understandings of morality”(2). Accordingly, Browning’s special interest refers to the understandings of morality that research presupposes. It is these preunderstandings that require critical analysis by, among others, theologians. The model that Browning uses in his analysis is an adaptation of Paul Ricoeur’s critical hermeneutical ethics. This ethics combines hermeneutical sensitivity to different cultural and religious traditions with a critical point of view informed by, among others, the social sciences and philosophical ethics. It gives due attention to particular visions of the good life and of the “status of humans” (10) without losing touch with the claims of universalist ethical criteria (“the deontological test” [52]). It may also be called “antifoundationalist” in that it begins with history and moral tradition rather than with empirical research as a supposedly objective basis.<br>

Abstract: Interestingly enough, this “clear cultural‐political thrust,” while the most important characteristic of re‐visionary fiction in Widdowson’s analysis, is also the one least developed. In this article, I am precisely challenging the taken‐for‐grantedness of the political thrust of rewritings. It might be worth noting that Widdowson’s article was published while this one was under review.<br>

Abstract: Popper would have none of it for two reasons. Being a philosopher of science, Popper believed that history is “characterized by its interest in actual, singular, or specific events, rather than in laws or generalizations” [
      75p. 143]. For Popper, history becomes an empirical science, like other disciplines within the social sciences, because of its interest in particular acts and events. This view of history goes back to Thucydides. There is a second reason, however, for Popper’s disdain for this version of historicism. Anyone who has read his earlierThe Open Society and Its Enemiesknows that Popper sees in Plato’s essentialist analysis of the state and in Hegel’s dialectical theory of history the two foundations of twentieth‐century totalitarianism [76, vol. 1, p. 24; vol. 2, p. 193.]. Totalitarianism is the opposite of what Herder intended in his philosophical reflections on the history of mankind. Only in a free and open society could Herder’s historicism become possible for scholars to use.<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives.

Abstract: Augustine relegates the rational aspects of scientific thinking to the soul’s
         ratio, that is, our faculty of analysis and synthesis (De ordine2.11.30;De diversis quaestionibus ad Simpl. 2.2.3), and contrasts rationality with intelligence (intelligentia), the soul’s faculty to acquire wisdom (sapientia) and act accordingly (De Trinitate12.3.3, 12.12.19;De ordine2.30;De immortalitate animae10.17). Rationality is instrumental; unless guided by intelligence, it is not affectively accountable. In the moral universe of Augustine’s subordination of human affection and family responsibility to religious devotion, for instance, the individual who despairs at the disruption, the “privation of solace” (deserabar tam magno eius solacio) brought about in his daily life by the demise of a dear one who used to “serve” him or her (servitus ab illa mihi), acts rationally (i.e., in self‐interest) yet unintelligently; on the contrary, the individual who, regardless of personal inconvenience, rejoices at his or her dear one’s assumption in heaven, acts irrationally yet intelligently (i.e., affectively or, in this specific case, altruistically) (Confessions9.12).<br>

Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Wars that do pass muster on just‐war terms have both moral and political benefits. Put more abstractly, when just‐war morality is expanded to connect with the habits of social criticism, it can contribute to the twin needs of legitimation and justification in democratic contexts. Obviously these points take us beyond Augustine and his vision of a just war. As a product of the premodern era, just‐war doctrine is typically viewed as enabling us to address a war’s moral justification (or lack thereof). But legitimation is different. In modern, democratic settings legitimation turns on the presence of consent (tacit or explicit) to acts authorized by public officials. Its value lies in the democratic commitment to hold authorities accountable to citizens and to provide a firm basis for political representation.
         73Concerns about legitimation are part of a broader theory of justified political coercion: reasons should be provided to persons whose liberties are restricted by a policy. Otherwise such restrictions are tyrannical, imposed heteronomously. Thompson and Gutmann remind us that legitimation is premised on the idea that “the moral authority of collective judgments about policy depends in part on the moral quality of the process by which citizens collectively reach those judgments.”74Drawing on the habits of self‐restraint, critical self‐analysis, and willingness to deliberate publicly, the ethics of war can seek the best of both worlds. Just‐war morality can provide moral resources for ensuring that we enter a war that reflects the popular will, one that does not seek to impose its will unjustly on that of others.<br>

Abstract: Now, the “world,” as I understand it, is a concept one uses for the complex ecology of reflexively interacting environments and the values historically etched into them. As human power grows through technological means, so too does our responsibility and also, interestingly, the world. In fact, our global age is a time of many worlds arising and reflexively interacting around the planet, and this challenges human beings to orient existence amid the possible collision and clash of diverse value orientations.
         34The current attacks on human agency in the name of the fate of Being, like Heidegger's, or nonpersonal social forces, in different ways by Luhmann and Foucault, are wide of the mark. The increase of power expands rather than effaces agency and responsibility; it creates new worlds, for good or ill. We must, then, insist on the work of ethics within the academy since it provides a normative discourse of power and responsible agency linked to the articulation and analysis of the lived structure of reality as itself structured through the interactions among agents and surrounding historically shaped environments. On this point, the religions and the legacy of humanism were right to explore agents who fashion worlds.<br>

Abstract: Excavating Victoriansbrings out very clearly the discomfort the newly discovered vast expanse of geological time gave the Victorians and examines some of the writings that helped shape responses to it. Though the book may not be of particular relevance to the historian focusing closely on Victorian geology or archaeology, for the historian of science who examines wider cultural or literary phenomena it is an important guide to the stimulus that the writings of geologists and archaeologists gave other mid-Victorian writers. Nevertheless, the specialist or narrowly focused historian of science will probably find it frustrating rather than helpful, since the overviews of Victorian geology and archaeology are brief and there are distracting errors, such as the attribution of theNinth Bridgewater Treatiseto William Buckland rather than to Charles Babbage (p. 18). The chapters on Tennyson and Dickens are both interesting and illuminating, although a reader accustomed to historical argument and with limited knowledge of the techniques of literary criticism may find them faintly bewildering in places. Nonetheless, it is in this part of the analysis that the work provides valuable guidance to the historian of science.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur,  Paul<br>
Abstract: This volume is something of a companion to Ricoeur’s earlier collection,
      The Just(Chicago, 2000), but positions the question differently. Ricoeur characterizes the aim of the earlier volume as a focused treatment of the relationship between justice as a moral ideal and justice as a system of institutions. “In the present volume, the adjective ‘just’ is traced back to its terminological and conceptual source, as we find it in Plato’s Socratic dialogues” (1). The volume is divided into three parts, titled respectively, “Studies,” “Readings,” and “Exercises.” This tripartite structure is one that appears constantly in Ricoeur's work. The essays in the first section isolate the idea of justice. In this initial section, Ricoeur brings thought to bear on the principal phenomenological structures through which the problematic of justice manifests itself: the necessary distance introduced into the question of justice by the imposition of a rule of justice, the relation of passivity and autonomy in the articulation of the imperative of justice, the paradoxical nature of authority, and the aporia that opens between the reflection of justice as an abstract, transhistorical ideal and justice as a historically conditioned set of institutional practices. The essays in the second section place the idea in the context of thought about justice. The principal figures who come into the discussion here are Kant, Weber, and Charles Taylor. The essays in the third section deal with the ideal of justice in the realm of practical, or regional, ethics; Ricoeur’s primary interests here are legal and medical ethics and their similarities, differences, and relations. In each of these proceeding sections, issues raised in the first section are taken up and dealt with at a progressively less abstract level. There is then a discernible trajectory that holds these essays together, one that might be characterized, without too much oversimplification, as a movement from abstract structuring of~<br>

Abstract: This second, more normative dimension of Mrozik’s project opens up some challenging questions. If it is the case, as she suggests, that a sympathetic reading of the
   Compendium of Trainingcan provide valuable intellectual resources for contemporary ethical reflection, it remains unclear to me how our engagement with this text should proceed, given the significant disparities in cosmological assumptions (e.g., karmic causation and rebirth) and forms of practice that separate Mrozik’s contemporary readers from the text’s original audience. The text, moreover, appears less concerned with advancing particular truth claims than with creating a distinctive kind of religious subjectivity through ascetic and ritualized practice. Can we assess the value of the text’s ethical ideals apart from the forms of discipline and practice with which they were linked in medieval India? IfVirtuous Bodiesleaves such questions open to further exploration and analysis, its nuanced reading of theCompendium of Trainingbrings into sharper focus the centrality of human embodiment in South Asian Buddhist religious discourses and encourages us to reflect deeply on its implications for our own ethical inquiry.<br>

Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: This emphasis—for example, one “must act in order to receive” (N5554, fol. 11v), and God as a “prior actuality” (N4816)—brings Coleridge far closer to Marion’s analysis than to Derrida’s, insofar as prayer responds to an always already present effect, claim, gift, or call. Marion presents prayer as language directed at a requisite (
         aition, or cause) from whom beings “receive themselves … as requestants.”64This is why he later argues that Derrida’s objections hold only if naming God is seen as attempting to overcome a lack or deficiency in one’s intuition of God. Marion insists that the intuition is, by contrast, present as an excess—a saturated phenomenon—that demands a proliferation of names: father, love, beauty, holiness, and so on.65Naming, in this infinitely multiplying sense, would thus be not a determination of God but a way of guarding against the illusion that any one name of God is determinative.66Yet if prayer responds and bears witness to a certain call already made on the subject, Marion arguably renders prayer too easy. After all, it is only a minor shift from the human experience of loving to praising God as love.67<br>

Abstract: Despite these oppositions, secularization and resacralization should be regarded as complementary phenomena that arose in response to the problem of a radically transcendent, hidden God.

Novel conceptions of society, the nation, Scripture, and personhood followed from an intensification of divine transcendence, and, at the same time, necessitated a reworking of the immanent relations between worldly persons, institutions, and things. It was not merely that secularization, now understood by Bell and others as the translation of divine authority into a worldly register, entailed that the latter incorporate the properties and prerogatives once reserved for God alone. Enlightenment-era efforts to resacralize the self as an object of a totalizing force—situated either in the mystic divine or in a purely immanent, materialist conception of nature—suggest another dynamic at work: the closing of the chasm between the divine and terrestrial spheres and the identification of one with the other. Even if human effort was increasingly regarded as the source of one's understanding of the world, the humans undertaking this work had become newly alien to themselves, and in a manner that recalled the radical distance of the divine.<br>

Article Title: The Last Night: Ritualized Violence and the Last Instructions of 9/11<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651998<br>
Date: 07 2010<br>
Author(s): Kitts Margo<br>
Abstract: We have touched upon Rappaport’s point that the more likely people are to violate a convention, the more fixed, more constraining, even more reifying, will be the ritual form that instantiates it. This exhortation seems to reify the oath of the final instructions' section 1. Notable is the sequence of second person imperatives—subordinate one’s soul, incite it, purify it, understand it—which speaks to Tambiah’s analysis of a ritual’s “compelling illocutionary words of command and persuasion or declaration” whose ultimate purpose is to produce “a sense of heightened and intensified and fused communication.”
            63The use of successive imperatives from a family of ideas might be seen as repeating on different frequencies the same core message. As Tambiah has pointed out, the same message may be communicated in a plethora of different ways or by a plethora of symbolic acts that overdetermine the ritual’s message, making it difficult to resist. The imperatives are aimed at inducing a high communicational register and overcoming individual resistance to the sanctified mission.<br>

Article Title: Critique and Promise in Paul Tillich’s Political Theology: Engaging Giorgio Agamben on Sovereignty and Possibility<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: The sort of possibility and actuality that accompanies this notion of promise Tillich describes in his essay as a giving that is communicable and therefore dispossessive of its own sovereignty. While Agamben’s analysis of potentiality issues in a being that forever retains its own power while giving itself to itself in actuality, being promised communicates itself to another, to the one outside of itself and so offers itself in a differential (the token) so as to fulfill itself to another. Thus, we can see that another kind of possibility is needed to reconstruct the political. The promise addresses, refers, and performs; this is the case even if the promise is in some sense creative of the one that the promisor addresses, as is the case of giving new names to Abram and Sarai. Contrast this with a pure gift that never arrives, never is present to consciousness. The pure gift may interrupt, but it does not create in the way that a gift as promise does. It, as Tillich pointed out, may criticize and negate without ever saying “Yes” or issuing in new forms, actions that all preserve the purity of the gift from any exchange. The pure gift only dwells in the negative, shattering ordinary attempts to fulfill the demands of reciprocity by offering in return a gift of equivalence. Promise issues itself into the field of exchange.<br>

Author(s): Bono James J.<br>
Abstract: If, as I have suggested, literature and science shares with the history of science a concern to understand the making of science—that is, the making of the different forms of knowledge of things and events in nature—through attentive focus on scientific practice(s) as performative, then we should ask how the distinctive ways in which each field contributes to an understanding of the making of science might lead to fruitful convergences and interdependencies. The essays that follow contribute to this goal. Crucial here, I would argue, is a fundamental question: How does the analysis of literary and linguistic dimensions of scientific practice and communication map onto the preoccupations of historians of science with the material practices of scientists? What this question in turn reveals is an abiding, if false, dichotomy: that between discourse and (material) practice or, to put it differently, between text and action.<br>

Abstract: It is a truism to state that there are as many Augustines as there are interpreters or, in any case, schools of interpretation.
      
            His work could be called an1
         opera aperta, albeit in quite a different sense from the way this expression was meant by its inventor, Umberto Eco.
            Eco's use of this phrase mainly concerned modernist works, such as Joyce's2
         Ulysses, whose very structure allows the reader to find his way in the labyrinth of the artwork without ever arriving at—or, for that matter, departing from—one single, fixed level of meaning. The metaphor of theopera apertaopened up a peculiar combination of structure and randomness, the latter made even more mysterious by modernism's emphasis on austerity of form. While it cannot be denied that for Joyce the fact that every line and every word were meticulously planned and put in their proper place was the precondition for the emergence of riddles and clues, thus widening up the scope of language and meaning, for Augustine things seem to be quite different inasmuch as the flow and width of his discourse is in place right from the beginning. In his case, randomness seems to be part of the structure of the discourse itself, to the extent of beguiling Henri-Irénée Marrou—still the most prominent historian of Augustinian rhetoric—into accusing Augustine of a lack of rhetorical skills: “Saint Augustin compose mal.”
            Fortunately, Marrou retracted this accusation in a later edition of his book:3
         
            One wonders whether this new appreciation of Augustine's style, being part of aI took for incapacity or indifference what was in fact conscious discretion, calculated flexibility, expressive deformation, brought about by adroit maneuvering. I took for barbarism or decadence what was in fact the supreme sophistication of an art that was completely in control of its own techniques and in search of subtle effects.

Author(s): Bowman Sharon<br>
Abstract: There are also evident similarities between Larmore’s account and Korsgaard’s analysis of “self-constitution” via the unity of reasons (theoretical and practical) that one acknowledges and maintains. Larmore’s book first appeared in French in 2004 and thus was presumably composed around the same time as Korsgaard’s Locke Lectures—and Larmore’s analysis of reasons develops themes already introduced in his
      The Morals of Modernity(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996, esp. chap. 5). But Larmore’s view is clearly distinguished from Korsgaard’s and Sartre’s (which is discussed in detail) by his cogent arguments that reasons which hold together a self (92) cannot get their normative force merely from the agent’s choice or endorsement (95) but require an authority that comes from the apparent objective worth of their objects. Like Gary Watson, Eleonore Stump, Susan Wolf, and others, he also rightly applies this modification to Harry Frankfurt’s account, noting that a second-order desire (or volition) only has the requisite authority if it “embodies an evaluation of the desires to which it refers” (98). Larmore might have clarified this by referring to Charles Taylor’s concept of “strong evaluation,” but he obscures Taylor’s distinction by arguing that all desires involve a normative element. His account is notable for this detailed “Normativist Conception of the Mind” (chap. 4), his related reconstruction of “first person authority” (chap. 5), and his sustained critique and reconstruction of “authenticity” ideals (chaps. 1–3). I begin with brief comments on the narrative account of chapter 7.<br>

Abstract: Historical realities, from the ziggurats of Babylon to the sixth-century exile, inform LaCocque’s study, but his real interest lies in the literary ingenuity of J, a “composer” who inherits a wide range of traditions. How these traditions are handed down is always difficult to establish, a point LaCocque makes with understated eloquence: “Literary themes are floating around, ready to be used by anyone” (15). The difficulty is establishing not only how ancient authors came upon these themes, but also how later readers variously interpret them. LaCocque’s own detailed analysis of the text, ranging across the methodological spectrum of biblical and literary studies, makes his readings cogent and compelling.<br>

Author(s): Regan Ethna<br>
Abstract: Regan’s chief impetus for writing the book is the assumption that rights talk is anathema to theology. She addresses this assumption from several distinct perspectives: via definition, description, theological construction, and critical analysis. As a matter of defining human rights, Regan aims to show that one of the bases for the perceived opposition between theology and human rights lies in an overly narrow conception of the nature and scope of human rights discourse. Given her experiences working with street children in Trinidad, Regan rejects the view that human rights discourse merely defines human beings as atomistic, autonomous rights-bearers with few ethical imperatives. To correct the perception that human rights and theology are mutual antagonists, she articulates a definition of human rights as a “dialectical boundary discourse,” by which she means that human rights ought to be understood as a rich discourse that operates within a specified sphere. As a discourse, human rights consist in more than the lowest limits of ethical conduct. They express an intrinsic conviction that humans ought to flourish and that certain conditions can destroy, distort, or thwart the potential for human flourishing. Human rights discourse does not itself define human flourishing or delineate the conditions of human flourishing, but rather adopts a
      via negativa, drawing on examples from human experience to articulate conditions that prevent, disrupt, or damage capacities to flourish. In this way, human rights discourse adopts a role that Regan describes as “protective marginality,” not serving as ends in themselves but located at the margins of ethics, carving out a space within which ethical life may be possible, leaving the task of fuller development of ethics within this sphere to other discourses. By defining human rights as a dialectical boundary discourse of protective marginality, Regan shows that there is no necessary conflict between theological ethics and theo~<br>

Abstract: There is a broad rift in the work on theory in the academy generally between realism, favored by scholars (often scholar activists), who typically work with concrete communities, and constructivism, typically favored by more philosophically inclined scholars, whose primary work is the analysis of texts and textual traditions. Marxist sociology is a paradigmatic example of the former; deconstruction is a classic case of the latter.<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: While Csordas favors an analysis of evil in its “most immediate sense,” a caveat is needed here. Indeed, if he stresses “evil at the human and intersubective level of analysis rather than to cosmological or radical evil,” how then does this match with his earlier statement about focusing on the “immediate existential sense” of evil, which cross-cultural ethnographies show more related to the cosmological, and/or the numinous dimensions defining the limits of morality? Moreover, for many societies, social ties link not only humans among themselves but also with many kinds of beings and what Westerners call “natural phenomena” and different sorts of materialities. So, the trope “a human phenomenon rather than cosmological or radical evil” tends to restrict the scope of the whole endeavor against a wider view of what “human” and “intersubjectivity” mean (see, e.g., Jackson
         1998; Wright2005). Even though I find positive the use of the notion of evil in this discussion, in the long run the “problem of evil” may result too Christianocentric and Western, in spite of Csordas’s efforts to neutralize its cultural load. As a suggestion, maybe the notion of “power” or “potency,” derived from Rudolf Otto’s work (1925), could provide a better term to refer both to the numinous/ominous cosmological forces involved in human moral life, and what Western Junguian psychology (Jung2008) identifies as the “shadow” and its relations with personal Destiny. Here the dimensions of the outside (cosmic) and the inside (psyche) might express their “power” and “potency” embedded in concrete individual and collective events.<br>

Author(s): Fisher Cass<br>
Abstract: The treatment of the ancient and modern examples is also somewhat too neat and overly selective. For example, it is definitely appropriate to analyze the relationship between theory and practice in rabbinic Judaism on the basis of Hadot’s analysis of ancient philosophy. But Fisher should have reflected on the interplay of theory and praxis in rabbinic Judaism in light of the Aristotelian tradition, which is utterly and consistently ignored in this book. Similarly, Fisher admits that his analysis of
      Mekhihta of Rabbi Yishmaelis indebted to Max Kadushin’s insightful presentation of rabbinic Judaism as “organismic” system of value concepts (105), but Fisher does not analyze the philosophical basis of Kadushin’s reading, as does Peter Ochs, whose book is cited in the notes but whose analysis is not engaged. The treatment of Rosenzweig also exhibits a penchant for selectivity. To show how his model of Jewish theological practice applies to contemporary debates about Rosenzweig and therefore to contemporary Jewish theology, Fisher singles out two interpreters: Leora Batnitzky (whose interpretation he finds “idiosyncratic” [163]) and Peter Gordon (who is accused of “grossly distor[ting] Rosenzweig’s point” [166]). While Fisher’s own interpretation of Rosenzweig is most suggestive, whether Jewish theological practice is a viable model cannot be decided by showing the limitations of two interpretations of Rosenzweig to the exclusion of all others.<br>

Author(s): Gutterman David S.<br>
Abstract: Ultimately it is at times unclear what is gained in making these comparisons or if such analysis “enhances our understanding of the relationship between religious narratives and politics” (p. 92). What precisely is revealed in grouping these movements together, other than that political crisis invites prophetic criticism? Gutterman carefully unpacks the readings of shared Biblical texts, and he skillfully details contextual and interpretative differences. But one wishes he had gone beyond these descriptive endeavors to construct a more nuanced account of the relationship between religion and politics and, more importantly, of the specifically religious grounds of the activism he examines. While Gutterman can be theoretically deft—in exploring the relation between narrative and politics (p. 21) or garden/wilderness metaphors (p. 47)—he is not fully engaged with the literature on political religion, often citing unrepresentative figures like William Connolly or Stephen Carter. He is a sharp writer with an eye for interesting problems and material. I applaud his engagement with important issues and also the ambition of his thinking. But his central categories require further explication, and this book speaks to the need for more conversations across disciplines.<br>

Author(s): Moatti Claudia<br>
Abstract: AbstractThis paper isolates movement as a topic for analysis in Roman imperial history. Movement is regarded under three aspects: translation (of texts, practices, ideas), migration (of officials, merchants, students, etc.), and communication (i.e. the movement of written documents). Interrelationships among the three aspects of movement are identified and discussed, as are the shared impact of translation, migration, and communication on issues of cultural and social identity and political negotiation and control. The article argues that movement changes the role of the state as well as relations between individual and states, augments the use of writing in society, transforms identities, and gives impulse to internal and external regulations. The implications of movement are understood as both pragmatic and formal, altering relations to space and time and influencing ways of organizing and thinking. The author surveys current work in the field and identifies potential areas for future research. The paper draws heavily on both literary and documentary sources and discusses material from the late republic through late antiquity, paying particular attention to continuities and discontinuities between early and later periods of the Roman empire.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores visual response methods as a representation of student learning in a college-level interdisciplinary curriculum integrating art and engineering. The visual response methods, specifically visual journals and postcards, are examples of authentic assessment and alternative data collection methods embedded in a mixed-methods (qualitative dominant) practitioner research case study. In the paper, we focus on different means for analyzing these visual responses (e.g., through hermeneutic analysis, document analysis, and narrative analysis) and deliberate the contribution of diverse analysis methods to the researchers’ understanding of students’ experiences of interdisciplinarity in this course.<br>

Abstract: In his 1986 essay on the intersections between music theory, phenomenology, and perception, David Lewin develops a heuristic model through which to come to terms with the constitution of multiple and heterogeneous perceptions of musical events. One of his principal vehicles for demonstrating this phenomenological turn is the well-known analysis of Schubert's “Morgengruß.” The present article considers the ramifications of Lewin's methodology, particularly with respect to the experience of time that emerges from Lewin's mobilization of the heuristic perception model, by approaching it from the perspective of Husserl's
         Phenomenology of Internal Time Consciousness. This perspective reveals a superposition of temporalities as well as a superposition of languages as the underlying factors through which Lewin's analysis is produced.<br>

Abstract: A number of Maybeck scholars emphasize his dedication to the truthful representation of construction materials, often in the context of their discussion of his debt to Viollet-le-Duc's theory. See Cardwell,
               Bernard Maybeck, 58, 73. Woodbridge quotes Charles Keeler, who embraced young architect's design philosophy because "Maybeck detested 'sham, veneers, and things done for sheer effect. If the material used was wood, it should look like wood, not stone'" (Woodbridge,Bernard Maybeck, 24). In fact, the relatively cool reception of the palace was partially due to perception that in this project—a pastiche over light wood and metal frame—Maybeck moved away from the ideal of structural honesty. In this respect, an interesting insight could be found in McCoy's analysis. She also admired Maybeck's honest treatment of wood (McCoy,Five California Architects, 11, 15). However, she also noticed that Maybeck developed a similar approach to plaster. She mentioned Maybeck's experimentations with this material as an attempt to use it in an innovative and honest way, not merely as a cheap substitute for stone (ibid., 13, 18).<br>

Abstract: Stanton Marlan, “Hesitation and Slowness: Gateway to Psyche's Depth,” San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal, 2005, 24:1, 17-27. This paper focuses on hesitation and slowness in the work of Jungian analysis. It emphasizes the importance of patience as a way of achieving depth and of avoiding facile and abstract formulations that lack respect for the true otherness of the analysand and for the fundamental enigmas of analytic work. Alongside the techniques of Freud and Jung, and drawing on Alchemy and on Renaissance and Eastern wisdom traditions, the author articulates a complex notion of hesitation. The paper deconstructs simple binary pairings of fast and slow and suggests an attitude of purposeless wandering as an important compensation to the overly technologically-oriented attitudes and fast-paced culture that have invaded our therapeutic sensibilities and consulting rooms.<br>

Abstract: Examination of two texts generated by the student massacre at the Plaza de Tlatelolco in 1968:
            Postdataby Octavio Paz, andLa noche de Tlatelolcoby Elena Poniatowska. Paz's totalizing vision interprets the events as providing answers to the questions about the nation posed inEl laberinto de la soledad, and he insists on the need to rewrite Mexico's history under the aegis of a new genealogy. Poniatowska's book, instead, is ruled by fragmentation and plurality, to convey the often dissonant voices of civil society. The analysis scrutinizes literary form as it is made to represent relations between violence, justice and aesthetics.<br>

Abstract: The L.D.S Church's use of commemorative rituals and narrative history to simultaneously adapt and maintain identity is not unique, but it is uniquely available to analysis because of the immediacy of the change and the Saints' devotion to record-keeping. Thus, the drama of LDS survival during the Progressive Era illuminates age-old religious strategies for adaptation to social norms, which strategies preserve the faithful's confidence in the timelessness of their god's moral and ecclesiastical order. More narrowly, these events in American church history are critical for understanding how the civilly disobedient Saints finally accepted the rule of federal law without losing their religion.<br>

Abstract: Abstract: Vico's theory of metaphor is best understood as a monster in the tradition of classical rhetorical invention. It is the mutant offspring of metaphor characterized as "necessary" (an "ear" of com, for example) and metaphor characterized in terms of analogy. From the perspective of his method. Vico marries these apparently incompatible forms inherited from Aristotle and thereby identifies a third type of linguistic metaphor. I argue that the metaphor identifies a stipulatory definition taken out of context. In order to situate this claim, I outline Vico's genetic analysis and elaborate in general terms what metaphor and definition share. Most importantly. Vico insists that beings, actions, and events are linguistically identifiedin some particular diseursive context. Indeed, in many cases that context alone determines whether the expression can be called a definition or a metaphor. Like Cicero's ideal jurist, Vico's hero employs motivated words and realizes possibilities available to common sense. Henee Vico's theory of metaphor is both "constructivist"—language has the power to makes things—and "humartist"—it must do so in a form appropriate to history and culture. Vico's theory is consequently important to us because it challenges the proper/figurative distinction championed in the philosophy of language and adds a pragmatic dimension to contemporary views of metaphor at work in literary theory.<br>

Abstract: On enigma as a rhetorical figure: a brief history in the rhetoricians, encyclopedists, and patristic commentators from Aristotle to Dante's time, with a rhetorical analysis of the figure. Special attention is given to Augustine in the
         De trinitateXV on St. Paul's well-known "in aenigmate" (I Cor.13:12). Some implications of Augustine's linking of the figurative and the figural (typological, historical) are considered, with a re-examination of Auerbach's "Figura" on this question. The importance for our own reading of rhetoric in relation to history and poetry is stressed.<br>

Issue: si.1986.9.issue-1<br>

Author(s): Kleinman Sherryl<br>
Abstract: Many sociologists have tried in vain to find the “true” meaning of the classic works in the discipline. An interactionist perspective suggests that this search is not a valid one for sociologists, especially symbolic interactionists. Although there can be no “true” meaning, some authors use conventions of writing that make their work more
         orless clear. Using Mead'sMind, Self and Societyas an example, we discuss the dimensions of clarity. We then argue that the sociological classics should be read to (I) simulate new theories and research (pragmatic analysis), (2) determine how sociologists have used that classic to support or refute particular theories or perspectives (rhetorical analysis), and (3) provide information about the sociological concerns of the author and his/her contemporaries (historical analysis).<br>

Article Title: Text and Temporality: Patterned-Cyclical and Ordinary-Linear Forms of Time-Consciousness, Inferred from a Corpus of Australian Aboriginal and Euro-Australian Life-Historical Interviews<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: si.1999.22.issue-2<br>
Date: August 1999<br>
Author(s): TenHouten Warren D.<br>
Abstract: It is argued that autobiographical texts, such as life-historical interviews, provide the richest possible source of information about a person's temporality and a culture's historical past. It is proposed that time-consciousness can be inferred from such texts. To this end, ethnographic and other studies of Australian Aboriginal time-consciousness were used to construct a seven-part model of patterned-cyclical time-consciousness. Turning these seven attributes of patterned-cyclical time-consciousness into their opposites yields seven features of one-dimensional, ordinary-linear time-consciousness, thereby establishing a structured temporal polarity. A lexical-level, content-analytic methodology, Neurocognitive Hierarchical Categorization Analysis (NHCA), is introduced, in which folk-concepts of time from
         Roget's International Thesauruswere used to construct wordlist indicators for 9 of the 14 definitional components. Then, using NHCA for a comparative analysis of texts consisting of life-historical interviews, earlier results of an empirical study were brieflv re-presented. Australian Aborigines, compared to Euro-Australian controls, used a significantly smaller proportion of words for an index of ordinary-linear time but a higher proportion of words for an index of patterned-cyclical time, indicating a time-consciousness that is primarily patterned-cyclical rather than linear. Females were less linear and more patterned-cyclical than males in both cultures. These cross-cultural results contribute predictive validity to the proposed polarity of time-consciousness. Implications for the culture-and-cognition paradox and its resolution in dual-brain theory are addressed.<br>

Abstract: There are two ways of reading Goffman--as a theorist of trust and ritual accommodation, that is, as a theorist of the interaction order, or as a theorist of deception. I suggest a way of making these two readings compatible, by arguing that Goffman was interested in what I call the “production of credibility.” Credibility is the quality of being believable, and this quality is integral to both trust and deception. Viewed in this way, Goffman explored the ways in which people make their actions convincing to other people. Although Goffman's analysis of the interaction order did not need a theory of the self, his work actually contains two quite different theories of the self: one linked to role analysis, one to his analysis of mental illness. I argue for the latter at the expense of the former. I conclude that Goffman both initiated substantive work about the interaction order and contributed to a synthesis of a theory of the interaction order and a theory of the self.<br>

Abstract: This article combines a narrative approach on life histories, inspired by Paul Ricoeur, with the symbolic interactionist approaches of George Herbert Mead and Erving Goffman. It focuses on "negotiations" in qualitative interviews with alcoholics, that is, narrative sequences in which the interviewee's line comes into conflict with the line of the interviewer. From a larger study of drinking careers among alcoholics in Copenhagen, two interviews are singled out for a more detailed analysis. The two interviewees did not live up to the (implicit) expectations of the study: the presumptions (a) that persons contacted at institutions for heavily addicted alcoholics do indeed identify themselves as alcoholics and (b) that alcoholics are interested in structuring their life histories according to the development of their drinking problems. By struggling to defend an alternative identity for themselves than the one the interviewer had in readiness for them, the interviewees laid bare the (problematic) therapeutic framework of the study.<br>

Author(s): Bernasconi Oriana<br>
Abstract: Sociology and neighboring disciplines have produced different analytic tools to examine the dialogical relationship between individuals and society ("narrative work," "identity work," "moral career," "moral breakdown"). However, the question of how individuals negotiate the interpretation of personal experience over their lifetimes in a changing cultural context remains unexplored. This article introduces narrative elasticity as a feature of narrative work and as a time-sensitive analytic tool for conducting inquiries into processes of temporal retraction and expansion of what storytellers conceive as the normal order of significance. The application of this tool to the analysis of mature and elderly Chileans' life stories shows how cultural change occurs at the individual level, considers factors that motivate and inhibit processes of reinterpretation of personal experience, and identifies different levels at which it operates.<br>

Abstract: The rhetorical techniques by which governments deny, justify, and qualify alleged instances of torture have been well documented. Sociologists, however, have neglected the social contexts in which officials confront allegations of torture, as well as officials' use of evidence to strengthen their own or weaken competing claims about torture. Relying on findings from a qualitative content analysis of seven Senate Armed Services Committee hearings held in 2004 on “detainee abuse” at Abu Ghraib prison, this article examines the processes by which hearing participants portrayed the violence there as an isolated incident. Building on James A. Holstein and Jaber F. Gubrium's (2003) “constructionist analytics,” I examine the textual mediation of claims-making in the hearings, focusing on the interplay between textual realities of detainee abuse and the interpretive uses to which hearing participants put these realities. I show that developments in the textual environment of the hearings, particularly the development of a textually mediated vantage on events that “really occurred” throughout Afghanistan and Iraq, provided hearing participants with rich interpretive materials to downplay and rationalize instances of abuse that occurred in places other than Abu Ghraib prison. These findings suggest that official denial is sustained by diverse claims-making activities, including the production of a textual reality of human rights violations. The findings also extend the purview of social problems theory to account for the role of texts in the construction of social problems.<br>

Abstract: Viewing the Constitution of the United States of America as a political text leads to the application of techniques of textual analysis when reading it. Textual analysis shows the Constitution to be incomplete, both as a constitution and as a founding instrument of the federal union. A complete text of a constitution for the United States requires inclusion of the state constitutions, and a complete text of a founding instrument for the United States requires inclusion of the Declaration of Independence. Any meaning to be derived from the U. S. Constitution, including the intentions of the Founders, requires taking into account the purpose for which the Constitution is being read, what constitutes a complete text for that purpose, and the context in which the document was written.<br>

Article Title: Education as Text: The Varieties of Educational Hiddenness<br>
Publisher: John Wiley & Sons<br>
Issue: i250429<br>
Date: 12 1, 1968<br>
Author(s): Wittgenstein David<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricoeur and Clifford Geertz have been concerned with the notion of human action as text. This text, like all texts, has manifest and hidden meanings. The hidden meanings indicate a "semantic" function of social activities, in the sense that they provide members of a society with readings of their experience, by telling them about themselves, their values, beliefs, and cultures. Ricoeur's and Geertz's ideas are used to examine the notion of "education as text". Because Ricoeur and Geertz stress hidden meaning, their ideas lead us to an analysis of the "hidden curriculum". The hidden curriculum is a reading of an educational text, normally performed by students. However, as Ricoeur argues, texts can be read by anyone. The question then arises: which sort of hidden curriculum is read not only by the students, but by all members of society? What sort of reading of society's experience is provided when education is a text read by all? I propose the hypothesis that education then becomes a text about society's myths and sacred beliefs.<br>

Article Title: Entrepreneurial Education Makes Its Debut in Israel: New Curriculum in an Ideological Shift<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers, Inc.<br>
Issue: i250458<br>
Date: 4 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): Yehoshua Dani<br>
Abstract: The introduction of entrepreneurial education (EE) in the Israeli education system is discussed in this article as an example of the introduction of new curriculum. We argue that this introduction should be construed as a consequence of major ideological changes in Israel and its education system, a change from collectivist to individualistic values. We open with an analysis of a Ministry of Education publication that introduces the EE program and find that it is loaded with references to Zionist myths. We suggest that relying on references to these myths in promoting EE reflects a need to disguise the discontinuity between the social values behind the new curriculum and the traditional collectivist values of pioneering Zionism. We note that the Israeli programs exercise EE in groups, whereby the responsibility for the new ventures is shared by the group members. We suggest that adopting the group method indicates a compromise between a completely individualistic and competitive approach to entrepreneurship and a collectivist approach to coping with new tasks-which is more in line with traditional Zionist values. We argue that the change of atmosphere from collectivism to individualism is a result of demographic and economic processes that have occurred since the establishment of the Israeli state, and that these processes may be exposed through observing the Israeli youth movements and the public discourse. We believe that the gradual shift from collectivism to individualism is a central factor in explaining the timing of EE's introduction in Israel.<br>

Abstract: This paper follows two purposes: the first to unpack some of the artistic cargo of symbols as distinct from the more conventional aspects of them (e. g., their ability to refer to other things or events, and their ability to communicate ideas), and the second to show, by means of contrasts, the actual workings of Interpretation Theory as it could be applied to the analysis of art-making and art-viewing. For the first purpose, the author draws material from philosophy, dramatic writings, linguistic theory, and statements of artists in an analytic search for the often intractable character of the artistic image. For the second purpose, the author demonstrates, through the use of logic and the poetic metaphor, how a particular form of hermeneutic inquiry can be applied to assist an understanding of the assumptions upon which research is often built.<br>

Publisher: National Art Education Association<br>

Abstract: The feminist pedagogical approach introduced here can raise self-awareness about gender inscriptions that people bestow on what they perceive. Gender inscriptions are normative assumptions formed as abstract idealized perceptions of gender (Hayles, 1992). These inscriptions are embedded in society's signs and discourse and appear natural, yet they are often at odds with our lived-experiences. As we expose these "normative" stereotypes we recognize that these constructed perceptions are attitudes that prejudice art as noteworthy or insignificant. Stereotypes of females tend to be aligned with qualities not highly valued in this society and do not match prevalent definitions of art and artists. My goal in presenting this study is to encourage its use as a teaching approach that exposes gender stereotypes and the devaluation of women artists. In this interpretive content analysis, I studied viewer rationales used for inscribing an artist's gender when looking at art in order to render visible gendered cultural inscriptions. Responses suggest that gender inscription impacts how viewers interpret a work, and how men and women diverge in describing similar themes.<br>

Issue: i259940<br>
Date: 9 1, 1966<br>
Author(s): Wallace William C.<br>
Abstract: I offer an account of Weston La Barre's The Ghost Dance to indicate the continuing vitality of a Freudian ideological attack on religious beliefs and behavior. A contemporary group of social scientists, chiefly featuring Bellah, Geertz, and Luckmann, could possibly meet La Barre's sociopsychiatric challenge to religion. I examine their reliance on functional definitions of religion as a conciliatory measure designed to overcome the conflict between religious belief and the social scientific study of religion. Despite certain logical and empirical problems in the use of functional definitions of religion, I conclude that theoretical advances have been achieved in their writings. But in a more philosophical context, which is where La Barre's analysis really belongs, I suggest that their positions are logically insufficient as a rejoinder. The bridge between religion and social science, therefore, may yet contain some shaky girders.<br>

Publisher: Carfax Publishing Co.<br>
Issue: i260459<br>
Date: 3 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Willis Kevin J.<br>
Abstract: This article draws upon theories from a wide range of disciplines, including cultural studies and literary theory, to analyse representations of schooling in rock and pop songs. The songs selected cover a period from the beginning of rock 'n' roll in the 1950s, to Britpop and the present. It is argued that schooling is overwhelmingly represented as the antithesis of leisure and that in the 1960s conjuncture the representations of schooling became more and more critical. Even so, the resolution to the perceived oppression of schooling takes place at an imaginary level of fantasy. Other features of these representations are discussed, including the challenge provided in pop and rock songs to the notion of schools as spaces where relationships, romantic and/ or sexual, do not take place. The way in which temporal aspects of schooling are represented and the division between clock time and time as experienced is discussed. The formal analysis is located within a larger project of ideology critique and its strengths and weaknesses are signalled.<br>

Article Title:  Classical Ethics and Postmodern Critique: Political Philosophy in Václav Havel and Jan Patočka <br>
Publisher: University of Notre Dame<br>
Issue: i261417<br>
Date: 7 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Patoeka Edward F.<br>
Abstract: This article examines the ties between the work of Václav Havel and his dissident mentor Jan Patočka. Havel's political theory consists largely of an evocative, literary reformulation of a number of themes developed by Patočka, the student of Husserl and Heidegger generally recognized as the most significant Czech philosopher of the century. Insofar as Patočka's work continues to be ignored in the West, the intuitively appealing essays of Havel will themselves fail to be fully understood. This study offers an analysis of Havel's debt to Patočka, as well as an explication of the latter's political thought. With Patočka's phenomenological interpretation of ancient and contemporary thought, of Socrates and Heidegger, a bridge is built between the classical and the postmodern that seeks to ground ethics and politics without recourse to the foundationalism of metaphysical accounts of reality.<br>

Abstract: Although "story" and "narrative" are frequently mentioned in Voegelin's account of the structure and dynamics of human consciousness, neither he nor his commentators have closely analyzed in a direct fashion the importance of these terms to that account. This article examines their significance to Voegelin's extended analysis.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263715<br>
Date: 3 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Windisch William A.<br>
Abstract: Considered rhetorically, or by phenomenological-literary analysis, the saying about finding one's life by losing it intends to break up the continuity of existence of the hearer to the extent that he or she is left without a frame of reference. Considered from a historical-literary point of view, however, the saying occurs in an environment and presupposes a context which gives meaning to the response. A Whiteheadian or process perspective of interpretation offers an approach which can relate these two types of understanding of the saying, and can also cast light on contemporary styles of interpretation with their ontological presuppositions, either to set the saying in a framework of "rightness" or in one of "creativity."<br>

Article Title: Toward a Generic Analysis of a Classic of the Social Gospel: An Essay-Review of Walter Rauschenbusch<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263714<br>
Date: 12 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Rauschenbusch Walter<br>
Abstract: Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis, viewed by many as the masterpiece of the social gospel movement, has been confined to the dusty shelves of the library. Can we catch no glimpse of what astounded its massive reading public, no glimmer of Rauschenbusch's own sense of the work as a "dangerous book" written in fear and trembling? This article suggests that a generic analysis of Christianity and the Social Crisis might lead to surprising disclosures. Any generic analysis involves the discussion of a group of texts. Consequently this study proceeds via a comparison of the structure of Christianity and the Social Crisis with those of other works of a similar type which were produced between 1890 and 1915. The genre is isolated by utilizing the techniques of Tzvetan Todorov. Certain negative traits are specified which separate the genre from its neighbors. The positive leitmotif of a dual crisis-a crisis affecting society as a whole and the ramifications of that crisis within the Christian churches-is specified as the decisive trait of the genre. To deal with this leitmotif a specific structure was generated by the works under consideration. They provided-to pirate the words of Clifford Geertz in his landmark essay on modern ideologies-"maps of problematic reality" and "matrices for the creation of collective conscience." In designing their maps of problematic reality our authors worked along two separate but related vectors. The first of these vectors was constituted by a historical analysis of the origins of the present crisis, while the second consisted of a systemic analysis of the present social order. Each of these elements of the genre is examined in turn. The mapping of problematic reality by means of a historical and a structural analysis was geared towards provoking as well as defining the crisis. Crisis, once defined, demanded decision. Nevertheless the "permanent basis for action" which Rauschenbusch and others sought could not be groun~<br>

Article Title: Ricoeur's "Symbolism of Evil" and Cross-Cultural Comparison: The Representation of Evil in Maya Indian Culture<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263706<br>
Date: 12 1, 1951<br>
Author(s): Makemson Laurence L.<br>
Abstract: The principal purpose of this essay is to examine the theory of culture (and the role of symbols of the sacred in culture) which is presupposed in Ricoeur's Symbolism of Evil. The examination is motivated by the question whether or not the etiology of the symbolism of evil which Ricoeur offers in his important text will stand up to the demands imposed by cross-cultural applications. It is argued that Ricoeur's exposition invites an assumption of the cross-cultural validity of his schema. The process of examination comprises two major sections. First, a synopsis of Ricoeur's text is offered to establish a working understanding of the concepts which offer themselves as integral to any cross-cultural evaluation of the "symbolism of evil." Second, a "test-case" is defined: the religious symbolisms of Maya Indian culture. The definition of this test-case involves two secondary tasks: 1) a brief description of the general features of Maya religious symbolism; and, 2) an analysis of how Ricoeur's categories of the symbolism of evil fail to define accurately symbolisms of evil which occur in Maya mythology both before and after the conquest. This analysis leads finally to an assessment of the impact of western religious symbolisms on indigenous Maya symbolisms of evil. Ultimately, Ricoeur's analysis of the symbolism of evil is argued to be invalid for cross-cultural comparisons which extend beyond the cultural ambience of the western world.<br>

Article Title: Ideology and Alienation: Theses on the Interpretation and Evaluation of Theologies of Liberation<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263710<br>
Date: 12 1, 1966<br>
Author(s): Winter Charles R.<br>
Abstract: Through the provision of a set of theses for the interpretation and evaluation of theologies of liberation, this paper attempts to mediate the existing conflict between academic theologians and theologians of liberation. It seeks to establish the legitimacy of theological discourse focused on the problem of alienation and liberation if carefully executed according to a clear set of guidelines. The paper begins with the argument that all interpretations of theologies of liberation must begin with an analysis of the theological genre within which these works fall. After insisting that theologies of liberation belong neither to the genre of systematic theology nor that of Christian social ethics, the paper develops the second thesis that theologies of liberation are best understood as members of a genre whose distinctive characteristics and functions are analogous to those intrinsic to secular ideologies. This thesis hinges upon a revisionist understanding of ideology drawn from the works of Clifford Geertz et al. and upon a careful specification of the generic similarities between the two forms of discourse. The second part of the paper moves from the level of interpretation to that of evaluation. It argues that theologies of liberation share with ideologies a tendency to occlude self-critical reflection. It suggests that a conscious recognition that theologies of liberation do not exhaust the possibilities of theological discourse but are relative models which select and interpret Christian symbols and doctrines in the light of the central dynamic of alienation and liberation might provide an antidote to this pathology. It maintains with Rosemary Ruether that there is no absolutely adequate model of alienation and liberation and that various models of alienation and liberation must be "interstructured" in order to overcome the perspectival biases of models which focus upon a single root of oppression. To establish relative degrees of adequacy between various theologi~<br>

Author(s): Williamson Tod<br>
Abstract: Using George Bataille's reflections on desire, death, and God as the basis for considering the love poetry of the Song of Songs as a manifestation of the commingling of separate realms and separate bodies in the service of a longed-for continuity helps us to see that such a commingling is never far from the domain of violence and that such continuity of being is never far from death. But the biblical book itself helps us to see something that is missing from Bataille's analysis-that is, a more complex understanding of the implications of desire for the divine. What if, contra Bataille, God were not "by definition" immune to risk? What if the divine were not understood to be perfection but, rather, bound as well to the vicissitudes of desire, with all the anguish and ecstasy that it implies? The Song of Song's lyrical presentation of Eros, carried over as it is into the tradition of allegorical interpretation, may, in fact, have rather profound implications for how we talk about God.<br>

Abstract: Anthropologists have seldom avoided anecdotal data and included in their texts information about how they produce knowledge that they claim to be true. While considering fieldwork as the foundation of their discipline as well as their identity, they have removed this activity from analysis and overlooked its relationship with textualisation. This account of fieldwork in Quilombo Frechal (Maranhao, Brazil) purports to move from "participant observation to observation of participation" (Tedlock 1991), including in written texts the process of construction of anthropological knowledge. It attempts to represent the social reality of "Others" through an analysis of one's own experience in their world.<br>

Abstract: In this essay, I explore the work of two scholars-Ian Morris and Leslie Kurke-and one of their claims: that the archaic Greek symposium served as the site for an anti-polis ideology. I first examine the conceptual underpinnings that guide their understanding of the operation of ideology. I then look closely at the arguments and evidence provided by Morris and Kurke. I argue that their respective conclusions about the symposium are not sustained even by their own evidence but rest on a set of problematic assumptions about the operation of ideology that they have imported into their analysis.<br>

Abstract: Notre analyse repose sur deux hypothèses générales complémentaires. La première hypothèse affirme l'existence non pas d'une crise de la pensée politique mais de trois situations critiques auxquelles doit faire face le pensée politique et qui déterminent des formes d'incertitude spécifiques, irréductibles les unes aux autres. La deuxième hypothèse affirme que l'intelligibilité des crises que connaît la pensée politique passe par celle des conditions politiques dans lesquelles s'exerce cette pensée. Pour préciser ces deux hypothèses nous faisons appel à un modèle construit à partir de la structure d'une action. Trois formes d'incertitude sont ainsi repérées: une incertitude concernant les valeurs, une incertitude concernant l'état des choses et une incertitude portant sur les voies d'action. Transposées sur le plan ou la dimension de la structure sociale, ces trois formes d'incertitude sont à saisir et à examiner respectivement comme crise au niveau du système de légitimation et de motivation, comme crise au niveau du système organisationnel ou des institutions et comme crise au niveau des stratégies ou système "opérationnel". Nous localisons la première forme de crise dans les sociétés du capitalisme "central", la deuxième dans les formations sociales socialistes et la troisième dans les sociétés du capitalisme "périphérique". A partir d'une analyse des conditions politiques qui ont rendu possible l'émergence de ces formes spécifiques de crise nous essayons de déterminer au moins certaines conditions nécessaires--mais non pas suffisantes--de leur dépassement. /// Two general complementary hypotheses underlie this analysis. The first contends that, although political science does not confront a crisis, it faces three critical challenges giving rise to uncertainty in the discipline. The second hypothesis asserts that to understand the present challenges testing political theory, it is necessary to relate the latter to the prevailing political context. To clarify the tw~<br>

Abstract: Freud: "The analytic treatment now proceeds to follow [the libido]; it seeks to
track down the libido, to make it accessible to consciousness and, in the end, serviceable
for reality. Where the investigations of analysis come upon the libido withdrawn into
its hiding place, a struggle is bound to break out; all the foreces which have caused the li-
bido to regreess will rise up as 'resistances' against the work of analysis, in order to con-]
serve the new state of things" (1912:12)]

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303097<br>
Date: 4 1, 1963<br>
Author(s): Wellek Chanita<br>
Abstract: This paper discusses the relationship between the Interaction theory of metaphor and Gestalt psychology. Interaction theory views the metaphor as a whole (gestalt), created by an interaction between its primary and secondary subjects. Moreover, this paper develops Interaction theory to require a full contextual analysis of the poetic metaphor embedded within its poetic text. We illustrate this Gestalt-Interaction approach by focusing on a particularly complex poetic text having multiple metaphors (Dylan Thomas's Sonnet VII, from his "Altarwise by Owl-Light" sequence). A representation employing primary semantic fields clarifies the underlying structure of the metaphor chain comprising the text.<br>

Article Title: The Reader-"Another Production": The Reception of Haykal's Biography of Muhammad and the Shift of Egyptian Intellectuals to Islamic Subjects in the 1930s<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303101<br>
Date: 7 1, 1938<br>
Author(s): Al-Zayyat Israel<br>
Abstract: This paper is an attempt to rethink the much-discussed topic of the so-called crisis of orientation among, or shift of, Egyptian intellectuals who turned to Islamic subjects in the 1930s. Those intellectuals who, during the 1920s, had adhered to the principles of Westernization and secularization were said to have abandoned these principles to embrace Islam and Arabism a decade later. The commonly ventured historical account of this shift attempted to describe and explain it from the "top down," that is, from the perspective of the intellectual producers, either on the basis of content analysis of their texts or through the reconstruction of authorial intentions. It was assumed that the impact of this shift on the culture and politics of contemporary society could be extracted from the meanings invested by the authors in their texts or from the context of the act of writing. This paper approaches the subject from a different perspective, namely, from the "bottom up." While not ignoring authorial intentions or the meanings with which authors invested their texts, I emphasize the ways in which readers reinterpreted intellectual literature on Islam as they consumed it and argue that a proper understanding of the social and political impact of literary products cannot be attained without also understanding the reception of these products. I concentrate especially on one of the major representative texts of this shift, Muhammad Husayn Haykal's biography of the Prophet, and reconstruct the different interpretations of this work's major communities of contemporary readers in the discursive context of their different "horizons of expectations." Through recontextualizing the "crisis of orientation" debate in the paradigm of reader-response criticism and reception theory, the paper is intended to show that each community of readers produces an autonomous interpretation, "another reading." Despite differences among the various reading communities, some common features emerge f~<br>

Article Title: When Is Metaphor? The Idea of Understanding in Theories of Metaphor<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303096<br>
Date: 12 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Tourangeau Raymond W.<br>
Abstract: My purpose in this article is to describe how and why theories of metaphor vary in the ways they do. I argue that theories of metaphor differ precisely because they emphasize different temporal stages in the process of understanding metaphorical expressions. The different temporal points at which theories propose that a metaphor has been understood, ranging from the first milliseconds of processing to extended, reflective analysis, distinguish rival accounts of metaphor. In this respect, metaphor theories do not necessarily compete with one another, but can best be evaluated through an appreciation of the specific time-course that underlies metaphor understanding. My discussion reviews some of the major theoretical approaches to metaphor and reveals their (mostly implicit) assumptions about the time-course of interpretation. I suggest that most theories of metaphor draw unjustified conclusions about the entire time-course of metaphor understanding because of the particular temporal stage of understanding that each attempts to describe. Thinking about metaphor in terms of the time-course of comprehension should permit much of the theoretical pluralism presently seen in the multidisciplinary study of metaphor.<br>

Author(s): Rennie B. S.<br>
Abstract: Eliade proposed to 'undertake to analyze the religious creativity of modern societies' in his "History of Religious Ideas" but never did so. In this paper I have attempted to suggest the general direction that his analysis would have taken -- the identification of the real with the actual is a religious valorization of contemporary humanity. This is not a generic shift from religion to non-religion but a belief of a religious nature which constitutes a novel departure from the traditional operations of the religious mind. It is accompanied by a refusal to countenance our creative involvement in the construction of reality. This Eliade labels 'modern' and 'historical'.<br>

Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
Issue: i308701<br>
Date: 7 1, 1977<br>
Author(s): Dittmer Lowell<br>
Abstract: The concept of political culture embraces some of the most basic, perennially fascinating concerns in behavioral political science; because of certain ambiguities in its theoretical formulation, however, there has been a tendency for the term to grow fuzzy with continued use. Its connection with related concepts, such as political psychology, political structure, and political language, has remained unclear, with the result that political culture has been difficult to isolate as an independent variable. Thus it has come to occupy a position on the periphery of politics, and is usually presumed to reinforce the status quo. This paper re-examines previous formulations of the concept and proposes a theoretical synthesis. The analytical framework is derived from semiological theory, a branch of science specifically designed for the analysis of meanings. The central variable is the political symbol. By analyzing the interactions of political symbols within a comprehensive semiological framework, the traditional concerns of political culture can be accommodated in a more precise and systematic way.<br>

Author(s): Jonsson Christer<br>
Abstract: Several recent studies of Soviet foreign policy formation have sought to bring organizational and cognitive considerations to bear on the subject. The article evaluates these perspectives and suggests how future research may, through the use of cognitive methods of analysis, distinguish formally between different conceptualizations of Soviet foreign policy formation, thus permitting a more rigorous empirical examination of the organizational issues involved. A model of inference that accounts for organizational and cognitive links between the Soviet press and Soviet foreign policy formation is also constructed; examples are drawn from the items under review. In conclusion, the article outlines a research strategy for cumulating knowledge about how the Soviet system works, and specifies what the organizational and cognitive frameworks for the study of Soviet foreign policy formation may contribute to such a project.<br>

Abstract: We argue that the processes underlying institutionalization have not been investigated adequately and that discourse analysis provides a coherent framework for such investigation. Accordingly, we develop a discursive model of institutionalization that highlights the relationships among texts, discourse, institutions, and action. Based on this discursive model, we propose a set of conditions under which institutionalization processes are most likely to occur, and we conclude the article with an exploration of the model's implications for other areas of research.<br>

Author(s): Bithell Caroline<br>
Abstract: This paper focuses on the revival and reconstruction of polyphonic settings of the Latin Mass in selected villages in Corsica. Many such mass settings, often unique to a single village and preserved only in oral tradition, fell into disuse during the first half of the 20th century for a variety of reasons that are briefly explored. In some cases, however, fragments remained in the memories of surviving singers or on old recordings and these were to provide the seeds for the repertoire's later renaissance. My account of the processes of retrieval, reconstruction and re-absorption of the musical material itself is balanced by an examination of the different motives and ideologies of the various parties involved, together with an exploration of the broader theoretical implications of the enterprise of reclaiming the musical patrimony and, in particular, what it reveals about attitudes towards the past, authenticity, ownership and local identity. In the course of my analysis I draw on a series of metaphors and paradigms from the fields of archaeology and heritage conservation. Ultimately, I argue that the renewed practice of singing the mass in the "old way" should be viewed as an authentic part of the Corsican present.<br>

Issue: i210419<br>
Date: 7 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Klausner Samuel Z.<br>
Abstract: The ways in which values are assimilated to social research differ according to the theoretical frame of reference informing the research. An example from the writings of E. Digby Baltzell illustrates how a moral commitment shaped his assumptions about the nature of the social matrix and his research strategies. A Western moral rhetoric fares well if the researcher chooses a methodologically individualist framework. The framework assists a moral rhetoric by providing it with concrete rather than abstract social actors and with a basis for explanation in terms of motive rather than situational forces. Along the way moral statements can appear in the form of empirical generalizations and historical laws. Should sociologists deem ethically neutral social research desirable, this study suggests that concentration on scientific method, without exploring the value bases for selecting a frame of reference, is not a promising approach. A value analysis, especially around Weber's "value relevance," may function propaedeuticly.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i210405<br>
Date: 10 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Hall John R.<br>
Abstract: Conventionally, proposals to improve working relations between sociology and history have been interdisciplinary. The present essay advances an alternative approach-consolidation of sociohistorical inquiry as a transdisciplinary enterprise. All socio-historical inquiry depends on four elemental forms of discourse: discourse on values, narrative discourse, social theoretical discourse, and the discourse of explanation. Though inquiry is transdisciplinary in the problematics of these discourses, concrete methodology typically is oriented either toward theorization in relation to cases (historical sociology) or toward comprehensive analysis of a single phenomenon (sociological history). Varying the articulated relations among the four forms of discourse once for historical sociology and again for sociological history yields eight ideal typical strategies of inquiry. The four strategies of historical sociology include universal history, theory application, macro-analytic history, and contrast-oriented comparison. The parallel strategies for sociological history are situational history, specific history, configurational history, and historicism. These ideal types offer standard reference points that help clarify the underpinnings of a diverse range of scholarly practices.<br>

Abstract: Les théories de la modernisation proposées dans les années cinquante et soixante avançaient l'idée que les sociétés convergeaient vers les valeurs modernes et abandonnaient progressivement leurs valeurs traditionnelles. Cette idée de convergence est réexaminée dans cet article, dans le contexte des seules sociétés européennes, à partir de l'exploitation des enquêtes Valeurs. Une série d'échelles d'attitudes sont construites, puis analysées par des techniques multivariées. Deux résultats principaux se dégagent de cette étude. Tout d'abord, il apparaît que, quelle que soit la date ou les pays examinés, les valeurs des Européens se structurent toujours autour d'un axe de traditionalisme. Un tel résultat est évidemment en contradiction avec les thèses, fortement critiquées par ailleurs, de convergence vers la modernité. Ce résultat est aussi l'occasion de réfléchir sur le pendant du traditionalisme -- faut-il l'appeler "modernité"? -- et sur les liens entre les attitudes économiques et les attitudes morales. En second lieu, la religiosité est étroitement liée à cette structuration des valeurs, mais elle oppose principalement les Européens affiliés à une religion quelle qu'elle soit aux sans-religion, plutôt que -- comme on l'imagine souvent -- les catholiques aux protestants. Au total, la tension entre tradition et modernité reste au cœur du système de valeurs des sociétés européennes. /// The modernization theories developed in the 1950s and 60s put forward the idea that societies were converging toward modern values and gradually abandoning their traditional values. Using data from the Values surveys, the article reexamines the convergence idea in the context of European societies. A set of attitude scales was constructed, then analyzed using multivariate techniques. Analysis yielded two main results. First, regardless of date or country examined, Europeans' values seem still to be structured around a traditionalism axis. This result obviously runs counter to converge~<br>

Abstract: ¿Cómo estudiar las experiencias sociales cuyas demandas escapan de los canales político-institucionales? Para llevar adelante este tipo de investigaciones, se encuentran coordenadas interesantes en el estudio del proceso sociopolítico y la subpolítica. Se desarrollan los niveles y las dimensiones con las que identificar e indagar lo sociopolítico. Así, aludimos tanto a las emociones como a los recursos culturales y simbólicos con los que construimos un modelo de análisis para dichas investigaciones. Esta perspectiva compara las maneras de explicar la aparición de las experiencias sociales a partir de la espontaneidad. El "cacerolazo" y las asambleas barriales ocurridos en la Argentina se constituyen en la experiencia social a partir de la cual poder reflexionar sobre tales cuestiones. /// How to study social experiences whose demands do not run through the political institutional channels? So as to put forward this kind of research, there are available interesting coordinates in the socio-political process and subpolitics. Levels and dimensions with which to identify and probe into the socio-political are developed. So, we refer both to the emotions as well as to the cultural and symbolic resources with which we construct a model of analysis to carry out such research. This approach confronts the ways to explain the emergence of social experiences taking spontaneity as a point of departure. The "cacerolazo" and the asambleas barriales which took place in Argentina make up the social experience from which we can reflect on such questions.<br>

Author(s): Azérad Hugo<br>
Abstract: This article examines Joyce's Parisian works through the lens of Reverdy's aesthetic of the image, which was symptomatic of the intricate tensions between innovative ideas and the rivalries surrounding avant-garde practices, thus showing possible links between Parisian avant-garde practices and what is commonly called 'high modernism' in modernism studies. This parallel analysis of Joyce and Reverdy should help reassess the role played by images in Joyce's modernist aesthetic in "Ulysses," and also in "Finnegans Wake," where words become 'word-images'. New relations should emerge between the innovative practices of poetry and of novel writing, beyond a seemingly well-established divide.<br>

Publisher: The Johns Hopkins University Press<br>
Issue: i20486733<br>

Author(s): Addis Adeno<br>
Abstract: The assertion of prescriptive and adjudicative universal jurisdictions by some countries in relation to a handful of offenses that are classified as international or universal crimes (e.g. genocide) has led to a great deal of controversy. Those who favor universal jurisdiction argue that certain acts (often crimes) affect all of us, not just the specific individual or group of victims or the country of which the victims are nationals. It is therefore legitimate, they argue, for any state to punish or suppress such acts regardless of any traditional jurisdictional connection between the alleged acts and the state asserting jurisdiction. The availability of universal jurisdiction is premised on the presumed effect of certain crimes on humanity as a whole. Those who commit these offenses are referred to as hostis humani generis--enemies of human kind. Skeptics argue that the idea of universal jurisdiction is conceptually incoherent, inconsistent with the principle of political self-determination, and has great potential to be an instrument of political mischief. While they disagree on the conceptual coherence and utility of the notion of universal jurisdiction, both proponents and opponents view its function in purely instrumental terms, to provide the condition for punishing or suppressing certain offenses that affect all of us. This article argues that universal jurisdiction also serves another, less articulated purpose. It has a constitutive function as well. It is partly a process through which the identity of the international community is imagined and enacted. It is an expression of a sense of ourselves (a community of humankind) at given moments of time. This article argues that neglect of this constitutive dimension leads to an incomplete analysis of universal jurisdiction.<br>

Abstract: The introduction to the symposium sets out a methodological framework for the apprehension of Southeast Asian rituals, languages, and literary texts so that they are at once open to cross-cultural comparative analysis and recorded in social and symbolic contextual detail. Philosopher Paul Ricoeur's use of the term "interpretation" is central here: he urges students of cultures to combine attention to structural features of language and culture (for example, grammatical patterns) with inquiries into social contextual features (for example, speech usage in real communities). Moving back and forth between the two sorts of analysis allows researchers to bring the insights of the one pole to the investigation of the other; the full hermeneutic process constitutes interpretation. This style of inquiry, a modification of the sort of interpretive social science developed by Geertz and Becker, allows Southeast Asianists to draw on careful ethnography to make crucial "course corrections" in anthropological and linguistic theory building in general.<br>

Author(s): Kosicki Piotr H.<br>
Abstract: Beginning with Maurice Halbwachs's theory of collective memory and the great body of sociological, historical, and political-science literature on war and aggression that postdates Halbwachs, the author attempts to identify the elements of aggressor—victim memory through a detailed analysis of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In participant and third-party narratives of the genocide, it is possible to observe a commemorative quality in the campaign of mass murder. The author suggests that the persistence of post-traumatic culture and the failure of dialogue can lead people to kill in remembrance of earlier aggression: in such cases, "acting out" substitutes for "working through," with horrifying consequences.<br>

Abstract: This article focuses on the personal experience of regret and the importance of coming to terms with our regrets. It begins with a sermon preached by the first author in which the issue of regret is explored by means of a summary of the film The Big Kahuna, continues with a discussion of recent articles (Tomer and Eliason, Existential and spiritual issues in death attitudes, 2008; Mannarino et al., Existential and spiritual issues in death attitudes, 2008) on the concept of regret formulated by Landman (Landman, Regret: A theoretical and conceptual analysis, 1987; Regret: The persistence of the possible, 1993), and on regret therapy, and concludes with a pastoral care case in which a dying woman expresses both future-related and past-related regrets. The case is interpreted in light of regret therapy's emphasis on parabolic experiences and reframing techniques.<br>

Author(s): Lambranca Béatrice Dias<br>
Abstract: This paper focuses on gendered processes of socialization experienced by Christian religious groups in different Christian churches in post-civil war Gorongosa, a district in the centre of Mozambique. Discourses of radical social transformation through Christian interventions and experiences are prominent among Christians, both men and women. Yet a comprehensive and longitudinal analysis of the social world in which the Christian groups are embedded and the performances of Christian men and women demonstrates the emergence of complex processes of transformation and continuities with local cultural beliefs and practices that many non-Christians have partially or thoroughly reformed or abandoned. These changes and continuities also encompass the manifestation of fluid forms of submission and creativity, and masculinities and femininities against the ideological notion of thoroughly new and closed Christian identities. The overall analysis suggests that the tension between the practices of change and continuity are necessary in order to create and sustain the legitimacy of the various Christian groups in Gorongosa.<br>

Abstract: El presente trabajo se centra en el acontecimiento traumático de la guerra, la posibilidad del sujeto de realizar una experiencia y sostenerse en cuanto tal, pese a la anulación que recae sobre él. El análisis se lleva a cabo en dos poemarios del poeta chileno Tomás Harris: "Encuentros al fin de la batalla" (de Encuentros con hombres oscuros) y "Balada del soldado de Oklahoma" (de Tridente). Ambos poemarios entran en diálogo y choque, puesto que uno aborda la Segunda Guerra Mundial y el segundo la guerra mediática del Golfo. La poesía pone a prueba sus propias posibilidades y nos muestra un sujeto que oscila entre el duelo y la melancolía y que se niega a ser reducido a un mero espectador pasivo. This article aims at exploring the possibility of surviving and realizing an experience from the traumatic event of war. The analysis is focused on two works by the Chilean poet Tomás Harris: "Encuentros al fin de la batalla" of Encuentros con hombres oscuros and "Balada del soldado de Oklahoma" of Tridente. Both poems are related to the issue of war trauma: in the first work, it approaches World War II and the second, the mediatic Gulf War. Thus, the poetry of Harris questions its own limits by means of a subject who oscillates between mourning and melancholy, and rejects to be reduced to a mere passive spectator.<br>

Abstract: This article reviews some new international releases in the field of discourse analysis in the tradition of Michel FOUCAULT. This kind of Foucauldian discourse analysis is related to other forms in the wider interdisciplinary field of discourse analysis. Nonetheless, it can be demonstrated that the Foucauldian form of discourse analysis is the most relevant one for contemporary analysis in the social sciences. It is argued that in the German social sciences the term "discourse analysis" is primarily used for theoretical social research or is used for empirical social research, without disclosing discourse-analytic methodology. Since the 1990s, the development of empirical methodologies for social discourse analysis in Germany has intensified. From it's beginning in the late 1960s, French methodology of discourse analysis has been empirically orientated. Here, the work of Michel PÊCHEUX is the central influence in which the epistemology of discourse analysis is thoroughly discussed and theorized. In France, PÊCHEUX continued the work of Michel FOUCAULT and, since then, one can speak of a Foucauldian tradition of discourse analysis, namely "French Discourse Analysis" (FDA). This review outlines the state-of- the-art of the transformation of Foucauldian discourse theory into a discourse-analytic methodology as a new kind of qualitative social research. For this reason, the influence and the analytic tools of linguistics are critically reviewed and a comparison of FDA in France and Foucauldian discourse analysis in Germany is undertaken. The first book reviewed is a British monograph from Glyn WILLIAMS that describes the development of French discourse analysis in the context of structuralism and post-structuralism. The book contains a thorough update of French discourse analysis and is path breaking for German readers of the discourse-analytic work of Michel PÊCHEUX. The volume comes on the heels of a new German handbook of social discourse analysis (edited by KELLER; ~<br>

Abstract: The contribution outlines a research programme which I have coined the "sociology of knowledge approach to discourse" (Wissenssoziologische Diskursanalyse). This approach to discourse integrates important insights of FOUCAULT's theory of discourse into the interpretative paradigm in the social sciences, especially the "German" approach of hermeneutic sociology of knowledge (Hermeneutische Wissenssoziologie). Accordingly, in this approach discourses are considered as "structured and structuring structures" which shape social practices of enunciation. Unlike some Foucauldian approaches, this form of discourse analysis recognises the importance of socially constituted actors in the social production and circulation of knowledge. Furthermore, it combines research questions related to the concept of "discourse" with the methodical toolbox of qualitative social research. Going beyond questions of language in use, "the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse" (Wissenssoziologische Diskursanalyse) addresses sociological interests, the analyses of social relations and politics of knowledge as well as the discursive construction of reality as an empirical ("material") process. For empirical research on discourse the approach proposes the use of analytical concepts from the sociology of knowledge tradition, such as interpretative schemes or frames (Deutungsmuster), "classifications", "phenomenal structure" (Phänomenstruktur), "narrative structure", "dispositif" etc., and the use of the methodological strategies of "grounded theory".<br>

Abstract: Actual efforts to use Michel FOUCAULT's ideas about discourse for empirical research induce a linguistic bias which misses FOUCAULT's interests in power/knowledge. Against such tendencies, this article argues for a grounding of discourse theory and empirical discourse research in the sociology of knowledge, especially in the German-based Hermeneutische Wissenssoziologie, which follows the BERGER/LUCKMANN approach to knowledge. For the purposes of empirical discourse research on knowledge, the author first considers the interpretative dimension of research. Then, some conceptual tools for knowledge analysis are presented (interpretative scheme, classification, phenomenal structure, narrative structure). Third, drawing on grounded theory and sequential analysis, concrete work on texts is discussed. Finally, the article insists that discourse research should not be reduced to the analysis of spoken or written texts. Instead, different kinds of materiality—for example as dispositifs—have to be considered.<br>

Abstract: In recent years, sociologists and anthropologists have conducted significant studies of modern life using concepts and perspectives derived from symbolic anthropology. This paper discusses the theoretical and methodological problems entailed, including the distinction between symbolic and nonsymbolic actions. Research on three major areas of behavior is reviewed: (a) studies of institutions, especially politics, law, and social control; (b) studies of ceremonial events, including life-cycle rituals, sports, and festivals; and (c) studies of everyday life, including consumer goods and food, and popular culture. We conclude with a discussion of the methodological issues of location and dimensionality and the different forms of symbolic analysis.<br>

Abstract: In many parts of the world, excavations of British military sites have unearthed material reflecting lifeways in the British Empire. Specifically, studies of historical ceramics and glass have greatly advanced our understanding of status and material expression. This study highlights the current body of knowledge on British military crested ceramics, contrasting the rarity of archaeological finds with their abundance in documentary sources. An elemental stylistic analysis reveals that these crests expressed regimental affiliation as the fundamental unit of self-identification. Symbolic interpretation of these crests stresses their active role in the socialization of officers and structuring collective memory, particularly through the mess institution.<br>

Date: 2 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Kritzer Herbert M.<br>
Abstract: Interpretation is central to the social scientist's process of analysis, regardless of whether that analysis relies on quantitative or qualitative data. This essay presents a "reconstructed logic" of the interpretation process involved in quantitative data analysis. Drawing upon a broad literature on interpretation, the paper shows how the interpretive processes for quantitative "data" has significant similarities to interpretation in other settings. For example, both qualitative textual analysis and quantitative statistical analysis rely upon contextual and topological paradigms, although the specific conventions differ in many respects. The process of play employed by musicians and actors in developing an interpretation of a piece of music or a dramatic role suggests ways in which the quantitative analyst might let data perform to help in arriving at appropriate interpretations of statistical results. The lines between quantitative and qualitative social science are less clear than often presumed. Both types of analysis involve extensive interpretation, and tools of interpretation that have many fundamental similarities.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i211058<br>
Date: 11 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Somers Margaret R.<br>
Abstract: The English translation of Habermas's The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere converges with the revival of the "political culture concept" in the social sciences. Surprisingly, Habermas's account of the Western bourgeois public sphere has much in common with the original political culture concept associated with Parsonian modernization theory in the 1950s and 1960s. In both cases, the concept of political culture is used in a way that is neither political nor cultural. Explaining this peculiarity is the central problem addressed in this article and its companion piece, which appeared in Sociological Theory, volume 3, number 2 (1995). I hypothesize that this is the case because the concept itself is embedded in an historically constituted political culture (here called a conceptual network)-a structured web of conceptual relationships that combine into Anglo-American citizenship theory. The method of an historical sociology of concept formation is used to analyze historically and empirically the internal constraints and dynamics of this conceptual network. The method draws from new work in cultural history and sociology, social studies, and network, narrative, and institutional analysis. This research yields three empirical findings: this conceptual network has a narrative structure, here called the Anglo-American citizenship story; this narrative is grafted onto an epistemology of social naturalism; and these elements combine in a metanarrative that continues to constrain empirical research in political sociology.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i211059<br>
Date: 11 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Kane Anne E.<br>
Abstract: Though the process of meaning construction is widely recognized to be a crucial factor in the mobilization, unfolding, and outcomes of social movements, the conditions and mechanisms that allow meaning construction and cultural transformation are often misconceptualized and/or underanalyzed. Following a "tool kit" perspective on culture, dominant social movement theory locates meaning only as it is embodied in concrete social practices. Meaning construction from this perspective is a matter of manipulating static symbols and meaning to achieve goals. I argue instead that meaning is located in the structure of culture, and that the condition and mechanism of meaning construction and transformation are, respectively, the metaphoric nature of symbolic systems, and individual and collective interpretation of those systems in the face of concrete events. This theory is demonstrated by analyzing, through textual analysis, meaning construction during the Irish Land War, 1879-1882, showing how diverse social groups constructed new and emergent symbolic meanings and how transformed collective understandings contributed to specific, yet unpredictable, political action and movement outcomes. The theoretical model and empirical case demonstrates that social movement analysis must examine the metaphoric logic of symbolic systems and the interpretive process by which people construct meaning in order to fully explain the role of culture in social movements, the agency of movement participants, and the contingency of the course and outcomes of social movements.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>

Author(s): Ku Agnes S.<br>
Abstract: There exist around the notion of the public three different yet overlapping dichotomies posed on different levels of analysis: public (sphere) versus private (sphere), public versus mass, and publicness versus privacy/secrecy. Habermas's book ([1962]1989) incorporates all the three sets of dichotomy without resolving the contradictory meanings and bridging the gaps among them. As a result, his conception of the public sphere becomes paradoxical in terms, and it undertheorizes the cultural property of publicness. This article proposes an alternative conception of the public that may encompass the structural, institutional, and cultural levels of theorization in a more precise and coherent way. It is argued that the public is an imagined category about citizen membership that is attached to both institutions of state and civil society. In political practices, a symbolic "public" is institutionalized through an open communicative space where it is called upon, constructed, and contested as the central source of cultural references. In this connection, a notion of public credibility is introduced as an attempt to bring forth a richer and more dynamic conception about the role of culture in democratic struggles than that of critical rationality by Habermas.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I explore the questions of why and how sociologists should be interested in narrative. The answer to the first question is straightforward: Narrative texts are packed with sociological information, and a great deal of our empirical evidence is in narrative form. In an attempt to answer the second question, I look at definitions of narrative, distinguishing narrative from non-narrative texts. I highlight the linguistic properties of narrative and illustrate modes of analysis, paying close attention to both the structural properties of the text and its subtle linguistic nuances. I guide the reader through a detailed analysis of a short narrative text. I show how linguistics and sociology interplay at the level of a text.<br>

Abstract: Comparative analysis is taken into account in relation to recent changes in social theory. By distinguishing different ways of doing comparative research, their limits and potentialities, the A. highlights the close link between social theory and empirical research. More precisely, the A. holds that only after a critical re-examination of this link it is possible to explain the role played by comparative analysis on the theory of social action during the last decades.<br>

Abstract: The Subject of this essay, as well as the intention behind it, is to examine the problems connected with the relationship between sociology and the theme of the person. The paper's position is that this theme has a substantial (and not only formal) centrality within a sociological analysis, which is intended to be critical, in the sense used by Theodor Adorno of this term, and is, therefore, naturally, problematic. This discourse implies that the analysis cannot be limited only to codes and factual dynamics (numbering, classify, aggregating-disaggregating) which reduce the sociological discourse to mere sociography.<br>

Abstract: I argue that the aporetic character of clemency must be understood in terms of its unmerited and merited character to achieve the underlying purposes of justice within criminal justice: justice as fairness (punishment must be deserved and proportionate) and justice as restoration (repair of the harm to victims and society and the reintegration of offenders) are paramount goals. Rather than destabilizing political order, pardons can render productive potential tensions between justice as fairness and justice as restoration. Taking as my conceptual point of departure Paul Ricoeur's claims about the suprajuridical and supraethical character of pardon, I develop the argument through three central sections: an excursus into historical and contemporary practices of clemency in the United States; a critical analysis of the merited and unmerited aspects of clemency with respect to remorse and atonement theories within theological and legal discourse; and a normative engagement with pardons and felony disenfranchisement.<br>

Abstract: The work of William Sewell and Marshall Sahlins has led to a growing interest in recent years in events as a category of analysis and their role in the transformation of social structures. I argue that tying events solely to instances of significant structural transformation entails problematic theoretical assumptions about stability and change and produces a circumscribed field of events, undercutting the goal of developing an "eventful" account of social life. Social continuity is a state that is achieved just as much as are structural transformations, and events may be constitutive of processes of reproduction as well as change.<br>

Abstract: This essay analyzes the contemporary culture of memory in Buenos Aires. The development of this culture since the democratic transition — and since Nestor Kirchner's turn in government in particular — is investigated. Data come from field-work research during the period of Cristina Kirchner's election victory in 2007. The official explanation of the duty to remember in order to re-establish the nation's democratic basis is shown through an analysis of Buenos Aires's urban landscape, and the building of such places of memory as the Museum of Memory and the Park of Memory, coinciding respectively with Nestor Kirchner's first election, and with Cristina Kirchner's election. The analysis of contemporary collective sensibility about the past dictatorship introduces an interview with a Madre de Plaza de Mayo, suggesting the task of watching over memory, and of coping with its current multiple interpretations.<br>

Abstract: This essay represents an attempt to critically assess the intellectual orientation often termed 'structuralism.' In particular, the essay is concerned with European, and even more specifically French, structuralism as displayed in the writings of Louis Althusser, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, and C. Levi-Strauss. The analysis indicates that despite a novel language, an often rigorous character, and some interesting, indeed exciting, intellectual constructions, structuralism is very much a child of positivism. The positivism/structuralism relationship is most clearly revealed when structuralism is contrasted with Marxian social inquiry. For comparative and illustrative purposes, then, the essay contrasts structuralism and Marxism.<br>

Abstract: Globalization has unsettled conventional, nationally based political belief systems, opening the door to emerging new global political ideologies. While much analytic focus has been on ideational transformations related to market globalism (neoliberalism), little attention has been given to its growing number of ideological challengers. Drawing on data collected from 45 organizations connected to the World Social Forum, this article examines the political ideas of the global justice movement, the key antagonist to market globalism from the political Left. Employing morphological discourse analysis and quantitative content analysis, the article assesses the ideological coherence of "justice globalism" against Michael Freeden's (1996) three criteria of distinctiveness, context-bound responsiveness, and effective decontestation. We find that justice globalism displays ideological coherence and should be considered a maturing political "alter"-ideology of global significance. The evidence presented in this article suggests the ongoing globalization of the twenty-first-century ideological landscape.<br>

Abstract: This paper presents an historical outlook on the macro-micro distinction in modern sociology. It links the genesis of social interactionism and microsociology to the rise of Romantic philosophy and attempts to elaborate methodological principles dividing macro- and microscopic perspectives in sociology. Six ideal-typical distinctions are considered: natural vs. social universality, emergent properties vs. emergent processes, morphological structuralism vs. genetical interactionism, choice among socially structured alternatives vs. structuring appearance into reality, structural vs. emergent directionality, operational vs. hermeneutical analysis. The complementarity of the languages of macro- and microsociological theories is advocated as a foundation for the further elaboration of conceptual links between the two levels of analysis.<br>

Abstract: The present paper is an analysis of the functioning of memory, selective memory and oblivion (or to put it differently—the game of remembering, partial remembering and forgetting) in Poland during the period of democratic transformation which, after long years of dictatorship and the hibernation of public discourse, ensures freedom of speech and encourages expression of different beliefs as well as articulation of divergent interests. It defines two distinct layers of memory and oblivion and, consequently, two main types of hidden or repressed elements which may be dubbed "skeletons in the nation's history closet." One is linked with the pre-communist past (before 1945), while the other is connected with the communist past (1945-1989). The latter is linked to political differences—within the same ethnic group—which presently constitute a very hot issue but are less likely to be inherited over more than two generations. The former comprises mostly nationwide skeletons, related mainly to contacts between the Polish and other ethnic groups and involving the sense of collective identity, collective pride, collective guilt, and collectively suffered injustice. On the one hand, these skeletons are currently still more willingly kept in the closet because they can be detrimental to the perception and self-perception of the national group as a whole, but on the other hand the memory of these ethnic and religious conflicts is more likely to be inherited and internalized by future generations for much longer. The question of how to facilitate the process of removing the nationwide skeletons from the national memory closet seems, therefore, all the more important.<br>

Abstract: Notwithstanding the growing use of interpretive analysis in public administration and policy research, its fullest potential for evaluating intractable public conflict has yet to be tapped. We develop a mode of narrative analysis, partly based upon Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutics, that shows promise for analyzing public disputes. We illustrate this with a case study in Los Angeles involving a contentious proposal to inject recycled wastewater into the city's water supply. The analysis reveals that, by representing opposing interests with a simplistic narrative, the water industry's response has been superfluous. The latter assumes that impasse simply results from the public's lack of information, the logical response being an information dissemination campaign. We employ a hermeneutic approach to reveal a set of persistent issues that project proponents have hitherto failed to address. By respecting the inherent plurivocity and intertextuality of narrative, hermeneutics provides new inroads into controversial public issues. We close the discussion with implications for practice.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: This article considers the function of the mashal (parable) in Rabbinic literature and the connection between the use to which the mashal is put in that literature and the literary form it takes. Following a consideration of the contexts, narrative and exegetical, in which the mashal appears in midrashic and talmudic literature, three disctinct models for the form are proposed: (1) As a didactic tool, whose form is exoteric and relies largely on figurative language that illustrates the ideas the parable teaches. (2) As an instrument of sectarian doctrine, often esoteric in its form, and one which closely resembles allegory and seeks to disguise its message if not to hide it. (3) As a homiletical device with the form of an allusive tale told for an ulterior purpose, in order to persuade its audience of a certain inexplicit message. The article suggests that the mashal in Rabbinic literature generally falls into the third category, and that the messages it seeks to persuade are mainly on the order of praise or blame (or a subtype of praise or blame, like apologetics, polemics, eulogy, or complaint). Examples of meshalim for several of these categories are briefly discussed. The article concludes with a detailed analysis of the meshal found in Lamentations Rabba 3, 21. This is a praise-mashal whose narrative also suggests a certain kind of blame and, in effect, allows the mashal to be read in two ways. On the basis of this analysis, it is suggested that the rhetorical richness of the mashal derives in part from the tension between the mashal's function and its narrative complexity, and that the popularity of the form was a result of the fact that the use of narrative in the mashal allowed the Rabbis to express certain feelings and attitudes that other, more prosaic, midrashic literary forms could not convey.<br>

Abstract: The paper examines the process of figurative reading in the presence of a marker (like / as), namely the unique cognitive impact caused by shaping figurative expressions as similes. The solution is sought through theoretical discussion and analysis of relevant excerpts from Hebrew poetry. Recently Bethlehem argued that a simile does not necessarily indicate the presence of resemblance of some sort; the simile only presents itself as such via its marker, like/as, but actually it can bear a variety of figurative relations, of which metaphoric relations are only one possible option. Consequently, simile has only coincidental relations with metaphor, if any (Bethlehem, 1996: 1997) First I address this criticism, trying to reinforce the widespread view that a simile is indeed a sub-type of metaphor, and that there is no fundamental difference between them, that is, comprehension processes in metaphor and simile are basically similar. Next I distinguish the simile from the literal comparison in a new comprehensive way. Finally I try to identify and study the special impression a figurative expression might create as a result of being shaped as a simile. Despite this basic sameness of simile and metaphor, the marker's presence in a simile has its unique cognitive effects, accumulating to a distinctive impact. I analyze the unique cognitive effects potentially evolved during the construction process of the simile's meaning. In this analysis this paper reexamines central issues pertaining to similes, their essence, and the cognitive processes they trigger in readers. Among these I focus on a problem never thoroughly explored so far: the essential nature of the coexistence of similarity and dissimilarity (without working against each other) in both metaphor and simile.<br>

Abstract: It has been argued that in higher education academic disciplines can be seen as communities of practices. This implies a focus on what constitutes identities in academic culture. In this article I argue that the transition from newcomer to a full participant in a community of practice of physicists entails a focus on how identities emerge in learning how to highlight certain aspects of personal life histories. The analysis of interviews with 55 physicists shows that physicists often perceive experiences in their childhood as the first step into their professional identities as physicists. These experiences involve recollections of the ability to think scientifically (e.g., 'go beyond the surface'), and the ability to play with toys which can be connected to the practical life of physics. The process of identity formation can be described as developing in a relational zone of proximal development, where old-timers recognize particular playful qualities in newcomers as a legitimate access to a physicist identity. The article discusses how play which physicists connects with a scientific mind can constitute a relational zone of proximal developments in a community of practice as a particular "space of authoring" in a physicist culture, which cut across other cultural differences. Il a été admis que les disciplines de l'éducation supérieure peuvent être considérées comme des communautés de pratique. Cela pose la question de savoir comment se constituent les identités dans la culture académique. Dans cet article, pour mettre en évidence la transition de nouveau venu à participant à part entière dans une communauté de pratique de physiciens, j'examine non seulement la manière dont des identités émergent au travers des pratiques, mais aussi les aspects biographiques que les participants identifient comme ayant facilité leur transition. Une cohorte de 55 physiciens a été interviewée et leurs analyses ont été comparées à des données supplémentaires, notamment tirées d'une ob~<br>

Abstract: Every community which regards as normative certain texts given by the worthies of old must develop a "hermeneutic," a means whereby these fixed standards can be kept in an effective relationship with the ever-changing frontier of day-to-day experience. In the two centuries surounding the turn of the era, six factors impelled Rabbinic Judaism toward the elaboration of a hermeneutic far more self-conscious than anything previously known: the canon of the Scripture was fixed; a body of authoritative Torah not part of that canon had to be kept in fruitful relationship to it; the institutions of Bet-Kenesset and Bet-Midrash emerged as settings suitable for carrying on the hermeneutical task; sectarian competition increased the urgency for an explicit hermeneutic; Hellenistic culture offered models from its own interpretive tradition; and the normative role of the Temple in religion ceased. Out of this period emerged a sophisticated system of "hermeneutics," or praxis of interpretation. The essay reviews the traditional lists of seven and thirteen middot, together with other methodological devices not part of the lists, and — with the help of illustrations drawn from Mekilta de R. Ishmael — offers a logical and literary analysis of each one. A comparison of the results of these analyses with hermeneutical devices found in both Old and New Testaments and in the larger Hellenistic milieu leads to the conclusion that the system of Rabbinic hermeneutics was sui generis, and was the indigenous response of the Tannaim and their immediate successors to their own urgently felt need for an effective hermeneutic.<br>

Abstract: Against the backdrop of the current popularity of the concept of narrative in the social sciences the authors analyse the uses of narrative analysis in empirical social research and provide a unifying frame based on Paul Ricoeur's notion of narrative mimesis. To begin they situate 'narrative' in the context of the social research tradition. Using both a simple and an elaborated definition of narrative they outline the main approaches to narrative analysis relevant to sociology and categorize them as structuralist, hermeneutic, or interactionist. The crux of the article is a discussion of Ricoeur's integrative model of narrative as threefold mimesis and its proposed methodological application in sociological narrative research. The authors argue that Ricoeur's model obviates undesirable analytical simplifications and encourages research that captures all the substantial aspects of narrative, including the producer (the narrator) and the recipient (the listener or reader).<br>

Author(s): Gordon Rae Beth<br>
Abstract: "La dérive d'une vie," that of the hero in En rade, is metaphorized by the dérive of narrative, composed of a complex network of metaphors. In 1893, Paul Souriau proposed that metaphor makes a fleeting representation pass into the unconscious. Dreams and hysteria, states in which the unconscious holds sway, are of considerable importance in this text. An analysis of the way that metaphor works will shed light on the relationships between dream and reality, and between consciousness and the unconscious in general. The double fil of extended metaphor is also metaphorized as a bifurcating road, the road of narrative and the labyrinthine path the hero's thoughts take. In fact, route or chemin is not only a metaphor for the text and for extended metaphor itself, but also for the complex pathways of the nerves and brain. If the road or path of narrative is also a representation of nerves/brain, then retracing these pathways of metaphors would be a way of following the text's attempt to dissect the brain and uncover the links between dream and reality, the double sphere of activity that characterizes this novel.<br>

Abstract: Augustine applies rhetorical principles of On Christian Doctrine to Book Eight of the Confessions by synthesizing four conversion stories as reenactments of the gospel paradigm.

Author(s): BLOOMQUIST L. GREGORY<br>
Abstract: In this article I suggest ways in which rhetorical analysis can complement sociological analysis of early Christianity. On the basis of a universally acknowledged saying of Jesus ("blessed are you poor"), I suggest that those who use social scientific perspectives need to clarify more accurately the levels of data from which they are working (i.e., when they are working with probably early material, possibly the words of Jesus himself, and when they are working with the later elaboration of the traditional material) and to identify the rhetorical value of each level. I then show how, contrary to sociological analysis that depicts Jesus as merely proclaiming reversal, the historical Jesus proclaimed a reversal that had already happened but one that was away from God's intended order: what the historical Jesus was calling for was a future restoration to a state that existed before the reversal. Attention to the rhetorical nature of his follower's use of this proclamation, however, shows that when the author of the Gospel of Luke and the Lukan Acts of the Apostles uses the language of reversal and restoration, he now does so to describe what was happening not primarily vis-à-vis "the world" but in their own, now Christian communities Jesus' message of reversal of the fate of the poor becomes in this way the Lukan message of the apostolic governance of that reversal, that is, the broker's (the apostolic leadership's, after the model of Jesus) dispensation of the patron's (God's) resources.<br>

Abstract: The aim is to show how formations of discourse can be seen as the subject matter for the historian of religions, drawing on structuralist and hermeneutic approaches. Although these may differ on important theoretical and methodological issues, I find the way in which they correspond, namely by pointing to the topic of discourse as their field of investigation, even more important. In this article a discourse is understood as a framework of communication, and the focus is laid upon religious discourse as a special kind of authorization. In ancient Greece, for example, "authors" such as Homer and Orpheus were the authorities of two different discursive traditions. The analysis of discourse can present us with a view of how certain frames of communication were interacting by means of contest, and how, eventually, it was the very strategy of authorization that was contested. Hence, what has often been seen as a paradigmatic shift from mythos to logos could more fruitfully be viewed from a discursive angle than from a perspective of different mentalities. Discourse analysis, as presented in this article, is a way of coming to terms with the process of transformation by regarding dynamic properties of communication, that is, as interrelated strategies on connected levels of system and event.<br>

Abstract: L'histoire contrefactuelle — «que se serait-il passé si?» — connaît actuellement un certain engouement éditorial et a fait l'objet dans les pays anglophones d'un vigoureux débat il y a une dizaine d'années, qui s'est achevé sur un consensus prudent. Pourtant, loin de ces usages polémiques dont les raisons sont explorées ici, un examen plus serré suggère, comme l'avait déjà identifié Max Weber, qu'il s'agit aussi d'un mode plus ordinaire du raisonnement, notamment en sciences sociales. La question n'est donc pas de savoir s'il faut promouvoir ou rejeter cette démarche, mais plutôt, à partir d'une lecture interdisciplinaire, de détecter les enjeux, risques et propositions que recouvre son explicitation. Trois aspects sont analysés ici: le rapport histoire/ fiction, le poids du déterminisme et de la causalité, les implications politiques d'une attention aux futurs non advenus. À partir du constat des tensions que fait saillir l'examen contrefactuel, l'article reprend ensuite de manière détaillée la critique de divers usages courants, et propose d'autres manières de faire qui semblent plus pertinentes, certaines évidentes, d'autres expérimentales, dans le but d'enrichir la boîte à outils historienne. Favorisant, ainsi, la relecture des sources, le rejet de la téléologie, l'analyse de moments critiques, l'élaboration de conceptions plus fines et discontinues des temporalités, et la mise en œuvre d'exercices pédagogiques et ludiques, la démarche contrefactuelle permet surtout au chercheur d'appréhender la question essentielle, mais délicate, des possibles en histoire. Counterfactual history — "what would have happened if?" — is currently receiving keen editorial interest and was, roughly ten years ago in anglophone countries, the subject of vigorous debate, which concluded with a cautious consensus. Yet, far from any polemical uses, the reasons for which are explored here, closer examination suggests, as already identified by Max Weber, that it is also a more ordinary way~<br>

Abstract: In the complex field of agricultural biotechnology, is there an approach that Christian ethicists can use to evaluate competing claims, multiple goods, and human rights issues in this important arena where humans and natures are intertwined? This paper is an attempt to apply Gibson Winter's three root metaphors (organic, mechanistic and artistic) as an ethical analysis that describes key socio-historical patterns in Western society and deciphers moral landscapes that undergird different forms of agricultural biotechnology. The paper also explores five key principles of the emerging "artistic" root metaphor that could guide more appropriate application and use of agricultural biotechnology.<br>

Author(s): Clairmont David A.<br>
Abstract: THIS ESSAY EXAMINES THE RELEVANCE FOR RELIGIOUS ETHICS OF BUDDHIST Abhidhamma texts, those dealing with the analysis and systematization of mental states arising in and examined by meditation practice. Developing recent scholarship on the prevalence and significance of interlocking lists in Buddhist canonical texts and commentaries, the Buddhist use of lists in the Abhidhamma constitutes a kind of narrative expression of moral development through the sequential occurrence of carefully defined mental states. Attention to this narrative dimension of the moral life, while related to other recent proposals about the place of narrative in religious ethics, offers a way to employ this underexamined genre of religious literature (lists) drawn from a comparative context (Buddhist and Christian ethics), in service of a more nuanced account of moral development.<br>

Abstract: On the occasion of the recent publication of a complete translation into French of Sein und Zeit, the author of the article means to approach the work with a "prejudice of innocence." Three philosophical questions are first treated. Reflection on time introduces the theological debate. For Heidegger, theology, as metaphysics on which it depends, is marked by "the forgetfulness of being." But does not the lack in him of a stand on moral conscience reveal a weakness of his thought on otherness? As for his theory of "concern", because it does not go back to its hebrew sources it fails to make "creatureliness" thinkable. The debate would deserve to be resumed starting from a philosophical analysis of the anamnesis.<br>

Abstract: The article develops the thesis, that the acts of promising and forgiving play an essential part in the constitution and stabilization of human sociality. In studying the phenomena of promising and forgiving the analysis explores their far reaching anthropological and finally theological meanings. As a result a differentiated concept of these two acts is presented. In doing so the argument develops with reference to the positions of Hume, Kant, Arendt and Rieoeur.<br>

Abstract: L'approche par les capabilités proposée par A. Sen a été considérée comme une révolution dans l'analyse du développement et, en particulier, de la pauvreté. Si elle a exercé une influence sur les indicateurs du développement, elle pose néanmoins la question de la conception sous-jacente du sujet. Cet article montre que la conception de la personne utilisée par Sen est insuffisante et qu'il pratique un individualisme très standard. Cette approche est d'autant plus problématique qu'elle n'est pas simplement compréhensive, mais aussi normative. En ne tenant pas compte de la fragilité de la personne, son analyse aboutit finalement à une faiblesse morale. The capability approach proposed by A. Sen constitutes a real change in the poverty analysis. It influenced considerably development indicators. However, the question who really is the subject behind this approach is at stake. In this paper we defend the idea that the conception of the person used by Sen is relatively standard. It is then problematic because his approach is not only comprehensive but also normative. His analyse finally conducts to a moral weakness. El enfoque de las capabilidades propuesto por A. Sen fue considerado como una revolución en el análisis del desarrollo y, en particular, en el de la pobreza. Si bien ejerció una influencia sobre los indicadores de desarrollo, plantea la cuestión de la concepción subyacente del sujeto. Este artículo muestra que la concepción de la persona utilizada por Sen es insuficiente y que practica un individualismo muy estándar. Este enfoque es aún más problemático dado que no es simplemente comprensivo sino también normativo. Al no considerar la fragilidad de la persona, su análisis desemboca finalmente en una debilidad moral.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo consiste numa análise da noção zubiriana de mentalidade. Começa por descrever a razão como busca para descobrir a estrutura da realidade. Esta busca requer um método que inclua um sistema de referência, que é o seu ponto de partida no sentido de sugerir hipóteses e teorias que expliquem a realidade. O sistema de referência deriva da transformação do campo de realidade. Esta transformação, que não segue uma via única, depende da "mentalidade" dos que procuram a realidade profunda. Em Zubiri, o conceito de "mentalidade" é polissémico. Existe uma "mentalidade estrutural e intrínseca", uma "mentalidade situacional extrínseca" e um "horizonte mental". Neste artigo estudam-se as três mentalidades e a sua relevância na constituição do sistema de referência e na elaboração de hipóteses e teorias. Finalmente, o artigo analisa a relevância destas mentalidades para compreender os contributos da investigação interdisciplinar e os seus desafios. The following paper is an analysis of Zubiri's notion of mentality. It starts by describing reason as a quest to uncover the structure of reality. This quest requires a method that includes a system of reference, which is its point of departure in the sense of suggesting hypotheses and theories that explain reality. The system of reference results from a transformation of the field of reality. This transformation, which does not follow a unique path, depends on the "mentality" of those who seek to deepen reality. In Zubiri the concept "mentality" is polysemic. There is a "structural and intrinsic mentality", an "extrinsic situational mentality" and a "mental horizon". The three of them and their relevance in the constitution of the system of reference and the elaboration of hypotheses and theories are studied. Finally the paper analyzes the relevance of these mentalities to understand the contributions of interdisciplinary research and its challenges.<br>

Abstract: El objetivo del presente trabajo es constituir el primer aporte en español a los estudios sobre cine documental coreano mediante el análisis comparado de Our School (Kim Myeong Jun, 2006), Cheonggyecheon Medley (Kelvin Kyung Kun Park, 2010) y Annyong Sayonara (Kim Tae Il y Kato Kumiko, 2005), los cuales son estudiados según las propuestas teóricas de Bhabha —mímesis, hibridización y traducción—, con el fin de repensar y reflexionar sobre las diversas y contradictorias maneras en que se desenvuelven los modelos de memoria, olvido e identidad en el cine documental contemporáneo surcoreano que retoman, directa o indirectamente, la temática del colonialismo. The objective of this paper is to make the first contribution in Spanish to Korean documentary film studies through the comparative analysis of Our School (Kim Myeong Jun, 2006), Cheonggyecheon Medley (Kelvin Kyung Kun Park, 2010) and Annyong Sayonara (Kim Tae Il and Kato Kumiko, 2005). These movies will be analyzed by retaking and discussing Bhabha's theoretical framework —mimesis, hybridization and translation— to suggest that South Korean documentary film's past memories conform so a contradictory space of reminiscence in which the pattern of oblivion, collaboration, victims and national identity is reshaped.<br>

Abstract: The article replies to the polemic by Nicholas Onuf. It defends a particular conceptualisation of metaphor distinguishing between conceptual metaphors and metaphorical expressions and explaining why metaphors are unidirectional. Following this, performativity of speech is addressed. Then metaphors of European integration are discussed. Finally, the case for metaphorical analysis is put in terms of ontology, epistemology and methodology.<br>

Publisher: INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS<br>

Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): HAYS GEORGE<br>
Abstract: This article examines Campbell's concept of 'foreign policy' and its application to identifiers 'below' those utilized by Campbell. Campbell's discussion of 'foreign policy' at the level of the ruling elite, though perhaps necessary for the historical breadth of his analysis, provides a skewed and privileged understanding of both national identity and its creation. Through an analysis of 'foreign policy' at the sub-elite level, using the three versions of The Quiet American as illustrative examples, this article demonstrates that a separation of 'foreign policy' from Foreign Policy can yield multiple potentially conflicting national identities. While at times taking on the form of an argument ad absurdum, it is not the intent of this article to disprove Campbell's work. Rather, its intent is to use the concept of 'foreign policy' with a different level of identifier to demonstrate that the tenuousness and indefiniteness of national identity are actually greater than those proposed by Campbell.<br>

Abstract: L'article porte sur les recherches que Husserl entreprend sur la géométrie dans les années 1892-1894. Dans une première partie, nous dégageons une méthode épistémologique originale, qui n'apparaît ni dans la Philosophie de l'arithmétique, ni dans les Recherches logiques. Dans une seconde partie, nous reprenons l'analyse logique que Husserl tente sur la géométrie de son temps, et les analyses réflexives, qui retracent la formation de la représentation de l'espace. This paper is based on the researches that Husserl carries out on geometry in 1892-1894. In the first part, we bring out an epistemogical method, which appears neither in the Philosophy of arithmetic nor in the Logical Investigations. In the second part, we study the logical analysis that Husserl tries on geometry, and the reflexive analysis, that explains the formation of the representation of space.<br>

Issue: i23638508<br>
Date: 1 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Pavlich George<br>
Abstract: Analyses highlighting the genres of critique engaged by radical criminologists are comparatively rare. The few exceptions tend to associate radical criminological thinking with a grammar of critique that (i) establishes universal criteria, (ii) judges (con)texts against these and (iii) prescribes paths of action accordingly. This is an unfortunate tendency since it ties radical thought to an increasingly anachronistic genre of critique, and does not arrest the dwindling plight of critical approaches, or resist dominant technocratic discourses in criminology. In an attempt at redress, this paper identifies four alternate genres of critique in British radical criminology of the 1960s-70s, and shows how these could spawn a deconstructive ethos from which to develop critical analysis with renewed legitimacy.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur connects the philosophical concept of 'recognition' to the ethnological analysis of ceremonial gift exchange by focusing on the term 'gratitude'. Particularly by means of a content analysis of the French word 'reconnaissance' (recognition) Ricoeur demonstrates that the term 'reconnaissance' is closely linked with the notion of gratitude. Thus Ricoeur broadens the philosophical concept of 'recognition', that is mainly defined in reference to the influential idea of an endless 'struggle for recognition' (Kampf um Anerkennung) as Friedrich Hegel puts it. Ricoeur outlines the interesting idea that gratitude binds donor and recipient together and that the ceremonial gift exchange symbolises the mutual recognition of donor and recipient. Hence the experience of the gift should be understood as the experience of being recognised. I wish to pursue these considerations by arguing that the gift exchange can only then be considered as establishing a mutual recognition if the gift itself is also recognised and acknowledged as such. As Marcel Mauss demonstrated this is the case in traditional societies. As soon, however, as the gift loses this special capacity to express recognition, the mutual recognition of donor and recipient will be lost.<br>

Abstract: History is not neutral. It is rendered ideological by the very act of being conveyed in a narrative form, for language is both the purveyor of meaning and the principle locus of ideology. This paper explores the idea of history as discourse, and its deployment in the cultural-symbolic construction of the Singapore nation. To this end, I have chosen to analyse a key moment for Singapore history, the years 1963-65, when Singapore was first merged with the nation of Malaysia, and then separated from it. The way that these events are described in official histories is used by the government of Singapore to justify its policy of multiracialism, which also serves as a legitimating device confirming the state in its political and ideological hegemony. I have examined the events through analysis of local newspapers, The Straits Times and Berita Harían, to see in what ways their reporting may have helped to mould popular understandings of what was happening.<br>

Article Title: Inside and Outside the EU's "Area of Freedom, Security and Justice": Reflexive Identity and the Unity of Legal Space<br>
Publisher: Franz Steiner Verlag<br>
Issue: i23676298<br>

Abstract: "It is essential," Hans Kelsen asserts provocatively, "that one state also have one territory, that the territory of a state form a unity." What, then, determines the territorial unity a legal community necessarily claims for itself? And why is this claim to territorial unity irreducibly problematic? These questions are particularly pressing, both theoretically and practically, with respect to the European Union's "Area of Freedom, Security and Justice," set to be consolidated in the novel Constitution for Europe. Rejecting any attempt to make sense of legal space in terms of geography, this Paper argues that the spatial unity of the European Union emerges in the reflexive process by which this legal community stakes out a territory as its own. Probing the notion of an "own" legal space, this Paper points to, and offers examples of, a strong form of exteriority that is inside what the EU calls its own territory: "another Europe" is — literally — elsewhere. This strong form of exteriority arises in the very same representational process by which the EU constitutes itself as a unitary Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. In effect, an analysis of key legal texts reveals that Europe is the place the Union claims to be originally its own, yet also the place to which it has no direct access. Finally, these considerations are brought to bear on Article 64 (1) of the EC Treaty, which holds Member States responsible for maintaining law and order and safeguarding internal security.<br>

Abstract: Confrontant les thèses des anthropologues qui ont tendance à voir dans la mafia une structure plurielle, informelle, dispersée sur le territoire, très dépendante de chaque chef de cellule mafieuse (cosche) et se regroupant à des fins pratiques (task oriented), et les thèses des juges palermitains qui ont tendance à considérer la mafia comme une organisation centralisée de type Cosa nostra, l'auteur montre qu'une analyse dynamique permet de dépasser la confrontation. Ainsi en étudiant les capacités d'adaptation de l'organisation et les différents vecteurs qu'elle peut utiliser (violence marché), il déplace les enjeux du débat et repense le phénomène mafieux dans son rapport à l'État en suivant une problématique weberienne. Haciendo una comparación de las tésis de los antropólogos que tienen la tendencia a ver en la mafia una estructura plural, informal, dispersa en el territorio, muy dependiente de los capos de las células mafiosas, (cosche) y que se reagrupan con objetivos prácticos (task oriented), con las tesis de los jueces palermitanos, inclinados a considerar a la mafia como una organización centralizada de tipo Cosa nostra, el autor muestra que un análisis dinámico permite sobrepasar la confrontación. Asi, estudiando la capacidad de adaptación de la organización y de los diferentes vectores (violencia-mercado) desplaza los terminos del debate, hace el re-examen del fenómeno mafioso en relación con el Estado, siguiendo las pautas de una problemática weberiana. Confronting (comparing) on the one hand anthropologists thesis who have a tendency to see in mafia a plural structure, informal, spread out on the territory, very depending upon their local chiefs (cosche) and meeting for task oriented, and on the other hand the palermitan judges who have a certain tendency to consider mafia as a Cosa Nostra centralized organization type, the author shows that a dynamic analysis allows to go further than confrontation.

Abstract: L'ambition de cet article est d'apporter une contribution en matière d'analyse interprétative du phénomène guerrier. Dans cette optique, il s'interroge sur les mécanismes de la pensée stratégique qui ont contribué à faire de la guerre moderne une pratique sociale jugée techniquement faisable et, partant de là, légitime pour les militaires. Pour ce faire, l'analyse proposée s'inscrit dans les champs, très proches sur le plan théorique, de la sociologie pragmatique (en s'inspirant d'auteurs tels que Luc Boltanski, Nicolas Dodier et Francis Chateauraynaud) et de la sociologie des sciences (en s'appuyant surtout sur les travaux de Bruno Latour). D'une part, la sociologie des sciences a développé un très fertile questionnement portant sur la construction des faits scientifiques dont la présente étude s'inspirera largement. D'autre part, la sociologie pragmatique a élaboré un cadre de compréhension des actions collectives qui s'articule à l'enquête sur la construction sociale des faits. Grâce à ces deux approches, nous nous proposons d'enquêter sur la formation d'un régime d'expertise stratégique qui soutient la légitimité technique de l'emploi de la force militaire. Ensemble, la sociologie des sciences et la sociologie pragmatique apportent un éclairage particulièrement pertinent à la question de la guerre. This article is intended to contribute to the interpretative analysis of war. For that purpose, I investigate how some apparatuses located in strategic thinking help making modern war a social practice considered as technically feasible and, at the same time, legitimate for soldiers. In order to do that, I made use of two different but closely related theoretical fields, i.e., pragmatic sociology (finding inspiration in the work of scholars such as Luc Boltanski, Nicolas Dodier and Francis Chateauraynaud), and sociology of scientific knowledge (mostly by referring to the work of Bruno Latour). On the one hand, the sociology of scientific knowledge has developed a prod~<br>

Abstract: Quentin Skinner's methodological project contains a fundamental imprecision that is rarely mentioned by the secondary literature: the assumption, present in several of his methodological texts, that a theory designed for the analysis of oral communication (speech act theory) can be unreservedly used for interpreting text. In this article I will use some of Paul Ricoeur's phenomenological insights on the difference between textual and oral communication in order to advance a systematic critique of Skinner's project and to suggest new methodological possibilities for the history of political thought and related disciplines. This procedure will also allow me to organize some of the criticism raised against Skinner's Collingwoodean approach since its inception.<br>

Abstract: This article attempts to refine the understanding of translation, thus contributing to evaluate its role in reception theory and in the history of ideas. A discussion of on the character, theories, and practices of translation in early-modern times is its entry point of analysis. During this period, what mattered in the first place was not the extent to which the translated text succeeded or failed in making the source text and its "original" ideas accessible in the target language, but rather the extent and the way in which the source text was instrumental in pursuing the agenda set by the translator or others in compliance with specific contexts. Such a perspective on translation seems also appropriate to current modes of inquiry for which translation is not an instance of inter-cultural communication, aiming to penetrate the Other in its fullness and make it intelligible in its otherness, but a communicative act whose purposes are predominantly intra-cultural and consist in supporting domestic agendas to which the translated text looks instrumental.<br>

Abstract: The main end of this article is to offer a critical analysis of autonomy conceived as a basic idea in modern educational philosophy. After the tragic experience and dramatic consequences of totalitarianism, is not possible to defend a kantian concept of autonomy as a unique source of moral responsibility and ethical action. After holocaust, we need to defend, on the contrary, the principle of previous value of heteronomy, conceived as the practice of otherness, in its levinasian perspective. So, the authors explore the thesis of the prior value of heteronomy on autonomy, as a source and foundation of moral responsibility in educational relationship, and to reflect the general educational implications of the jewish philosophical tradition of otherness in philosophical educational discourse.<br>

Abstract: Classroom discipline systems are considered as patriarchal moral systems focused on hyper-individuality and dependent upon rules, consequences, and principles focused through authoritarian structures. Three example systems (Assertive Discipline, Glasser's Control Theory, and Discipline with Dignity) are critiqued using Noddings' analysis of evil and Welch's liberation theology. As an alternative grounding, freedom of responsibility is proposed, moved foward through Noddings' mediation and care and Welch's dangerous memory and solidarity with oppressed peoples. Les différentes approches à la discipline dans la salle de classe sont considérés comme des systèmes patriarcaux et moraux qui ont pour but de brimer l'individualité. Ces systèmes ont également comme bases des règlements, des conséquences et des principes imposés par des structures autoritaires. A la lumière de l'analyse de Nodding sur le mal et de la théologie de la libération de Welch, nous critiquons trois systèmes de discipline: "Assertive Discipline, Glasser's Control Theory, Discipline with Dignity." Comme alternative nous proposons plutôt une approche dite "liberté responsable" qui s'inspire des concepts de médiation et de soin de Nodding et des concepts de mémoire dangereuse et de solidarité des opprimés de Welch.<br>

Abstract: Será possível colocar a questão da culpa à parte de determinantes morais e históricos? Heidegger parece pensar que sim e, em verdade, empreende esta tarefa com base na reflexão sobre o papel do chamamento, um tema que, como a culpa, também está rodeado por inevitáveis conotações religiosas. O seu propósito inicial, mesmo que não declarado explicitamente, é mostrar a viabilidade de uma análise do chamamento, sem fazer uma apologia de qualquer tradição. Por seu lado, Foucault mostrou-nos os problemas associados com uma separação histórico-social do tema da culpa. Neste artigo pretendo expor estas duas abordagens sobre a questão da culpa. Is it possible to raise the question of guilt apart from those moral and historical determinants? Heidegger seems to think so and actually undertakes this task based on the reflection on the role of the call, a matter that, like guilt, is also surrounded by unavoidable religious cannotations. Its initial purpose, but does not state explicitly, is to show that it is feasible consistent and deep analysis of the call without making at any time through you an apology for any religious tradition. For his part, Foucault has shown us the problems associated with socio-historical untethering of the issue of guilt. In this paper I intend to expose these two lines of approach to the question of guilt.<br>

Abstract: This article attempts to pose the principles for the use of certain tools, forged in linguistics, for sociological analysis, particularly for the analysis of interviews. Far from being a simple collection of information, the interviews with migrants analyzed here are an arena for intense language activity. With the use of concepts such as annunciation, pragmatism and natural logic, various language functions are identified that sociologists should take into consideration: the construction of representations, negotiation of one's position in an interaction. Contrary to the spontaneous sociology of certain linguistics, language practices are not those of an actor free of all social determinants. On the contrary, by taking into consideration the complexity of language, sociology can construct a plural, heterogeneous and even divided actor. Cet article essaie de poser les principes d'utilisation de quelques outils forgés en linguistique pour l'analyse sociologique, plus particulièrement pour l'analyse des entretiens. Loin d'être une simple collection d'informations, les entretiens analysés ici, qui sont des entretiens de migrants, sont le lieu d'une intense activité langagière. En recourant aux concepts de l'énonciation, de la pragmatique et de la logique naturelle, sont repérés divers fonctionnements langagiers que le sociologue a tout intérêt à considérer: construction des représentations, négociation des places dans l'interaction. Cependant, contrairement à la sociologie spontanée de certaines linguistiques, les pratiques langagières ne sont pas celles d'un acteur libre de toutes déterminations. Au contraire, en prenant en compte toute la complexité du langage, le sociologue peut construire un acteur pluriel, hétérogène, voire divisé.<br>

Author(s): Adam Raoul J.<br>
Abstract: This paper provides a relational analysis of James Fowler's (1981) Faith Development Theory (FDT) and Heinz Streib's (2001) Religious Styles Perspective (RSP) in light of a recent study of apostasy from religious fundamentalisms. Empirical support is provided for both theories. RSP is endorsed as a more encompassing theory of religious development which accounts for more contingencies than FDT. However, FDT is subsumed rather than superseded by RSP as a powerful lens through which to observe cognitive dimensions of religious development. The paper introduces an integrative paradigm, phenomenological empiricism, to conceptualise a complementary relationship between FDT and RSP as key theories in the future study of religious development.<br>

Abstract: In this study we relate four different measures: the theodicy models proposed by van der Ven, the coping strategies proposed by Pargament, a measure of positive or negative self-image and the post critical belief scales we ourselves have developed. We analysed the data of 251 Dutch-speaking Belgians. In the analysis we focus on the relation of the different measures with the post critical belief scales. Different types of believers are using different theodicy models, somewhat different coping strategies and we observe some differences in self-image, where believers have a more positive self-image than non-believers. We could suggest that there is a specific theodicy model used by symbolic believers and another theodicy model used by more literal believers. The former could be interpreted as more developed and perhaps more religiously mature.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines the significance of the concept of culture for organizational analysis. The intersection of culture theory and organization theory is evident in five current research themes: comparative management, corporate culture, organizational cognition, organizational symbolism, and unconscious processes and organization. Researchers pursue these themes for different purposes and their work is based on different assumptions about the nature of culture and organization. The task of evaluating the power and limitations of the concept of culture must be conducted within this assumptive context. This review demonstrates that the concept of culture takes organization analysis in several different and promising directions.<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present the elements of a radical humanist critique which suggests that the discipline of organization theory has been imprisoned by its metaphors, and to stimulate an awareness through which it can begin to set itself free. The paper explores the relationship among paradigms, metaphors, and puzzle solving showing how organization theory and research is constructed upon a network of assumptions that are taken-for-granted. The metaphorical nature of theory and the implications of metaphor for theory construction are examined. A theoretical and methodological pluralism which allows the development of new perspectives for organizational analysis is suggested. While orthodoxy is based upon a few metaphors characteristic of the functionalist paradigm, metaphors characteristic of other paradigms, which challenge the ground assumptions of orthodoxy, are shown to have much to offer.<br>

By using narratological distinctions together with an analysis of the confessional structures of Jim's narratives, we find that his confessions fail for three reasons: he never fulfils his promise to Marlow to plot the 'fundamental why' of his jumping ship, his father's 'easy morality' condemns him even before he abandons the Patna, and Marlow fails to meet his role as confessor.<br>

Abstract: Es wird der Begriff der „Lebensgeschichte“ zur Diskussion gestellt. Am Beispiel ausgewählter Therapie-Konzeptionen (Dührssen, Cremerius, Loch, Kohut, Morgenthaler) wird gezeigt, daß in jeder therapeutischen Richtung verschiedene Segmente des lebensgeschichtlichen Problemfeldes isoliert, ausgearbeitet und zum Ansatzpunkt des therapeutischen Handelns gemacht werden. Die entsprechenden Konsequenzen für Diagnostik, Therapie und Forschung werden im Blick auf aktuelle Strömungen der therapeutischen Psychoanalyse (Ich-Psychologie, Narzißmus-Analyse, Repräsentanzenlehre, hermeneutische Psychoanalyse) verdeutlicht. The concept of „life history“ is the theme of this discussion. Working from a selection of therapy models (Dührssen, Cremerius, Loch, Kohut, Morgenthaler) it can be shown that in every therapeutic approach various segments from the problem area of life histories in general can be isolated, developed and made into the central point of therapeutic activity. The relevant consequences for diagnosis, therapy and research will be clarified with respect to present-day movements in therapeutic psychoanalysis (ego-psychology, the analysis of narcissism, hermeneutic psychoanalysis).<br>

Abstract: The article analyses the narrative construction of a Polish collective identity in confrontation with the Shoa in Andrzej Szczypiorski's Początek [The beautiful Mrs. Seidenman] and Hanna Krall's Zdążyć przed Panem Bogiem [Shielding the Flame]. As the main site of the Shoa in the Second World War, Poland needs a fundamental justification of his national and cultural identity and a revision of the narrations linked with this. In the article, the concept of 'culturodicy', which is derived from theodicy, the justification of God with regard to all the suffering in the world, is developed. Confronted with the Shoa, Poland's national martyrology must be re-qualified and revised. It is the concept of the hero which connects the "collective" with the "individual identity". The analysis of this concept in the aforementioned texts by Szczypiorski and Krall indicates that Szczypiorski's novel falls back more on romantic myths than Krall's literary report.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object h~<br>

Article Title: Text as action, action as text? Ricoeur, λογοσ and the affirmative search for meaning in the 'universe of discourse'<br>
Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Scott-Baumann Alison<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Author(s): Tepe Peter<br>
Abstract: This article critically assesses Bell's attempt at transforming discourse analysis into discourse interpretation by means of hermeneutics as developed by Paul Ricoeur. If a hermeneutic turn is to take place in a discipline that proceeds according to the principles of empirical research, cognitive hermeneutics is the better option compared to Ricoeur's hermeneutics. Part I presents a short introduction to cognitive hermeneutics as developed by Tepe. Against this background, some central theses of Ricoeur's hermeneutics, on which Bell's approach is based, are discussed in part II.<br>

Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Wodak Ruth<br>
Abstract: This article discusses different theoretical and methodological approaches in the humanities and social sciences which strive to analyse and understand, interpret and explain texts and discourses in systematic, qualitative ways. After reviewing some of the salient theories in the social sciences (such as objective hermeneutics and critical hermeneutics), I argue that critical discourse studies require a 'trichotomy' consisting of explanation, interpretation and critique. Other approaches such as Ricoeur's 'hermeneutic arc' seem to neglect important structural and material dimensions of context as well as critical self-reflection. Moreover, I argue that much intuitive and non-transparent speculation in Hermeneutics might be transcended if more historical, cultural, linguistic and philological knowledges would be systematically and explicitly integrated into the analysis of text and discourse, in a retroductable manner. The latter possibility is illustrated by applying an interdisciplinary framework to some brief examples (e.g. intercultural and historical translation studies; the discourse-historical approach in critical discourse studies).<br>

Abstract: Text interpretation – the main interest of discourse analysts – is a central component of the text understanding process. In this article we introduce the Landscape Model, which describes the cognitive processes underlying reading comprehension in a detailed and precise manner. Moreover, this model captures the interpretative processes in which the human mind engages during reading. Within the context of the Landscape Model, we describe the relation between discourse understanding and discourse interpretation, and explain some of the phenomena that are central to the field of discourse analysis as seen from a cognitive perspective. In the first section we describe the basic cognitive processes that underlie discourse understanding, as captured by the Landscape Model. In the following section we illustrate the way that the Landscape Model can be applied to the work of discourse analysts. We conclude by discussing the usefulness of the cognitive Landscape Model for the field of discourse analysis.<br>

Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: The nine responses to my focus article 'Re-constructing Babel: Discourse analysis, hermeneutics and the Interpretive Arc' are cross-disciplinary, as is the article itself. They come from discourse studies (Van Dijk, Billig, Wodak), cognitive science (Tepe, Yeari and Van den Broek, Van Dijk), Old Testament studies (Billig), hermeneutics (Pellauer, Scott-Baumann), history (Gardner) and literature (Pratt). I identify and address five main issues which I see these responses raising for discourse interpretation: the role of author intent and the original sociocultural context in interpretation; principles of translation, particularly in relation to the Babel story; issues of certainty and subjectivism in interpretation, again including the Babel story; the role and limitations of cognitive approaches, and the potential of images like 'unfolding the matter of the text' to be realized in teaching hands-on discourse work; and finally a call to new listening in the encounter with hermeneutics, as a route to freshening the field I like to call Discourse Interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Within the papal eneyelieals (exhortations) ranging from Leo XIII (1878) to Pope Francis (2013), concern for authority in general and for obedience and duty, in particular, is in decline. This longterm trend signals intra-ecclesial secularization at the elite level. A second negative trend supports this finding: textual indicators for Catholic uniqueness such as: Catholic, Doctrine and Pope have steadily lost prominence. Upwardly directed, the textual indicators for God, Jesus, Gospel, Spirituality and Love follow positive long-term trends. The traditional eschatological code, with its keywords sin, death, final judgment, heaven or hell, reaches only low levels of attention. Overall, there is an eschatological loss, where Heaven, due to a slower decline, wins over Hell. Christ the Inexorable Judge is retreating in favor of the loving Jesus and God as Love. The millennia-old process of civilizing God persists. Technically, the quantitative content analysis was carried out mainly with TEXTPACK.<br>

Abstract: Original Sin is considered to be a uniquely Christian doctrine. Nevertheless, an analysis of apparently forgotten Jewish treatises — most of which are to be found only in manuscript form — reveals that an extraordinary philosophical theory of Original Sin is present in late medieval Jewish thought. It implies, therefore, a new dimension in characterising this doctrine and has implications for the understanding of the process of inter-communicating of Jewish and Christian thought. This study focuses on fundamental Jewish passages, beginning with Apocalyptic literature and ending with medieval philosophical texts. Yet, the examination of those Hebrew texts is carried out in the light of the writing of Christian scholars. This means that the attempt to clarify this Jewish doctrine is made, from a methodological viewpoint, both by looking at the development of this doctrine trough the history of the Jewish thought, and by a close examination of the parallel general sources. It is only then that one can see that rudiments of the Christian doctrine of Original Sin were inserted into the Aristotelian theory of Nature, and combined with elements from Maimonides' Biblical-allegoric exegesis.<br>

Abstract: Son ya varias las décodas transcurridas desde que los estudios de folklore en general y la etnomusicología en particular se han visto dominados por la analitica deconstructiva y el pensamiento culturalista, configurando un bloque paradigmático sumamente influyente en el multidisciplinar territorio de las ciencias sociales. Las aportaciones provenientes de estas corrientes han resultado en líneas generates de gran valor e interés para la comunidad científica, ensanchando y dinamizando el hasta entonces relativamente reducido campo de acción e interpretación de disciplinas como la musicología comparada. Sin embargo el proceso de renovación académica –que encabezarían obras como las de Benedict Anderson y Eric Hobsbawm– ha implicado asimismo un desigual desplazamiento del foco de atención desde el objeto de estudio mismo hacia la esfera de su contexto, relevancia social e implicaciones ideológicas. La deconstrucción se ha ejercido particularmente en contra del aserto diferencial, subrayando sus debilidades argumentales, excesos etnocéntricos y –con frecuencia– obvios intereses espurios, una tarea históricamente necesaria pero que a la par ha sustraído del folklore todo valor ontológico en aras de su significado, y del trabajo científico el vital soporte empírico, que ahora se ve arrinconado por una elaboración altamente abstracta al amparo de un lenguaje en el límite de la saturación semántica. Este artículo explora la vía crítica descrita para concluir planteando determinadas alternativas en defensa de una tradición sostenible –a pesar del vigor innegable y sinergético de las fuerzas del progreso, los procesos de hibridación y globalización y las alteraciones provenientes del constructo folklorista–, así como del hecho diferencial implícito y su asunción y gestión no indefectiblemente en el marco de un proyecto político o comercial.

Abstract: It is surely because this prolongational dimension was not taken on board by structu-
ral linguistics that it did not inspire research in this sense in the application of linguistic mo-
dels to music analysis. In the history of analysis in the 20th century prolongation is drawn
from other sources: from Fuxian counterpoint in Schenker, from Gestalt psychology in Me-
yer. Note that had the linguistic théories of Gustave Guillaume - inventor of a 'psycho-
mechanics of language' marginalized during the structuralist period - been studied more
widely, the situation may have been rather différent. But we can't re-write history...<br>

Abstract: The study of causes and chance events that happened to connect two distant musical traditions may help understand some aspects of both. Certain basic principles, often only implied, become apparent as we look at them from a different standpoint. And it grows clear that sundry meanings are given to the word "influence", so ubiquitous in discourse on cultural exchange. By discussing some specific traits of sub-Saharan music, the Author explores how and why some major 20th-century Western composers came to welcome its influence, thus establishing relationships that reveal (apart from superficial comparison) how such musical concepts as "influence", "tradition", and "innovation" developed in Africa and in Western music, and how they were received in academia. This work is rooted in the Author's personal experience in musical analysis, from Togo to European scholarship.<br>

Abstract: The notion of text acquires a fundamental epistemological role in the disciplines of language in the second half of the XXth century. The analysis of some linguistic objects we have called semiological tools could highlight some epistemological issues in the use of the term text. From the Sixties we can observe that text has progressively acquired the general status of an object of analysis. Nevertheless, if linguistic text proves to be a common object of analysis for semiotics and hermeneutics, then it is necessary to reconsider their epistemological relations, to understand something new about what text is. Considering the interpretative problem in the hjelmslevian epistemology, a new perspective emerges between these complementary approaches to text. Comparing semiotics and hermeneutics we can also question the epistemological role that the notion of text embodies among contemporary disciplines of language.<br>

Abstract: Cet article vise à opérer une comparaison des traitements de la relation que le choix entretient avec le destin et la contingence tels qu'ils apparaissent dans le mythe d'Er de Platon et la philosophie pratique d'Aristote. L'hypothèse que nous défendrons est que cette comparaison permet de mettre au jour une inversion consistant dans le passage d'une conception où le choix se trouve mis au principe d'un destin et de son temps clos à l'affirmation d'un choix exclusif de toute idée de destin et constitutif, par conséquent, d'un temps ouvert. The purpose of this paper is to compare the analysis of the relationship that choice has to fate and contingency as they appear in Plato's myth of Er and in Aristotle's practical philosophy. Our hypothesis is that this comparison brings out an inversion consisting in the transition from a conception where choice is conceived as the principle of fate and of its enclosed time to the affirmation of a choice that is exclusive of any idea of fate and founds an open time.<br>

Abstract: An initial awareness is needed of the debates regarding the choice of research approaches in sociology and the diversity and specificity of methods currently being used in the domain of textual data analysis in France. In general the influence of the French socio-linguistic tradition looms large, including, on the one hand, the older works of Michel Pécheux on the "discursive formations" and his A.A.D. (Analyse Automatique du Discours, 1969), and on the other hand, two main perspectives of the "Ecole Française d'Analyse du/de Discours" - which refer to the "speech act" concept and to the problematics of enunciation, and emphasizes the processes and "sociodiscursive practices" between socially-located speakers. Such theoretical conceptions and specific requirements lead to build on methodologies different from the classic, theme-based content analysis, though not yet translated into an operational software. Then the main software developments currently having an impact (at least potential) on practices of computer-aided sociological analysis of textual data, in France, are classified : from the lexicometric using procedures of "French Data Analysis" ('Analyse Factorielle des Correspondances' of Benzecri, and so on...), to a set of "expert-systems" working on specific theoretical frameworks, through more classical methods of content analysis and coding-sorting-retrieving socio-semantic procedures, eventually with various statistical methods. L'auteur expose d'abord quelques considèrations épistémologiques générales sur les présupposés implicites des méthodes de recherche sociologique, abusivement séparées en qualitatives et quantitatives, et des interrogations spécifiques sur le statut des corpus textuels et des pratiques socio-discursives dans différents domaines et selon divers types de problématique en sociologie. Puis, après un résumé des problématiques sociolinguistiques de l'"énonciation", propres aux courants de l'Analyse de Discours à la française", il propose~<br>

Author(s): Odenstedt Anders<br>
Abstract: This paper discusses Hans-Georg Gadamer's account of what he sees as a major change in the approach to the Western philosophical and aesthetic traditions that began in the second half of the eighteenth century, and the results of this change today. According to Gadamer, these traditions ceased to be binding at this time and became objects of historical research. Instead of being seen even as potential sources of insight, traditional knowledge claims and works of art were subjected to historical and aesthetic analysis. And Gadamer holds that these approaches have partially come to encompass the present as well. Thus, modern art has often downplayed cognitive and pedagogical tasks in proceeding in a purely aesthetic, playful way. And the study of history has been seen as providing insight into the contextually determined nature of presuppositions, those of the modern age included. According to Gadamer, this unduly limits the possibilities of both art and history to provide learning.<br>

Abstract: This essay discusses Heidegger's interpretation of autobiographical narration in his lecture on Basic Problems of Phenomenology (WS 1919/20) as an alternative conception of authenticity. A focused comparison between Heidegger's early understanding of the 'narrated self' and the analysis of the call of conscience in Being and Time shows that the most problematic aspects of Heidegger's later idea of authenticity result from a distinct isolation of the authentic self, which is specific for his conception of authenticity since the mid-twenties. At last, the article intends to demonstrate that Heidegger's early idea of an original self-understanding is close to current philosophical theories which assume a holistic idea of authenticity and point out a strong relation between authenticity and narrativity.<br>

Publisher: FELIX MEINER VERLAG<br>
Issue: i24358654<br>

Author(s): Amthor David<br>
Abstract: Emmanuel Levinas' earliest development of thought is presented here as a phenomenological endeavor, i.e. in its relation to Husserl and Heidegger as well as in its own effort to give an appropriate philosophical account of ‚things themselves‘. The latter task is shown to have a transcendental dimension as it is a self-awareness of conscious life in which the faithful analysis of concrete phenomena and the concept of this life itself have to be brought into attunement. The perspective of Levinas' phenomenological gaze is then presented in these terms and shows two fairly distinct stages. Up to the mid-1930s Levinas appears as a follower of Martin Heidegger, when he advocates an appropriate approach to being in all its richness and therefore criticizes Husserl's alleged intellectualism. Later, with a radicalized perspective, Levinas' own philosophical project advocates an appropriate account of the problem of radical alterity beyond experience and phenomenology. He therefore criticizes both Husserl and Heidegger and remodels phenomenology so that it can adequately ‚understand‘ radical alterity and at the same time confine itself before it.<br>

Abstract: The present article explores some currently disputed issues regarding the relationship between temporality, memory, and the self. To exemplify and to concretely examine the problems under consideration, a phenomenological analysis of dementia illnesses is proposed. The first objective of this article is to develop an appropriate concept of the self, apt to describe the experience of dementia patients. To this aim, the different positions in the debate regarding the preservation of the self in dementia patients are first critically assessed. Subsequently, it is shown how the phenomenological distinction between the basic sense of self, often indicated as the minimal self, and the higher forms of narrative self-consciousness and identity can fruitfully contribute in this debate. The second objective of the article is a more concrete qualification of the minimal self. Particularly, the determination of the minimal self as un-extended in time is challenged. On the basis of the phenomenology of time and implicit body memory, and still exemplarily referring to the analysis of dementia illnesses, it will be argued that a concrete description of basic self-experience necessarily needs to take its spatio-temporal unfolding into account.<br>

Abstract: En este artículo se aborda la diversidad de tipos o dimensiones del discurso implícito. En concreto, se plantea una caracterización tipológica del mismo basada en las intenciones del productor del discurso, distinguiéndose cuatro dimensiones básicas: el discurso insinuado, el discurso ocultado, el discurso «fallido» y el discurso subyacente. Después de ofrecer ejemplos de cada uno de ellos, se sostiene la utilidad de la tipología propuesta para el análisis sociológico del discurso implícito, esto es, para su detección y su interpretación. This article discusses the variety of types or dimensions of implicit discourse. Specifically, a typological characterisation is proposed, based on the intentions of the producer of the discourse, including a distinction between four basic dimensions: insinuated discourse, hidden discourse, ‘failed’ discourse and underlying discourse. Some examples are provided of each dimension, and then it is held that the proposed typology is useful for the sociological analysis of implicit discourse, that is, for its detection and interpretation.<br>

Abstract: The article proposes a definition of the German term ›Narrativ‹ as an analytical category of interdisciplinary narratology. Based on the terminological approaches of both psychology and history, ›Narrativ‹ is described as an intersubjective narrative pattern consisting of specific structural features. The depiction of these features allows for a more accurate analysis of phenomena of collective narration from a comparative perspective. The utility of the concept will be proved by analysing some aspects of the ongoing debate on a ›New Narrative for Europe‹. It becomes apparent that a stock of consistent terminology based on philological basic research is necessary for major problems of interdisciplinary narratology.<br>

Cet exercice en autoethnographie se divise en deux parties : d'abord un compte-rendu impressionniste d'un voyage en Nouvelle-Zélande/Aotearoa de l'auteur avec sa famille pour disperser les cendres de son partenaire au Cap Reinga (Te Rerenga Wairua) dans une cérémonie Maori et, en seconde partie, une analyse de la première partie posant le problème des notions de « culture » et « d'hybridité », puis abandonnant les deux en faveur d'une approche dialogique à la différence et à « l'Autre ».<br>

L'exemple précis des jeux vidéo permet ici non seulement de questionner la dichotomie virtuel / réel mais aussi la définition traditionnelle du jeu élaborée à partir du modèle de la règle distincte de son effectuation concrète. L'analyse des pratiques ludiques de personnes en situation de handicap pointe enfin la nécessité d'une attention portée sur les modes d'appropriation corporelle d'un dispositif techno-communicationnel. En conséquence, il s'agit d'envisager les formes d'expériences vidéo-ludiques comme des « instances de procuration » autorisant l'exploration sensible de mondes moins disjoints les uns des autres qu'en interaction constante. This article is a continuation of ongoing research to understand the uses of online gaming by people with physical disabilities. By emphasizing the epistemic and methodological contributions of online ethnography, it points to the heuristic limits of the traditional distinction between a supposedly real world and that which would be repeated in the virtual. The specific use of video games in this example, makes it possible not only to question the virtual–real dichotomy, but also to question the traditional definition of the game which starts from the premise that the rule is distinct from its concrete execution. Analysis of the recreational practices of disabled people also points to the need for attention to modes of bodily appropriation of techno-communication devices. In the end, it is a question of considering video entertainment experiences like "instances of proxy," authorizing the sensitive exploration~<br>

Abstract: Cet article analyse les expériences de mobilité interne de femmes atteintes par le VIH résidant au moment des enquêtes ethnographiques dans la ville de Gondar, dans le nord-ouest de l'Éthiopie. Les expériences biographiques de cinq femmes séropositives, vivant dans des conditions de marginalité sociale et originaires de zones rurales, seront étudiées plus largement dans les principales configurations que la mobilité féminine interne prend en fonction de l'âge et de l'origine sociale des sujets migrants. L'article mettra au jour le caractère multiforme et la condition permanente d'instabilité de ces parcours migratoires. Initiés depuis un premier projet de départ, ils se sont poursuivis au fil des opportunités et des contraintes que les femmes migrantes ont rencontrées tout au long de leur parcours de migration dans une tension constante vers un avenir que les expériences biographiques cristallisent comme le temps du changement. Nous démontrerons que l'état de séropositivité au VIH, avec ses manifestations et ses conséquences, apparaît comme un facteur de conditionnement prééminent sans pour autant constituer une « rupture biographique ». Il participe au processus d'« assujettissement » d'individus se situant en marge de la société et des espaces d'action des pouvoirs établis. Plus particulièrement, l'analyse de la relation subjective de ces femmes aux normes et aux catégories du discours dominant présidant à la construction de leur « identité sociale virtuelle », mettra en exergue que le VIH représente à la fois une opportunité et une contrainte dans la détermination de leur relation subjective à l'avenir. This article analyses the experiences of internal mobility of HIV-positive women who at the moment of the ethnographic surveys lived in the city of Gondar, in North Western Ethiopia. The "biographical experiences" of five women who migrated from rural areas and used to live in conditions of social marginality will be placed in the context of a wider analysis of th~<br>

Issue: i24484208<br>
Date: 8 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): da Silva António Barbosa<br>
Abstract: The purpose of this theoretical article is to discuss the existential and universal feature of suffering—as illustrated by Job's suffering in the Book of Job in the Bible and by the survivors of the 2004 Asian tsunami catastrophe—and to highlight its significance for health care. Further, the study is aiming at contributing to health professionals' understanding of patients' suffering. The sources are narratives, comprising Job's book, TV interviews 1 year after the tsunami catastrophe and the survivors' autobiographies. The methodological approach is a philosophical analysis. The existential, universal, ontological and epistemological aspects of suffering are carefully scrutinized to unveil the universal and existential versus culture-specific features of suffering. Based on the results, the authors' recommendations are (1) a holistic concept of the patient and health care has to seriously consider suffering in all its complexity because when a person is in pain, it is not his/her body but the whole person as a unity of body, psyche and spirit that suffers and (2) suffering should be seen as the most central concept of health care, which should provide treatment for physical pain and all dimensions of suffering: physical, social, mental and spiritual aspects.<br>

Abstract: The subject of the presented research is the analysis of relations between Post-Critical Belief and Sense of Coherence in women and men in early, middle, and late adulthood. Six hundred and thirty-six individuals participated in the research, 332 women and 304 men, at the age of 18–79 years. We applied the Post-Critical Belief scale by Hutsebaut (J Empir Theol 9:48–66, 1996) and the Sense of Coherence scale (SOC-29) by Antonovsky (Soc Sci Med 36:725–733, 1993). The results suggest that the salutogenic function of religiosity is related to age and gender—in women, it is most strongly marked in late, and in men, in middle adulthood<br>

Author(s): Bracher Nathan<br>
Abstract: The present article argues that Hélène Berr's Journal goes well beyond mere testimony to provide an astute analysis not only of the persecutory measures, arrests, camps, and deportations but also of the various attempts to camouflage the violence and even of the wider implications of what she ultimately recognized to be a systematic extermination. Hélène Berr thus presents an extraordinary case of a young French Jewish student at the Sorbonne who, steeped in literature but untrained in history, nevertheless achieved a degree of historical lucidity that, in view of the confused, limited, and often unreliable information available to her in Nazi-occupied Paris, we can only consider as remarkable. Above all, Hélène Berr's very personal confrontation with history, as it unfolded in all the sinister complexity of what we now know as the Holocaust, enables us to better understand these events in the human terms in which they were experienced and with the ethical dimensions that they take on for us today.<br>

Article Title: THE POETICS OF ANCIENT GREEK MEMORY AND THE HISTORICAL IMPERATIVE<br>
Publisher: Wiley Periodicals, Inc.<br>
Issue: i24542986<br>
Date: 10 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Grethlein Jonas<br>
Abstract: This book examines Greek engagements with the past as articulations of memory formulated against the contingency of chance associated with temporality. Based on a phenomenological understanding of temporality, it identifies four memorializing strategies: continuity (tradition), regularity (exemplarity), development, and acceptance of chance. This framework serves in pursuing a twofold aim: to reconstruct the literary field of memory in fifth-century BCE Greece; and to interpret Greek historiography as a memorializing mode. The key contention advanced by this approach is that acts of memory entailed an "idea of history" that was articulated not only in historiography, but also in epinician poetry, elegy, tragedy, and oratory. The book offers a rich account of poetic conventions and contexts through which each of these genres counterbalanced contingency through the use of exemplary and traditional modes of memory. This fine analysis highlights the grip of the present on the past as a significant feature of both historiographical and nonhistoriographical genres. The essay argues that this work fills a disciplinary gap by extending the reflection on memory to a new period, Greek antiquity. The retrospective positioning of this period at the outset of Western historical thought brings Grethlein's investigation to the center of debates about memory, temporality, and the meaning history. In engaging with the book's argument, the essay suggests that historiographical memory emerged in Greece not as a first-order encounter with time, but as a second-order encounter with forgetting. This confrontation marked a certain separation of historiography from other memorializing genres. Whereas poetic and rhetorical memories were posited against contingency, historiography sought to retrieve those aspects of the past that may otherwise have been irretrievably lost and forgotten. In doing so, it formulated the historiographical imperative as a negation of forgetting that problematized~<br>

Author(s): CZERNY BORIS<br>
Abstract: De septembre 1941 à novembre 1943 le lieu-dit Babij Jar, vaste ravin situé dans la périphérie de Kiev, devint un immense charnier où s'entassèrent les corps de milliers de Juifs fusillés entre les 29 et 30 septembre 1941 ainsi que ceux de prisonniers de l'Armée rouge, de nationalistes ukrainiens, de familles entières de tsiganes, et les cadavres d'hommes, de femmes et d'enfants massacrés tout au long de l'occupation de la ville par l'armée allemande. Si le déroulement du massacre a été l'objet de nombreuses études historiques précises, l'analyse littéraire des textes – poèmes, œuvres en prose, articles de presse – traitant de Babij Jar a été délaissée. Le point de départ du présent article est la littérature considérée dans le sens russe du mot de textes écrits sur un sujet donné, et donc toute forme de documents écrits en URSS en russe, ukrainien ou yiddish entre 1941 et 1948, année de la fermeture du journal yiddish Ejnikajt. En plaçant la littérature au centre de l'article, nous estimons que le contenu même des textes doit permettre d'établir des connections éventuelles avec d'autres œuvres s'inscrivant dans la thématique malheureusement très vaste de la souffrance juive. Il n'est évidemment pas question de nier l'assassinat de personnes non-juives à Babij Jar, mais de souligner l'extraordinaire ampleur du massacre d'une grande partie de la population juive de Kiev en l'espace de deux jours et en un seul lieu. Between September 1941 and November 1943 the place called Babii Iar, a large ravine not far from Kiev, became a mass grave. Thousands of Jews were shot down on the 29th and 30th of September 1941, and the ravine was piled with their dead bodies, as well as the bodies of prisoners of the Red Army, Ukrainian nationalists, entire families of gypsies, and the corpses of men, women and children slaughtered during the German occupation. A lot of historical studies have dealt with the proceedings; but the literary analysis of texts (poems, prose, articles) dealing~<br>

Abstract: El texto busca mostrar cómo Pío IX y su más conocido documento, el Syllabus errorum, publicado en 1864, participan del fin de una era multisecular en la historia del catolicismo, caracterizada por la existencia de un dominio temporal pontificio, por un vínculo afectivo de la Iglesia católica con la monarquía como forma de gobierno y por la concepción de la fe católica como única vía para la salvación. Fin de una era, no solo desde la perspectiva de la vigencia de las instituciones, sino de las representaciones que las acompañan. La demostración se apoya en un análisis de los tiempos en que el pontífice y su documento se enmarcan, desde la perspectiva braudeliana de los tiempos históricos, así como en las categorías propuestas por R. Koselleck para el estudio de la experiencia del tiempo. This article aims to show how Pius X and his most famous document, the Syllabus of Errors, published in 1864, participated in the end of a centuries-old era in the history of Catholicism that was characterized by the existence of the temporal dominion of the Popes, close ties between the Catholic Church and monarchism as a form of government and the conception of the Catholic faith as the only road to salvation. This was the end of an era, not just from the perspective of the power of institutions, but also in terms of the representations that accompanied them. The article is supported by a Braudelian analysis of the times in which the Pope and his document belonged and makes use of the categories proposed by R. Koselleck for the study of the experience of time.<br>

Author(s): Tyree-Hageman Jennifer<br>
Abstract: This paper traces the development of the historical origins of an economic ethos and the groups that carried and transformed this ethos in two key economic sectors: first, Silicon Valley, and second, Wall Street. Financialization of the US economy is closely connected to a political logic that celebrated the capacity for the self-regulation of markets and condemned state intervention, bringing free-market thought to the fore. A growing body of sociological literature explains the rise of neoliberalism as an intellectual project, as a series of policy reforms, and as a form of politics. This dialogue has largely lacked sufficient critical analysis of whether a motivating ethos allowed market fundamentalism to emerge and take hold across different economic sectors. An analysis of the resurgence of free-market ideas in two important sectors of the US economy, informed by Weberian theory, reveals a distinct element, in this case an ethos, which itself motivates and sustains free-market thinking. In Silicon Valley and on Wall Street an economic ethos emerged from the structuring of ideas and ethics into specific historical contexts by distinct groups within each economic sector.<br>

Publisher: IRSA<br>
Issue: i24595727<br>
Date: 1 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Burroughs Charles<br>
Abstract: Through the analysis of a major religious painting by Botticelli, this article builds on important recent work on Botticelli's sacred art to explore apparent responses on the part of an especially sophisticated artist to the gathering atmosphere of crisis in the city's political and religious life. The artist uses various devices of connection or separation between the viewer/worshiper and the holy image; these devices are not unique to the painting, but their combination is exceptional. First, Botticelli uses a hieratic gold ground to distinguish a scene set in heaven, the coronation of the Virgin, from a more earthly zone; here recent scruples about the representation of transcendence seem to be in play. Second, the figures beneath, four major saints, embody different ways of addressing the viewer and mediating between him/her and the heavenly event. Third, the latter appears to be treated as an apsidal image within an implied architectural setting, in other words, as a representation of a representation. By establishing modes of mediation, then, Botticelli confronts issues emerging as central to the representation of the sacred, in part on the basis of a critical understanding of Albertian picture theory.<br>

Author(s): Benjamin Roy<br>
Abstract: In this paper, I examine the influence of the Gospel of John on Joyce's aesthetic. My basic claim is that the gospel aided Joyce in charting a middle course between materialism (body without spirit) and spiritualism (spirit without body). After examining the temptations of flying too high (symbolism, mysticism, gnosticism) and flying too low (historicism, realism, materialism), I show how Joyce made use of the Johannine strategies of epiphany and realized eschatology to achieve a synthesis between these extremes. The essay is much indebted to two students of John—Rudolph Bultmann and Franz Mussner—who examined John's peculiar synthesis of fact and allegory. In addition, the scholar Jacques Aubert was indispensable for his analysis of a similar trajectory in Joyce's aesthetic.<br>

Abstract: Les auteurs proposent de concevoir les idéologies politiques comme des « trames », c'est-à-dire des véhicules de narration qui organisent la production de récits identitaires. Cette proposition, de pair avec l'analyse compréhensive des idéologies, pourrait apporter une solution aux problèmes liés au changement et à la permanence de ces procédés rhétoriques, thématiques, symboliques, etc. Pour illustrer cette théorie, les auteurs analysent le cas de la Navarre depuis le dernier tiers du XIXe siècle. On peut ainsi observer comment l'affrontement de deux trames idéologiques a provoqué le grave conflit d'identité dont souffre cette communauté depuis la transition démocratique. It is being suggested here that ideologies can be conceived of as « textures » or narrative vehicles organizing the production of identity-narratives. That suggestion together with the related understanding analysis of ideologies may solve the problems tied to change and permanence in their rhetorical, topical and symbolic processes. To illustrate their theory, the authors study the case of Navarra since the late 19th century, showing how the antagonism of two ideological textures yielded the deep identity conflict that has been affecting this community since the democratic transition.<br>

Abstract: The mice folk's reception of Josefine's art in Kafka's story "Josefine, die Sängerin oder Das Volk der Mäuse" reflects the reception on the part of Kraus's audience of his literary art with its "meta-ideological" cultural analysis. This analysis was recognized by the primary members of the Frankfurt School for Social Research and is easily demonstrable in Kraus's analytical treatment of the Social Democrats in the short essay "Hüben und Drüben." The question of the efficacy of Kraus's analysis is better posed as a question of the reception on the part of the mice folk of the meta-ideological analysis undertaken.<br>

Abstract: The author argues that Casanova's journey to Venice constitutes not only a physical journey, but also an inner quest that brings significant insights. A close analysis of the dream sequence as a condensed version of the novella's plot reveals the protagonist's disillusionment with the obsolete public persona in which he is trapped, a reluctant recognition of an inner void, and a paralysis in his futile pursuit of a new identity, qualities which capture the fin-desiècle Viennese Weltanschauung.<br>

Abstract: Paul Klee's art found broad impact upon philosophers of varying commitments, including Hans-Georg Gadamer. Moreover, Klee himself was not only one of the most important artists of aesthetic modernism but one of its leading theoreticians, and much in his work, as in Gadamer's, originated in post-Kantian literary theory's explications of symbol and allegory. Indeed at one point in Truth and Method, Gadamer associates his project for a general "theory of hermeneutic experience" not only with Goethe's metaphysical account of the symbolic but equally with a "rehabilitation" of allegory. In this paper, I examine this position and Gadamer's own use of it in his analysis of Klee's work, contrasting it with that of Walter Benjamin's account of allegory, equally indebted to Goethe and this archive. Finally, I contrast the resulting interpretations of Klee, discussing the implications that evolve for understanding both Gadamer and Benjamin—but equally for understanding Klee's work and, provisionally, the work of art, thus construed, for philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Environmentally we seem to be both the victims and the perpetrators of a type of bait and switch: lured into the discussion by one set of intuitions, our interests become redescribed in terms that are intellectually more respectable. Our deepest concerns with the environment are converted into foreign discourses, as we strain to make the languages of science, economics, and interest group politics express our intuitions. The circumscription of environmental philosophy within environmental ethics is one manifestation of this process of bait and switch. 'Corrosive Effects' critiques this process through a case study of acid mine drainage-water pollution resulting from mining activities. An analysis of acid mine drainage reveals the metaphysical and theological roots of many of our environmental problems.<br>

Abstract: This article examines Gadamer's claim that language is fundamentally metaphorical from the perspective of Ricoeur's complementary analysis of metaphor. I argue that Gadamer's claim can only be understood in relation to a broader understanding of metaphor in which metaphor is not regarded as secondary to literal meaning. From this context one is better able to understand the connection Gadamer makes between language and ontology, which is found in his statement "Being that can be understood is language."<br>

Abstract: The article comprises three parts. Part I contains an overview of the areas in the analysis of modern French philosophy that have been of the greatest relevance to Russian researchers over the last years. We conclude that numerous aspects of the French philosophical thought of the twentieth century are well represented in the research of Russian authors, who also point out the emerging trends in its development. Part II deals with the development of analytic philosophy in Russia within the framework of such areas as "critique of bourgeois philosophy", a purely ideological stand only nominally related to philosophy, logic, and the history of philosophy and theoretical research. Part III contains a periodization of the history of phenomenology in Russia, pointing out the most important achievements of the contemporary Russian scholars of phenomenology as well as their understanding of the essence, the problems, and the aims of phenomenological philosophy. We also indicate the tendencies within the development of the discipline in the Russian Federation.<br>

Abstract: Cécile et Étienne sont amants. Elle est âgée de trente-six ans, mariée et mère, vit à Paris; il a dix ans de moins, est célibataire, provincial et sans expérience sexuelle. Leur importante correspondance a été déposée à l'Association pour l'autobiographie et le patrimoine autobiographique (APA) et constitue une source d'une grande richesse. Faisant appel à la microhistoire et attentive à l'analyse des discours, nous proposons de suivre le développement de l'histoire d'amour de Cécile et Étienne entre 1945 et 1960, en s'attardant sur ses prémices entre 1945 et 1949. L'analyse d'une relation adultère vécue de l'intérieur permet de mieux comprendre les métamorphoses de l'intimité au cours de cette période du baby-boom, en particulier les rôles masculin et féminin. Cette histoire singulière permet aussi d'éclairer, par un jeu de contrastes, les représentations de la conjugalité pendant les décennies d'après-guerre — période de doutes au sujet de l'intimité. En quoi ce couple adultère interroge-t-il et contourne-t-il les normes conjugales, tout en cherchant à s'y conformer? Cécile and Étienne were lovers. She was a thirty-six year-old mother, married and living in Paris; he was ten years younger, single, living in the suburbs and lacking in sexual experience. Their vast correspondence, deposited with the Association pour l'autobiographie et le patrimoine autobiographique (APA, Association for Autobiography and Autobiographical Heritage), constitutes a documentary source of great value. Referencing the phenomenon of microhistory and relying upon discourse analysis, we shall attempt to follow the trajectory of Cécile and Étienne's relationship between 1945 and 1960, focusing in particular on its beginnings from 1945 to 1949. Analysing an adulterous relationship from such an inside perspective will shed light on the metamorphosis of intimacy that occurred during the Baby Boom era, in particular with regard to male and female gender roles. By playing with contrasts, this uni~<br>

Abstract: En 2006, en Afrique du Sud, une chanson évoquant la guerre anglo-boer (1899-1902), « De La Rey », connut un succès exceptionnel chez les jeunes Afrikaners. Entendue selon les uns comme un appel aux armes contre le gouvernement, selon d'autres comme l'expression de l'incertitude de ces jeunes blancs parlant afrikaans quant à leur avenir dans le pays, elle libéra la parole, permit à de nombreuses interrogations de s'exprimer, notamment quant au poids de l'héritage de l'apartheid et à la possibilité de s'en libérer. Après avoir brièvement présenté la position des Afrikaners dans la société sud-africaine, cet article évoque l'histoire de la chanson et du rock afrikaans pour y situer « De La Rey »; il envisage ensuite les débats qu'elle a provoqués avant de procéder à une étude systématique du clip vidéo qui l'a illustré. Il met en lumière l'instabilité des configurations identitaires afrikaners et propose une méthode d'analyse du clip vidéo qui fait ressortir sa capacité à exprimer ambiguïtés et contradictions. In 2006, a song dedicated to the Boer general Koos De La Rey, a forgotten hero of the second Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902), became a hit among young Afrikaners and provoked heated debates about Afrikaners' attitudes towards the « new » South Africa. Some commentators heard in its lyrics a call to arms against the Anc government, others interpreted it as an expression of the anxiety young Afrikaners felt about their future in the country. Beyond what was written and said in the media, debating the song « De La Rey » allowed the public articulation of interrogations about the legacy of apartheid and the possibility to overcome it. After a brief presentation of the current situation of Afrikaners in South Africa, this paper introduces the history of Afrikaans song and rock music to provide the backcloth to an analysis of « De La Rey ». Opinions expressed in various forums are reviewed before a structural analysis of the video clip that greatly contributed to the succes~<br>

Abstract: In Reformational philosophy the term 'structure' can be used in two different senses: It could
refer to the factual or subject-side of reality and is then used in the sense of the structure of
reality. It could also refer to the law-side of reality, i.e. the structural laws governing and
conditioning the regularities perceived in phenomena. Then it is understood in the sense of the
structure for reality. When the term 'structure mapping' is used in this article it refers primarily
to the latter sense of the term, although it is conceded that analysis of the structures for reality
are inextricably bound to the analysis of the structures of reality.<br>

Abstract: For Dooyeweerd's Western oriented, sometimes even nationalistically tinted and yet, in
its intention, normative view of culture, see A New Critique, vol. 2, pp. 266-68, etc. In his
Roots in particular, the Occident' is very central (ch. 1, §§ 3,17-25), as the following passage
illustrates: Ά truly scriptural view of history... knows that the great antithesis between the
ground motive of the divine revelation of the Word and the ground motive of the apostate
spirit operates [in history] in the power struggle for the future of western civilization' (p.
108). Yes, Dooyeweerd at one point even calls the Dutch national character, in view of its
calvinistic bent, its humaneness, its sober life-style, and the like, a 'normative type' of histor-
ical disclosure and differentiation (p. 82). See also the striking analysis by C. T. Mclntire in
'Dooyeweerd's Philosophy of History', especially pp. 104-5, together with the nuanced criti-
cism of S. Griffioen in 'De betekenis van Dooyeweerd's ontwikkelingsidee', pp. 105-7.<br>

Abstract: Cf. George Steiner, A/ter Babel, Aspects of Language and Translation (Oxford Univer-
sity Press, 1975), for perhaps the best comparative analysis of state-of-the-art in translation
theory. George Steiner himself seems to prefer a special sort of interlinear literalist
option (but not 'a word-for-word' transference) that has the translator remain selflessly
submerged within the original tongue, producing a centaur idiom in which one's own
longue takes on a 'deliberate strangeness', and the product becomes virtually an unknown
tongue 'which can transcend the constraints of imprécise objective reference' (pp.307-33).
Steiner approves of Hölderlin's approach, and crédits Chesteron on Du Bellay and Leyris
on Hopkins as superb approximations of the true translation (pp.407-13).<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur, op.cit., p. 156. The tremendous difficulties we face in developing an
adequate view of evil are well illustrated by the fact that Ricoeur himself, despite his clear
intentions to the contrary, works with a view of human "fault" in Fallible Man (Chicago:
Henry, 1965) which itself comes very close to reading sin and evil into the fundamental
human structure. See the Master's thesis of Henry Venema, Philosophical Anthropology, and the
Problem of Evil: An Interpretative Analysis of Paul Ricoeur's Philosophy of Will (Toronto: Institute
for Christian Studies, 1986).<br>

Author(s): Blosser Philip<br>
Abstract: H. Dooyeweerd, "Calvinistische Wijsbegeerte," Scientia 1 (1956), 144; quoted in G.C.
Berkouwer, Man: The Image of God, Studies in Dogmatics, trans. Dirk W. Jellema (Grand
Rapids: Eerdmans, 1962), p. 258; henceforth cited as "Man." See Dooyeweerd's comparable
statement in NC, I, 21, where he uses "philosophical" instead of "theoretical" thought; and cf.
TM, VI, on the presuppositional nature of the soul in human theorizing.
The parallels with Scheler's view of the "person" are remarkable here. Much as in
Dooyeweerd's view the "soul" or "heart" can never be objectified, so for Scheler the "person"
can never become an object of analysis; much as in Dooyeweerd's view "acts" come forth out
of the soul but only function within the temporal structure of the human body, so for Scheler
the person acts into time without himself being in time. For Scheler's distinction between
"acts" and "functions," and significant differences in his view of the act-structure, see Max
Scheler, Der Formalismus in der Ethik und die Materiale Wertethik, Gesammelte Werke, Vol;. II, ed.
Maria Scheler (Bern: Francke Verlag, 1954), pp. 395ff.; translated as Formalism in Ethics and
No7t-Formal Ethics of Values (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973), pp. 385ff. For
the comparable views of Dooyeweerd, see TM XIV and XX, for example. It is possible that
both Dooyeweerd's and Scheler's view of the non-objectifiability of the essential selfhood of
the person is the result of a residual Kantianism.<br>

Abstract: Other thinkers have also been instrumental in re-inteφreting philosophy as a way of re-

Paul Ricoeur, Charles Taylor and Alasdair Maclntyre - Spren Kierkegaard (1844, 1845, 1848)
with his analysis of human freedom as entangled in itself and liberated by the 'jump' into faith;
Heidegger (1927) with his analysis of anxiety as openness for the possibility of one's (own) im-
possibility; Levinas (1974) with his notion of the Other as a disquieting openness or wound in
my existence, Ricoeur (1990) with his four-fold analysis of the self as a relatedness to oneself
opened-up by the presence of the other, Taylor (1989) with his notion of disengaged reason
and of the intrinsic relation of persons to (their) 'goods', Maclntyre (1981) with his concept of
'goods' internai to practices.<br>

Abstract: A well-known example of this is one of the paradoxes of Zeno, who argued that Achilles
can never overtake the turtle if the latter is allowed to start out first. When Achilles has covered
the distance that the turtle had at point a the turtle has moved on, and when Achilles has
covered that distance as well, the turtle has moved up too, etc. The paradox dissolves as soon as
it is recognized that the spatial analysis (distances) is not enough to study the phenomenon of
speed. Speed is a kinematic category. When the spatial aspect is not related to time (as in the
kinematic aspect) speed difference is a phenomenon that cannot be grasped.<br>

Abstract: Sabemos cómo debemos comer pero no comemos como debemos. Esta paradoja del comensal actual es objeto de debate entre sociólogos, nutricionistas y responsables de salud. Las dificultades para afrontarla sugieren ensayar aproximaciones diferentes a las habituales. Pensar el comer desde los imaginarios colectivos que pueden entrar en colisión quizá arroje nueva luz sobre dicha paradoja. Aquí ensayamos ese acercamiento a partir de cuatro textos canónicos de la literatura utópica en los albores de la revolución industrial. Su análisis revela un conflicto de larga duración entre dos modos de imaginar la comida ideal: el de las utopías modernas e ilustradas, que comparten los expertos en nutrición, y el de las utopías populares, donde una cierta racionalidad social, basada en los hábitos y tradiciones culinarias, se opone a una alimentación racional. We know how we should eat but we don't eat as we should. This paradox of the modern eater has long been the subject of debate amongst sociologists, nutritionists and healthcare workers. The difficulties faced when dealing with this paradox suggest the need for new approaches. By considering food from the potentially conflictive social imageries, it may be possible to shed some light on this paradox. In this work, we have approached this issue from the perspective of four canonical texts of utopian literature that were created at the dawn of the industrial revolution. Our analysis reveals a long-lasting conflict between two views of the ideal diet: that of modern and enlightened utopias, which is shared by nutrition experts, and that of the "popular" utopias, in which social rationality, based on culinary habits and traditions, opposed a rational approach to eating.<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de François Laplanche prend délibérément pour objet la longue durée : l'exégèse biblique entretient un rapport constant au Texte originel et l'historien ne peut s'exonérer de connaître les interprétations patristiques et médiévales de la Bible. L'histoire d'une pratique de lecture savante est ici réintégrée à l'intérieur de l'ensemble de la culture, de la société et des événements d'une période donnée. Prenant pour centre d'analyse les théologiens calvinistes de Saumur vers 1620-1670, François Laplanche montre que, tandis que leur système demeure arrimé à l'orthodoxie réformée, ils la minent et conduisent à une désacralisation de l'Écriture par un double éloignement : éloignement de l'origine puisque la disqualification de l'Ancien Testament le transforme en objet d'histoire; éloignement de la fin des temps par la récusation catégorique du prophétisme et du millénarisme. The work of François Laplanche deliberately deals with long duration: biblical exegesis maintains a constant relationship to the original Text and the historian cannot exempt himself from knowing the patristic and medieval interpretations of the Bible. The history of scholarly reading is here reinstated within the culture, society and events of a given period. Taking as the center of his analysis the Calvinist theologians of Saumur around 1620-1670, François Laplanche shows that, while their system remains linked to reformed orthodoxy, they are undermining it and go towards a desecration of Scripture via a double remoteness: remoteness from the origin since the disqualification of the Old Testament transforms it into an historical object; remoteness from the end of time via the adamant disqualification of prophecy and millenarianism. La obra de François Laplanche toma deliberadamente como objeto la larga duración: la exégesis bíblica establece una relación constante con el Texto original y el historiador no puede eximirse de conocer las interpretaciones patrísticas y medievales de la Biblia.~<br>

Article Title: The Moral Rearmament Activist:<br>
Publisher: Murray Coombes Publishers<br>
Issue: e24805687<br>
Date: June 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Mason Garth<br>
Abstract: In this article I examine Philip Qipa (P.Q.) Vundla’s Moral Rearmament-inspired (MRA) politics with a view to explicating the previously hidden currents at work in his political activism. In my analysis, I draw on the theoretical frameworks of Paul Ricoeur and Homi Bhabha. In terms of these conceptual foundations, I investigate Vundla’s involvement in two foundational events in the history of the South African struggle, namely the school boycott of 1955 and the bus boycott of 1957. The official history of these two events, written by social historians such as Tom Lodge, interprets them as the dawn of mass opposition against apartheid. However, I contend that a closer analysis of these two events via biographical material reveals a more complex history, implicitly connected to the person of P.Q. Vundla and his politics of negotiation and finding common ground between opposing ideologies. Vundla stands out within this context because he was a nonconforming ANC leader, who disagreed with the way the party leadership approached political activism. His approach was driven by MRA values, which sought political solutions through dialogue and aimed to benefit all communities within South Africa. Vundla can be seen as an early forerunner of the bridge-building politics of Nelson Mandela. It is hoped that, by examining the role of MRA values in Vundla’s activism, a fuller, more complex account of politics in the 1950s can be arrived at.<br>

Publisher: Journal of Consumer Research<br>
Issue: i342750<br>
Date: 9 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Zaner Howard R.<br>
Abstract: Existential-phenomenology is presented as an alternative paradigm for conceptualizing and studying consumer experience. Basic theoretical tenets of existential-phenomenology are contrasted with more traditional assumptions and methods used in consumer research. The metaphors used by each paradigm to describe its world view are provided and their respective implications for consumer research discussed. One phenomenological research method is detailed, and examples of how the method is applied and the type of data it produces are provided. An epistemological analysis reveals that existential-phenomenology can provide an empirically based and methodologically rigorous understanding of consumer phenomena.<br>

Abstract: This article proposes literary criticism as a source of insight into consumer behavior, presents a broad overview of literary criticism, provides a specific illustrative analysis, and offers suggestions for further research. Literary analysis of advertising text reveals elements that provide additional information to consumer researchers, and contributions of literary criticism to consumer research are discussed. Major post-war critical schools are reviewed, and relevant theoretical concepts summarized. An ad for Ivory Flakes is analyzed using a variety of concepts drawn from literary schools, primarily sociocultural and reader-response ones. Suggestions for additional research on content analysis, image analysis, and the history of consumption are made.<br>

Article Title: Reading Post-Soviet (Trans)formations of Siberian Identity through Biographical Narrative<br>
Publisher: Slavica on behalf of the Institute of Russian Studies at the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies<br>
Issue: i24896621<br>
Date: 1 1, 2016<br>
Author(s): Echevskaia Olga<br>
Abstract: This article presents the results of empirical research regarding Siberian regional identity with a particular focus on regional identity formation and transformation. Based on biographical interviews with residents of three Siberian cities, it analyzes the processes of regional identity formation in a "resettlement" society and identity (re)construction under conditions of social crisis. In order to capture the individual dimension of such (trans)formation in a resettlement society the authors introduce and use a methodology combining the so-called "actionist" version of the social constructionist approach to identity studies and narrative analysis. The final section of this article offers a detailed analysis of the life stories of three Soviet-generation women, demonstrating different scenarios of regional identity transformation on the level of the individual. The results suggest that the effect of dramatic social change on personal identity depends upon the core identity of an individual. Those whose identity was rooted in the Soviet privileging of Siberian economic development face the hardest challenge. Those who have multiculturalism or such values as work or family at the core of their identities handle the crisis more easily, and the consequences of social transformation for their identities are less severe.<br>

Article Title: The Spoken and the Unspoken: A Hermeneutic Approach to Understanding the Cultural Viewpoints That Underlie Consumers' Expressed Meanings<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i342769<br>
Date: 12 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Winograd William B.<br>
Abstract: This article draws on the philosophical concept of the hermeneutical circle to explore the cultural viewpoints that underlie the meanings expressed by consumers. Phenomenological interviews were conducted with adult female consumers. The interviews are interpreted first by the identification of an exemplary image or event that we describe as a symbolic metaphor. We show that these symbolic metaphors highlight key personal meanings that each participant ascribed to her consumer experiences. We then use a hermeneutic logic known as intertextual analysis to show that these personal meanings reflect more general cultural viewpoints that are implicitly conveyed in language. These intertextual interpretations offer insights into the sociocultural meanings that underlie skeptical, nostalgic, and pragmatic consumer orientations. A concluding discussion is given to key implications and areas for future research that follow from this hermeneutic approach.<br>

Abstract: I am indebted to the insightful work of Emily Rosenberg and Frank Costigliola. See,
for example, Rosenberg, "Gendered Discourses in Dollar Diplomacy," and Costigliola, "The
Nuclear Family: Cold War Gendered Discourse in the Western Alliance," both papers deliv-
ered at the Annual Meeting of the Organization of American Historians, 1993. One might
argue that gendered analysis of international relations should do more, that is to explain why
women everywhere are treated unequally. See Sarah Brown, "Feminism, International
Theory, and International Relations of Gender Inequality," Millennium: Journal of International
Studies 17 (1988): 461-75. But Brown makes no effort to show that the structure of international
relations is, in fact, responsible for the situation she abhors.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342993<br>
Date: 5 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Sternberg Nancy<br>
Abstract: Hayden White's perhaps richest and most profoundly argued book, The Content of the Form, touches many nerves in the American historical profession. The entirety of the book, from its premises through its most thoughtful exegeses of historical writing, insists that linguistic form is the primary carrier of content in historical writing, indeed, in historical knowledge. This insistence on a respectful and careful attention to the formal usages of nonfiction prose, truth-claiming language, goes well against the grain of American tastes. As de Tocqueville presciently and correctly predicted, when Americans take to literature in a serious way, they won't have much patience with precise matters of form. Hayden White's narrative theory has had uphill work to penetrate this pervasive indifference, especially among historians. He has been joined in recent decades by Paul Ricoeur, whose Time and Narrative, beginning from different premises and a slightly different question, arrives at a sympathetic and complementary analysis of historical narrative. In spite of White's published hesitations about the political/philosophical tendencies of Ricoeur's work, I am convinced that their books are mutually supporting and, in an important cultural sense, belong together. Altogether, however, I do feel that the main import and justification of this present essay must rest on my quite serious reading of Hayden White's best joke, a profound shaggy dog story about the historian monk of St. Gall.<br>

Abstract: This article considers the legacies of Jacques Derrida in and for Anglo-American sociocultural anthropology. It begins with a survey of Derrida's own engagement with themes that have historically been foundational to the field: (a) the critique of sign theory and, with it, the questions of language and law in Lévi-Straussian structuralism; (b) the question of the unconscious; (c) the critique of the performative and its consequences for the idea of ritual; (d) the rereading of Marcel Mauss's concept of the gift, and of economy more generally; and (e) the analysis of the metaphysical basis of law, in both religious and ostensibly secular formations. It then considers the state of the field at the time when it was being infused with different forms of poststructuralism and explores the competing claims made by these discourses in relation to deconstruction. Finally, after tracing the convergences and divergences between Derridean deconstruction and theory in sociocultural anthropology, it treats two main examples of works produced against and under the influence of Derrida's thought, respectively.<br>

Author(s): Templeton Alice<br>
Abstract: What is the use of writing poems against war if they reenact rather than alter the binaries and brutalities of the war imagination they claim to protest? Why does so much contemporary war poetry only compound war's depleting effect instead of offering us energy for resistance? In The Life of Poetry (1949), Muriel Rukeyser defines poetry as a vital but underused national resource for a culture dominated by war. As a creative transfer of energy, poetry complicates and resists habits of imagination that sustain war. Using Rukeyser's analysis to contrast a representative poem from the volume Poets Against the War (2003) to several poems by Forche, Celan, James Wright, Blake, Yeats, Oppen, and Levertov, this paper discusses ways in which poetry about war and wartime can provide useful, life-giving energy without replicating the very violences it claims to oppose.<br>

Abstract: On September 11, 2001, the passengers and crew members aboard Flight 93 responded to the hijacking of their airplane by organizing a counterattack against the hijackers. The airplane crashed into an unpopulated field, causing no damage to human lives or national landmarks beyond the lives of those aboard the airplane. We draw on this story of courageous collective action to explore the question of what makes this kind of action possible. We propose that to take courageous collective action, people need three narratives-a personal narrative that helps them understand who they are beyond the immediate situation and manage the intense emotions that accompany duress, a narrative that explains the duress that has been imposed upon them sufficiently to make moral and practical judgments about how to act, and a narrative of collective action-and the resources that make the creation of these narratives feasible. We also consider how the creation of these narratives is relevant to courageous collective action in more common organizational circumstances, and identify how this analysis suggests new insights into our understanding of the core framing tasks of social movements, ways in which social movement actors draw on social infrastructure, the role of discourse and morality in social movements, the formation of collective identity, and resource mobilization.<br>

Abstract: Nous avons tenté de montrer que les recherches longtemps réunies sous le nom de biologie de l'art ont constitué les racines oubliées de la pensée anthropologique d'Aby Warburg. Connues par lui en 1895-1896, ces perspectives nourrissent encore en 1927, à la fin de sa vie, sa réflexion. À partir de l'analyse ethnographique de la représentation des noms propres dans le Sepik, nous avons ensuite montré que, pour tenter de déchiffrer l'utopie dont témoigne sa pensée - formuler une anthropologie de la mémoire sociale telle qu'elle se fonde sur les traditions iconographiques -, il est nécessaire de reprendre, d'un point de vue critique, la méthode morphologique de la biologie de l'art, et sa manière de reconstruire les opérations mentales impliquées par le déchiffrement des images. /// The studies that have, for a long time now, been assembled under the name " Biology of Art " form the forgotten roots of Aby Warburg's approach to anthropology. He learned about them in 1895-1896, and the thus opened perspectives were still enriching his thinking at the end of his life in 1927. An analysis of conceptions about proper names in the Sepik area is used to show that, to decipher the utopia in Warburg's thinking - formulate an anthropology of social memory in relation to iconographic traditions - it is necessary to critically examine the morphological method of the biology of art and its way of reconstructing the mental operations involved in deciphering images.<br>

Author(s): Martin Denis-Constant<br>
Abstract: De nombreux textes, à commencer par l'étude de Max Weber, ont déjà défriché le champ d'une sociologie de la musique et précisé à quels objets elle pouvait s'intéresser et comment elle pouvait les aborder. Le domaine, et l'appellation même, des musiques " populaires " demeurent toutefois problématiques. L'enseignement tiré de travaux des historiens de la culture conduit à les envisager comme " musiques de masse ". Pour les étudier, la sociologie peut les considérer comme un " fait sociomusical total " et y rechercher des représentations sociales, à la fois déchiffrement de la société par ses membres et moyens d'action sur elle. Une analyse tripartite modifiée, s'inspirant de la méthode proposée par Jean Molino et Jean-Jacques Nattiez et tenant compte des leçons de l'ethnomusicologie, peut fournir un cadre d'analyse général à partir duquel un très grand nombre de domaines s'ouvrent à l'exploration du chercheur qui y découvrira des mélanges infinis et, refusant de juger esthétiquement, s'attachera plutôt à expliquer le jugement esthétique des acteurs de ce " phénomène social total ". /// Several writings, starting with Max Weber's, have done pioneering work in the sociology of music. They have formulated the subjects to be studied and suggested how they can be approached. Many problems, however, remain. The lessons drawn from studies by cultural historians lead us to see it as " mass music ", which sociology can take to be a " total sociomusical fact ". The search can then be undertaken for the underlying " social representations ", which are both an interpretation of society by its members and a means of action on society. Modeled on the method proposed by Jean Molino and Jean-Jacques Nattiez, a modified threefold analysis taking into account the teachings of ethnomusicology, can help devise a general analytical framework that opens a large number of fields where sociologists will discover infinite mixtures. Refusing to make aesthetic judgements, they will seek to exp~<br>

Abstract: En s'appuyant sur un commentaire du texte de la première nuit du Kitāb al-Imtāʿ wa-l-muʾānasa d'Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī, cet article se propose de montrer la place primordiale qu'occupe la parole conversante (al-muḥādaṯa) dans la pensée arabe classique. La conversation, ḥadīṯ, constitue bien dans la culture arabe à la fois un paradigme épistémique dominant et un cadre généralisé d'expériences esthético-éthiques: la parole conversante fonctionne à la fois comme facteur de construction des contextes d'interaction au sein desquels se tissent les réseaux de sociabilité et d'échanges intellectuels fécondants (muqābasa), comme action cathartique qui libère l'âme et purifie l'esprit, comme facteur de sublimation et d'émancipation de la personne (ʿitq). Ainsi, l'analyse de toutes ces formes de manifestation de la parole conversante dans la champ de l'adab nous a permis d'aboutir à deux conclusions complémentaires: premièrement, selon la conception de la culture propre à la vision anthropologique inhérente au système de l'adab, la culture ne se transmet pas héréditairement, mais par fréquentation, interaction et contact entre personnes contemporaines. Deuxièmement, l'adīb véritable, tel que nous en avons un exemple vivant dans la figure d'al-Tawḥīdī, est celui qui se montre capable de créer et prendre en charge les occasions de sociabilité et d'échanges permettant aux individus d'une même époque de s'insérer dans le tissu de la contemporanéité concrète et de s'influencer et se cultiver les uns les autres. /// Based on a commentary of the first night in Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī's Kitāb al-Imtāʿ wa-l-muʾānasa, the purpose of this article is to show the essential place held by conversing speech (al-muḥādaṯa) in classical Arabic thought. In Arabic culture, conversation (ḥadīṯ) represents indeed both a dominant and epistemic paradigm and a generalized ethical-aesthetic frame of experiences: i. e. conversing speech works at the same time as a building factor of interacting contexts in ~<br>

Abstract: La réflexion offerte dans cet essai s'inscrit dans une entreprise d'approfondissement de la compréhension générale que nous avons de l'activité politique (parler, écrire, revendiquer, mettre en scène), et particulièrement de la relation que cette activité entretient avec l'idée de l'émancipation. Plus précisément, il s'agit de prendre pour objet d'exploration théorique le fait de parole, défini en termes d'articulation performative des espaces-temps humains, et d'en faire le paradigme de toute action politique. L'analyse de ce paradigme, au terme, permettra de pointer vers une matière utopique qui se qualifie à la fois comme événement et comme permanence du commun. /// In this article, the author seeks a better understanding of the modalities of political action (speaking, writing, claming, staging), and more specifically of the relation between political action and the idea of emancipation. To do so, the author proposes that the speech act, comprehended as the performed articulation of lived space/time, is to be taken as the paradigm of political action. Further analysis of this paradigm, as developed in the article, compels the manifestation of a philosophical object which qualifies both as event and as the manifestation of the perennially of the common.<br>

Abstract: In this semiotic analysis of the Spanish auto defe, we begin to understand for the first time the meaning of religious rituals that have appeared completely incomprehensible in traditional accounts. The morning processions of penitents through city streets, the formal denunciations of heretics on public scaffolds, and the final burning at the stake of unrepentant sinners are placed within the context of medieval penitential practices and eschatological beliefs. The ceremony of the auto defe unveiled in time the Judgment Day awaiting all humankind at the end of time. For this reason, the spectacle aroused the interest of spectators all over Christendom, filling them with apprehension of their own final judgment.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i25478832<br>
Date: 5 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Kansteiner Wulf<br>
Abstract: This essay provides a close reading of Saul Friedländer's exceptionally successful comprehensive history of the Holocaust from the theoretical perspective of Hayden White's philosophy of history. Friedländer's The Years of Extermination has been celebrated as the first synthetic history of the "Final Solution" that acknowledges the experiences of the victims of Nazi genocide. But Friedländer has not simply added the voices of the victims to a conventional historical account of the Holocaust. Instead, by displacing linear notions of time and space and subtly deconstructing conventional concepts of causality, he has invented a new type of historical prose that performs rather than analyzes the victims' point of view. Friedländer's innovation has particularly radical consequences for the construction of historical explanations. On the one hand, Friedländer explicitly argues that anti-Semitism was the single most important cause of the Holocaust. On the other hand, his transnational, multifaceted history of the "Final Solution" provides a wealth of data that escapes the conceptual grasp of his explicit model of causation. Friedländer chooses this radically self-reflexive strategy of historical representation to impress on the reader the existential sense of disbelief with which the victims experienced Nazi persecution. To Friedländer, that sense of disbelief constitutes the most appropriate ethical response to the Holocaust. Thus the narratological analysis of The Years of Extermination reveals that the exceptional quality of the book, as well as presumably its success, is the result of an extraordinarily creative act of narrative imagination. Or, put into terms developed by White, who shares Friedländer's appreciation of modernist forms of writing, The Years of Extermination is the first modernist history of the Holocaust that captures, through literary figuration, an important and long neglected reality of the "Final Solution."<br>

Abstract: Amid the debates over the meaning and usefulness of the word "culture" during the 1980s and 1990s, practice theory emerged as a framework for analysis and criticism in cultural anthropology. Although theorists have gradually begun to explore practice-oriented frameworks as promising vistas in cultural anthropology and the study of religion, these remain relatively recent developments that stand to be historically explicated and conceptually refined. This article assesses several ways that practice theory has been articulated by some of its chief expositors and critics, and places these developments in conversation with comparable accounts of "social practices" by recent pragmatist philosophers. My aim in generating such a conversation is to illuminate the ways that Ludwig Wittgenstein's later work provides important resources for cultural analysis that are already implicit in practice theory, yet either frequently overlooked or dismissed by practice theorists. I demonstrate how a Wittgensteinian understanding of practice theory coheres with, and illuminates, Clifford Geertz's account of meaning, thick description, and religious practices. Reading Geertz as a practice theorist, I argue, helps alleviate the apparent opposition between assessing meaning and analyzing power in the study of religious practices and institutions, and unsettles dichotomous accounts of belief and intentional action.<br>

Abstract: This paper argues against the all too common dichotomy of globalization into a process of homogenization or a process of significant diversification. The paper seeks to bridge this dichotomy by arguing for the relative autonomy of culture with respect to global political-economy, for the plurality of voices that constitute ongoing social interaction, and for a vision of actors operating in fields of power that position human agents differentially. The essay makes use of world systems theory to illustrate the merits and problems of global analysis while focussing on the ethnographic examples of French and Michigan wine growers. /// L'article s'inscrit en faux contre la vision dichotomique et récurrente de la mondialisation selon laquelle il s'agit soit d'un processus d'homogénéisation, soit d'un profond processus de diversification. L'article cherche à surmonter cette dichotomie en soutenant l'existence d'une autonomie relative des cultures face à l'économie politique mondiale, d'une pluralité des voix qui constituent les interactions sociales en cours et d'une vision qui situe les acteurs au sein de cercles de pouvoir qui leur imposent des positions différentielles. L'essai se sert de la théorie des systèmes-monde pour illustrer le bien-fondé et les défauts des analyses de niveau mondial. Il met l'accent sur des exemples ethnographiques de viticulteurs de la France et du Michigan.<br>

Abstract: What would policy analysis look like if we were to begin with the assumptions of multivocality and incommensurability, rather than discover them in the midst of analytic research? Much interpretive policy analysis begins and ends by arguing on philosophical grounds with the positivist presuppositions of the field. Reflecting on the organizational and other "realities" of multiple meanings that emerged during my own field work, I raise some of the theoretical and conceptual issues that interpretive analyses engage, concluding that such analysis would have to be conducted under the demands of "passionate humility."<br>

Abstract: In Science, great difficulty is sometimes experienced in giving up hypothesized structures. The inadequacies of Freudian hypotheses are highlighted, and attention is directed to Dasein-analysis, which stays close to the data. This perspective focuses attention upon the phenomenological tradition, and suggests that certain mathematical frameworks in human geography are inappropriate. The adequacy of a priori models is also questioned from a Heideggerian perspective, and more general qualitative algebras are suggested to replace the distorted functional thinking inherited from the physical sciences.<br>

Abstract: El artículo analiza las condiciones de validez del testimonio en ciencias sociales. Sus potencialidades centrales son el constituir un campo de exploración e investigación de acercamiento a la subjetividad, especialmente a la de los sectores populares. Ello ha permitido incorporar sus discursos y representaciones en las ciencias sociales. Sin embargo, dicha incorporación se ha realizado bajo una perspectiva empirista, según la cual el testimonio es una representación inmediata, directa de los sujetos, lo que oculta la mediación del testimonio a través del cientista social, particularmente mediante la entrevista. Por ende, la idea del testimonio como una "voz de los sin voz" oculta el diálogo entre investigador-sujetos, que podría ser potenciado en un tipo de investigación hermeneútica en la que el investigador ya no ostentaría el monopolio de la interpretación. This article analises the validity conditions of "testimony" as a methodological tool in the social sciences. The principal advantage of testimony is that it enables the construction of research and analysis of subjectivity, particularly with popular sectors. This has facilitated the incorporation of their discourses and representations into the social sciences. Notwithstanding, this incorporation has occurred within a highly empiricist perspective, whereby testimony is an immediate representation of the individual. The mediation of the social scientist, which is particularly significant in interviews, remains hidden. The concept of testimony, therefore, as the "voice of the voiceless" disguises the dialogue between the researcher and the individual. This dialogue could be further developed as an instrument of hermeneutical research, whereby the researcher no longer monopolises interpretations.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo es un análisis de la novela Una casa vacía (1996) del escritor chileno Carlos Cerda, basado en la identificación de elementos de imaginería gótica en distintos niveles de la obra. Se estudia el funcionamiento de estos elementos dentro del macro esencialmente realista de la obra, para intentar establecer los límites cruzados entre el testimonio, la historia oficial y sus metaforizaciones. La alegoría final que la obra novelesca construye en relación con la antigua casa de tortura y sus habitantes, se corresponde con el período final de la Dictadura Militar (1973-1989) y las prácticas de tortura realizadas por organismos de gobierno contra civiles. Sin embargo, también se trata de mostrar la dificultad del realismo testimonial para escribir una novela sobre la degradación y el sufrimiento de la sociedad chilena del período, sin caer en una ideología maniquea de la narración. This article is an analysis of Una casa vacía (1996), a novel written by the Chilean author Carlos Cerda. This analysis is based upon the identification of elements of the Gothic imaginery at different levels of this narrative. The functioning of these elements is studied within the basically realistic frame of the novel, in order to establish the permeable boundaries between testimonial narrative, the official history and its metaphorizations. The ultimate allegory that the novel builds around a former torture house and its inhabitants finds its correspondence with the final period of the Military Dictatorship (1973-1989) and the torture practices carried by Government Organizations against civilians. Nevertheless, this article tries to show the difficulty of testimonial realism in order to write a novel about the suffering and decadence of the Chilean society of the period, without succumbing to a Manichean concept of the narrative function.<br>

Article Title: Responsibility and nanotechnology<br>
Publisher: Sage Publications<br>
Issue: i25677409<br>
Date: 6 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Kelty Christopher<br>
Abstract: In this paper we argue that the concept and practice of responsibility is being transformed within science and engineering. It tells the story of attempts by nanotechnologists to make responsibility 'do-able' and calculable in a setting where the established language and tools of risk and risk analysis are seen as inadequate. The research is based on ethnographic participant-observation at the National Science Foundation-funded Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology (CBEN) at Rice University in Texas, during the period 2003 to 2007, including the controversies and public discussions it was engaged in and the creation of the International Council on Nanotechnology (ICON). CBEN began as a project to study 'applications' of nanotechnology to environmental and biological systems, but turned immediately to the study of 'implications' to biology and environment. We argue here that the notion of 'implications' and the language of risk employed early on addressed two separate but entangled ideas: the risks that nanomaterials pose to biology and environment, and the risks that research on this area poses to the health of nanotechnology itself. Practitioners at CBEN sought ways to accept responsibility both as scientists with a duty to protect science (from the public, from de-funding, from 'backlash') and as citizens with a responsibility to protect the environment and biology through scientific research. Ultimately, the language of risk has failed, and in its place ideas about responsibility, prudence, and accountability for the future have emerged, along with new questions about the proper venues and 'modes of veridiction' by which claims about safety or responsibility might be scientifically adjudicated.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo ofrece aportes para un balance de uno de los más ambiciosos y debatidos proyectos de antropología aplicada en América Latina, el Proyecto Perú-Cornell, que se desarrolló en la Comunidad de Vicos, en los Andes peruanos, entre 1952 y 1966. Lo más valioso de estos aportes es que son fruto del trabajo con los propios pobladores de Vicos, que durante un año se embarcaron en un intenso proceso reflexión y diálogo intergeneracional en el marco de una investigación participativa enfocada en las memorias locales del pasado comunal, y las implicancias de ese pasado para el presente y futuro de Vicos. Además de presentar a la Comunidad de Vicos, los antecedentes del Proyecto Perú-Cornell y el marco teórico y metodológico del proyecto de investigación participativa, este artículo ofrece una selección de testimonios de los pobladores de Vicos así como algunas reflexiones a modo de conclusión. Particularmente, destaca el potencial de los procesos colectivos de reflexión sobre el pasado como mecanismos de consolidación de la identidad y subraya la importancia de incluir a los actores locales en la reflexión y análisis de su pasado, no como «datos» o testimonios aislados, sino como productores de sentidos sobre ese pasado. This essay offers contributions for evaluating one of the most ambitious and debated projects of applied antropology in Latin America, the Project Perú-Cornell, that was developed at Vicos community, in the Peruvian Andes, between 1952 and 1966. What is most valuable of these contributions is that they are a fruit of work with Vicos' dwellers, who were embarked during a year on an intense process of reflection and dialogue between generations in the frame of a participative research focused on local memories of communal past, and its implications for Vicos present and future. Besides presenting Vicos community, the background of the Peru-Cornell Project and the theoretical and methodological frame of the participative research project, this essay of~<br>

Article Title: Qur'an and Science: A Hermeneutical Approach / ‮القرآن والعلم: منهج تفسيري‬<br>

Abstract: The aim of the present article is to investigate how the passages of the Holy Text regarding natural sciences or the cosmological order of the universe can be read from a hermeneutical viewpoint, in a philosophical rather than a historical, grammatical or stylistic sense; the debated problems of literary and artistic character, and the relationship between Qur'an and science per se, are not involved here. If we assume as a working hypothesis the Gadamerian perspective that 'being, as far as we can understand it, is language', we can accept that the being of God and of the universe are disclosed in Qur'anic language and that the Qur'an becomes the framework of the aletheia (in the Heideggerian sense) of science. This paper utilises the above-mentioned epistemological and hermeneutical key in order to make a first attempt to explore the possibility of a philosophical analysis of the question of science in the Qur'an, and concludes that, although it can sound highly paradoxical, the attitudes of total agreement, partial agreement or no agreement between Qur'an and science are not mutually exclusive, but rather work in parallel at different linguistic levels. ‮الهدف من هذه الدراسة هو بحث کيف يمکن فهم الآيات القرآنية المتعلقة بالعلوم الطبيعية أو النظام الکوني من وجهة نظر منهج تفسيري من ناحية فلسفية لا تاريخية أو نحوية أو بلاغية. لن يتم هنا مناقشة قضايا أدبية أو فنية أو العلاقة بين القرآن والعلم في هذا البحث. إذا افترضنا أن وجهة نظر جادامير (remadaG)، ‮ وهي أن " الوجود، کما نفهمه، هو اللغة "، تعتبر نظرية قابلة للتطبيق، يمکن أن نقبل أن وجود الله والکون يبين من خلال اللغة القرآنية وأن القرآن يصبح إطار الوصول للحقيقة، طبقاً لفهم هيدجر (reggedieH). ‮إن هذا البحث يستخدم علم الحد والمنهج التفسيري من أجل القيام بأول محاولة لاستکشاف إمکانية تحليل فلسفي لقضية العلم في القرآن. وقد انتهى هذا البحث إلى أن التوافق بين القرآن والعلم تاما أو جزئيا أوعدم التوافق لا يعتبر أمرا قاطعا من الجهتين لکنه يعمل على درجات لغوية مختلفة متوازنة.‬<br>

Abstract: This article reflects on the question of the disappearance of the individual subject of experience in Beckett's writing, and its gradual replacement by an anonymous subject. After The Unnamable, the voice becomes increasingly ambiguous or plural. It can no longer be ascribed to any distinct individual. In the light of Paul Ricœur's analysis of narrative identity, I intend to show how Beckett's work gradually goes, through the notion of alterity, beyond the problematic of subjectivity. By suspending the question who, the Beckettian text appears to be more and more organized by a missing presence, and moves toward a gradual reinforcement of the notion of past.<br>

Article Title: Die Entwicklung zum Postmodernismus in der Sozialwissenschaft<br>
Publisher: Dietrich Reimer Verlag<br>
Issue: i25842884<br>
Date: 1 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Scheuch Erwin K.<br>
Abstract: First of all an overview is presented of the development in the social sciences that led to postmodernism. The starting point for this is the modernity that was under the influence of Parsons after the second World War. It extended to the Third World mainly in the context of development research. Since the end of the 1970s the contributions of two German scientists, Niklas Luhmann and Jürgen Habermas, have received international recognition. During this time the first critical voices concerning the modernist theories were heard. Among ideas opposing these theories the approaches should be named first, which the author calls "post industrial". To these he counts primarily the analysis of the modern socio-economic system by Daniel Bell and the studies of the "post-material personality" by Ronald Inglehart. Research on the change of values in modern societies should be named in the same context. However, "post-industrial" should not be confused with "post-modern". The origin of the latter term from the "culture scene" is explained. The language of the post-modernists can be viewed as their characteristic, as well as the attempts of deconstruction imprinted by Derrida. Ever since Lyotard the strong bond between the name and the named object within the language has been questioned. Therefore, Jean Baudrillard is correct in noting a loss in the sense of orientation of the modern human being. For example, the works of two post-modernists, Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck, are discussed in detail, after which the author concludes: "That is the most important meaning of postmodernity: as a symbol for the weakened autonomy of the sciences and arts, as a lack for the support of sciences in culture and politics". Nevertheless one can observe a return to rationality in recent years.<br>

Abstract: Critical theory is presented as a general method for analyzing an organization science based on either a natural science or interpretive paradigm. This is accomplished by introducing epistemic inquiry into organization science methodology. Specifically, critical theory provides a means of examining the socio-political interplay among the researcher, the research enterprise, the practitioner, and the organization members. Such an analysis requires the examination of ideology, technology, and praxis.<br>

Publisher: Butterworth-Heinemann<br>
Issue: i324426<br>
Date: 3 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Banerjee Sanjoy<br>
Abstract: How does international interaction shape states' patterns of thought, emotion, and action? This paper examines the processes by which motives and practices feed each other in reproducing historical structures. An artificial intelligence model defines state-subjects as cultures combining special meanings that produce causal attribution, state self-identification, emotions, and action motives. These special meanings are built from subjective cultural categories describing social acts and group character of the self and others. Anger, pride, fear, and relief motivate action. A collection of such subject-cultures may produce a pattern of actions that reiterates the cultures. The model discriminates between those combinations of elements in special meanings which reproduce subjects and historical structures, and those which do not. The meanings discovered in such reproduction analysis can be validated by discourse analysis.<br>

Author(s): Kiser Edgar<br>
Abstract: This paper examines the linkages among the ideological, political, and economic dimensions of the world-system by looking at changes in the publication of two types of utopian novels in the United States. We argue that positive and negative visions of the future (eutopian and dystopian literature, respectively) can be treated as aspects of the ideological dimension of the world-system. As part of such an interrelated system, the volume of utopias should change in response to periods of crisis and stability in the political, economic, and cultural dimensions of the system. A time-series analysis indicates that both types of utopian literature are affected by changing conditions of the world-system. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that the world-system perspective represents a promising approach for the study of ideological change.<br>

Publisher: Butterworth Scientific<br>
Issue: i324410<br>
Date: 3 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Walker R. B. J.<br>
Abstract: Much recent commentary on the theory of international politics has focused on the analysis of change and the continuing vitality of political realism. This paper argues that the philosophical dilemmas posed by the concern with change and by the claim to political realism are intimately related. The argument is pursued in the context of contrasting traditions of political realism, of the antithesis between structuralism and historicism in contemporary social and political theory, and of recent tendencies and controversies in the literature on neorealist theories of international politics. The paper concludes that political realism ought to be understood less as a coherent theoretical position in its own right than as the site of a great many interesting claims and metaphysical disputes. As there is no single tradition of political realism, but rather a knot of historically constituted tensions and contradictions, these tensions and contradictions might be reconstituted in a more critical and creative manner. This involves an examination of the way the core categories of international political theory depend upon a particular formulation of the relationship between identity and difference-a formulation which must be refused.<br>

Abstract: Twelve years after the genocide, nothing has been forgotten in Rwanda. The country resembles a multiplicity of experiences, words and silences. The aim of the article is to reflect on the representations – or absence of representations – of the past. The approach is based on the ambivalence of any reference to the past. It is not a question of making a judgement in the abstract about the more or less legitimate character of the attitudes observed, but to understand the dynamics at work. The analysis is divided into three parts. The first part recalls the specific aspects of the case under study. The second examines the silences that weigh upon Rwandan society. The third notes the main accounts of the past.<br>

Abstract: This paper deals with the manner of negotiating the relation to its colonial past of France in the Maghreb, concentrating on a key episode in the national historical account, the battle held to have taken place at Poitiers in 732. The creation, near Châtellerault, of a memorial site for that battle, and the annual commemoration which takes place there, constitute the substance of this paper, unfolding in three phases: firstly, an archeology of the genesis of the “Site of 732” situated in the context of the years from 1960 to 1970; secondly, an analysis of the contents of the site as seen through the typology of the discourses constructing the museum project; finally, clearly setting out the social issues involved in memorialisation, through observation and using the survey carried out on visitors to the site.<br>

Abstract: L'article est une «archéologie intellectuelle» du cours «Honneur et Patrie» de Lucien Febvre, professé au Collège de France en 1945-1946. Une analyse de la démarche méthodique de Febvre, ainsi qu'une amorce d'étude de sa conception volontariste et «anti-autoritaire» de l'histoire, mettent à nu l'attitude fondamentalement anti-Vichyste et antinazi de l'historien. Dans cette perspective, est réexaminé le conflit de Febvre avec Marc Bloch à propos de la continuation des Annales en 1941. The article is an «intellectual archeology» of a course entitled «Honour and Country» given by Lucien Febvre at the Collège de France in 1945-1956. An analysis of Febvre's methodical approach as well as an initial study of his volontarist, «anti-authoritarian» conception of history, reveals his fundamentally anti-Vichyist and anti-Nazi attitude. The conflict between Febvre and Marc Bloch concerning the continuation of the Annales in 1941 is re-examined from this perspective.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur porte un regard critique sur la construction d'un objet historique qui, pour retracer l'histoire des pratiques de lecture sur le long terme (des années trente à nos jours) et cerner les processus d'appropriation des textes lus en milieu ouvrier, a nécessité le recours à une démarche d'investigation en histoire orale. Il aborde donc les grandes questions méthodologiques puis précise quelques résultats de l'analyse des discours en insistant sur leur apport fructueux pour l'histoire socioculturelle. The author takes a critical look at the construction of an historical object which, in order to relate the history of reading practices over the long term (from the 1930s to today) and bring to the fore the appropriation process of texts read in a working class milieu, meant undertaking an investigation involving oral history. It discusses the main methodological questions and then indicates some results of the analysis of the discourse, while insisting on their fruitful contribution to socio-cultural history.<br>

Abstract: According to Philip Rieff, Freud affirms the distance of the individual from the com-
munity, and in this sense psychoanalysis agrees with liberalism. The Freudian individual is
aloof from politics and learns not to seek radical changes in society, avers Rieff. That individ-
ual adapts to society in a calculated way which suits his or her needs: 'a rationally alienated
person learns how to guard against social over-investments, and how to make them when
necessary' (Philip Rieff, Freud: The Mind of a Moralist (Garden City, NY, 1961), p. 278).
Freud, then, teaches that the individual's attachment to society should be dependent on a
rational, economic exercise—on the conscious distribution of instinctual energy. Moreover,
once psychoanalytic therapy becomes a way of life, it contributes to detachment from others
by enhancing self-absorption. 'While enjoining a person to be less severe with himself,
observes Rieff, 'Freudian analysis may also develop in the patient new qualities of self-
suspicion... The therapy manufactures a new sort of conscience, one which demands a more
accurate and yet more scrupulous self-centeredness' (ibid., pp. 106-7).<br>

Publisher: Leo S. Olschki<br>
Issue: e26230922<br>
Date: 8 1, 2008<br>
Abstract: In 2008, as a follow-up to the initiative taken the previous year, ISRE – Istituto Superiore Regionale Etnografico
         [Superior Regional Ethnographic Institute]organized the seminarGramsci ritrovato, tra Cirese e i Cultural Studies(Nuoro, October 24th- 25th, 2008)[Gramsci rediscovered: between Cirese and the Cultural Studies]. The seminar focused on another ‘find’: the readings of Gramsci’s works on folklore that Cirese had elaborated thirty-eight years before. The idea came from Giorgio Baratta, who – in hisGramsci in contrappunto [Gramsci in counterpoint](Carocci 2008) – has given special attention to an analysis of Cirese’s essayConcezioni del mondo, filosofia spontanea e istinto di classe nelle “Osservazioni sul folklore” di Antonio Gramsci [World Views, Spontaneous Philosophy and Class Instinct in the “Observations On Folklore” by Antonio Gramsci](1970). Giulio Angioni’s and Pietro Clemente’s contributions – coming, in part, from an intellectual autobiography standpoint (they both have been Cirese’s students at first, and his colleagues later) – helped elucidate the method and the contents of Cirese’s work. They also dealt with Gramsci, in order to theoretically reconstruct the foundations of Italian folklore studies between the Sixties and the Seventies of XX Century. Baratta’s renewed reading, a part of which we here republish, together with Brigitte Wagner’s contribution (dedicated to the issue of the feasibility of translations of languages and cultures), give evidence to the prospect of a vitality of Cirese’s critical work outside the usual context of Italian folklore studies. Prospect and vitality that have been demonstrated by Cirese himself, who, during the 2008 seminar in Nuoro, was a protagonist of the dialogue with other scholars as well as with the public that intervened in the debate. He was a generous testimony of the large spectrum of his interests, mostly methodological, and he very carefully underlined, with respect to Gramsci, two aspect~<br>

Publisher: Leo S. Olschki<br>
Issue: e26233631<br>

Author(s): Riccardo Gaetano<br>
Abstract: This paper aims to stress the anthropological relevance of
         La vendetta barbaricina come ordinamento giuridico(1959), the most famous Antonio Pigliaru’s book, by showing some methodological affinities with Mauss’sEssai sur le don. The author maintains that, exactly as it was affirmed by Alain Caillé in this latter case, it is possible to single out a sort of “third paradigm” operating in Pigliaru’s analysis ofvendettain traditional Sardinia. To emphasize this feature of Pigliaru’s book also allows us to throw a fresh look at the lasting but often unprofitable debate concerning the most appropriate label – Law or Anthropology – for defining the subject of his most important work.<br>

Author(s): White Joanne<br>
Abstract: This paper begins with a story told by a corporation president to illustrate what his organization was doing to "help" women employees balance the demands of work and home. The paper deconstructs and reconstructs this story text from a feminist perspective, examining what it says, what it does not say, and what it might have said. This analysis reveals how organizational efforts to "help women" have suppressed gender conflict and reified false dichotomies between public and private realms of endeavor, suggesting why it has proven so difficult to eradicate gender discrimination in organizations. Implications of a feminist perspective for organizational theory are discussed.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i325622<br>
Date: 6 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Zeitlyn David<br>
Abstract: Some systems of divination are used to select particular sections of text, which are typically arcane and erudite, in which lies the answer to the particular, pressing problems of the client. Celebrated examples of such systems are the Chinese I Ching and the Yoruba Ifa. Werbner's work on Kalanga and Tswapong divination provides a case-study of the detailed praxis in such systems. Diviners have a multiple role when a divination technique selects a text. At each consultation they must satisfy themselves, their client, and their audience that they have followed the correct procedures to select the text. A second stage follows. The client has a particular question and the selected text was not composed as a specific answer to it. Interpretation is required to satisfy the client that the question has been answered. The diviner thus plays the role of indigenous critic, a role both similar to and different from that of literary critics in the Western tradition. The concept of `dialogic' used by Barber in her analysis of Yoruba praise poetry is taken to illustrate similarities and differences between diviner and critic.<br>

Date: 10 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Hall Anne<br>
Abstract: The problem of how to access and deploy the explanatory power of culture in historical accounts has long remained vexing. A recent approach, combining and transcending the "culture as structure"/ "culture as practice" divide among social historians, puts explanatory focus on the recursivity of meaning, agency, and structure in historical transformation. This article argues that meaning construction is at the nexus of culture, social structure, and social action, and must be the explicit target of investigation into the cultural dimension of historical explanation. Through an empirical analysis of political alliance during the Irish Land War, 1879-1882, I demonstrate that historians can uncover meaning construction by analyzing the symbolic structures and practices of narrative discourse.<br>

Issue: i345907<br>
Date: 2 1, 1969<br>
Author(s): Althusser Nicole<br>
Abstract: This article, written by a Russian cultural historian, analyzes the concept of "ideology" in the work of Clifford Geertz and his role in understanding the figurative nature of ideology as a cultural system. The author compares Geertz's semiotic approach to culture with the semiotics of culture developed by Russian theorists, particularly Yuri Lotman, showing the convergence and divergence of the two different national traditions. This understanding of the nature and functions of ideology opens new possibilities for discussing the tortured relations of ideology and literature, showing the way fiction can affect the formation of ideological systems and influence practical politics. The analysis is illustrated by examples from Russian political life of the 1990s, when revolutionary changes demanded new sets of ideological metaphors that in their turn shaped the direction of events.<br>

Abstract: The structural analysis of myth is a prime focus of anthropological interest, largely because of the efforts of Levi-Strauss. This paper uses some Levi-Straussian ideas to develop a strategy for myth analysis that I call the non-sense-in-myth strategy (NIMS). The strategy is given a trial run on a well-known and (I believe) much-misunderstood myth: Adam and Eve in Eden. The structure identified has an evolutionary character consistent with many modern understandings concerning the nature of human reality. NIMS, a mediator between Levi-Straussian intellectual leaps and a real methodology, indicates the value of cautious optimism concerning the question "Can structural analysis of myth become a scientific endeavor?"<br>

Author(s): Watson-Gegeo Karen Ann<br>
Abstract: Two traditions have been vying for supremacy in the area of cultural analysis. The first sees culture as encompassing the totality of socially learned human phenomena; the second restricts the term to shared mental-primarily cognitive-properties. David Schneider has achieved a dominant positon in the latter school. In this paper I examine critically Schneider's approach to culture, with special attention to the problems raised by his perspective with respect to intracultural consistency and contradiction. While agreeing that the ethnographer must attempt to shun prior assumptions as to the nature of symbolic and conceptual domains recognized by the people under study, that it is incumbent on the anthropologist to comprehend reality from the natives' point of view before attempting to formulate laws or generalizations, that the symbolic systems and their associated meanings plays an essential part in making sense of any human action system, I shall argue that cultures do not exhibit the degree of integration, consistency, and articulation assumed by Schneider, that in his attempt to render culture wholly integrated and consisten he strips the concept of its analytic utility, that social action and symbolic systems are empirically and epistemologically more closely intertwined than he would lead us to believe, and that the very debate over what culture "really" is constitutes an exercise in reification.<br>

Author(s): Ulin Robert C.<br>
Abstract: The argument of Evans-Pritchard's classic The Nuer has been subject to conflicting interpretations. We examine these interpretations and then present a reading of the work that treats it as a whole. A key conclusion is that Evans-Pritchard distinguishes among three aspects of the "systems" he describes: (1) logical possibilities immanent in all forms of action, (2) cultural or local idioms in terms of which action is formulated and expressed, and (3) conditions and patterns of action. With this framework he develops, through an examination of the way interests in cattle are translated into political practices, an analysis in which the central theoretical problem is the relationship of structure to human agency. Our reading raises questions about the utility of standard classifications of theoretical orientations in social and cultural anthropology, particularly of the category of structural-functionalism, of which The Nuer is taken to be a central text.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i27504370<br>
Date: 11 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Wils Jean-Pierre<br>
Abstract: Over the last few decades there has been a revival of interest in virtue ethics, with the emphasis on the virtuous caregiver. This paper deals with the 'virtuous patient', specifically the patient with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). We believe that a virtue approach provides insights not available to current methods of studying coping styles and coping strategies. Data are derived from seven semi-structured in-depth interviews. The transcripts of the interviews were subjected to an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The focus of the analysis was on 'living well with chronic illness'. It appears that the moral challenges faced by patients with an ESRD are manifold. When they are invited to tell the story of their illness, they do not explicitly speak of virtues, but they often refer to moral qualities, and to attitudes that can be regarded as virtuous. We identify several such concepts in the narratives of patients with ESRD. We conclude that the Aristotelian model of virtue ethics is particularly descriptively (and possibly also normatively) relevant to the explanation of the life narratives and the moral challenges of patients with an ESRD.<br>

Abstract: The conflict between President John F. Kennedy and the management of the steel industry in April, 1962 has been interpreted in an unsatisfactory manner. Many of Kennedy's reactions appear to be inexplicable and do not conform with the impression of him either as an "idealist without illusions" or the calculating cynic of recent revisionist writing. This paper is an attempt to provide another understanding of Kennedy's behaviour. We argue that Kennedy was neither hero nor villain, but a practising politician aware of the obligations and function of his profession in a liberal democratic polity. We suggest that Kennedy was aware of the sensibilities of his constituency and that he possessed a finely attuned ear to the language and discourse of American politics in the early 1960s. Consequently Kennedy realised the peril, in the steel crisis, to his political standing and thus felt compelled to embark on a dramatic and potentially dangerous course of action. We attempt to sustain this argument by closely examining the political language of the participants, relying heavily for our analysis on the writings of the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, the Italian semiologist, Umberto Eco and the Russian linguist V.N. Volosinov.<br>

Abstract: Mass death resulting from war, starvation, and disease as well as the vicissitudes of extreme poverty and enforced sexual servitude are recognizably pandemic ills of the contemporary world. In light of their magnitude, are repentance, regret for the harms inflicted upon others or oneself, and forgiveness, proferring the erasure of the guilt of those who have inflicted these harms, rendered nugatory? Jacques Derrida claims that forgiveness is intrinsically rather than circumstantially or historically impossible. Forgiveness, trapped in a paradox, is possible only if there is such a thing as the unforgivable. "Thus, forgiveness, if there is such a thing," can only exist as exempt from the law of the possible. Does this claim not open the way for hopelessness and despair? More troubling for Derrida is his concession that forgiveness may be necessary in the realm of the political and juridical. If so, is not the purity of the impossibility of forgiveness so crucial for him, contaminated? In pointing to some of the difficulties in Derrida's position, I shall appeal to Vladimir Jankelevitch's distinction between the unforgivable and the inexcusable. I shall also consider the significance of repentance in the theological ethics of Emmanuel Levinas and Max Scheler. Forgiveness, I conclude, is vacuous without expiation, a position that can be helpfully understood in the context of Judaism's analysis of purification and acquittal in the Day of Atonement liturgy. I argue that what disappears is Derrida's assurance of the impossibility of forgiveness, a disappearance that allows for hope.<br>

Abstract: A presente análise do conto "Seqüência", do livro Primeiras estórias, de Guimarães Rosa, pretende demonstrar um recurso recorrente de estruturação das "estórias" do autor. Esses enredos mobilizam, de uma maneira geral, o motivo da viagem e, de uma maneira particular, o percurso do eterno retorno. Nesse trajeto estrutura-se a travessia por um rito de passagem, cujo desfecho dá-se, com uma espécie de sobrelevação lendária, numa paisagem mítica. Para perfazer esse processo, o autor parte de um motivo da cultura popular que acaba amalgamado ao universo da tradição erudita, por meio de referências à tradição da história do gênero da narrativa e de seus códigos míticos. /// This analysis of "Seqüência", a short story from the book Primeiras estórias, by Guimarães Rosa, aims at showing a recurrent device used in the author's stories. These plots have, in a general sense, the motif of travel and, in a strict sense, the journey of eternal return. In this path, the traverse is structured through a rite of passage, whose completion occurs at a mythical scenery as a sort of legendary lifting. In order to accomplish this process, the author's starting point is a motif of popular culture, which ends up by being amalgamated to the universe of the erudite tradition, through references to the narrative genre historical traditions and to its mythical codes.<br>

Abstract: Desde este punto de vista, y contrariamente a los postulados de la teoría de las utilida-

da por los autores de la teoría prospectiva, quienes insisten en el hecho de que los individuos
son más sensibles a las pérdidas que a las ganancias. La situación anterior a 1973 se interpre-
taría más en términos de utilidades esperadas, con una precisión: los actores durante este pe-
riodo se mostraron singularmente risk-acceptant (situación diametralmente opuesta a la de los
años ochenta, en donde son risk-averse). Véase Daniel Kahneman y Amos Tversky, "Prospect

Author(s): Clegg Stewart R.<br>
Abstract: Although studies in organizational storytelling have dealt extensively with the relationship between narrative, power and organizational change, little attention has been paid to the implications of this for ethics within organizations. This article addresses this by presenting an analysis of narrative and ethics as it relates to the practice of organizational downsizing. Drawing on Paul Ricoeur's theories of narrative and ethics, we analyze stories of organizational change reported by employees and managers in an organization that had undergone persistent downsizing. Our analysis maintains that the presence of a dominant story that seeks to legitimate organizational change also serves to normalize it, and that this, in turn, diminishes the capacity for organizations to scrutinize the ethics of their actions. We argue that when organizational change narratives become singularized through dominant forms of emplotment, ethical deliberation and responsibility in organizations are diminished. More generally, we contend that the narrative closure achieved by the presence of a dominant narrative amongst employees undergoing organizational change is antithetical to the openness required for ethical questioning.<br>

Abstract: El surgimiento de una identidad aymara entre la población indígena del norte grande de Chile es un fenómeno reciente, como lo han demostrado algunos investigadores en los últimos años. En este artículo se aborda el vínculo problemático que se establece entre indentidad y memoria como parte de este fenómeno nuevo en el que los sujetos involucrados, principalmente aymaras urbanos, sienten la necesidad de articular una memoria representativa de ese colectivo amplio que es el pueblo aymara, planteándose, al mismo tiempo, el desafío de construirla, o como sus promotores sostienen, de "conocerla" y "descubrirla". El análisis tiene como punto de partida las tensiones que cruzan este proyecto y cómo éstas se reflejan en los documentos producidos por distintas organizaciones aymaras a partir de los años noventa. Nuestro interés se concentra en aquello que los sujetos dicen acerca de la memoria aymara (nivel de metamemoria), los esfuerzos desplegados en su construcción y los recursos utilizados en este intento. The emergence of an Aymara identity among the indigenous population in the northern part of Chile is a recent phenomenon, as some researchers have shown in the last few years. This paper discusses the difficult link between identity and memory as a part of a new phenomenon, where the concerned individuals, mainly urban Aymara, feel the necessity of articulating a memory that would represent this broad collective group, the Aymara people. At the same time, they assume the challenge to build this memory, or, in their own words, to "know" and "discover" it. The analysis focuses on the tensions that exist in this effort and on the way in which these tensions appear in the writings of different ethnic organizations since the nineties. Our interest centers on what the subjects say about Aymara memory (the level of metamemory), as well as on the efforts they put on its construction, and the resources they use.<br>

Abstract: Handwritten documents as well as printed books and tracts in the indigenous languages of New England's Native Americans in the colonial era enable linguistic scholars to "reclaim" traditional Native speech, "closing the circle" for many Native Americans and providing a solid foundation for group cohesion and cultural identity. In addition, writings by Native Americans and Native voices inherent in documents penned by Euro-American colonials are essential to understanding the details and dynamics of acculturation. A key focus of this article is the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project, which relies heavily on linguistic analysis of historical documents scattered throughout repositories in New England. Endangered languages, cultural diversity, and the multifaceted perspectives preserved in archival repositories have much to teach us.<br>

Author(s): Zeitlin Larry J.<br>
Abstract: Recent developments in historical sociology emphasize the centrality of temporality to analysis and explanation. Narrative uses temporal order to organize information about events and to foster their understanding but is insufficiently systematic to substitute for sociological explanation. This article illustrates a new interpretative heuristic for the computer- assisted analysis of qualitative narrative sequences, "event-structure analysis,"that infuses narrative with greater rigor and explicitness. Through the analysis of a lynching that took place in Mississippi in 1930, this article shows how event-structure analysis can be used to build replicable and generalizable causal interpretations of events.<br>

Author(s): Zelditch Michael<br>
Abstract: The methodological foundations of comparative-historical sociology have been transformed dramatically in recent years. Arguments against general theoretical models have proliferated, while the complexity and uniqueness of historical events and the virtues of inductive methods have been emphasized. The growing convergence of sociology and history has led to a decline in the use of general theories. This article begins with a description and analysis of the recent transformation of the methodology of comparative-historical sociology. An overreliance on inductive methods has resulted in inadequate specifications of causal relations and causal mechanisms in recent comparative-historical sociology. The concluding section discusses a nascent rational choice research program in political sociology to illustrate an alternative methodology.<br>

Author(s): Wolseley Ronald N.<br>
Abstract: Narrative methods are used to analyze the cultural dynamics of civil society through a comparison of African-American and "main-stream" newspaper coverage of the Rodney King crisis in Los Angeles. The newspapers' different narrative constructions affected the selection and interpretation of significant crisis events, shaped social expectations about how the crisis would be resolved, and constrained the range of symbolic strategies available to local political elites. Through and application of narrative methods, this case demonstrates how the analysis of plot, character, and genre can help explain the interplay between the analytic and concrete forms of culture and the dynamics of social problems and social change more broadly.<br>

Author(s): Goodwin Jeff<br>
Abstract: Network analysis is one of the most promising currents in sociological research, and yet it has never been subjected to a theoretically informed assessment and critique. This article outlines the theoretical presuppositions of network analysis. It also distinguishes between three different (implicit) models in the network literature of the interrelations of social structure, culture, and human agency. It concludes that only a strategy for historical explanation that synthesizes social structural and cultural analysis can adequately explain the formation, reproduction, and transformation of networks themselves. The article sketches the broad contours of such a theoretical synthesis in the conclusion.<br>

Author(s): ATZENI PAOLA<br>
Abstract: Using an "anthropo-pragmatic" approach, this essay analyzes the speech made by Mussolini in the square in Carbonia, Sardinia, on 18 December 1938. The analysis also takes in other speeches and reveals the power of Mussolini's logos: this was not simply inaugural, ritual and foundational in its celebration of the new town, but recognised a historic turning point in the policies of the Italian nation and empire in the passage of the fascist state from ruralism to industrial urbanism. By broadening the study, the power of Mussolini's declarative strategy becomes more apparent. Also that other subjects were submerged with subversive micro-narrations of different types. Finally, multiple discourses, practices and complex negotiating subjects appeared in the post-fascist democracy. The "anthropo-pragmatic" approach, which is at first restricted, is later broadened and utilized on a speech-by-speech basis: from the comical and satirical to the poetic and the contractual. Highlighting the discursive conflicts at work, examples are emphasized of dialectical speeches that constitute and characterize other antagonists and protagonists of democratic cultural modernity: the nurse-comedy-writer, miner-poet, and miner-trade unionist. In the new fascism these figures test new risky declarations that were also practices of freedom, caring for oneself and many others, to the extent of spreading into democratic relations. These speeches and themes operate in a setting where discursive and identity-related powers meet, hidden and manifest, public and private, in the mine and the city.<br>

Abstract: En este artículo se abordan algunas de las cuestiones metodológicas que plantea el análisis de la violencia de los hombres contra las mujeres en la historia, como contrapunto a la existencia de este tipo de violencia en nuestra sociedad. En primer lugar se exponen las diferentes fórmulas que se utilizan para nombrarla —«violencia de género», «violencia sexista», «violencia sexual», «violencia doméstica o familiar», «violencia de pareja», «violencia machista»...—, sus significados y connotaciones políticas, y su validez conceptual para la investigación histórica; a continuación se tratan algunos de los problemas que surgen al estudiar la violencia contra las mujeres a partir de las fuentes documentales históricas, y, finalmente, se analiza cómo puede repercutir en el presente el análisis histórico de la violencia de los hombres contra las mujeres. This essay considers some of the methodological issues raised by the analysis of male violence against women in the past, as a counterpoint to the persistence of this kind of violence in our society. In the first place, the author examines the different expressions used to name this kind of violence —«gender violence», «sexist violence»,«sexual violence», «domestic violence or violence in the family», «partner violence in couples», «macho violence»...—,their meaning and political connotations. Some of the problems posed by the study of violence against women based on historical documentary sources are considered thereafter, to finish analyzing the possible effects on the present situation of an historical analysis of male violence against women.<br>

Abstract: La stèle du Bronzo est gravée d'un oiseau "levé", en plein vol, la tête tournée vers l'extérieurs, superposé à un filon de quartz blanc; une crosse, également traitée en champlevé, lui barre le passage. En première lecture, une identification plausible du genre volatile semblait prévaloir et le colombidé emportait notre adhésion. Mais une analyse plus posée et un effort de déconstruction graphique du motif permettront cette fois de reprendre et d'affiner la reconnaissance, en décrivant les différents filtres autorisant tel ou tel rejet de catégorie ou d'espèce, pour ne conserver en dernier ressort que les meilleurs prétendants à la seule confrontation possible, celle qui oppose les corvidés aux colombidés. La représentation du Bronzo est en définitive équivalente en substance et en structure aux scènes figurées sur les stèles voisines dans lesquelles un phallus s'oppose qu tranchant d'une lame de hache (Mané Rutual), tandis qu'un cachalot affronte la coalition des animaux et des outils de l'homme (Table des Marchand). A "flushed" bird is engraved on the Bronzo stela, in full flight, its head turned to the exterior, superposed over a white quartz vein; a crook, equally treated in cut-away engraving, bars its passage. At a first reading, a plausible identification of the bird seemed to prevail and the Columbidae met with our approval. However, more deliberate analysis and an effort at the graphic deconstruction of the motif allows the identification to be reconsidered and improved, by describing the various filters authorising the rejection of such or such a category, finally preserving the best claimants to the only possible confrontation, opposing Corvidae to Columbidae. The Bronzo representation is equivalent in substance and in structure to the scenes on the neighbouring stelae where a phallus is opposed to the sharp edge of an axe blade (Mané Rutual), while a sperm-whale confronts the coalition of animals and human tools (Table des Marchand). However Bronzo is a ~<br>

Abstract: Since several well known critics have recently declared that the golden age of literary theory has come to an end, this might be the moment to rethink a theoretical problem that attracted some interest in the academic world from the late 1970s to the early 1990s: the relationship between historiography and literary criticism. Although the histoire des mentalités has given the literary text an unprecedented status in the reconstruction of the collective imaginary and although the discussion of similarities between forms of narrative in historical and fictional texts has undoubtedly intensified the dialogue between historiography and literary criticism, some aspects have been overlooked in the debate of the last twenty to thirty years. First, for both types of texts, fictional as well as historiographic, the wide range of narrative and representational strategies has not been taken into account; second, more recent narratological methods of analysis have not been applied to historiographic texts; third, the interest for the narrative character of historiographic texts can be found almost exclusively among literary critics and philosophers and much less among historians; and fourth, the analysis of narrative structures inside and outside the limits of fictional writing has eclipsed the main characteristic of literary texts, their inherent potential to produce pleasure.<br>

Abstract: According to the received interpretation, 'Der Abschied', the finale of Gustav Mahler's exotic and valedictory "Das Lied von der Erde", depicts the intrinsic subject's farewell to life and ecstatic, quintessentially romantic death. Cultural and anthropological historians of death, however, agree that by Mahler's day, encroaching modernity had rendered such a 'belle mort' a vanishing ideal. This article juxtaposes close musicopoetic and formal analysis against contemporary orientalist discourses to propose that 'Der Abschied' articulates a fresh epistemology of death whereby individual identity becomes subsumed in nature's eternal cycles. Laut der allgemein akzeptierten Deutung des Schlusssatzes von Gustav Mahlers exotischem Abschiedswerk, dem "Lied von der Erde", stellt 'Der Abschied' das Lebewohl des immanenten Subjekts an das Leben und seinen ekstatischen ur-romantischen Tod dar. Sich auf die Geschichte des Todes spezialisierende Kulturhistoriker und Anthropologen sind sich aber darüber einig, dass die fortschreitende Moderne bis zu Lebzeiten Mahlers das Ideal eines solchen 'schönen Todes' immer weiter schwinden ließ. Dieser Beitrag stellt eine detaillierte musikalische und poetologische Analyse neben zeitgenössische Orientalismus-Diskurse, um die These aufzustellen, dass 'Der Abschied' eine neue Erkenntnislehre des Todes darstellt, in der die Identität des Einzelnen in den ewigen Naturkreislauf subsumiert wird.<br>

Abstract: It is argued that, contrary to the received view, there is not one but at least two significant conceptions of society as a moral system in the structural functionalist tradition. They express a weak and a strong sense of `morality' respectively. This conceptual equivocation is a pregnant construction of Durkheim's sociology and is dramatically brought forth by Evans-Pritchard's notorious recommendation to turn away from orthodox functionalism to semantic analysis. As the equivocation implies that social anthropology is bound by a stultifying analytical dualism, profound change of presuppositions seems a prescribed therapy.<br>

Author(s): Ohnuki-Tierney Emiko<br>
Abstract: Most symbols are polytropic as well as polysemic in that their multiple meanings in various contexts functions as different types ot trope. This article pursues the complex nature of polytropes through a formulation of synecdoche as an interstitial trope between metaphor and metonymy, and demonstrates how the two conceptual principles of analogy and contiguity, that define metaphor and metonymy respectively, are interdependent and interpenetrated, rather than of basically different natures as presented in the biaxial image of structural linguistics. The analogic thought expressed in methaphor involves movement and temporality, just as does the discursive thought of metonymy. The interpenetration of the two modes of thought is demostrated through an analysis of the process of objectification of what, throughout history, has been a dominant symbol of self in Japanese culture: the monkey. As a polysemic and polytropic symbol, the monkey takes on different meanings, and functions as different tropic types, sequentially or simultaneously, as actors use and/or interpret the symbol in varying historical and social contexts.<br>

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>
Issue: i212608<br>
Date: 8 1, 1942<br>
Author(s): Pepper Chunglin<br>
Abstract: This paper considers some aspects of the early history of the American contribution to the International Biological Programme (IBP), ecology's only venture into 'Big Science'. It is argued that American ecologists were successful in obtaining generous funding for the IBP from the US Congress, thanks to a shared understanding of the way in which controlling nature was to be accomplished, expressed in the metaphor of the 'cybernetic machine'. To support this argument, a literary analysis is performed on Congressional documents, on scientific and popular books and papers by ecologists, and on writings of the environmental movement. The paper explores how a dominant representation of nature, or mentalité, is brought about, and its political effects.<br>

Author(s): Collins Kay<br>
Abstract: This Note reviews shortcomings and claims of discourse analysis (DA). In particular, it focuses on the relationship between DA and reflexivity. It argues that DA could not succeed as its supporters originally thought, because DA has not dealt adequately with the issue of reflexivity. Even now that has turned to such issues, DA has a limited interpretation of reflexivity that is related to the change in sociological focus from scientific beliefs and knowledge to the study of texts for texts' sake.<br>

Date: 12 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Godin Benoit<br>
Abstract: Literature discussing rhetoric is mainly concerned with rhetoric per se - its structure, and the categorization of arguments by kind. Rarely do rhetorical studies examine the actual effects on audiences, and auditors' reactions. On the other hand, sociological studies of scientific controversies look at rhetoric - or argumentation - in action, but with few references to rhetorical studies. The purpose of this paper is to integrate rhetorical studies into the sociology of technology in order to integrate the concept of action into discourse analysis. I intend to show how the use of discourse to enroll actors in a health technology is intimately linked to action. I deconstruct the promoters' strategy into two discursive components - the utility component and the fear-reduction component - to show how the rhetoric of expectations (utility) and representations (fear) contingently shape the fate of a technology.<br>

Abstract: Before World War II the intellectual climate of American sociology was congenial to the growth of a sociology of knowledge akin to Mannheim's. Yet in the postwar period American sociologists committed themselves to ahistorical theory, positivist methodology, and team research; their "scientistic" sociology did not permit the historicism, relativism, and holism necessary to Mannheimian analysis. Currently, however, convergent trends in a number of disciplines--not only sociology but also philosophy, anthropology, literary criticism, and the histories of ideas, science, and art--favor a revival of the Mannheimian program. Analysts of culture now seek to integrate the sociological goals of "explanation" and "understanding"--the formulation of quasi-laws of behavior, based on identification of the social structural elements of culture production, and the interpretation of the subjective meaning of culture, based on recovery of actors' intentions. Their research program requires investigation of the peculiar sociohistorical circumstances that condition actors' perceptions, necessitating attention to the cognitive content of culture. This article surveys both the theoretical justifications for such a research program and recent exemplifications of it, focusing on anlyses of what Mannheim termed "objective culture"--such symbolic vehicles for conceptions as religion, the arts, science, and political thought that acquire independent existence, becoming subject to diverse interpretations.<br>

Abstract: Partant de l'analyse de la situation mémorielle actuelle, cet article diagnostique la question qu'elle fait naître pour la mémoire relative à l'esclavage dans les Antilles françaises, prise dans une frénésie qui renforce l'idée de mémoires soudainement inventées. Des mémoires de l'esclavage de l'ordre de la circulation intergénérationnelle sont-elles présentes? Cette question renvoie au débat anthropologique propre à ces sociétés où la mémoire collective relative à l'esclavage a longtemps été tenue pour être absente. À partir d'une recherche conduite sur un événement ancien qui reconduit le cadre du conflit originel entre maîtres et esclaves, à savoir l'insurrection de 1870 à la Martinique, l'article décrit les processus mémoriels qu'il a générés. Le recueil de témoignages auprès des descendants des insurgés rend compte de la présence de récits familiaux transmis jusqu'à aujourd'hui selon des modalités particulières liées aux conséquences de la répression de l'événement insurrectionnel. L'interprétation qui s'en dégage amène à revoir la question de la mémoire collective à la Martinique. Taking the analysis of the current memory situation as a starting point, this article analyses the question that it provokes about the memory of slavery in the French West Indies, subjected to a frenzy that reinforced the notion of spontaneously invented memories. Is there an inter-generational dissemination of slavery memory? This question refers to the anthropological debate in societies where collective memory about slavery has long been deemed absent. Using research carried out on an historical event that revives the framework of the original master/slave conflict, namely the 1870 insurrection in Martinique, we describe the memory processes this generated. The collection of accounts from descendentes of the rebels shows that family accounts have been transmitted until this day, using specific forms related to the consequences of the repression of the rebellion.

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>

Author(s): Weidler Markus<br>
Abstract: While the Dialectic of Enlightenment (1944; 1947) is often judged to be too limited a cultural critique, it is still widely accepted as pioneering cultural criticism, a mix of critical discourse analysis, hermeneutics, and semiotics. This article contests this reputation by turning to a source that Horkheimer and Adorno are at pains to occlude: Ernst Cassirer's Philosophy of Symbolic Forms (1923-29). Drawing on the tradition of eighteenth-century German Christology revived by the Young Hegelians in general and F.W.J. Schelling in particular, Cassirer evolves a critical strategy broader than that in the Dialectic, yet clearly implied by it. Most particularly, Cassirer's Schelling analysis discriminates philosophy, art, and religion as forms of knowledge and forms of epistemological critique, where Horkheimer and Adorno recast the art of the Bildungsbürger to occlude Cassirer's innovation, a new materialist semiotics that offers cultural critique in the broader terms that the Dialectic's critics would favor.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i30204873<br>
Date: 2 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Gardner Colin<br>
Abstract: Traditional discourses upon literature have been predicated upon the ability to refer to a text that others may consult (Landow, 1994, p. 33). Texts that involve elements of feedback and nontrivial decision-making on the part of the reader (Aarseth, 1997, p. 1) therefore present a challenge to readers and critics alike. Since a persuasive case has been made against a critical method that sets out to "identify the task of interpretation as a task of territorial exploration and territorial mastery" (Aarseth, p. 87), this paper proposes the use of readers in an empirically based approach to hypertext fiction. Meta-interpretation, a method that combines individual responses to a text, reading logs, screen recordings and limited qualitative/quantitative analysis, and critical interpretation is outlined. By analysing readers' responses it is possible to suggest both the ways that textual elements may have influenced or determined readers' choices and the ways that readers' choices "configure" the text. The method thus addresses Espen Aarseth's concerns and illuminates interesting features of interactive processes in fictional environments. The paper is divided into two parts: the first part sketches out meta-interpretation through consideration of the main problems confronting the literary critic; the second part describes reading research aimed at generating data for the literary critic.<br>

Abstract: Margaret W. Ferguson observes: "Augustine is haunted by the parallel between the nature
of language and the nature of man 'lost in our present sad dispersal.' His analysis of language as a
sequence of parts is in many ways a forerunner of Derrida's discussions of language as a 'play of
differences' that necessarily ruptures any concept of truth as a totality. Unlike modern theorists, how-
ever, when faced with the contradictions between a philosophy of essence and a linguistics of difference,
Augustine chooses to relinquish language rather than God" (p. 845).<br>

Date: 1 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Silbey Susan S.<br>
Abstract: The authors outline a sociology of narrative-an analysis of the role of narrative in various social contexts, including academic sociolegal scholarship. Narratives are social acts that depend for their production and cognition on norms of performance and content that specify when, what, how, and why stories are told. Because narratives are situationally produced and interpreted, they have no necessary political or epistemological valence but depend on the particular context and organization of their production for their political effect. The analysis specifies the variable conditions that produce hegemonic tales-stories that reproduce existing relations of power and inequity-and subversive stories-narratives that challenge the taken-for-granted hegemony by making visible and explicit the connections between particular lives and social organization.<br>

Abstract: Although the I960 student sit-ins were not nearly as uncoordinated as contemporaneous and subsequent accounts suggested, their repeated characterization in participants' accounts as "spontaneous" merits explanation. Analysis of campus newspaper articles and letters to the editor, speeches, and organizational and personal correspondence shows the emergence of a coherent and compelling narrative of the sit-ins, in which spontaneity denoted not a lack of prior coordination but independence from adult leadership, urgency, local initiative, and action by moral imperative rather than bureaucratic planning. Narratives of the sit-ins, told by many tellers, in more and less public settings, and in which spontaneity was a central theme, helped to constitute "student activist" as a new collective identity and to make high risk activism attractive. It was the storied character of representations of the sit-ins that compelled participation. This case suggests the more general importance of narrative-as distinct from collective action "frames"-in accounting for mobilization that takes place before the consolidation of movement organizations.<br>

Author(s): Wittgenstein Craig J.<br>
Abstract: The author describes and illustrates a hermeneutically grounded interpretive framework for deriving marketing-relevant insights from the "texts" of consumer stories and gives an overview of the philosophical and theoretical foundations of this approach. Next, the author describes a hermeneutic framework for interpreting the stories consumers tell about their experiences of products, services, brand images, and shopping. An illustrative analysis demonstrates how this framework can be applied to generate three levels of interpretation: (1) discerning the key patterns of meanings expressed by a given consumer in the texts of his or her consumption stories, (2) identifying key patterns of meaning that emerge across the consumption stories expressed by different consumers, and (3) deriving broader conceptual and managerial implications from the analysis of consumer narratives. This hermeneutic approach is compared and contrasted to the means-end chains laddering framework, the "voice of the customer" approach to identifying consumer needs, and market-oriented ethnography. The author concludes with a discussion that highlights the types of marketing insights that can result from a hermeneutic interpretation of consumers' consumption stories and then addresses the roles creativity and expertise play in this research orientation.<br>

Date: 7 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Blades David<br>
Abstract: Against the backdrop of Blades's analysis in Foucauldian terms of the failure of a particular science-technology-society reform, this review addresses four questions: (1) the problem of postmodern writing as a language of rupture; (2) the justification of science-technology-society approaches to science teaching; (3) the fruitfulness of Foucault's explanatory framework for understanding educational change; (4) the fruitfulness of Foucault's framework for education theory in general. It is argued that Foucault's notion of authors who are "founders of discursivity" can form the basis of both a productive theory of educational change and also of an educational vision in which a school strives to become a community of such founders of discursivity.<br>

Author(s): Lefort Dominique<br>
Abstract: Nous tentons de clarifier la place de la normativité dans une approche phénoménologique du politique en analysant l'opposition de la philosophie des droits de l'homme d'inspiration kantienne de Luc Ferry et Alain Renaut à la réflexion de type phénoménologique de Claude Lefort. Le projet de Lefort consiste d'abord en une tentative d'élucidation du réel et non de justification de principes. Mais la dimension normative n'en demeure pas absente puisque Lefort conçoit les droits de l'homme tant comme un phénomène du politique que comme signes de la liberté qu'il recherche dans la démocratie. Y a-t-il là nécessairement incohérence? /// Can a phenomenological analysis of political reality tackle the issue of norms? We try to answer this question through an analysis of the opposition between Luc Ferry and Alain Renaut's Kantian philosophy of human rights and the phenomenological approach of Claude Lefort. Lefort's project is an attempt to elucidate reality and not to justify principles. But the normative dimension is not entirely absent from his thought. Lefort conceives of human rights not only as a political phenomenon but also as a sign of liberty, which he supports. Is this inconsistent with the nature of his phenomenological project?<br>

Author(s): Thucydides William<br>
Abstract: Interpretation has been an issue in political theory for nearly two decades, but its influence for the most part has been limited to problems in the history of ideas. In this article, William Adams uses the methodological claims of the "new historians" of political thought as a point of departure to argue for an interpretive approach to contemporary theory. He contends that an important part of the task of political theory is to fashion critical interpretations of contemporary political culture. He claims further that many of the great works in the history of political thought pursue a strategy of this sort and might therefore be useful as models of political/cultural criticism. Adams elaborates his thesis with a brief analysis of Plato's critique of poetry in the Republic.<br>

Article Title: The Division of Labor in Social Science Research: Unified Methodology or "Organic Solidarity"?<br>
Publisher: Northeastern Political Science Association<br>
Issue: i362393<br>
Date: 7 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Somers Rudra<br>
Abstract: Since contending methodological perspectives and different types of research products are founded on irreconcilable philosophical assumptions, the sharp, recurrent debates over social science research methods are likely to be fruitless and counterproductive. This article begins by exposing some of the philosophical assumptions underlying the most recent calls for a unified social science methodology and seeks to help develop a common appreciation of how different kinds of methods and research products advance our understanding of different aspects of social life at different levels of abstraction. Such commonly posited dichotomies as deductivist/inductivist logic, quantitative/qualitative analysis, and nomothetic/idiographic research products are shown to obscure significant differences along a continuum of strategies through which context-bound information and analytic constructs are combined to produce interpretations of varying degrees of complexity or generality. Durkheim's conception of "organic solidarity" in a social "division of labor" serves as a useful metaphor here to capture the complementary roles performed by various research products as well as the trade-offs arising from the strengths and weaknesses of various methodological approaches (ranging from formal and statistical approaches to various case-based and interpretive approaches). Thus, sharp claims regarding the strengths and limitations of particular methods are transformed into elements of an overarching agnostic understanding of the trade-offs and complementarities among these methods. Finally, a distinctive role is identified for an ideal-typical "middle-range" comparative-historical approach in fostering greater communication among a more inclusively defined community of methodologically diverse social scientists.<br>

Abstract: A Classical Latin text, Ovid's metamorphosis about Echo, is analyzed using Givón's notion of topic continuity. The analysis reveals iconicity on the paradigmatic level of discourse. A problem encountered in applying Givón's iconicity principle is raised, and this leads to an alternative approach to iconicity in discourse, following Becker. This approach uncovers instances of another type of iconicity in the text, this time on the syntagmatic level, and leads to a discussion of the role of iconicity in the aesthetics of the text.<br>

Author(s): Turner Elizabeth M.<br>
Abstract: This article examines some of the discursive practices through which residents of West Virginia coal-mining communities negotiate the emically defined role of "neighbor." Notions of personhood privilege the synaptic, the contextual, and the relational. The ontology informing these discursive practices is contextualized within the historical conditions of their lives as working-class. Data and analysis contest essentialized notions of 'Appalachia', working-class consciousness, and social 'identity'.<br>

Abstract: In this paper we present an analysis of the articles in Educational Studies in Mathematics since 1990. It is part of a larger project looking at the production and use of theories of teaching and learning mathematics. We outline the theoretical framework of our tool of analysis and discuss briefly some of the methodological difficulties we face. We then present our findings from the analysis of the journal and we also give one example of how we 'read' an article, illustrating the rules whereby criteria are applied.<br>

Article Title: Semantic Innovation: Arithmetical and Algebraic Metaphors within Narratives of Learning<br>
Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i277383<br>
Date: 10 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): Wilden Dave<br>
Abstract: This paper examines a theoretical perspective on the ways in which children progress in learning mathematics. It suggests that there is a difficulty in associating teaching discourses with the mathematics they locate. This can result in an incommensurability between alternative perspectives being offered. The paper resists attempts to privilege any particular account but rather demands an analysis of these discourses and their presuppositions. In developing these themes the paper invokes Ricoeur's analysis of time and narrative as an analytical approach to treating notions such as transition, development and progression in mathematical learning. His notion of semantic innovation is introduced. This embraces both the introduction of a new metaphor into a sentence or the creation of a new narrative which reorganises events into a new 'plot'. The notion is utilised in arguing that the shift in the student's mathematical development from arithmetic to first order linear equations with unknowns reconfigures the contextual parameters governing the understanding of these mathematical forms. It is also utilised in showing how alternative approaches to accounting for such transitions suit different and perhaps conflicting outcomes. For example, demonstrating awareness of generality or performing well in a diagnostic test featuring the solution of linear equations.<br>

Issue: i281449<br>

Author(s): Yin Alain<br>
Abstract: Les méthodes utilisées majoritairement en économie sont la modélisation mathématique et les approches quantitatives. La narration, dont on a usé dans le passé, notamment en économie industrielle, semble avoir disparu. Est-ce réellement le cas? Une résurgence de la démarche narrative en économie ne pourraitelle pas constituer une source de diversité méthodologique? Telles sont les questions que pose cet article. La première partie montre que la narration continue à être utilisée, mais comme une forme ancillaire des méthodologies dominantes. Sur le rôle joué par la narration vis-à-vis de la modélisation, le cas du statut du récit de l'adoption du clavier QWERTY et de son maintien dans le cadre de la théorie de la dépendance de cheminement (path dependency) sert de support à l'analyse. Un autre cas illustre le rôle potentiel de la narration dans les études quantitatives. La seconde partie présente la démarche narrative comme une approche exploratoire et s'efforce de montrer dans quels cas, et à quelles conditions, elle peut conduire à des apports originaux. /// Economic analysis appears primarily based on modelisation and making use of quantitative methods. In particular narratives on case studies which had for long prevailed in industrial economics have noticeably receded. Yet, is it as straight-forward? Is it not thinkable to propose a structured narrative approach that would have increased scientific legitimacy and added diversity in the field? The paper focuses on these issues. The first part discusses to what extent narratives may be said having disappeared from economics scientific production. It illustrates that they still play an effective ancillary role as a key source for theorisation. Evidence is given from the analysis of the QWERTY story and its relationship to the emergence of the path dependency theory. Other seminal economic works are reviewed which show that, properly performed, the narrative approach has scope for bringing new insights under the domin~<br>

Article Title: If Meaning Is Constructed, What Is It Made from? Toward a Cultural Theory of Reading<br>
Publisher: American Educational Research Association<br>
Issue: i368708<br>
Date: 4 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Yaroshevsky Peter<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the notion of meaning, particularly as applied to acts of producing and reading texts. The analysis is grounded in principles of activity theory and cultural semiotics and focuses on the ways in which reading takes place among readers and texts in a culturally mediated, codified experience characterized here as the "transactional zone." The author builds on Vygotsky's work to argue that meaning comes through a reader's generation of new texts in response to the text being read. As a means of accounting for this phenomenon, examples are provided from studies illustrating, for instance, Vygotsky's zones of meaning, the dialogic role of composing during a reading transaction, and the necessity of culturally constructed subjectivity in meaning construction. The author concludes by locating meaning in the transactional zone in which signs become tools for extending or developing concepts and the richness of meaning coming from the potential of a reading transaction to generate new texts. "When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean-neither more nor less." (Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass)<br>

Abstract: In this article we show how an interpretative methodology of narrative analysis is beneficial for the study of public administration. We demonstrate the use and usefulness of a method for analyzing narratives that is based in concepts from classical rhetoric and semiotics. The method allows researchers to make more available the unstated, implicit understandings that underlie the stories people tell. We show how we have used this method to examine our data about change in city administrations. This article is a step-by-step demonstration of our method of narrative analysis and an illustration of how this method can be used.<br>

Abstract: Despite the abundance of psychological studies on trauma related ills of descendants of historical trauma, and the extensive scholarly work describing the memory politics of silenced traumatic pasts, there has yet to emerge a critical analysis of the constitutive practices of descendants of historical trauma. This article presents an ethnographic account of a support group for descendants of Holocaust survivors, proposing that the discursive frame of intergenerational transmission of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and support group based narrative practices allow descendants to fashion their sense of self as survivors of the distant traumatic past. The discursive frame of transmitted PTSD acts as both a mnemonic bridge to the past and a mechanism of identity making, as participants narratively reemplot their life stories as having been personally constituted by the distant past. A close ethnographic reading of on-site discursive practices points to how culture ferments to produce narratives, practices and ultimately carriers of memory to both sustain and revitalize historical grand narratives and the cultural scenarios they embed.<br>

Author(s): Wittig Zeus<br>
Abstract: Critical social theory is a multidisciplinary knowledge base with the implicit goal of advancing the emancipatory function of knowledge. It approaches this goal by promoting the role of criticism in the search for quality education. Through critical social theory in education, quality is proportional to the depth of analysis that students have at their disposal. As a critical form of classroom discourse, critical social theory cultivates students' ability to critique institutional as well as conceptual dilemmas, particularly those that lead to domination or oppression. It also promotes a language of transcendence that complements a language of critique in order to forge alternative and less oppressive social arrangements. A critical social theory-based movement in education highlights the relationship between social systems and people, how they produce each other, and ultimately how critical social theory can contribute to the emancipation of both.<br>

Author(s): Schreiner Sabine<br>
Abstract: En analysant l'épisode de la lettre à Johnson publiée en avril 1966 par "Témoignage chrétien" et "Cité nouvelle," Sabine Rousseau décrit les mécanismes d'une mobilisation, alors pionnière, contre la guerre du Vietnam. Au lendemain de Vatican II, l'enracinement chrétien confère à cet engagement une forme originale, caractéristique d'un tiers-mondisme fondé moins sur les théories de l'impérialisme que sur le sentiment de la responsabilité chrétienne dans le drame vietnamien. /// The publication in "Cité nouvelle" and "Témoignage chrétien," on 21 April 1966, of an appeal to President Johnson marked the French Protestant and Catholic left's entry in the fight against the Vietnam war. Although somewhat late in their mobilization with respect to the Peace Movement, the commitment was early enough considering the dominant silence outside communist and communist sympathizer circles. As a sequel to the struggle for decolonization, this commitment took the original form of a letter to the president of the US. The feeling of Christian responsibility for the history of imperialism overtook the political analysis of the war. After a difficult beginning, the public opinion campaign grew during the summer, favored by the escalation of violence in Vietnam. But to the most committed left Christian militants, the campaign seemed already insufficient. Their radicalization in the fall of 1966 prepared for a mobilization in which the specific Christian commitment gave way to common action with the anti-imperialist movements.<br>

Abstract: En quoi le western, ce genre cinématographique si typiquement américain, peut-il aider les historiens à réfléchir sur leurs propres méthodes? En comparant les œuvres de John Ford et de Michael Cimino, Christian Delage nous invite à revenir sur la question des temporalités et des représentations de la durée. /// The filmmaker reconstructs the past rather than reconstituting it, and thus meets the historian. The analysis of two major works by John Ford and Michael Cimino shows how the cinema historicizes a past event through the indirect agency of the narrative. In the fiction presented to the audience, the filmmaker, like the historian, faces representations inscribed in general history, while simultaneously modifying its meaning. American cinema carries on an almost ontological relation with duration and time; the question of its truthfulness presents the same methodological challenge as that driving contemporary historical research.<br>

Abstract: Au départ, quatre groupes discriminés au nom de la nationalité française: les femmes qui épousaient un étranger, les naturalisés restés inéligibles, les juifs depuis Vichy, les musulmans d'Algérie. Au point d'arrivée: chez les deux derniers groupes, des traces si fortes et si durables qu'elles ont pu créer un sentiment de non reconnaissance et de rejet. Voici, par un de nos meilleurs spécialistes, le point sur une hantise française très présente. Et un appel au travail d'histoire. L'article examine la discrimination dont furent victimes, depuis le Code civil et l'installation de la République, quatre catégories de Français: les femmes qui ont épousé un étranger; les naturalisés de fraîche date qui n'ont pas joui de tous les droits civiques, en matière de vote et d'élection notamment; les juifs victimes des mesures raciales sous Vichy; les musulmans dans l'Algérie coloniale. Il détaille tout particulièrement les traumatismes que cette situation a engendrés jusqu'à nos jours chez les deux dernières catégories et propose de renouveler l'analyse historique de certains d'entre eux. /// The article examines, since the Civil Code and the setting up of the Republic, the discrimination that four categories of French people were victims of: the women that married foreigners; those recently naturalized that didn't enjoy all their civic rights in voting and elections in particular; the jews who were victims of racial measures during the Vichy government; the Muslims in colonial Algeria. It details the traumatisms that this situation continues to engender in the last two categories and mentions plans to revisit the historical analysis of some of them.<br>

Abstract: Is history a category of reason, or is reason a category of history? These opposing questions have divided the structuralist from the materialist-but neither question is wrong. Analysis of the logic of oppositions challenges feminism, in particular, to find a logic-and a poetics-in which to render its values without historical or theoretical naiveté. I explore the question of the timing of feminism through Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray.<br>

Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i291342<br>
Date: 4 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Žižek Sergei<br>
Abstract: The literary epic Lāčplēsis, written in the nineteenth century, was a conscious attempt to create a cultural frame of reference for the emerging Latvian nation. In this article, which examines how poet Andrejs Pumpurs imagined his community, Kruks compares the Latvian epic hero with his Estonian counterpart, Kalevipoeg, who was invented at the same time under similar conditions of domination by Russians and Baltic Germans. Kruks's narrative analysis demonstrates the different frameworks through which social bonds are constructed for the heroes. Kalevipoeg is a pragmatic actor with an explicitly formulated duty; he errs, but he recognizes his personal responsibility. The Latvian hero Lāčplēsis, on the other hand, is not given a clearly formulated duty; he is simply a hero by destiny and definition. As a resource of symbols that feed contemporary discourses, the epic impedes the construction of a modern national identity capable of engendering a civic society through active pragmatic participation. For past generations, Lāčplēsis explained unjust foreign domination. Kruks argues that contemporary Latvian society now seeks a new frame of cultural reference that will permit the construction of a future-oriented national identity.<br>

Issue: i371629<br>
Date: 1 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Vindhya Srila<br>
Abstract: Marriage practices, the dynamics of interpersonal relationships and the politics of sexuality are relatively under-researched themes in the study of Bengali communism. Historical scholarship on the revolutionary politics of the extreme left Naxalbari andoian of the late 1960s-1970s, the object of this piece of study, is no exception. The article engages with women and men's narratives on the practice of 'revolutionary' marriage in the movement through the prism of contemporary popular memory studies and narrative analysis. Drawing on field interviews with middle-class male and female activists, the article draws attention to the contestatory nature of marriage in the collective memory of the movement. Narrative contestations over marriage in the Naxalite movement underscore, I argue, a tension between a Utopian ideal of transgressive interpersonal relations and dominant middle-class codes of sexual morality. At the same time, individual attempts to 'compose' (in storytelling) socially recognizable and acceptable subject positions are grounded upon the silencing and abjection of more risky memories. Given the discrepancies and contradictions within the narrative repertoire from which individuals construct their identities, these 'marriage stories' are a tremendous resource for investigating the politics of love, sexuality and subject-formation in middle-class Bengali society.<br>

Abstract: This article evaluates Emmanuel Levinas's novel "ethical metaphysics" of interpersonal relations from a religious perspective. Levinas presents a unique version of agape ethics that can be evaluated in terms of a number of the dilemmas that have traditionally attended Christian discussions of neighbor-love. Because Levinas's analysis makes our responsibility for other persons depend on their eschatological significance, it has the same problems that hamper all theories of neighbor-love that lack a sufficient role for reciprocity.<br>

Abstract: This paper offers a listing of references to religious ethics in recent Anglo-American philosophical literature, organized in terms of a critical analysis of the main lines of argument to be found there. The principal focus is on metaethics, although references are included to other aspects of religious ethics. The author maintains that the case for a logical and/or a linguistic relation between religion and ethics is much stronger than is generally recognized in the philosophical discussions of these issues.<br>

Author(s): Wattles Jeffrey<br>
Abstract: The drama of Plato's brush with the kind of thinking formulated in the golden rule--"Do to others as you want others to do to you"--discloses (1) ambiguity in the rule, due to its association with the popular Greek practice of helping friends and harming enemies, and (2) an unnoticed philosophic and/or religious solution to a problem raised by this ambiguity. Revising Albrecht Dihle's influential analysis in "Die Goldene Regel" (1962), this article explores the philosophic implications of golden-rule thinking in three of Plato's sources--Homer, Herodotus, and Isocrates--and in three texts from the dialogues: "Crito" 50a-54d, "Phaedo" 62b-c, and "Laws" 913a.<br>

Abstract: El objetivo del artículo es describir rasgos estructurales de la comprensión de metáforas mediante una comparación con la comprensión de otras culturas, tal como ésta ha sido comentada por Wittgenstein y Geertz. El fenómeno de estudio es la comprensión enfática (no básica) de metáforas fuertes (no de metáforas convencionales y muertas). La comparación entre ambos tipos de comprensión sirve para plantear y dar respuesta a tres preguntas desatendidas en la profusa literatura sobre la metáfora: 1) ¿En qué sentido nos sorprenden las metáforas fuertes? 2) ¿En qué sentido pueden ser profundas? 3) ¿En qué sentido hablamos de la riqueza de este fenómeno lingüístico? /// This paper sets out to describe the structural features of metaphor comprehension through a comparison with the process of understanding other cultures construed along the lines proposed by Wittgenstein and Geertz. The phenomenon under analysis is the emphatic (not basic) understanding of strong (not conventional or dead) metaphors. The comparison between understanding metaphors and cultures serves to raise and answer three questions that have been neglected in the vast literature on metaphors: 1) In which sense do strong metaphors surprise us? 2) In which sense can a metaphor be profound? 3) In which sense do we speak of the richness of this linguistic phenomenon?<br>

Publisher: Northeastern Political Science Association<br>

Author(s): McManus Helen<br>
Abstract: There is something profoundly disturbing in the concept of politics as an agon, a site of contestation, struggle, and competition. Action in a world of pervasive and irreducible conflict risks exposing the individual to the contingency of all unity, including the unity of the self, and thus forces individuals to recognize their own internal divisions and contradictions. This article considers the possibility of enduring, surviving, and excelling at agonistic politics. It asks what kind of individuality, what mode of thinking about and addressing the person's inner plurality, might provide the capacities to survive participation in the democratic agon and thus sustain democracy as a form of politics. Accounts of agonistic politics concur in imagining the individual as engaged in what might be called an inner agonism; therefore my analysis focuses on the reasons for this mimetic relationship between individuality and politics. I argue that mimesis in political imagination draws out particular sorts of affective responses, orienting the person to her political world in ways that might provide precisely the sorts of resources needed for action.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i40008393<br>
Date: 1 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Browne M. Neil<br>
Abstract: The doctrine of comparable worth is frequently denounced by economists as inefficient, unnecessary, unworkable, incredibly costly, and replete with unfortunate consequences for the same low-wage workers it alleges to be helping. This paper attempts to identify an explanation for both the vigor and content of economists' common antipathy toward comparable worth. The methodology of the paper is taken from Donald McCloskey's recent The Rhetoric of Economics and Feyerabend's epistemology of conversation. A content analysis of economists' criticisms of comparable worth reveals a much different methodology from that deified in the beginning chapters of Principles of Economics texts. Facts and empirical validation are not the primary bases responsible for their conclusions. The theoretical and empirical support for current relative wages is not solid enough to explain either the nearunanimity of economists' arguments or their vitriolic tone. This paper analyzes the fundamental role played by metaphor in guiding economists' analysis of comparable worth. Metaphor is treated in this paper as a pre-rational image that, much like Kuhn's paradigms, provides insight and establishes blind spots.<br>

Abstract: This article aims to "unthink" influential philosophical articulations of the crisis of Europe in order to articulate a non-Eurocentric epistemological position that aims to give a consistent expression to the interrelational approach of wprld-systems analysis. This alternative epistemology demands and foments a postimperial Utopia and requires no less than the death of ideals that defend the epistemological superiority of European Man. An analysis and critique of works by Edmund Husserl, Immanuel Wallerstein, and Walter Mignolo lead to the formulation of a positive conception of the crisis of Europe and to weak versions of Utopia and "colonial difference." The alternative articulation of these concepts aims to make more flexible and productive the links between knowledge and location. In this way, this article intends to bridge the gap between Wallerstein's world-systems approach and Mignolo's concern with the limits of Eurocentric critiques of Eurocentrism.<br>

Abstract: Political and legal debates over the value of official silence in the aftermath of civil wars are inconclusive. On the one hand, official silence is considered disrespectful to the memory of the victims and an impediment to establishing a culture of accountability and respect for human rights. On the other, silence is regarded as instrumental to achieving peace. Yet, longitudinal analysis of the dynamics of official silence in Mozambique demonstrates that, in this post-conflict country, as in others, silence has not in fact been achieved. Official silence in politically pluralistic environs can also offer opportunities for political elites to use memories as weapons to settle accounts with former wartime foes. In post-civil war Mozambique, Frelimo and Renamo over time have moved away from the initial strategy of official quiescence. Both parties appropriated the official silence to wage fierce political battles where memories of the violent past are used as the principal weapon. The interruption of silence through manipulative appropriations of the grisly past take place in dispersed political activities; however, the most confrontational and violent eruptions of memory occur in the Mozambican national parliament. These political confrontations signal the necessity in this politically pluralistic society for complex readings of memory against the prevailing monolithic official history.<br>

Abstract: This article aims to explore aspects of the construction by scientific practice of historical-cultural differences. It aims as well to suggest ways to approach ethnic phenomena considering the need to place them historically, and to focus the cultural and political dimensions in new terms; in the challenge that ethnicity represents to today's world. The confrontation with humanity as 'the others' that is talked about, is partial. It is not with all 'humanity' but only with a part of it—substantial indeed—, a 'humanity' with specifities placed in a world divided in ethnocentric and unequal modes. This is the world that Geertz embraces what is 'not properly ours.' We can ask ourselves what is exactly 'properly ours' for those who say it. I add some obvious but forgotten dimensions: the place of the observer, the characteristics of the society where the perceptions and construction of otherness originate and are reproduced. Nowadays the idea of the importance of the 'racial factor', is newly again reinforced. Like in the United States and now in Europe. These differences, more than having a physical or cultural referent, have to do with the dimension of power and with social differences. Ethnicity has never been translated in only one discourse. Therefore, ethnicity should be seen as a process whose meanings can only be understood in context, evolving in the course of history in the specific social circumstances of a given people. Even more, the development of ethnic and class processes in the same social formation adds to the complexity of ethnic processual nature. The articulation of these two processes—ethnicity and class— and their contradictions can only be aprehended by observing the historical dimension in which these take place. By underlining the temporal depth of social processes, the 'ethnographic present' is displaced from this centre of analysis to be come 'a moment' in this processual flow. From this perspective ethnic phenomena are not anymore mere 'acci~<br>

Abstract: O presente estudo constitui um ensaio crítico de reflexão sobre a questão dos limites da linguagem em Wittgenstein. A perspectiva deste estudo observa, numa primeira parte, o próprio procedimento do método wittgen-steiniano e segue um modelo de discurso plural, a partir de várias perspectivas que, não só permitem desconstruir a aparente unidade da razão, como indagar interiormente do próprio limite da análise wittgensteiniana. Retomando a caracterização da linguagem e do pensamento nos seus traços fundamentais, desde o "Tractatus" até às "Investigações Filosóficas", chama-se a atenção para os pontos de dificuldade, da indefinição e da cons-trutividade do modelo de Wittgenstein. A plena lição do "autómaton" da linguagem face a uma possível diferenciação dos signos e aprofundamento lógico, constitui uma parte desta reflexão que se complementa pela referência aos horizontes de resíduo do não-linguístico, ou até do indizível, numa dupla maneira de estabelecer os limites da linguagem. Enfim, e a título conclusivo, apontam-se, não apenas os contornos do que se entende como uma moral retórica da linguagem em Wittgenstein, mas para perspectivas originais de um reaprofundamento em termos etioló-gicos de diferenciação de escala da lógica e da linguagem, e de recuperação de uma intencionalidade psico-lógico-linguística superando aquela indiferen-ciação do dizer no automático da fala estatuída na "ordinary language". /// La présente étude constitue un essai critique qui réfléchie sur la question des limites du langage dans la philosophie de Wittgenstein. Dans une première partie la perspective de cette réflexion analise les procédés que Wittgenstein lui-même utilise dans sa méthode, et pour cela se sert d'un modèle de discours pluriel, lequel permet non seulement la déconstruction de l'apparente unité de la raison, mais aussi faire une enquête au dedans des limites de l'analyse wittgensteinienne.

Abstract: Este estudo dedica-se à teoria da verdade tal como se apresenta nas obras de Ricoeur entre 1947 e 1960. Procura-se sublinhar o vaivém entre uma compreensão ontológica da verdade, marcada antes de mais pelo pensamento de Karl Jaspers (1947), e uma compreensão fenomenológica da verdade centrada na teoria do juízo (1960). Contudo a análise da tensão entre a unidade do verdadeiro e a multiplicidade das filosofias permite elaborar o conceito de verdade como comunicação e de verdade como objecto de esperança. Procura-se então mostrar o fundamento desta esperança bem como a dimensão pela qual ela ultrapassa o universo da filsosofia. A conclusão sublinha que os desenvolvimentos ulteriores de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sobre a hermenêutica do símbolo, da metáfora e da narrativa ganham em serem relidos no horizonte das tensões do problema da verdade. /// Cette étude est consacrée à la théorie de la vérité telle qu'elle se présente dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur entre 1947 et 1960. On cherche à souligner le va-et-vient entre une compréhension ontologique de la vérité initielement influencée par la pensée de Karl Jaspers 1947, et une compréhension phénoménologique de la vérité centrée sur la théorie du jugement (1960). L'analyse de la tension entre l'unité du vrai et la multiplicité des philosophies débouche cependant sur le concept de vérité comme communication et comme object d'espérence. On cherche alors à montrer le fondement de cette espérance ainsi que la dimension par laquelle elle dépasse l'univers de la philosophie. La conclusion souligne que les développements ultérieurs de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sur l'herméneutique du symbole, de la métaphore et du récit ont tout à gagner à être replacés et relus à l'horizon des tensions du problème de la vérité. /// This study pays special attention to the theory of truth elaborated in Ricoeur's work from 1947 to 1960.

Abstract: Vale a pena voltar a analisar a relação entre o mal e a religião em Kant. Mas este artigo aborda a problemática prévia a esta questão, isto é, a própria questão do mal tal como Kant a apresenta na primeira parte do livro de 1793, A religião nos limites da simples razão. Depois da introdução que elucida o espanto dos primeiros leitores deste livro, procura-se, na base da análise hermenêutica dos textos, verificar a articulação entre a disposição originária para o bem e a propensão para o mal. Encontra-se em seguida a aporia da relação entre o desejo e a realidade do mal: de onde provém o desejo do mal moral? Será preciso, no itinerário desta resposta, elucidar o conceito de natureza, bem como a relação com a interpretação kantiana do pecado original. A conclusão volta a introduzir a questão da liberdade na compreensão do mal, numa espécie de tensão pós-kantiana entre moral e metafísica. ///Il convient de réanalyser la relation entre le mal et la religion chez Kant. Le présent article aborde cependant une problématique préalable á celle-ci, á savoir la question meme du mal telle que Kant la présente dans la première partie du livre de 1793, La religion dans les limites de la simple raison. Après l'ntroduction qui rappelle 1'étonnement des premiers lecteurs de ce livre, on essaie, sur la base d'une analyse herméneutique des textes. de discerner l'articulation entre la disposition originaire pour le bien et la propension au mal. On rencontre ensuite l'aporie entre le désir et la rélité du mal: d'où vient le mal? Sur l'itinéraire de cette réponse il faudra éclaircir le concept de nature, ainsi que l'interprétation kantienne du péché originel. La conclusion réintroduit la question de la liberté dans la compréhension du mal, en une sorte de tension post-kantienne entre morale et metaphysique. /// The relation between evil and religion in the philosophy of Kant deserves e renewed analysis. The approach this article takes, however, is to begin by treating a prior problematic~<br>

É verdade que a psicanálise, na sua técnica, contém sérios problemas; o artigo, porém, mostra como o seu "trabalho" essencial consiste em promover a transformação que o próprio sujeito opera mediante a sua palavra criativa, palavra esta que Ihe proporciona o seu próprio nascimento de si. /// This article tries to evince how the psychoanalytical transference, as a regular product of the therapeutic alliance, is meant to be overcome by a progressive consciousness that the patient acquires of its instrumental character. The transference is destined to be dissolved at the end of the analysis. It is true that psychoanalysis, in its technique, harbours serious problems; its essential « travail » , however, is to promote the transformation that a person realizes through his/her own creative word that pushes him/her to give birth to him/herself.<br>

Abstract: Depots de uma primeira parte em que se situa o problema, o presente artigo aborda de forma pormenorizada, ainda que nāo exaustiva, o modo como a psicanalista francesa Marie Balmary interpreta os três primeiros capítulos do Génesis. O artigo mostra como, segundo a análise de Balmary, se trata aqui de um conjunto de narrativas que evidenciam o fracasso da prova da alteridade homem-mulher. O artigo pretende, desta forma, conjugar uma série de saberes habitualmente separados, como sejam a psicanálise, a exegese bíblica e a antropologia filosófica. /// After aftrst part where the problem is situated, the present article develops in a detailed, though not exhaustive way how the French psychoanalyst Marie Balmary interprets the first three chapters of Genesis. According to Balmary's analysis, we are dealing here with a collection of narratives which clearly show the failure of the "proof ofalterity" between men and women. In this way, the article aims to link knowledges usually separated: psychoanalysis, biblical exegesis and philosophical anthropology.<br>

Abstract: No presente ensaio trata-se da relação entre filosofia e cristianismo no século XX a partir da consideração de uma problemática comum a estas experiências: o eclipse do sentido, ou seja, a perda de referênda a um horizonte a partir do qual o ser humano pode orientar-se na vida. Esta problemática, diferentemente declinada nas formas do excesso do mal, do niilismo e da indiferença religiosa, é uma das heranças com que hoje tanto a filosofia como o cristianismo têrn de se debater. O presente artigo reconstrói uma "genealogia filosófica" da atitude de indiferença e oferece deste fenómeno uma análise articulada. A partir daqui apresentam-se duas soluçõoes possíveis, capazes de unir ainda filosofia e cristianismo e que estão em posição defavorecer novas formas de co-implicação entre Deus, homem e mundo: a referênda aos aspectos "positivos" da indiferença e a atenção à esfera do emocional, na qual as motivações têrn ainda espaço. /// The present essay deals with the relation between philosophy and Christianity in the 20 th Century in relation to the eclipse of meaning, i. e., the lack of a horizon that constitutes a point of reference by which one might orient his/her life. This problematic, affected differently by excesses of evil, nihilism, and religious indifference in the last century, is at the heart of the debate. In view of this, the present article offers a "philosophical genealogy" of the attitude of indifference. On the basis of an analysis of this phenomenon, it proposes two possible solutions that might bring philosophy and Christianity together by reformulating the ways that God, man, and the world may be seen as co-implicated and by considering how this indifference can have positive aspects.<br>

Author(s): Kearney Richard<br>
Abstract: In this article, the author argues that the phenomenological revolution inaugurated by Husserl and Heidegger opens up new avenues for a radical rethinking of the God question. With Husserl's 'free variation of possibilities in imagination' and Heidegger's famous claim in Being and Time that 'for phenomenology possibility stands higher than actuality', the author discovers new resources for our understanding of both Being and God. In both cases, the article claims, we witness the surpassing of the traditional metaphysical priority of actuality over possibility. Then, in a second moment, the paper explores the notion of the 'God of possibility' from the perspective of three different hermeneutic circles: scriptural, testimonial and literary. The essay concludes with an analysis of the positive implications of the notion of the 'possible' (as posse and possest) for a new understanding of the God of eschatology. /// No presente artigo, o autor defende que a revolução fenomenológica inaugurada por E. Husserl e M. Heidegger abre novas possibilidades para um repensar radical da questão de Deus. A partir da 'livre variação de possibilidades na imaginação' de Husserl e afamosa pretensão de Heidegger em Ser e Tempo de que para a 'fenomenologia a possibilidade está acima da actualidade', o autor descobre novos recursos para a nossa compreensão quer do Ser quer de Deus. Tanto num caso como no outro, diz-nos o artigo, podemos testemunhar a superação da tradicional prioridade metafisica da actualidade sobre a possibilidade. Em seguida, num segundo momento, o artigo explora também a noção de um 'Deus da possibilidade' a partir da perspectiva de três círculos hermenêuticos diferentes: o escriturístico, o testemonial e o literário. 0 ensaio conclui com uma análise das implicações positivas da noção de 'possível' (como posse e possest) para uma nova compreensão do Deus da escatologia.<br>

Publisher: Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40014514<br>
Date: 12 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Doran Robert M.<br>
Abstract: The paper appeals to Rene Girard for help in specifying what might be meant by four categories suggested by Bernard Lonergan: (1) a sacralization to be dropped and (2) a sacralization to be fostered; (3) a secularization to be welcomed and (4) a secularization to be resisted. The key text that is analyzed with Girard's help is Lonergan's paper "Sacralization and Secularization," where these cateories are introduced. Key to the discrimination of the sacred is the Law of the Cross, which is here amplified by Guard's analysis of the single victim mechanism and its reversal, as these are definitively revealed in the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus. But key to the discrimination of the secular are Lonergan's transcendental precepts, which are a specification of nature as a genuine category, one that would enhance Girard's mimetic theory. Lonergan and Girard are judged to be complementary and mutually supportive. /// O presente artigo busca auxílio na obra de René Girard em ordem a especificar o possível significado de quatro categorias sugeridas por Bernard Lonergan: (1) uma sacralização a ser rejeitada e (2) uma sacralização a ser promovida; (3) uma secularização a ser acolhida e (4) uma secularização que deve ser resistida. O textochave a ser analisado com a ajuda de Girard é o artigo de Lonergan "Sacralização e Secularização", no qual estas quatro categorias são introduzidas. A chave para o discernimento do Sagrado é a Lei da Cruz, a qual neste artigo é amplificada mediante a análise girardiana do mecanismo victimário e da sua superação, tal como eles são definitivamente revelados na paixão, morte e ressurreição de Jesus. Mas a chave para o discernimento do secular encontra-se nos preceitos transcendentais de Lonergan, os quais são uma especificação da natureza como categoria genuína, uma que é capaz de aprofundar a teoria mimética girardiana. Em suma, o artigo mostra de que modo Lonergan e Girard devem ser considerados complementares e suportadores um do ou~<br>

Article Title: The Narrative Ethics of Leopold's Sand County Almanac<br>
Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i40014552<br>
Date: 10 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Liszka James Jakób<br>
Abstract: Although philosophers often focus on the essays of Leopold's Sand County Almanac, especially "The Land Ethic," there is also a normative argument present in the stories that comprise most of the book. In fact the shack stories may be more persuasive, with a subtlety and complexity not available in his prose piece. This paper develops a narrative ethics methodology gleaned from rhetoric theory, and current interest in narrative ethics among literary theorists, in order to discern the normative underpinnings of the stories in Part 1. The narrative ethics approach sidesteps the need to ground the land ethic in ethical theory—which has been a reconstructive and problematic task for the philosophical interpreters of Leopold—and suggests, instead, that it emerges in Leopold's very effort to narrate his, professional, personal, and practical experience with nature. The involves examining the stories in terms of their emotional, logical and performative aspects. The result is an analysis that shows not only how these stories express normative claims, but also justify them. One conclusion of the analyses is that, in the narratives, there is less emphasis on the problematic notion of an over-arching "community" than in the prose pieces, and more emphasis on the metaphor of other living things as "fellow travelers" in the "odyssey of evolution." Second, the narratives take on an ironic attitude toward the ecological order, less discernable in the prose essays. The order itself may not be ethically admirable, but should be preserved since it makes possible any ethical relations within it. Thus, the narrative reading suggests some temperance to the usual holistic interpretation of his land ethic and its concomitant criticisms especially the charge of ecofacism. We should not take the land ethic imperative at its face value, in the sense that the good of the order itself is an intrinsic good. In the narratives, individuals are shown not merely to be means to the ecological whole,~<br>

Abstract: Benedict Anderson incorporó a la segunda edición de Comunidades imaginadas, dos capítulos "El censo, el mapa y el museo" y "La memoria y el olvido". Más tarde los reelaboró y definió como dos tipos de serialidades profundamente contrastantes pero igualmente influyentes en la formación de subjetividades colectivas nacionales. Este artículo hace un balance de la influencia de la obra de Anderson en el desarrollo de los estudios sobre nación y nacionalismo y, en especial, de categorías como "capitalismo impreso" y "serialidades". También analiza la influencia de la seriali-dad indefinida, la menos estudiada hasta el momento, en la construcción de naciones e identidades nacionales a través de un estudio de caso: la construcción de la nación argentina. /// Benedict Anderson included two chapters, "The census, the map and the museum" and "The memory and forgetfulness" in the second edition of imagined Communities. Later on these were redrafted and defined as two types of serialisations in profound contrast but equally of influence in forming national collective subjectivities. This article gives an assessment of the influence of Anderson's work on the development of studies on the nation and nationalism, and especially of categories such as "printed capitalism" and "serialisations". There is also an analysis of the influence of undefined serialisation, the part least studied up to now in the construction of nations and national identities through a case study; the construction of the Argentinian nation.<br>

Abstract: La tesis de este artículo es que el mejor medio para rebatir las críticas que dirigen a la historia los "postmodernistas" (etiqueta que incluye a los post-estructuralistas, materialistas culturales, nuevos historicistas, etc.) es hacer una nueva y detallada exposición de lo que en realidad los historiadores hacen y por qué lo hacen. Se abordan para ello dos problemas centrales: el del lenguaje y el de la historia como actividad social y profesional. Más adelante se analiza la diferencia entre el estudio de aspectos del pasado humano rigurosamente delimitados y los estudios especulativos, realizados por filósofos, teóricos literarios y otros investigadores ajenos a la profesión. Los "postmodernistas" simplemente son los intrusos más recientes en el estudio de la historia. En la parte esencial del artículo se analiza el contraste entre lo que los postmodernistas dicen que hacen los historiadores y lo que éstos en realidad hacen. /// The thesis of this article is that the best way to refute the criticism made of history by "postmodernists" (a label which includes post-structuralists, cultural materialists, new historicists etc.) is to give a new and detailed explanation of what historians actually do and why they do it. To do this two central problems are tackled: that of language and that of history as a social and professional activity. Further on there is an analysis of the difference between the study of strictly limited human past and speculative studies, undertaken by philosophers, literary theorists and other researchers outside the profession. The "postmodernists" are simply the latest most recent intruders in the study of history. The essential part of the article analyses the contrast between what postmodernists say and what they actually do.<br>

Article Title: Reader and Text in the Horizon of Understanding Methodology: Gadamer and Methodological Hermeneutics<br>
Publisher: Higher Education Press and Springer<br>
Issue: i40014889<br>
Date: 9 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Lin Zhang<br>
Abstract: Judging Gadamer's theoretical stance is a complicated matter, and his ontological hermeneutics is usually regarded as a text-centered theory of understanding. Through an analysis of the phenomenological premises from which his theories take off, however, we can clearly see his reader-centric stance. On the basis of this stance some cease to seek for the original intention of the author or the original meaning of the text, which ineluctably leads to the ignorance of an understanding methodology. As far as people's intentional understanding is concerned, however, the important as well as essential task is still that of striving for a certain kind of understanding that is relatively correct, with universally effective methodology as its necessary prerequisite. What is more, herein lies the significance of the epistemology of hermeneutics. This article aims to re-insert a sense of methodology after hermeneutics went through a period of ontological reflection, and hence clarify that it is of necessity that hermeneutics resumes its text-centric methodological stance. /// 判定加达默尔的理论立场是一个复杂的问题。他的本体论诠释学一般被视为 一种文本中心论的理解理论，然而通过对他所从出发的现象学前提之分析，可以清 楚地看出他的读者中心论的立场.正是基于这一立场，放弃了对作者原意或文本原 义之诉求，必然导致对理解方法论的漠视。但是，就人们有意识的理解活动而言， 首要的以及根本的任务仍然是努力获得某种相对正确的理解，而普遍有效的方法论 就是其必要的前提，诠释学的认识论意义便在于此.在诠释学经历了本体论的反思 后，应重新注入一种方法论的意识，回到以文本为中心的方法论立场.<br>

Author(s): Djezriri Souria<br>
Abstract: The modernisation theories developed in the 50s and 60s suggested that societies were converging toward modern values, gradually abandoning their traditional values. This convergence idea is re-examined in the following article within the context of European countries and on the basis of processed Values surveys. A set of attitude scales was constructed and then analysed through multivariate techniques. Two main results emerge from this analysis. First, it appears that, regardless of date and country, the Europeans' values are still structured around a traditionalism axis. This result obviously contradicts the theories of convergence towards modernity, theories that are strongly criticised. It is also an opportunity to reflect on the counterpart of traditionalism -need it be called "modernity"?- and on the relations between economic and moral attitudes. Second, religiosity is strongly linked to this structuring of values but it mainly opposes European members of whatever religious denomination to non-members, rather than -as is often imagined-Catholics to Protestants. All in all, the tension between tradition and modernity remains at the core of the value system of European societies.<br>

Author(s): Ballard Chris<br>
Abstract: The role of narrative in explanation has received considerable attention in most of the disciplines concerned with questions of historical process, including history, geology, psychoanalysis and palaeo-anthropology. Archaeologists, however, have been curiously reluctant to consider the proposition that their reconstructions of the past are fundamentally narrative in character. An argument is put forward for the serious study of narrative in archaeology, and three case studies from the prehistory of the New Guinea Highlands are presented in support: a brief review of the debate over the impact of sweet potato on Highland society; an analysis of the changing interpretations of the Kuk Swamp agricultural site by Jack Golson; and a summary of the role of indigenous narratives in accounting for the history of wetland drainage amongst Huli speakers in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea.<br>

Abstract: Although anthropologists have discredited use of the liberal and secular concept of "agency" for explaining Muslim women's behavior, their evidence comes from women who still appear rather agentive to Western readers, hence, muting the necessity and consequences of discovering and applying the women's own ethical and religious terms in their analysis. In Guinea's rural Fouta Djallon, women are not prone to mobilize and make self-interested decisions with immediately observable outcomes. Therefore, understanding them on their own terms requires greater attention to their religious frameworks, namely, to their use of visions of creation and afterlife to define themselves and strategize for redemption.<br>

Abstract: The article aims at a demonstration of the various problems attached to the concordist project. The study begins with a definition of concordism, precisely in order to show that it is derived from the desire of assuring the unity of the human spirit as it is confronted with the great diversity of scientific knowledge, but also that it ends up contradicting this very intention due to its lack of a true spirit of criticism. The article shows also how during the xx! h century the crucial questions to which the concordism related have to do with those pertaining to the origin of the universe, to the formation of the planet earth and to the notion of original sin. However, due to the fact that this last point is, no doubt, the most delicate and sensible one, the article insists particularly on a more detailed analysis of the notion of original sin in a theological perspective, one namely that is coherent with contemporary scientific knowledge. /// O presente artigo tem por objectivo mostrar os impasses a que conduz a atitude concordista em relação aos dados da Ciência e da Teologia. Nesse sentido, o estudo começa por definir o que se entende por concordismo. Mostra-se até que ponto a intenção do concordismo é a de assegurar a unidade do espírito humano confrontado com a diversidade dos saberes, mas também até que ponto essa mesma intenção é traída pela notável ausência de um verdadeiro espírito crítico. Mostra-se também que ao longo do século XX os pontos mais salientes do concordismo têm a ver com as questões ligadas à origem do universo, à formação da terra e ao pecado original Dado, porém, que este último ponto é, sem dúvida, o mais delicado, o autor do artigo detém-se numa análise mais detalhada e situada da noção de pecado original numa perspectiva teológica renovada por virtude dos conhecimentos derivados das ciências naturais.<br>

Author(s): Margulis Mario<br>
Abstract: En este artículo se rescata la tradición crítica del concepto "Ideologia". Se le intenta definir tratando de superar los problemas que emanan de su polisemia y de su utilización desde el sentido común. Para definirlo, el autor inicia su análisis a partir del apartado sobre fetichismo de la mercancía en el primer volumen de El Capital de Marx. Partiendo de los efectos del fetichismo sobre los procesos de pensamiento y los códigos de la cultura en un sistema productor de mercancías, se exponen los efectos sociales de la reificación (Lukács y Goldmann) y los rasgos principales de los contenidos ideológicos presentes en los discursos. El autor considera que las luchas sociales por el poder y la dominación son paralelos con las pugnas por la construcción social del sentido. En esa línea, llega a definir ideologia como "las huellas dejadas por las luchas por la hegemonía en los códigos de la cultura". /// The critical tradition attending the concept of'ideology' is recovered by defining this term in a way to avoid the traps set by its many meanings and its common sense usage. The author grounds his analysis on the arguments about the fetishism of commodities in the first volume of Marx's Capital. Taking as his starting point the effects of fetishism on the processes of thought and cultural codes in a commodity-producing system, he explains the social effects of reification (Lukacs and Goldmann), and the main characteristics of ideological contents in discourses. The author considers that social struggles over power and domination run parallel to competing social constructions of meaning. He defines ideology as "the tracks left by the fights over hegemony in the codes of culture".<br>

Author(s): Rössler Martin<br>
Abstract: This paper examines the application of both cognitive and symbolic/interpretive approaches to the analysis of specific cultural domains, in particular to the analysis of ritual. The data sources, referring to a most significant ritual in a rural Makassar community, are subdivided into three categories, namely various verbal statements, an indigenous written text describing form and contents of the ritual, and information resulting from participant observation during its actual performance. The argumentation shifts from a formal analysis of the ritual schema to a discussion of the question to what extent verbal statements as well as the written text have to be conceived of as indigenous interpretations of the local culture, which in turn are interpreted by the ethnographer. It is suggested that both cognitive and symbolic/interpretive approaches should complementary be referred to for a fruitful analysis of at least some domains of cultural knowledge.<br>

Publisher: Paulusdruckerei<br>
Issue: i40020091<br>
Date: 1 1, 1997<br>
Abstract: This paper is an anthropological reading of mythical and historical texts aimed at exploring the dynamics by which archaic Egyptian cosmology was constructed and reconstructed. Using Dumont's ideas of hierarchy and Sahlins' work on cultural reproduction, the study presents a synchronie and diachronic analysis of the underlying themes and principles upon which archaic Egyptian cosmology was constructed. The opposition of visible/invisible is the common principle around which other principles or sets of oppositions are clustered. The study shows that archaic Egyptian cosmology underwent a transformation from a structure based on natural entities into socially significant cosmological system. The paper further elaborates the striking homology between the archaic social cosmology represented in Osirian mythology and Christianity in the early centuries of the Christian era.<br>

Abstract: How can we understand the social impact of cognitions of a projected future, taking into account both the institutional determinants of hopes and their personal inventiveness? How can we document the repercussions, often contrary to intentions, "back from" such projected futures to the production and transformation of social structures? These are some of the questions to be addressed by a cultural sociology that attempts to look seriously at the effects of a projected future as a dynamic force undergirding social change. In this essay I discuss some of the reasons why the analysis of the future has been so neglected in sociological theory and research, and then sketch a possible framework for reincorporating it that specifies some of the cognitive dimensions of projectivity. In the process, I will show how a focus on future projections can help us make a link between cognition and action in a manner that has so far been neglected in the sociological literature.<br>

Abstract: We presented a model which describes the field of questions on identity as a field of dynamics. It is structured by means of particular, temporal configurations of identity through time and space. The theory of dynamic systems provides us with precise models for the representation of forms of identity, or of their evolution towards types of so-called chaos, given certain conditions. The model allows us to work in a comparative perspective, which is a sure advantage in conflict analysis. The complexity of identity phenomena is captured covering individual, group and community dynamics of identity.<br>

Author(s): Kosmicki Guillaume<br>
Abstract: Cet article se propose de comprendre le sens musical d'une production de techno dite underground. Au travers de l'analyse de « Let's play » de Crystal Distortion, un artiste réputé de la mouvance free party (ou techno clandestine), on examine principalement la coexistence douloureuse des valeurs utopiques de ce mouvement, aujourd'hui considérablement affaiblies, avec le statut inévitablement commercial du disque sur lequel figure la composition. L'opposition pourrait être frontale, une de ces valeurs premières étant justement le refus de la société marchande, mais on décèle au travers de différentes analyses de nombreuses stratégies pour cacher au mieux l'aspect commercial attelé au morceau. En effet, tout ce qui met une œuvre en situation contribue à son sens, et c'est pourquoi nous consacrons du temps à exposer certains aspects du mouvement acquis par un long travail de terrain et de nombreuses observations participantes : la présentation des valeurs de la free party ; son historique ; la manière dont est considéré Crystal Distortion par les acteurs du mouvement ; ainsi que le fait qu'il vende cette production sur CD (la plupart des productions étant normalement tirées uniquement sur vinyle car destinées au mix par des DJs). Puis nous passons à l'examen des éléments composant la jaquette du CD pour en arriver enfin à l'analyse interne de la production, en relation avec les précédentes strates de l'analyse. The purpose of this paper is to understand the musical meaning of a production of so-called underground techno music. Through the analysis of "Let's play" by Crystal Distortion, a famous artist from the free party trend (or underground techno trend), one examines the painful coexistence of the Utopian values of the movement, tremendously weakened today, with the unavoidable commercial status of the record in which the composition appears. The confrontation could be frontal, as one of these essential values precisely is the refusal of consumer society; but one de~<br>

Abstract: Au moyen d'une analyse sémiotique de 14 entretiens réalisés auprès d'adolescentes à propos de la mode nous mettons en évidence les « bricolages » qui leur permettent d'élaborer des panoplies vestimentaires et de construire leur apparence et leur identité. Cette description permet de montrer que la consommation peut être considérée comme un processus de co-construction. Nous montrons les implications de ce travail vis-à-vis : de la construction de l'identité au travers de la consommation, la signification des objets de mode, des méthodes de recherche utilisées, des travaux sur l'expérience vécue des consommateurs, et des praticiens. Semiotics provides a useful base for interpreting 14 interviews with adolescents about fashion. Our analysis show the «bricolages» used by each participants to produce various looks and to develop a sense of personal identity. We suggest that our description is an example of consumption viewed as a co-construction process. Implications for previous works on personal identity and the meaning of fashion objects, research method, experiential aspects of consumption, and marketers are provided.<br>

Abstract: À partir d'un petit corpus de controverses advenues récemment en France à propos de fictions littéraires ou cinématographiques, mettant l'accent sur les fortes restrictions encadrant actuellement la censure, cet article — inscrit dans la perspective d'une sociologie des valeurs dont sont tout d'abord explicitées les règles énonciatives — se propose : premièrement, de comprendre les principes qui poussent les acteurs à limiter l'espace imparti à la fiction ; deuxièmement, d'examiner la façon dont la narratologie a traité cette question des limites, les principes qui s'en dégagent et les instruments qui méritent d'être retenus ; troisièmement, de réfléchir aux raisons pour lesquelles il peut être nécessaire de limiter soit axiologiquement, soit ontologiquement, la fiction; et quatrièmement, d'expliquer pourquoi les chercheurs ont intérêt à en élargir les limites, de manière à éviter plusieurs types de réductions - logiciste, esthète, herméneutique, scientiste. L'article se termine par une tentative de solution aux controverses précitées, en forme d'avis d'expert outillé par cette analyse des limites de la fiction. Using a small corpus of recent controversies in France about fiction in literature or the cinema that have emphasized the tight restrictions now on censorship, this approach in terms of a sociology of values starts by examining the rules governing speech acts about this topic. First of all, how to understand the principles that lead to limiting the room allowed for fiction ? Secondly, how has narratology dealt with this question of limits ? What principles can be identified, and what instruments are worth using? Thirdly, what reasons might make it necessary to limit fiction either axiologically or ontologically ? Finally, the attempt is made to explain why researchers have an interest in broadening these limits so as to avoid several types (logical, aesthetic, hermeneutic, scientific) of « reduction ».

Abstract: Si certaines formes-sonate ou certains Andante de Mozart et Beethoven ont la réputation d'être « dramatiques » et de porter une expression fondée sur l'opposition entre tension et détente, est-il possible d'y détecter des règles narratives ? C'est la question à laquelle l'article tente de répondre, en se servant du modèle taxinomique proposé par A. J. Greimas. L'articulation des signifiés à l'intérieur d'un micro-univers sémantique est décrite au travers de la représentation de certains types de passion et de caractères musicaux (topiques, topoï, affects, etc.) détectés dans les œuvres de Mozart par Jozsef Ujfalussy. L'analyse de « la forme du contenu » , c'est-à-dire de la structure des signifiés dans un mouvement de symphonie de Mozart (le premier mouvement de la Symphonie en ut majeur, KV 338) ou de sonate de Beethoven (le deuxième mouvement de la Sonate op. 2 n°3) à l'aide du vocabulaire expressif codifié de l'époque, permet de démontrer la présence quasi « littérale » des rapports de contradiction, contrariété et de présupposition décrits par le fameux « carré sémiotique » de Greimas. On y découvre l'existence symbolique, dans ces mouvements d'œuvres instrumentales, des deux grandes classes de récit de la Sémantique structurale de Greimas, en fonction du maintien ou du refus de la situation de départ. If some sonata forms or some Andantes by Mozart or Beethoven can be described as « dramatic » , and cany an expression based on tension and relaxation, is it possible to detect in them narrative rules ? This is the question which the present article tries to answer, on the basis of the taxinomic model proposed by A. J. Greimas. The articulation of signified within a semantic micro-universe is described through the representation of types of passion and of musical characters detected in Mozart's works by Jozsef Ujfalussy. The analysis of the « content forms » , i.e. of the structure of signified in a Symphony movement by Mozart (KV 338, first movement) or in a sona~<br>

Abstract: Les apports de Jean-Marie Floch au marketing sont nombreux. Cet article ne prétend nullement en rendre compte de façon exhaustive mais tâche plutôt de montrer combien les voies et pistes de recherche qu 'il a initiées ont été fructueuses pour l'ensemble de la communauté marketing et sont d'un recours très fréquent pour aborder les questions de signification. Comprendre le parcours generatif du sens, permettre l'analyse des récits de marque, inscrire dans le lieu de vente ou l'objet les attentes génériques des consommateurs, voici quelques unes des très précieuses idées développées par ce sémillant sémioticien. The contributions of Jean-Marie Floch to marketing are numerous. This paper does not pretend to cover exhaustively this domain but tries to show how the research avenues developed are fruitful for the entire marketing community and are frequently used in order to deal with questions that have to do with signification. Facilitating the understanding of the process of sense generation, allowing the analysis of brand stories, marketing through sales area designs or products the generic requirements of customers, those are some of the precious ideas developed by Floch.<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i40026609<br>
Date: 4 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Klein Michael L.<br>
Abstract: This article discusses irony both as a narrative archetype in tonal music and as an interpretative strategy on the part of the listener. Beginning with a discussion of Northrop Frye's four narrative archetypes (romance, comedy, tragedy, irony), the article turns to a semiotic interpretation of the archetypes by James Liszka and an application of that work for music analysis by Byron Almén. Arguing that ironic narratives in tonal music often take as their premise a topical field associated with romance or comedy that leads to an unexpected failure, the article also claims that our interpretation of musical narratives must be invested in the semantic level (topics, codes, conventions, genres) as well as the syntactic one (harmony, voice leading). The four archetypes function as structures of the musical text and as master signifiers that the listener uses to organize an interpretation. As such, the archetypes function as ideologies of the musical text and as ideologies of the reader. The article illustrates these ideas with analyses of Chopin's Nocturne in B, op. 32/1, Chopin's Second Ballade, and Brahms's Rhapsody in Ek op. 119/4.<br>

Author(s): Moore Cerwyn<br>
Abstract: This article makes a contribution to hermeneutic explorations in global politics. Taking as its points of departure the growing body of work on film and the turn to aesthetic and intertextual IR, the article argues that a further conversation with cinema and poetics can be used to develop the interpretive canon in global politics. In particular, the analysis draws upon the idea of cinematic poetics, and more generally the work of Andrei Tarkovsky, who, throughout his films and written work, articulates a particular form of Russian interpretivism. The article explores Tarkovskian cinema and engages in debates about artistic creativity and aesthetics, filmic representations of belonging and spiritualism, all shaped by a Russian hermeneutic tradition. The final sections apply these themes, illustrating how the icon presents a way to read the themes of suffering and salvation, inscribing the formation of identities in global politics.<br>

Abstract: En partant de quelques transformations sodétales majeures, et en s'appuyant sur la fiction romanesque française, l'article dessine deux grandes constellations imaginaires de la mobilité dans la modernité. La première associe le but du déplacement, l'existence d'un ailleurs, le goût de l'aventure, l'attitude de départ actif et le rôle de la mobilité comme logique de pouvoir. La deuxième, souvent en résonance avec les items précédents, souligne plutôt l'exigence de la mobilité pour la mobilité, la fin de l'idée de dehors, l'impératif de la fuite, la prolifération de l'expérience du départ passif, enfin, la centralité croissante de la mobilité dans le saisissement de la domination. Au terme de ce parcours, l'imaginaire de la mobilité apparaît comme une boussole privilégiée pour cerner les transformations de la modernité. The article tracks two major imaginary constellations of modem mobility, through the analysis of important social transformations, illustrated by certain French novels. The first joins the goal of mobility, the existence of an « elsewhere » , the taste for adventure, an active departure, and the role of mobility as a logic of power. The second, frequently in relationship with the precedent, emphasizes the idea of mobility for itself, the end of elsewhere Utopia, the need to run away, the multiplication of experiences of passive departure, and finally the growing link between mobility and domination. The mobility imaginary appears at last as a privileged compass to surround the transformations of modernity.<br>

Abstract: The lawyer's crucial role in the contractual process has not been adequately addressed. Transaction cost economics provides a promising approach for doing so, but does not fully account for the lawyer's motivations or intentions. To do so, a more comprehensive theory of human behavior is required. Husserl's phenomenology, specifically his analysis of the natural attitude, provides such a theory. This article describes the role of lawyers in drafting complex entertainment contracts and explains that role in terms of both transaction cost economics and phenomenology. It argues that the two explanations are consistent, but that phenomenology offers additional insights and more fully explains the lawyer's actions.<br>

Author(s): Lampert Tom<br>
Abstract: This essay is the first attempt to compare Reinhart Koselleck's Historik with Hannah Arendt's political anthropology and her critique of the modern concept of history. Koselleck is well-known for his work on conceptual history as well as for his theory of historical time(s). It is my contention that these different projects are bound together by Koselleck's Historik, that is, his theory of possible histories. This can be shown through an examination of his writings from Critique and Crisis to his final essays on historical anthropology, most of which have not yet been translated into English. Conversely, Arendt's political theory has in recent years been the subject of numerous interpretations that do not take into account her views about history. By comparing the anthropological categories found in Koselleck's Historik with Arendt's political anthropology, I identify similar intellectual lineages in them (Heidegger, Löwith, Schmitt) as well as shared political sentiments, in particular the anti-totalitarian impulse of the postwar era. More importantly, Koselleck's theory of the preconditions of possible histories and Arendt's theory of the preconditions of the political, I argue, transcend these lineages and sentiments by providing essential categories for the analysis of historical experience.<br>

Author(s): CONSONNI MANUELA<br>
Abstract: The essay discusses the passage from an ideological, patriotic and anti-fascist memory of the deportations and the extermination to what the author describes as the "ethnic" memory of the Shoah, which has played, and continues to play, a central role in constructing the European historical narrative as that narrative depicts the Jews as Europe's "other". Theoretical reflection on memory is intertwined with historical analysis of the period between 1945 until the end of the twentieth century. Two, binary perspectives are featured, one, which examines memory from a cognitive point of view and the other, which examines memory from a cultural, ideological, moral and political perspective. These perspectives come to the fore in memoire-literature, movies, plays, historiographie and philosophical debates, which illustrate the two perspectives and their articulation, as well as they justify the essay's periodization.<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: The influence of Husserl on the Russian Formalism and the Structuralism of the Prague School of Linguistics is especially manifest in the work of Jakobson. A direct literary dependence is traceable in the so-called „antipsychological” tendency, in the program of a Universal Grammar and in several questions of the theory of meaning. Objective points of contact can be found in the theses of the intersubjective and the associative constitution of objects, but also concerning the central topics of Husserlian phenomenology, the analysis of essence (the elaboration of invariants and universals) and the phenomenological attitude (e.g. in phonology the priority of the perceptual level against the articulatory (physiological) and the acoustic (physical) level). A comparison of Jakobson and Husserl yields not only a mutual confirmation of fundamental aspects of their linguistic and philosophical thought. It opens also interesting ways for further research in both fields.<br>

Abstract: In his hauntology or 'ghost theory', Derrida both subscribes to and rejects Marx's famous exposition on commodities fetishism. He subscribes to Marx's analysis of the world of merchandise as a shadowy world which covers up how exactly society produces this merchandise. His rejection pertains to the invariant structure typical of all discussions of fetishism. This structure, in which the fetish is determined as a substitute for the real item, presupposes a determinable distinction between substitute and the real item. It will be shown that Marx's concept of fetish does indeed rest on this presupposition, because it assumes that the utility value of the commodity can be dissociated fromits market value. Derrida's hauntology wants to retain the critical dimension of Marx'sexposition on fetishism, without incorporating its intrinsic ontology.<br>

Abstract: In this article, an overview is given of Ricœur's ontological thinking. Although Ricœur never dedicated a whole book to the theme of ontology, it is present in most of hisarticles. In his study on the will he approached ontology initially through a strictly phenomenological method. After his analysis of the symbols of evil, in which hermeneutics was used as a philosophical instrument, he discovered the importance of linguistics in philosophical questions. Consequently, his thinking underwent a linguistic turn and evolved into a phenomenological hermeneutics. Through his dealings with ontology, it became clear that ontology is influenced by hermeneutics as well. A firm and stable ontology seems no longer conceivable and should be exchanged for a hermeneutical ontology that articulates being within the horizon of language. In this respect, Ricœur develops the concept of metaphor through which the 'seeing as' leads to a 'being as'. Although Ricœur acknowledges the dynamic and contingent character of being, his thinking aims at adimension beyond historical dynamics. However, in trying to clarify the problems of ontology, he discovers that it is not possible to solve the aporias of being. Still, language offers him an alternative opportunity to develop an account of being, namely narrativity, in which being is expressed in respect to its dynamic character and with the awareness that we always try to get a view on the whole from within.<br>

Abstract: Cassirer faisait de la connaissance le point culminant du « processus d'objectivation de l'esprit » se révélant ainsi progressivement à soi-même à travers la spécificité de ses diverses configurations symboliques. Nous nous proposons d'élucider ici la loi de constitution propre aux sciences exactes à partir des principales figures de la physique moderne pour nous élever à une philosophie de la culture scientifique et dégager les principaux problèmes que pose sa réalisation comme « Weltbegriff ». Cassirer considered Knowledge as the terminating point of the « process of objectification » of human spirit that leads progressively to its self-consciousness through the differential specificity of symbolic forms. We are mainly concerned here with trying to clear up the constitutive law proper to exact sciences. Our analysis starts from the main figures of modern physics as its starting point in order to set our thought on a philosophy of scientifical culture and to draw the main problems related to its achievement as « Weltbegriff ».<br>

Author(s): Ricœur Paul<br>
Abstract: Cet article s'interroge sur le statut à la fois épistémologique et ontologique d'un passé qui « a été » et dont les individus comme les sociétés retiennent le souvenir, mais qui, comme le langage ordinaire l'exprime, « n'est plus » . Toute une tradition de réflexion sur la conservation du passé par la mémoire depuis Platon et Aristote a voulu ramener la mémoire à la métaphore de l'empreinte. En revanche, cet article tente de montrer que la mémoire à plusieurs dont dépend la connaissance historique n'est pas simplement assimilable à ce topos traditionnel. Ce qui caractérise la mémoire plurielle et publique qui alimente le travail de l'historien, c'est le statut privilégié du témoignage, la possibilité de confronter différents témoignages les uns aux autres, dont dépend la crédibilité du récit historique. C'est ainsi moins la problématique d'une ressemblance entre récit et événements racontés — problématique de la trace, héritée d'une tendance traditionnelle à identifier la mémoire avec l'empreinte — que la confrontation de témoignages dans leurs différents degrés de fiabilité qui nous fait assister à l'événement raconté. Cette réflexion sur le décalage entre mémoire et histoire ouvre, dans la deuxième partie de cet article, à une analyse approfondie de la temporalité propre au passé qui fait l'objet du souvenir et conduit à une confrontation avec privilège accordé, dans la synthèse des trois modes du temps, chez saint Augustin au présent et, chez Heidegger, au futur. De cette manière, l'article tente de rééquilibrer la synthèse des temps en lui restituant un autre rapport au passé, que l'on ne saurait atteindre à partir d'Augustin ou de Heidegger. Libérer l'histoire du paradigme de la trace, de la métaphore de la mémoire comme empreinte, revient précisément à la restitution de ce mode de temporalisation du passé jusqu'ici esquivé : cet autre rapport au passé vise, conjointement à la mise en évidence du témoignage propre au travail de l'historien, à souligner la dette~<br>

Author(s): Villani A.<br>
Abstract: On essaie dans ces pages d'appliquer à la philosophie de Kant et de Dilthey certains concepts en vue d'une perspective critique de l'histoire. La distinction diltheyenne entre explication et compréhension est mise en rapport avec celle qu'opère Kant entre jugement déterminant et jugement réfléchissant. Puisque la majeure partie de la complexité historique ne peut trouver son explication dans des lois générales, on propose une compréhension réfléchissante du récit historique. Mettre en relation le jugement réfléchissant et la compréhension revient à souligner la dimension normative de l'interprétation historique. La perspective anthropologique de Kant fait également place aux jugements préréflexifs, préliminaires sur l'histoire, tandis que l'approche diltheyenne par les Geisteswissenschaften ramène à une conscience reflexive ou autoréférée qui replace l'individu en son temps et en son lieu. D'autres aspects peuvent encore conduire à notre rapport critique à l'histoire : le modèle kantien d'une orientation réfléchissante de la communauté humaine, les limites qu'ilpose à l'interprétation authentique, la conception heideggerienne de l'authenticité historique, l'analyse diltheyenne des systèmes d'influence réciproque comme cadre de l'idée d'une imputation causale singulière chez Paul Ricœur. This essay is an attempt at applying certain concepts to the philosophy of Kant and Dilthey, so as to develop a critical perspective on history. Dilthey's explanation-understanding distinction is related to Kant's distinction between determinant and reflective judgment. Since much of the complexity of history cannot be determinantly explained by general laws, a reflective understanding of the meaning of historical narrative is suggested. To relate judgment and understanding is to highlight the evaluative dimension of historical interpretation. Kant's anthropological perpective also makes room for pre-reflective, preliminary judgments about history, whereas Dilthey's human science app~<br>

Abstract: Juriste de formation logicienne, longtemps influencé par le positivisme logique, Chaim Perelman a d'abord pensé qu'il était possible d'étendre l'analyse du raisonnement formel à l'argumentation pratique, juridique et morale. L'abandon de ce projet est ce qui l'a conduit à redécouvrir la topique juridique et à proposer, sous le titre de « nouvelle rhétorique », un retour à la Rhétorique et aux Topiques d'Aristote. As a jurist with a background in logics who was influenced by logical positivism for a long time, Chaim Perelman first thought that the analysis of formal reasoning could be extended to practical argumentation in the field of law and ethics. Renouncing this idea was what allowed him to rediscover juridical topics and to go back to Aristotle's Topics and Rhetorics under the name of « new rhetorics ».<br>

The article describes how young Vietnamese women use narrative to find meaning in the suffering that a late-term abortion causes. Seeking to further develop anthropological use of the concept of social suffering, the article argues that existing scholarship has tended to neglect the importance of human agency and imagination, hinging as it does on suffering as entrenched within structural forces. The article contends that this neglect must be understood in the context of the particular epistemological and ethical conditions under which anthropological studies of human suffering are produced, and that closer attention to the human engagements out of which ethnographic accounts are fashioned may bring into analysis not only the harm that social forces can inflict on people, but also their capacities for action and imagination. / Mêlant ethnographic et récits littéraires, l'article explore la relation réciproque entre souffrance et agency. Il décrit comment les jeunes femmes vietnamiennes utilisent la narration pour trouver un sens à la souffrance causée par une fausse couche tardive. Visant à élargir l'utilisation anthropologique du concept de souffrance humaine, l'auteur montre que les études tendent à négliger l'importance de l'agency et de l'imagination, qui s'articule sur la souffrance enracinée dans les forces structurelles. L'auteur affirme que cette négligence doit être comprise dans le contexte de conditions épistémologiques et éthiques particulières dans lesquelles sont produites les études anthropologiques de la souffrance humaine, et qu'une analyse plus attentive des engagements humains desquels sont issus les récits ethnographiques peut introduire dans la réflexion non seulement le mal que les forces sociales peuvent infliger aux individus, mais aussi les capacités d'action et d'imagination de ceux-ci.<br>

Abstract: La catégorie de « temporalisation » est omniprésente dans les textes fondateurs de la Begriffsgeschichte koselleckienne. Elle renvoie à la question générale de la temporalité humaine et au problème épistémologique des temporalités historiques en particulier. Elle constitue en outre, pour Koselleck, un cadre interprétatif fondamental de notre modernité politique. Ce texte revient sur ces différents problèmes en reconstruisant la « théorie générale de l'expérience historique » qui se trouve à l'arrière-plan. Un inventaire des usages analytiques de la catégorie de « temporalisation » est ensuite proposé. Par là même, le schème de la « temporalisation » apparaît comme un processus global traversant notre modernité politique, en interaction avec d'autres processus englobants, qu'il s'agit aujourd'hui de tenter de typologiser dans la continuité certes, mais au-delà du cadre koselleckien initial. Soucieux de faire apparaître, en les distinguant et articulant ensemble, les différents niveaux d'analyse mis en œuvre par l'entreprise même de l'histoire des langages politiques modernes, cet article tente de réengager le dialogue entre l'histoire (structurelle, culturelle et événementielle) et les sciences politiques en reconnaissant un statut causal propre aux idées politiques et religieuses modernes, à la philosophie politique et juridique moderne, à l'inertie des sémantiques historiques sur la longue durée : toutes choses qui ne peuvent être causalement, et partant disciplinairement, disqualifiées que parce que l'on part d'une vision étriquée et pauvre de ce qu'est l'expérience de l'histoire. The notion of 'temporalization' is one of the key concepts in the Koselleckian Begriffsgeschichte. It refers to the general issue of human temporality and more specifically to the epistemological problem of historical temporalities. In Koselleck's writings, it constitutes a fundamental interpretative framework for political modernity as a whole. This article returns to these different is~<br>

Abstract: Début 1936, X., haut dirigeant de l'État-Parti, pressentant peut-être une disgrâce prochaine qui le conduira à la mort en 1937, s'exile en écriture. Pour autant, l'analyse proposée de son journal ne s'attache pas à décrire cette lente descente aux enfers qu'ont connue d'innombrables citoyens soviétiques au cours de cette histoire désorbitée. Elle tente de discerner divers « noeuds », lestés de paradoxes et sans doute constitutifs de la période : comment l'(il) logique de la Terreur peut être l'objet d'une appropriation par sa future victime ; comment cette même Terreur, via une déstructuration temporelle imposée à l'individu, lui dicte des formes narratives de soi ; et comment, ce faisant, l'individu en question est susceptible de reconquérir un « je ». In early 1936, probably sensing the eventual disgrace which caused his demise in 1937, an anonymous top party leader retreated into writing. The present analysis of this man's journal does not address the slow descent into hell experienced by so many Soviet citizens in those times gone mad. Rather it aims at discerning various predicaments laden with paradoxes and undoubtedly constituent of the period: how a future victim internalizes the (il) logic of Terror; how Terror dictates narrative forms of the self by causing a disruption of the individual's awareness of time; and how, in the process, the individual in question is likely to recover his sense of self.<br>

Abstract: En étudiant les récits de vie des paysans roumains du Banat et d'Olténie déportés dans les années cinquante dans la plaine de Bǎrǎgan, nous avons essayé de mettre en évidence de quelle façon le récit de vie peut être un révélateur d'une réalité ethno-historique et anthropologique. Nous avons souligné le problème d'ordre méthodologique qu'une telle étude pose au chercheur. Dans un premier temps, nous avons discuté le statut discursif du récit de vie comme discours de témoignage, et les conséquences qui en dérivent pour son analyse comme texte narratif et argumentatif qui développe une rhétorique spécifique. Une description du contexte historique auquel font référence les textes, ainsi que des circonstances dans lesquelles l'enquête orale a été menée, nous a semblé nécessaire pour dégager l'importance du thème de l'identité et de la différence dans les récits de nos interlocuteurs. En analysant ce thème, nous avons tenu compte des constellations idéologiques et symboliques qui dominent ces développements dans le texte des critères que les paysans utilisent pour se différencier de l'Autre sous ses différents visages. L'analyse de ces facteurs suggère des pistes intéressantes pour déceler certaines mentalités et pratiques culturelles, surtout celles liées au foyer et à la famille et aux pratiques culinaires.

Abstract: L'auteure présente un outil d'exploration des situations sociales : l'arrêt sur image. Elle revient sur ses diverses contraintes techniques et méthodologiques et démontre leur intérêt au sein d'une enquête inspirée par la sociologie de l'action. C'est en tenant compte de la temporalité des actions humaines que l'image semble pouvoir évoluer d'un rôle d'illustration à celui d'outil d'analyse. En passant indifféremment d'image animée à image statique, l'enregistrement vidéo permet un choix de séquences filmées et une lecture multiple des contextes observés. Il aide à suivre finement les activités des acteurs, et à mettre en évidence la différence entre les normes du groupe et celles de l'individu. The author présents a tool for explorating social situations : freezing on the frame. She evokes its various technical and methodological limits and shows its interest for a survey inspired by action sociology. By taking into account the temporality of human actions the image can be more than illustrative and become an analysis tool. By passing indiscriminately from an animated image to a static one video recording permits a sélection of filmed séquences and a multiple reading of the observed contexts. It helps to follow minutely the actors' activities and to show the différence between group norms and individual norms. Die Autorin stellt ein Beobachtungsmittel der sozialen Lagen dar : das Standbild. Sie beschreibt seine verschiedenen technischen und methodologischen Beschränkungen und zeigt sein Interesse für eine von der Handlungssoziologie inspirierten Erhebung. Durch die Berücksichtigung der Zeitlichkeit der Menschenhandlungen ist das Bild mehr als illustrativ und kann zum Analysemittel werden. Beim unterschiedslosen Übergehen von einem belebten zu einem statischen Bild bietet die Videoaufnahme eine Auswahl von gefilmten Bildfolgen und ein vielfaches Lesen der beobachteten Kontexten. Sie hilft dazu, den Unterschied zwischen Gruppennormen und individualen Normen hervorzuh~<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de Jean Piaget contient des éléments exemplaires pour une réflexion épisthémologique, nottamment ceux qui concernent les phases de révolution de l'intelligence humaine (intégrés à sa pratique scientifique psychologique) et ceux objectivement centrés sur l'analyse des conditions générales de la connaissance scientifique. Dans cet article, on cherche à établir un inventaire des notions les plus significatives de l'espace scientifique contemporain. Two main trends of Jean Piage's work are most important for those concerned with episthemological research — mamely his studies on the evolution of human intelligence (his scientific psychological practice) and his analysis on general conditions for scientific knowledge. This article intends to dress a first list of the most significant concepts in contemporary scientific space.<br>

Abstract: Traditional sources of sociohistorical data capture only a narrow sense of past lifeworlds. Ethnographic accounts often preserve greater details of social practice but have less clear guidelines for use as data. We evaluate the use of hermeneutical theory as providing guidelines for a method by which ethnographies may be used as sociohistorical data. Hermeneutical analysis of ethnographic "texts" is used to reconstruct patterns of daily life in early-twentieth-century rural Appalachia. This method involves: (1) concept-critique to separate observations from the theoretical framework of the ethnographic account, and (2) validation through a logic of internal consistency and comparison. Through hermeneutical analysis, ethnographics can be made to yield observations of social relations not otherwise available. Our analysis suggests benefits and drawbacks of hermeneutical analysis of ethnographic texts.<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i40048276<br>
Date: 9 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Keck Frédéric<br>
Abstract: En lisant l'œuvre de Lévy-Bruhl à travers le problème de la causalité mentale, on voit que le concept de participation, emprunté à la philosophie de Malebranche, lui permet de dépasser l'opposition entre deux conceptions : — d'une part, la « causalité naturelle » , empruntée à Tylor et à Tassociationnisme britannique, qui explique les opérations magiques par des erreurs intellectuelles ; — d'autre part, la « causalité sociale » , élaborée par Durkheim et la sociologie française, qui explique les phénomènes moraux et religieux par l'intervention de la « société » comme sujet collectif. Le concept de participation désigne un mode de causalité qui opère au niveau de l'expérience naturelle sans lui ajouter un niveau surnaturel et proprement social : « Cette analyse est comparable à celle de l'imagination chez Bergson et éclaire la réception ambivalente de Lévy-Bruhl dans la phénoménologie et dans le structuralisme. » Reading Lévy-Bruhl's work through the topic of mental causality, one sees that the concept of participation – borrowed from Malebranche's philosophy – enables him to overpass the opposition between two conceptions : — on the one hand, « natural causality », borrowed from Tylor and British associationnism, which accounts for magical operations through intellectual mistakes, and — on the other hand, « social causality », elaborated by Durkheim and French sociology, which accounts for moral and religious events through the intervention of society as a collective subject. The concept of participation refers to a mode of causality which works on the level of natural experience without adding to it a supernatural and specifically social level: « This analysis can be compared to that of imagination by Bergson, and throws a light on the ambivalent reception of Lévy-Bruhl by phenomenology and structuralism. »<br>

Author(s): Vieillard-Baron Jean-Louis<br>
Abstract: Le premier volume d'inédits de Levinas comprend un hommage à Bergson rédigé en 1946. Levinas voit en Bergson celui qui s'est opposé au temps de la science et des machines au nom du temps vécu ; ceci a rendu possible la conception heideggérienne du temps comme être. Levinas souscrit à la grande découverte de Bergson. Il souligne l'intérêt de la critique bergsonienne du néant comme être biffé, mais rejette la critique du désordre qui ne serait qu'un ordre différent ; pour lui, le désordre est le chaos préalable à tout ordre. Surtout, il voit dans la durée un temps fondamental, une diachronie première, qui rend possibles les trois dimensions du temps. Et il note que la durée est une vie que la mort ne limite pas ; le temps n'est pas la marque de notre finitude. Pour Bergson, seule la matière meurt, par manque d'énergie. Bien qu'il n'ait pas suivi la méthode bergsonienne, Levinas reconnaît la supériorité de l'analyse de la durée et la prolonge dans le sens d'un immémorial subjectif. The first volume of Levinas' unpublished texts includes a tribute paid to Bergson in 1946. Levinas considers Bergson as the philosopher who opposed the time of science and machines in the name of time experienced, and this in turn paved the way to Heidegger's concept of time as being. Levinas subscribes to that major insight of Bergson. He underlines the interest of Bergson's criticism of nothingness as « being scratched out », but rejects his criticism of disorder as but a different kind of order. For Levinas, disorder is the chaos preliminary to any kind of order. Above all, he sees in duration a fundamental time, a primary diachrony which makes possible the three dimensions of time. He remarks that duration is life not limited by death: time is not the mark of our finitude. For Bergson, matter alone dies, for lack of energy. While he does not follow Bergson's method, Levinas acknowledges the superiority of his analysis of duration and takes it further in the direction of immemorial subjec~<br>

Abstract: En 1950, Paul Ricœur publia une imposante Philosophie de la volonté, vite brocardée par la vague structuraliste et les critiques de toute « philosophie de la conscience ». On y trouve notamment une analyse du phénomène de l'hésitation qui contient bien des éléments encore pertinents. Phénomène bien connu, l'hésitation n'a pas été vraiment thématisée en tant que telle, même si, comme le montre Ricœur, l'histoire de la philosophie est susceptible d'aider à le faire. Mais le doute cartésien, par exemple, n'est guère hésitant. Ce chapitre fourmille d'analyses denses mais claires, d'allusions qu'il faut expliciter, de métaphores « vives » très riches, qui permettent de concevoir un sujet se cherchant dans l'hésitation avant de se choisir dans la décision. Il y a là un concept indispensable à toute théorie de l'action. Philosophie de la volonté (Philosophy of Will), a major work published by Ricœur in 1950, was quickly derided by members of the structuralist trend and by those critical of every single « philosophy of consciousness ». The book includes notably an analysis of the phenomenon of hesitation, many elements of which are still relevant. Although a well known phenomenon, hesitation has never been fully analyzed in itself, even though the history of philosophy, as Ricœur shows, might be helpful in such an endeavor. Cartesian doubt, for instance, shows hardly any hesitation. This chapter is replete with dense yet clear discussions, with allusions that require elucidation, and with a wealth of vivid metaphors which help us to envisage a subject in search of himself through hesitation, before choosing himself through decision. Such a concept is indispensable for any theory of action.<br>

Abstract: Three different methodologies exist to analyse data which is in the form of verbal texts. They are content analysis, the Glaser-Strauss constant comparative method of grounded theory, and text interpretation in the hermeneutic tradition. This article briefly reviews content analysis and the constant comparative method. More detailed instructions for text interpretation, for which relatively few explicit specific directions exist in the literature, are developed. The appropriate use of each methodology is discussed.<br>

Article Title: The conventions of agri-environmental practice in New Zealand: farmers, retail driven audit schemes and a new "spirit of farming"<br>
Publisher: Springer<br>

Abstract: Audit schemes dictating the parameters of environmentally and socially acceptable management practice have emerged as a pervasive feature of global agri-food production. While the impacts of such schemes on the global movement of food and fibre and the evolving terrains of power in agri-food relations are well documented, the associated reconstruction of farming identities in the localities where audits are implemented has received less attention. The emerging responses to audit schemes in the New Zealand kiwifruit and dairy sectors are key examples of the contentious nature through which auditing is incorporated within farming practice. Analysis of these responses reveals the potential for audits to alter the spirit of farming in New Zealand, initiating new conventions of interaction between producers and industries. Within a convention theory framework, the incorporation of auditing within standard management practice involves a negotiated process in which the farmers employ strategic justifications of their capability (and value) relative to the quality designations established by the audit. Rather than evaluate the relative merits of a farm, its product and its owner through the craft and skill of the independent land manager, successful farming is increasingly associated with the individual's ability to conform to an audit's structures. The global trend toward audit schemes suggests that similar challenges to the spirit of farming may be replicated in other contexts.<br>

Abstract: The issue of foundationalism and the growing irrelvance of sociological meta-theorizing to the understanding of contemporary society is considered from the perspective of postmodernism. Foundationalism is treated as a form of ideology. Changes in the analysis of ideology are discussed briefly and the postmodern approach to the critique of grand narratives, or logocentrism, is introduced. Two meta-narratives, neofunctionalism and conflict theory, are criticized as illustrative examples of logocentrism. The postmodern critique is then applied to the issue of foundationalism as recently articulated in the "Seidman controversy," which is exposed as containing hidden foundationalist implications of its own. The critique of foundationalism raises three issues that are discussed: the possibility of a deontological social theory, narrative as social inquiry, and the social role of academics as intellectuals.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: i383167<br>
Date: 4 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Wiley Douglas<br>
Abstract: This article argues for a synthesis of George Herbert Mead's conception of the temporal and intersubjective nature of the self with Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory of narrative identity. Combining the insights of Ricoeur's philosophical analysis with Mead's social-psychological orientation provides a subtle, sophisticated, and potent explanation of self-identity. A narrative conception of identity implies that subjectivity is neither a philosophical illusion nor an impermeable substance. Rather, a narrative identity provides a subjective sense of self-continuity as it symbolically integrates the events of lived experience in the plot of the story a person tells about his or her life. The utility of this conception of identity is illustrated through a rereading of Erving Goffman's study of the experience of mental patients. This example underlines the social sources of the self-concept and the role of power and politics in the construction of narrative identities.<br>

Issue: i383702<br>
Date: 2 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): ZizekAbstract: Arguing that without a differentiated and relational notion of the cultural, the social sciences would he crippled, reducing social action to notions of pure instrumentality, in this article, I trace the growth of cultural analysis from the beginnings of modern anthropology to the present as a layered set of experimental systems whose differential lenses create epistemic objects with increasing precision and differential focus and resolution. Arguing that culture is not a variable-culture is relational, it is elsewhere or in passage, it is where meaning is woven and renewed, often through gaps and silences, and forces beyond the conscious control of individuals, and yet the space where individual and institutional social responsibility and ethical struggle take place-I name culture as a set of central anthropological forms of knowledge grounding human beings' self-understandings. The challenge of cultural analysis is to develop translation and mediation tools for helping make visible the differences of interests, access, power, needs, desires, and philosophical perspective. In particular, as we begin to face new kinds of ethical dilemmas stemming from developments in biotechnologies, expansive information and image databases, and ecological interactions, we are challenged to develop differentiated cultural analyses that can help articulate new social institutions for an evolving civil society.<br>

Publisher: The Polish Sociological Association<br>
Issue: i40057457<br>
Date: 1 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): HAŁAS ELŻBIETA<br>
Abstract: Robert Morrison Maclver — Franklin Giddings' successor at the Columbia University was a leading opponent of positivism (George Lundberg), empricism (William Ogburn) and antitheoretical praxism (Robert Lynd). Maclver developed sociological theorizing along the Weberian tradition. The paper focuses on the temporality concerns of Maclver: 1) the question of distinct qualitative times, 2) the question of various temporal modes of being in the sociocultural realm, 3) temporality in social action. Maclver, unrecognized by today's symbolic interactionists, sought the implications of George H. Mead's work on time for analysis of activity as dynamic remaking of the present. The unity of the meaningful or symbolic and the temporal aspects of social pheomena was evident in the Maclver's theorizing. In consonance with the Bergsonian criticism of scientific mechanism Maclver was critical of variable-centered methodology. He analyzed the temporal modes of being of events, processes and cultural objects and focused on different ways society, history and culture enter the time process. Maclver made the temporality of actions the key issue. He should be classified as symbolic interactionist along with Florian Znaniecki and Pitirim Sorokin.<br>

Author(s): BOKSZAŃSKI ZBIGNIEW<br>
Abstract: The article begins with an analysis of the concept of identity and a description of two theoretical traditions which lie at the source of this concept and which determine the operationalisations of the identity concept within the context of social change (G.H. Mead and E. Erikson). The author then goes on to discuss the problems which evolve from the many applications of the concept of identity to analysis of collectives. The concept of collective identity is outlined and four basic ways of understanding this concept in contemporary sociology are discussed. The author refers in his presentation to the works of F. Barth, R. Turner, A. Touraine, S. N. Eisenstadt, E. Gellner, and A. Kłoskowska. The author concludes his article with several comments focusing on the relationships between social change and collective identity and he refers to those approaches which either stress the relative independence of identity formulae and social structure or even view the evolving patterns of identity as a factor contributing to social change.<br>

Publisher: The Polish Sociological Association<br>
Issue: i40057469<br>
Date: 1 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): MORAWSKI WITOLD<br>
Abstract: On the assumption that harmonization of the allocative efficiency of market, state redistributionism and the social values of solidarity and social justice is the key to successful systemic transformation, the author analyzes systemic change from the institutional perspective. Thus he is able to interpret the new systemic rules in their interaction with the environment and to interpret change in evolutionary terms. The analytic design has seven components: new rules, their intrinsic domestic sources, the need to adjust structurally to the West, environmental contingencies (values, actors and their methods of operation, public or private space, time and circumstances), the mechanisms of emergence of the new system (via establishment of new institutions, deinstitutionalization, reinstitutionalization etc.), impact of the heritage of the past, and, finally, the effectiveness of the new institutions (the state, the economy and civil society). Both in the analysis of universal challenges and the analysis of Polish problems, the author emphasizes the need to develop adaptive rationality, which he views as a superior, synthetic form of overcoming the dilemmas posed by the systemic transformation.<br>

Author(s): VarineAbstract: This ethnographic study of the creation of a museum in Le Creusot (France) provides an analysis of the heritage industry that emerged in the wake of the demise of a family company around which the town was built. This museum was a reaction to the passing of an age when industrial and urban environments were intrinsically linked. Through this description of how the past is collected and recollected in a museum, this article attempts to determine if this duty of remembrance is not, to a certain extent, a strategy of forgetfulness. Is cultural regeneration-the staging of history fading into oblivion-our society's sole response to industrial regeneration?<br>

Abstract: La xénophobie exercée à l'encontre de la communauté d'origine asiatique sur l'île de La Réunion a été exacerbée durant la Grande Guerre (1914-1918). L'analyse d'une émotion populaire en novembre 1915, sur la commune de Saint-Joseph, permet d'appréhender les sentiments d'une population en proie aux difficultés économiques et sociales. L'Asiatique devient le « Boche » , l'ennemi commun selon un inconscient collectif. In the course of the First World War, in the island of Reunion, an increase was seen in the xenophobia shown toward the Asian community. An analysis of public opinion in the township of St Joseph in November 1915 reveals the ill feeling of a population beset by social and economic difficulties. Asians became known as « Huns » , a collective subconscious turning them into the common enemy.<br>

Abstract: Diversos trabajos han señalado còmo en contextos altamente represivos el surgimiento y la continuidad del activismo no se entienden sin la intervención de fuertes elementos subjetivos, afectivos y emocionales.Este artículo participa de este enfoque con un análisis longitudinal del activismo de la primera generación de anarquistas clandestinos bajo la dictadura franquista (1939-1975). Los resultados destacan la combinación de tres factores que ayudan a explicar el sostenimiento del activismo anarquista: i) la mediación de la esperanza en la percepción de oportunidades para la movilización; ii) la movilización estratégica de la indignación en el discurso dirigido a los potenciales apoyos y participantes; y iii) el fortalecimiento de la identificación ideológica con el movimiento gracias, paradójicamente, a la represión. Las fuentes incluyen diversos materiales de archivo y testimonios de activistas. Previous research has shown that in highly repressive contexts, the emergence and continuity of activism cannot be understood without considering the role of strong subjective, affective and emotional elements.Building on this approach, this article offers a longitudinal analysis of the activism of the first generation of clandestine anarchists under Franco's dictatorship (1939-1975). The results point towards a combination of three factors that help explain the maintenance of anarchist activism. These are: i) the role of hope in the perception of opportunities for mobilization; ii) the strategic mobilization of indignation in the discourse directed at potential supporters and participants; and iii) the strengthening of the ideological identification with the movement due, paradoxically, to the effects of repression. The sources used include a range of archival material as well as activists' memoirs.<br>

Publisher: George Mason University<br>
Issue: i40058998<br>
Date: 7 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): McCormack Jo<br>
Abstract: This article examines social memories in France over the last 10 years. There has been a significant amount of 'memory work' during this period, concerning various aspects of French history, including the World Wars, but predominantly postcolonial issues: the Algerian War, the legacy of slavery, memories of Empire and memories of Immigration in particular. The 'devoir de mémoire' (duty to remember) and 'work of memory' (Paul Ricœur) have taken on greater, and controversial, proportions. While President Jacques Chirac was for some the 'président du devoir de mémoire' (President who championed the duty to remember), President Nicolas Sarkozy seems intent on ending what he sees as the trend towards 'repentance'. After a discussion of the wider memory culture in France, this article focuses on collective and social memories of the Franco-Algerian War (1954-62) Through an analysis of various 'vectors of memory' (Henry Rousso) it argues that the recent upsurge in 'memory work' in France is very much anchored in the present postcolonial social context in France. That memory work is however largely symbolic and in some ways unsatisfactory. It shows that much of the recent work of memory has been only belatedly and partially undertaken by the State, and with civil society in some ways yet to follow.<br>

Abstract: Dieser Artikel möchte eine konstruktivistische Herangehensweise zur Erforschung des Terrorismus illustrieren. Er will zeigen, wie bestimmte metaphorische Konstruktionen des »Terroristen« in den Medien bestimmte Gegenmaβnahmen ermöglichen. Basierend auf Ansätzen aus der kognitiven Linguistik führt der Beitrag eine Metaphernanalyse von Artikeln der Bild-Zeitung durch und arbeitet fünf verschiedene konzeptionelle Verständnisseheraus: »TERRORISMUS IST KRIEG«; »TERRORISMUS IST VERBRECHEN«; »TERRORISMUS IST UNZIVILISIERT UND BÖSE«; »TERRORISMUS IST EIN NATUREREIGNIS« und »TERRORISMUS IST KRANKHEIT«. Hierbei zeigt der Artikel, dass Metaphern nicht nur Realität beschreiben, sondern aktiv teilnehmen an der Konstruktion der Welt, wie wir sie sehen, über sie denken und letztendlich auf sie reagieren. Indem Metaphern Verständnisse von einem konzeptuellen Bereich wie Krieg auf andere Bereiche wie Terrorismus übertragen, lassen sie bestimmte Gegenmaβnahmen angemessen erscheinen, während sie andere Möglichkeiten der Entgegnung von vorneherein ausschlieβen. This article wants to illustrate a constructivist approach to the analysis of terrorism. It wants to show how particular metaphorical constructions of the »terrorist« in the media make certain counter-measures possible. Based on approaches in cognitive linguistics the article conducts a metaphor analysis of the Bild newspaper and illustrates five different conceptual understandings: Terrorism Is War; Terrorism Is Crime; Terrorism Is Uncivilised Evil; Terrorism Is Natural and Terrorism Is Disease. Thereby the article shows that metaphors do not only describe reality but they actively take part in the construction of the world as we see it, think of it and ultimately react to it. By projecting understandings from one conceptual area such as war to a different area such as terrorism, metaphors make certain counter measures appear appropriate while other means are placed outside of the options considered sensible.<br>

Abstract: Taking seriously Linda Martin Alcoff s suggestion that we reevaluate the extent to which poststructuralist artkuhtions of the subject are truly socially constituted, as well as the centrality of Latina identity to her own account of such constitution, I argue that the discussion Alcoff and other Latina feminists offer of the experience of being Latina in North America is illustrative of the extent to which the refotional and globally situated constitution of subjects needs further development in many social-constructionist accounts of selfhood. I argue, however — contra Alcoff — that Michel Foucault I s mode of investigating subjectivation, particularly as it is articulated in his later work, has room for just such an account, especially when it is supplemented by postcohnial theory. With this end in mind, I take as a case study the public discourse surrounding Sonia Sotomayor prior to her confirmation as the first Latina woman to serve on the United States Supreme Court, suggesting that an analysis of this discourse (including its position within and contribution to wider discourses of ethnicity, race, gender, and chss) shows why the accounts of relational subject-constitution offered by both Foucault and Alcoff are indispensable.<br>

Abstract: Individual behaviors, such as loss-coping and “grief work” are affected in organizational contexts. In everything pertaining to coping with trauma in general, and loss more particularly, the individual is “trapped” within a political psychology that enforces the habitus and expectations of institutional dominance on the ostensibly intimate and private response. Regimes have perceived bereavement over battlefield deaths as a form of social capital that can be mobilized to enhance national loyalty and political support. Employing both existential/hermeneutic and institutional analysis, this study examines three diachronic models of bereavement — hegemonic, political and civil — and their political ramifications in the Israeli context.Drawing on changing parental conceptual orientations towards fallen sons and their role as cultural and ideological agents in public sphere, the article traces the movement of bereavement from its capture by the hegemonic state institutions to its creations under the domination of others institutions: political and civic and ultimate use in critiquing the political and military echelon. The article indicates the powerful impact of the social institutional-organizational context on the intimate-psychological context of coping with loss, by illustrating this phenomenon in the Israeli society.<br>

Abstract: Los estudios sociales sobre alimentación y las autoridades responsables de este campo coinciden en resaltar la situación paradójica del comensal actual: se sabe cómo se debe comer pero no se come como se debe. Enfrentarse con éxito a las paradojas suele requerir un cierto distanciamiento —lingüístico y disciplinar— que ofrezca la suficiente perspectiva. Aquí se propone hacerlo desde la perspectiva histórica que una sociología de la utopía puede aportar al conflicto entre imaginarios alimentarios. Para ello, este artículo revisará los elementos comunes del pensamiento utópico/distópico en orden a extraer las categorías de mayor interés para un análisis sociológico de las políticas y comportamientos alimentarios. Después, recorreremos los modos en que algunas de las utopías clásicas han enfocado —o desenfocado— la cuestión de la comida e intentaremos sacar algunas conclusiones. Social studies on food and nutritional authorities coincide in emphasizing the paradoxical situation of the modern eater: people know how they should eat but do not eat as they should. Dealing with paradoxes successfully usually requires a certain —linguistic and disciplinary— distance to gain sufficient perspective. We suggest this should be done from the historical perspective that a sociology of utopia offers on the conflict between food imaginaries. To this end, we outline the common elements of utopian/dystopian thought in order to extract the categories of major interest for a sociological analysis of food policies and eating behaviours. Subsequently, we trace the ways in which some classical utopias and dystopias have focused on —or blurred— the question of food and we try to draw some conclusions.<br>

Abstract: Françoise de Graffigny's mid-eighteenth-century play Phaza features a main character who is unknowingly crossed dressed as male. The text provides a rich starting point for exploring questions of gender identity and performance. This article situates Phaza within the fairy-tale tradition in which women authors played a major role. Its analysis draws upon philosophies of narrative identity and theories of gender to show that identity comprises both permanence and performance. Reading Graffigny can make an important difference in our understanding of gender, authorship, and relations between the sexes in Enlightenment France. Phaza's masquerade sheds light on the ways in which women authors of the era approached and assumed various gender identities. Eighteenth-century texts like Phaza reveal a lineage of ideas that continue to influence feminist thought today and will do so in the future.<br>

Abstract: L'article présente un regard comparatif sur les modalités d'agrandissement de la cause environnementale en France et en Russie depuis des usages locaux. En suivant de près la formation progressive des collectifs écologiques, nous mettons en lumière les exigences qui pèsent sur la transformation de l'environnement de proximité, mais aussi sur celle des personnes en êtres publics. Nous appréhendons les tensions qui accompagnent ce mouvement, les vacillements et basculements entre les attachements locaux et engagements publics, ainsi que les tentatives politiques de laisser place, voire de mettre en valeur au sein-même du format public, les relations personnelles et attaches familières. Cette démarche nous permet de porter un regard symétrique et nuancé sur les cas étudiés et de rendre compte des difficultés et obstacles qui jalonnent le chemin de l'apprentissage de l'exercice démocratique. The article presents two scenarios of development of the environmental cause in France and Russia. Starting with familiar environmental uses and personal engagements in the immediate environment, we follow the formation of environmentalist groups with public status. The essay analyzes local evolutions from personal attachment to public commitment, and efforts to gather appropriate equipment and devices for such apprenticeship. We pay attention to the switching back and forth between personal links and public commitment, as well as to political attempts to make room for personal environmental uses. This approach, based on a subtle symmetrical analysis of the cases under study, aims to produce an account of the plurality of human engagements in their dynamics and at clarifying difficulties and tensions these experiences imply.<br>

Author(s): Waistell Jeff<br>
Abstract: This study investigates how business leaders dynamically narrate their aspirational ethical leadership identities. In doing so, it furthers understanding of ethical leadership as a process situated in time and place. The analysis focuses on the discursive strategies used to narrate identity and ethics by ethnic Chinese business leaders in Indonesia after their conversion to Pentecostal-charismatic Christianity. By exploring the use of metaphor, our study shows how these business leaders discursively deconstruct their 'old' identities and construct their 'new' aspirational identities as ethical leaders. This leads to the following contributions. First, we show that ethical leadership is constructed in identity talk as the business leaders actively narrate aspirational identities. Second, the identity narratives of the business leaders suggest that ethical leadership is a context-bound and situated claim vis-à-vis unethical practice. Third, we propose a conceptual template, identifying processes of realisation and inspiration followed by significant shifts in understanding, for the study of aspirational ethical leadership.<br>

Issue: i40072033<br>

Author(s): Keller Reiner<br>
Abstract: The article presents the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse (SKAD). SKAD, which has been in the process of development since the middle of the 1990s, is now a widely used framework among social scientists in discourse research in the German-speaking area. It links arguments from the social constructionist tradition, following Berger and Luckmann, with assumptions based in symbolic interactionism, hermeneutic sociology of knowledge, and the concepts of Michel Foucault. It argues thereby for a consistent theoretical and methodological grounding of a genuine social sciences perspective on discourse interested in the social production, circulation and transformation of knowledge, that is in social relations and politics of knowledge in the so-called 'knowledge societies'. Distancing itself from Critical Discourse Analysis, Linguistics, Ethnomethodology inspired discourse analysis and the Analysis of Hegemonies, following Laclau and Mouffe, SKAD's framework has been built up around research questions and concerns located in the social sciences, referring to public discourse and arenas as well as to more specific fields of (scientific, religious, etc.) discursive struggles and controversies around "problematizations" (Foucault).<br>

Issue: i40074891<br>

Author(s): Viljoen Martina<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on the philosopher Christopher Norris's critique of the way in which the New Musicology deploys Jacques Derrida's much-celebrated (and equally much-abused) notion of deconstruction, as well as Paul de Man's lesser-known writings (in the musicological field) on aesthetic ideology. The implications of Norris's critique for a case study from the South African art music repertoire, Arnold van Wyk's Missa in illo tempore, are examined, demonstrating how three diverging readings of the work, resulting in three different hermeneutic outcomes, promulgate notions of a hypernormative contextualism which might frame, and even override musical interpretation. Prošlo je više od trideset godina od kada je Joseph Kerman (1980.) prvi osporio glazbenu analizu kao disciplinary postupak u svojem članku »Kako da uđemo u analizu i kako da iz nje izađemo« (»How we got into analysis and how to get out«). Njegovo kanonsko djelo Contemplating Music (1985.), objavijeno pet godina kasnije, upućuje na to da Kerman ne zagovara istraživački postupak niti samo kao kompilaciju relevantnih povijesnih činjenica niti kao opis i dokumentiranje formalnih unutarnjih odnosa u nekom glazbenom djelu. On se prije zalaže za analitički pristup koji će se baviti ne samo formalnim sadržajem nekog djela ili njegovim neposrednim ili prethodnim povijesno-referentnim okvirom, nego i aspektima afekta i ekspresije, znacenja glazbe i kulturnog konteksta unutar kojega je proizvedeno i prihvaceno. Takozvana Nova muzikologija pojavila se unutar takve antiformalističke klime. Izvan je opsega ovoga članka raspravljati raznim pristupima koji su se tijekom posljedja tri desetljeća pojavili pod zastavom Nove muzikologije. Stoga će se fokusirati na pojam interdisciplinarnosti kako ga se upotrebaljava u Novoj muzikologiji. I još uže, rasprava se koncentrira na filozofa Christopher Norhsa i njegovu kritiku načina na koji Nova muzikologija razvija proslavljeni (i jednako tako mnogo zloupotrebljavani) pojam de~<br>

Abstract: Cognitive semantics postulates that specific mental mechanisms belonging to the human imagination, namely metaphorical and metonymical mappings, are involved in semantic changes. Nevertheless, a thorough examination reveals the weakness of this theory. I therefore advocate a radically different analysis which allows us to do without these postulated cognitive mechanisms. Systematizing Meillet's observations about the role of « discontinuity in transmission » in semantic change, I propose, for each case studied, to look for what circumstances in collective experience can make the discrepancy between the new and the former meaning imperceptible to the speakers themselves. I argue that a semantic change at its decisive moment must most often perform in a covert way, without its instigators' knowledge. The efficiency and heuristic fruitfulness of this method is illustrated in this paper by the study of certain Latin polysemous words expressing not only a physical bond but also a juridical obligation (obligare, obligatio, nectere, obstringere, solvere, absolvere).<br>

Abstract: The construction of a meta-discourse in order to describe interior monologues (IM) cuts across narratologic and linguistic approaches. It varies according to whether the purpose is to establish a typology based on their wider representation or to provide a linguistic analysis restricted to reported speech. The paper highlights the persistent under-rating of a phenomenon close to the IM, and related to the "unspeakable sentence", that of "the point of view". The represented "point of view" and the free indirect speech have coexisted since the second half of the 19th. However, unlike as in the IM, these forms are not clearly differentiated as dual forms of the expression of the inner speech. Consequently, inner speech (at least as a theory issued from literary experience) is reduced to the relatively homogeneous form of the "interior speech" or "flow of consciousness". But this representation is under the influence of enormous tensions as literary manifestations of inner speech are more varied than the phrase IM gives to understand.<br>

Abstract: This paper is about the analysis of the written production of argumentative discourse. Thanks to the technique of collective writing it is possible to observe the process of discourse production. Declarative, strategic and procedural abilities of two non native adults are successively analyzed and compared periodically to those of two young native speakers. This study focuses on only two levels : global and interphrasal organisation of discourse. The organisation of debates in class so as to bring students to build argumentative concepts and help them in their approach of texts (reading and writing) shows the limits of a didactic scheme which relies on oral language practice for the elaboration of written texts.<br>

Abstract: O artigo procura discutir a contribuição da perspectiva antropológica para a análise de conflitos, contrastando a ênfase da Antropologia na pesquisa empírica com a orientação predominantemente doutrinária que caracteriza o Direito. Dialogando com textos de repercussão significativa na Antropologia do Direito, o artigo realça a importância da dimensão simbólica dos direitos, caracterizada como aspecto central do universo empírico investigado, e sem a qual demandas por direitos, acordos e decisões judiciais não podem ser adequadamente compreendidos. The article makes a brief assessment of the contribution of Anthropology's perspective to the analysis of conflicts, contrasting Anthropology's emphasis in empirical research with the doctrinarian approach that predominates in Law. Drawing on significant texts in the Anthropology of Law, the article highlights the symbolic dimension of rights, characterized as a core aspect of empirical data, and without which demands for rights, judicial agreements and decisions cannot be adequately understood.<br>

Abstract: Can the act of creation itself be considered like an infinite forgiveness that God turns to the earth and to those who live there after having preferred the waters as his place of first existence? The conference "In the beginning it was the forgiveness" held in L'Aquila in the occasion of a pluriconfessional meeting, suggests some hypothesis starting even from some biblical episodes like: the universal deluge, the Amalek's remembering, Giuseppe and his brothers, Isaac's sacrifice, and furthermore with Moses' death, to end with the forgiveness from the original sin through the entrance in the promise land. A suggestive analysis of the forgiveness in the Hebraism, seen too often as a pure religion of the contraposition law to the forgiveness given from the religion of love.

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>

Author(s): Voloshinov Michelle Z.<br>
Abstract: I begin by introducing the Ilongots and some of their attitudes toward speech. Whereas most modern theorists think of language as a tool designed primarily to "express" or to "refer," Ilongots think of language first in terms of action. They see commands as the exemplary act of speech, displaying less concern for the subjective meanings that an utterance conveys than for the social contexts in which utterances are heard. An ethnographic sketch thus outlines how Ilongots think of words and how their thought relates to aspects of their practice -- providing an external foil for theorists found closer to home. Speech Act Theory is discussed and questioned first on internal grounds, as an approach that recognizes but slights important situational and cultural constraints on forms of language use. A consideration of the application of Searle's taxonomy of acts of speech to Ilongot categories of language use then leads to a clarification of the individualistic and relatively asocial biases of his essentially intra-cultural account. Last, I return to Ilongot directives. A partial analysis of Ilongot acts of speech provides the basis for a statement of the ways in which indigenous categories are related to the forms that actions take, as both of these, in turn, reflect the sociocultural ordering of local worlds.<br>

Abstract: This article explores kwaito's early years by focusing on South African music legend Brenda Fassie. While Fassie is not usually known as a kwaito artist, her "bubblegum" music of the 1980s was hugely influential on later kwaito musicians, and in the early 1990s Fassie recorded several tracks that arguably fall under the category of kwaito. An analysis of Fassie's life and music does not represent a clear break with earlier South African music. I attempt a more nuanced historicization of kwaito in this article, and seek to uncover continuities as well as ruptures in the post-apartheid period.<br>

Abstract: Carlo Ginzburg, in 1988, considered present historiography as beholden to a regimen of truth by quotation that had distanced itself from the task of making the past present to make it believable, a position he was to nuance; but the distinction between the two modes is a valid one for analyzing the writing of history -if analysis reveals their intertwining in ways that ultimately open out onto the relationship between history and fiction, whose history is still not told. En 1988 Carlo Ginzburg considérait que l'historiographie moderne se soumettait à un régime de la preuve par la citation documentaire qui l'éloignait de la tâche de rendre l'histoire présente pour la rendre crédible ; s'il devait plus tard nuancer cela, la distinction constitue une entrée valide pour analyser l'écriture de l'histoire - si l'analyse révèle plutôt leur imbrication selon des modes qui ouvrent sur le rapport entre fiction et histoire, dont l'histoire reste à faire.<br>

Abstract: S'appuyant sur un corpus de textes adolescents adressés au site Internet www.filsantejeunes.com, notre analyse tente de cerner le problème de l'indicibilité du sensible, puisque la plupart de ces textes se limitent à élaborer un discours sur le corps, ses difficultés à être la source de bien-être, à se conformer aux normes de beauté, et n'abordent pas le phénomène, l'expérience de perception du monde. La théorie des instances proposée par Jean-Claude Coquet permet de rendre compte de cette impossibilité de dire le sensible, laquelle serait due à une mise en tension conflictuelle des deux instances du non-sujet et du sujet. Ce conflit sans issue peut aboutir à des comportements de boulimie et/ou d'anorexie, aux conséquences graves pour la santé, voire la vie du sujet. La psychothérapie, dans ces cas-là, devrait viser une réconciliation des instances. Ces textes adolescents constituant des exemples d'écriture autobiographique, genre discursif très prisé à l'adolescence, permettent aussi de contribuer à l'analyse de la genèse de ce genre littéraire, où s'impose la reprise différée, par le sujet adulte voire vieillissant, d'expériences anciennes de l'instance non-sujet, expériences corporelles de prise directe avec le monde. This analysis, based on a corpus of texts by teenagers posted on www.filsantejeunes. com, tries to take the measure of the issue of the impossibility of expressing in language the experience of sensing the world -since most of these texts are content to limit themselves to elaborating discourses about the body, its difficulties at being a source of happiness, at conforming to norms of beauty, and do not deal with the phenomenon, namely the experience of perceiving the world. The theory of instances, or of the grounding of utterance, elaborated by Jean-Claude Coquet, can explain this impossibility of expressing in language the experience of sensing the world: it is due to a conflict between the two instances, the grounding in the subject or in the no~<br>

Abstract: En explicitant le concept linguistique de prédicat et en étendant sa portée, l'auteur introduit et définit celui de « prédicat somatique », responsable de l'expression du sensible dans le langage. Il en illustre la pertinence et en spécifie le contenu analytique à travers trois exemples. La reprise critique de l'analyse du « sein nu » dans Palomar d'I. Calvino par A. J. Greimas (dans De l'imperfection) permet de dégager les propriétés du « corps percevant ». L'analyse d'un énoncé de la mère de Jamel Debbouze dans Télérama fait ressortir l'expression corporelle d'une vérité « refoulée, proscrite, par le langage », un « ça » vrai, expression d'un non-sujet immanent. Enfin, la relation fondamentale entre « l'acte politique » et « le corps parlant » est dégagée à partir de positions exprimées par Jean-Claude Milner et ici analysées dans la perspective du « prédicat somatique », dont trois variétés se trouvent ainsi dégagées au terme de l'article. Developing and extending the validity of the linguistic concept of predicate, the author introduces and defines the notion of "somatic predicate", responsible for expressing in language the experience of the senses. Three examples both show the notion's pertinence and specify its content. A critical reappraisal of A. J. Greimas' analysis of the « naked breast » in Italo Calvino's Palomar (in De l'imperfection) leads to defining me characteristics of the « perceiving body ». The analysis of an utterance of Jamel Debbouze's mother in Télérama stresses the physical, bodily expression of a truth "repressed, prohibited, by language", a true "id", the expression of an immanent non-subject. Finally, the fundamental relation between the "political act" and the "speaking body" is shown through opinions expressed by Jean-Claude Milner which are here analysed from the perspective of a "somatic predicate", three varieties of which have thus been described and defined by the end of the article.<br>

Abstract: The analysis of narrative processes and metaphorical language are the topics generally focused on by business ethics researchers interested in the work of Paul Ricœur. Yet his work on political questions also applies to the ethical issues associated with organizations. Ricœur's ethical enterprise can be expressed as a triad composed of ideological, deontological, and sapiential levels, associating ostensibly opposing positions of Aristotelian and Kantian origin. In this study, I examine politics, economics, and ethics in their dialectic relation as established by Ricœur. Against a vertical, mechanistic, and axiologically neutral vision of management, he opposes the two conceptual pairs of conviction/imagination and ideology/utopia as well as a superior definition of justice associating reciprocal indebtedness and mutual disinterestedness. Through this analysis, it becomes clear that the vertical, hierarchical nature of politics tends to undermine the horizontal interactions necessary to procure just institutions in society. And any business ethic that does not acknowledge political tensions will be mute. What is needed instead is practical wisdom that is developed through interaction, and often through conflict, involving all the different players.<br>

Abstract: This paper considers how companies use their own mass communication media to create, with the aid of metaphors, a legitimizing image of their practices. The analysis is based on the example of two banks, both of which undertook massive staff and cost reductions between 2001 and 2003. Downsizing measures like theirs are often met with resistance if they conflict with the interests, values or worldviews of stakeholders. Companies approach this threat of resistance by building a linguistic façade of legitimacy that suggests conformity with prevailing ideas of good or correct managerial conduct. Our metaphor analysis, which covers all publicly accessible texts of the two banks' own mass communication, identifies nine metaphoric concepts, which we further condense into three persuasive meta concepts: concealing metaphor, euphemistic metaphor, and urgency and control metaphor each fulfil different persuasive functions and vary systematically according to the conditions surrounding the managerial practice.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur vise à scruter le fondement de l'éthique en opposant la conception éthique de Paul Ricoeur à celle de deux de ses prédécesseurs, Émile Durkheim et Henri Bergson. Il montre comment Ricœur a défini la notion de raison pratique qui se distingue radicalement de toute science, et comment il a développé son éthique sans vision de l'évolution biologique et anthropologique. Grâce à Aristote et en passant par Kant, il a montré, dans Soi-même comme un autre (1990), le rôle éthique de la narrativité dans la formation de l'identité personnelle et de la responsabilité. The author proposes an analysis of the foundation of ethics by opposing Paul Ricoeur's conception of ethics to that of two of his predecessors, Émile Durkheim et Henri Bergson. He shows how Ricœur has defined the notion of practical reason as radically different from any science, and how he has developed his ethics in independence from considerations related to biological and anthropological evolution. In Oneself as Another (1990), on the basis of Aristotle and reformulated in relation to Kantian principles, he has demonstrated the role of ethics and narration in the formation of personal identity and responsibility.<br>

Abstract: La présente étude se consacre à un examen du concept de la mémoire collective en s'interrogeant sur l'interprétation que Paul Ricœur propose de ce concept dans son ouvrage La mémoire, l'histoire, l'oubli. L'auteur présente une lecture critique de l'interprétation de la mémoire collective chez Ricœur là ou Ricœur tente de comprendre ce phénomène par analogie avec la mémoire personnelle et risque, selon cette lecture, d'occulter les dimensions de la mémoire collective qui échappent à un tel rapport analogique. L'auteur tente alors de dépasser le cadre de cette analogie par une analyse des sources symboliques et métapersonnelles de la mémoire collective. This study examines the concept of collective memory through an investigation of Paul Ricœur's interpretation of this concept in his work, La mémoire, l'histoire, l'oubli. In presenting a critical reading of the analogy Ricoeur establishes between collective and personal memory, the author argues that this analogy risks excluding those dimensions of collective memory which cannot be comprehended through such an analogy. The attempt is then made to surmount this difficulty through an analysis of collective memory in relation to its symbolic and metapersonal sources.<br>

Abstract: Le but de notre article est d'essayer de montrer en quoi l'expérience rédactionnelle et éditoriale de l'Histoire socialiste de la Révolution française fut pour Jaurès, hormis le prétexte pédagogique évident pour préparer les dirigeants à l'unité du mouvement socialiste encore divisé et pour éduquer politiquement les militants et le prolétariat, l'occasion d'affiner sa réflexion sur une future « méthode socialiste », à la veille de l'unité de 1905. Parce que « la Révolution française contient le socialisme tout entier », quels sont donc les événements que Jaurès juge les plus pertinents et les plus féconds pour l'avenir socialiste de la société et de l'État ? Rappelant le contexte et les conditions de cette grande entreprise, nous nous sommes attachés à retrouver ce qui fonde philosophiquement sa démarche et ses analyses historiques - spécialement au cours du « moment thermidorien » - à partir de sa méthode philosophique adossée à sa métaphysique de l'unité de l'être. Une esquisse, en somme, de l'analyse critique jaurésienne de la « dictature jacobine » et de l'esprit révolutionnaire de Robespierre conditionnant le socialisme réformiste gradualiste de Jaurès. The article attempts to show how the writing and editing of the Socialist History of the French Revolution was for Jaurès not merely a self-evident pretext to enlighten others, unify the still divided leaders of the socialist movement and educate politically the party faithful and the proletariat, but also an opportunity to finetune his reflections on a future « socialist methodology » on the eve of the union of 1905. Given that « the French Revolution contains socialism in its entirety », what then were the events that Jaurès thought most relevant and fruitful for the socialist future of society and state ? While recalling the context and conditions of this great venture, our aim has been to retrieve the philosophical essence of his historical approach and analysis, especially during the « moment of Thermidor »~<br>

Abstract: En croisant les approches contemporaines sur la traduction, l'histoire culturelle et l'histoire des idées, l'article cherche à comprendre la signification politique et les enjeux rhétoriques de la traduction des textes républicains de la première Révolution anglaise autour de 1789. Le but est de dépasser l'analyse en termes d'influence d'une tradition, pour s'intéresser à la transmission et au contexte de réception des textes, c'est-à-dire à l'agenda politique et au projet traductif des auteurs dans un état donné de la langue. Comment ces textes s'insèrent-ils dans le contexte intellectuel et les conventions argumentatives du moment révolutionnaire? Dans quelle mesure ces traductions ont-elles été des outils de l'innovation politique? L'interprétation du traducteur éclaire le contexte qui les a inspirées et le processus de transfert et de réception des idées et du vocabulaire. Sur l'horizon d'attente de 1789, le bonheur de la traduction dépend moins de la fidélité à l'original que de la manière de rendre l'esprit du texte et sa force illocutoire pour traduire les idées en actes. By combining contemporary approaches to translation, cultural history and the history of ideas, this article seeks to understand the political meanings and the rhetorical issues involved in the translation of republican texts of the first English Revolution in the French Revolution of 1789. The aim is to go beyond an analysis of the influence of a tradition to concentrate on the transmission and reception of the texts - that is, on the political agenda and their translation. How were these texts incorporated in the intellectual context and in the argumentative conventions of the revolutionary moment? To what degree were these translations the tools of political innovation? The particular interpretation of a translator does much to clarify the context that inspired his translations and illuminates the process of the transfer and reception of ideas and vocabulary.

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>
Issue: i388794<br>
Date: 3 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Wilson Henrik<br>
Abstract: A theory of the embodiment of action is proposed. Reflections on relations between human intentions, the human body and the notion of agency lead us to argue that phenomenological analysis is not sufficient for such a theory. Our consideration, that the most fundamental level of embodied agency is that of life itself, brings us to the philosophy of biology and the theory of the organism: briefly, certain parts of the natural environment are intrinsic to the constitution of organisms and, in their more sophisticated configuration, as agents. Action is embodied in the sense that certain physiological processes are internal in relation to it and play a constitutive role in its performance. The way in which environment, context and consciousness affect and constitute the nature of agency at personal and sub-personal levels is elaborated. We see that human agents perceive and act upon their world through a complex shifting between those levels. A summary of the ways in which the social sciences can be enriched by this more comprehensive view of human agency provides the basis of justification for claiming Actor-Network Theory (ANT), originally developed by sociologists studying science and technology, as a promising framework for the continuation of this reasoning.<br>

Abstract: Norbert Elias never presented his views regarding collective memory in a systematic manner. However, his approach may be reconstructed on the basis of such works as The Civilizing Process, Time: An Essay and The Symbol Theory. The most important tenet of Elias is that human memory can only be explained by the symbol theory. Human ability to use socially created symbols in communication is applied in activities in which symbols are used (speaking, thinking, knowing and remembering), which makes memory a part of general process of symbolic communication. Memory research needs to account for the interactive and communicational origins of both individual and collective remembering. One of the crucial issues related to remembering is collective forgetting. According to Elias it operates by three main mechanisms: (1) elimination and creation of fantastic notions (fantasy being a substitute and subsidiary for experience), (2) modification of social canons of reference as a result of power struggle in social figurations, and (3) delegitimization of alternative imageries by means of marginalization or elimination of groups acting as their social vehicles. I discuss these mechanisms and the dynamics of memory they entail in the broader conceptual framework of the theory of civilizing processes referring to Central and Eastern European examples in order to demonstrate the productivity of Elias's interdisciplinary and multidimensional analysis in social memory studies focusing this region.<br>

Abstract: The goal of this article is to review the possibilities and limitations of applying Aleida and Jan Assmann's concept to the study of local memory, using as an example the memory of inhabitants of the Polish town of Olsztyn. The author first briefly presents selected key premises of Aleida and Jan Assmann's concept of cultural memory. She then addresses the question of how the Assmanns' concept is received and interpreted in Poland. Discussion of these issues leads to an analysis of the advantages and difficulties of applying the two German scholars' theoretical proposals to the study of memory in local communities. The author refers to the case of a moderately aggregated, urban society with a complicated multiethnic past. Her conclusions concern the challenges scholars face in adopting Aleida and Jan Assmann's theoretical perspective for studying memory and local communities in this part of Europe.<br>

Abstract: This article deals with the problem of text and ¡ mage in contemporary art, as exemplified in a photograph by Jeff Wall called The Storyteller (1986). This image is analysed, taking as reference Manet's Déjeuner sur l'herbe as well as Walter Benjamin's essay of 1936 on the subject of the narrator. The main points in this comparative analysis are the role of the narrator both in text and image, oral tradition versus visual space, the concept of the picture and the tradition of story representation. The author proposes the idea that modernity introduced a major change in the art of storytelling and in the narrative function of image.<br>

Abstract: The article presents an analysis of the concept of „subject“ in ethnography from its historical origins through its development over the span of the 20th century. Furthermore, based on her own experience of different cultures, the author conføonts the implicit Western philosophical background in anthropological conceptualisations of the subject and the ethnographic research with alternative philosophical frameworks, specifically the reflexive approach developed by female anthropologists. The main focus of the text lies on a re-conceptualisation of the ethnographic research as an inter-subjective process, and on a new emphasis on the role of the subject in the culture-productive processes of symbolic negotiation.<br>

Abstract: The study ’The meaning of action, the action of meaning’ raises the theoretical question of the relationship between the intent and meaning, the self-referentiality and referentiality of the literary text. It sets out from the hypothesis that a literary text has not only a self-referential, but also a referential character. Unlike non-literary texts whose function is their intent, the referentiality of a literary text is open. The ambiguity and polysemy of the text then results from the non-obviousness of reality itself. The concept that captures this difference between literary texts and texts with other functions is that of meaning. The study uses the concrete example of the thematicisation of the metamorphosis of a puppet, a monster or an animal into a man in Kleist, Collodi and Grass to illustrate the difference between mechanical intent founded upon efficiency and living meaning, founded on ambiguity and non-functional complexity. An analysis of Pavel Vilikovský’s novel Kôn na poschodí, slepec vo Vrábroch (’Horse Upstairs, Blind Man in Vráble’) shows how, in its thematic, ostentatiously self-referential action, meaning is born as an expression of the polysemic re fe re n tia lity of the text. The analy sis shows that behind this self-referentiality the text is also created in the referential action of meaning to such an extent that it is precisely the open action of meaning which becomes the r » on-obvious sense of the action of the text.<br>

Abstract: The study deals with the problem of Stephen Greenblatt's approaches to an analysis of literary work. The author analyzes Greenblatt's concepts of interpretation of literary work and notices the dangerous results of such interpretations in which literary work as a specifical esthetical object is dissolved in the wide frame of cultural history. On the other hand, he tries to represent how Greenblatt's looking for historical context via permanent negotiation with the texts and reading of textual traces can enriches the work of literary historian.<br>

Abstract: In the twentieth century the phenomenon of the subjective body was integrated into ontology in philosophy, moving from Phenomenology to Existentialism. The rediscovery of the body and affect as a way of thinking also led contemporary cognitive science to the topic of the relationship between emotion and cognition, to the necessity of expanding the model of the mind and of experiencing emotions and physical sensation. The extension of the explanatory possibilities of a scholarly metalanguage into the area of the emotions and physical sensation is also important for the analysis of the acoustic aspect of lyric verse. In the acoustic flow of verse, the sounds of language have, apart from a phonemic function, their own sensuous (emotional) effect of the articulating body. In literary studies so far the acoustic flow has been interpreted only at the segmental level as a sequence of phonemes or sounds (for example in constructs of acoustic succession, phonetic instrumentation, or phonetic composition). At the suprasegmental level the acoustic flow must be conceived of as a sequence of syllables, a sequence of articulated phonations, the semantic movement of the phonemic flow. A syllable has no semantic value, but does have an experiential form, which influences motivation, behaviour, and experience. In addition to sonic and tonal modulation at the suprasegmental level, qualitative modulation, modulation of timbre, and the sequences of tones and of noise are also employed. In modelling the semantic movement of syllables in a phonemic flow the methodological approaches of experimental psychosemantics have been used. Connotational objectivization took place in three dimensions that were polarized on the basis of domestic and alien, light and darkness, activity and passivity, and research was conducted with a sample of 2,800 respondents. The analysis of the acoustic side of lyric verse would be incomplete if in addition to accentual rhythm and melody we did not also consider ~<br>

Abstract: S'il déclame contre les deux principes qui sont ceux de Descartes, Sartre se réclame pourtant de lui. Sans doute n'est-il pas à un paradoxe près. Reste qu'il nous faudra ne pas l'être moins pour expliquer le sien. Car certes, le sens du texte qu'il intitule « La liberté cartésienne » et qui articule ce volume de morceaux choisis qu'est Descartes 1596-1650 confère quelque cohérence à cet apparent non-sens. Mais une fois présenté de cette oeuvre le paratexte, il nous faudra affirmer non seulement que celle-ci se lit avant L'être et le néant quoiqu'elle ait été publiée après, mais, plus encore, qu'elle est un ensemble d'écrits de Descartes sur Sartre quoiqu'elle soit un écrit de Sartre sur Descartes. C'est qu'outre l'analyse sartrienne des analyses cartésiennes de la Méditation quatrième, on y trouve une psychanalyse existentielle par l'auteur de son devancier, à l'occasion de laquelle a lieu non pas un transfert, mais un contre-transfert. Although Sartre denounces Descartes' two principles, he nevertheless draws inspiration from him. No doubt this is close to being paradoxical; we shall have to be no less paradoxical in our explanation. For although the text entitled "Cartesian Freedom," which introduces a volume of selections from Descartes, Descartes 1596Ί650, confers some coherence on this apparent non-sense, once the texts surrounding this work have been taken into account, we have to conclude not only that this text predates Beinjj and Nothingness, even though it was published afterwards, but that it is a collection of Descartes' writings on Sartre, even though it is a writing by Sartre on Descartes. For beyond the Sartrean analysis of the Cartesian analyses of the Fourth Meditation, we find Sartre's existential psychoanalysis of his predecessor, in which takes place not a transference, but a counter-transference.<br>

Abstract: In view of the pluralism of current exegetical methodologies, constant recourse is had to models for interpretation of texts, be these more ancient stages of the text, as in historical-critical exegesis, or schemes of a logical character as in structural exegesis. What advantages does the use of a model offer to interpretation? With the analysis limited to a narrative text, an examination of the contribution from the philosophy of history (H.-I. Marrou), from epistemology (K. R. Popper), and from philosophical hermeneutics (H.-G. Gadamer,), helps to see in the logical dimension of the different models, the source of their interpretative power. At the hermeneutical level this opens up a perspective of unity in the exegetical methodologies.<br>

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Abstract: This study is concerned with the method and results of an empirical research project called’ Regional Topics and the Understanding of Region: Research into Reception of Literature in Silesia and North Moravia’, which took place in May 1998. The starting point was an attempt to summarize the predominant approaches to regionalism, the particular nature of a region, and the predominant forms of Communication in regional Communication in the arts and in society in general. The chosen method of asking the questions and the results of the quantitative analysis have been received with a certain degree of scepticism, though a comparison with some of the signs and features discovered in similar research in 1982-4 is not without interest. The entire matter, however, has taken on a new form and cannot be looked at in isolation.<br>

Abstract: This paper argues that the analysis of culture and mass communication should be regarded as central concerns of sociology and social theory. It develops a framework for the analysis of culture and shows how this framework can be applied to the study of mass communication. Focusing on the medium of television, the paper highlights some of the distinctive characteristics of mass communication and examines some of the factors involved in the production, construction and reception of media messages. It is argued that this approach enables the analyst to pose questions concerning the ideological character of mass communication in a new and more fruitful way.<br>

Abstract: The public/private debate has not been a major feature in recent sociological theory. However; Bailey (2000) has argued for a renewed sociological research programme to focus on the sociological private. He outlines three dimensions of this: intimate relationships, the self and the unconscious. This article seeks to address two of these dimensions, the production of self-theories and unconscious disavowal. We extend this theorizing to account for the experience of sexual engagement present a discourse analysis of the diaries of the comedian and actor Kenneth Williams (1928-1988). Drawing principally on the thought of Merleau-Ponty (1962) we argue that our analysis demonstrates the importance of a prereflective engagement with the social world that is then reflected on in internal dialogue. We show how discourse analysis may be used to demonstrate the discursive production of a self-theory and the role of such a self-theory in the disavowal of the principal's pre-reflective engagement with others.<br>

Abstract: This article is based on a cross-national qualitative study of homeless and street-involved youth living within Olympic host cities. Synthesizing a Lefebvrian spatial analysis with Debord's concept of 'the spectacle', the article analyses the spatial experiences of homeless young people in Vancouver (host to the 2010 Winter Olympics) and draws some comparisons to London (host to the 2012 Summer Olympics). Tracing encounters with police, gentrification and Olympic infrastructure, the article assesses the experiences of homeless youth in light of claims made by Olympic proponents that the Games will 'benefit the young'. By contrast, the authors argue that positive Olympic legacies for homeless and street-involved young people living within host cities are questionable.<br>

Issue: i40108742<br>
Date: 5 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Newton Tim<br>
Abstract: This paper links the ideas of Norbert Elias to the conceptualisation of power and subjectivity that has developed in British industrial and organisational (I/O) sociology. It examines the relevance of power and subjectivity to British I/O sociology and reviews theoretical positions that have influenced this field. Elias's work is examined in some detail, exploring his approach to power, agency, the self, individualisation and discourse. His work is then applied to a re-examination of the perspectives on power and subjectivity contained within labour process, Foucauldian and actor network theory. The paper attempts to show how Elias's work re-frames our understanding of power and subjectivity through a stress on interdependencies and their asymmetry, the 'networked' nature of agency, and the interwoven form of human and socio-political development. It argues that Eliasian analysis maintains the critical concern with power asymmetries witnessed in labour process theory, yet avoids some of the difficulties in conceptualisation of power and subjectivity that are apparent in labour process, Foucauldian work and actor network theory. Elias's work also illustrates the need for a lengthier historical perspective than is typically observed in industrial and organisational sociology, and points to the value of studies which look beyond the context of the workplace. Finally, attention is paid to some of the limitations of Elias's work.<br>

Author(s): Corradi Consuelo<br>
Abstract: A lively concern for new instruments of knowledge has led sociology, among other disciplines, to collect life stories in order to explore social phenomena. Dialogue and interpersonal communication thus become crucial tools, as well as loci of knowledge. This paper investigates the epistemological suppositions of 'the biographical approach': the quest for identity in the narrative, the dialogical relationship between the narrating self and the researcher, the fixation of speech into text and more. The overall effort of the investigation is to reach criteria of analysis which are not simply borrowed from other areas, but are the outcome of reflection upon the constituent features of life stories. This investigation, however, does not widen the gap between 'qualitative' and 'quantitative' sociology, but rather it contributes to put this division into question.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines reasoning and rhetoric about economic recession in selected newspapers. This is an interesting topic for discourse analysis because it is a site of argumentation. We begin by asking: (1) epistemological questions (e.g. What evidential basis is drawn on in rhetoric about recession?) and then (2) ontological questions (e.g. How is recession pictured? and How is recession coordinated with the social world?). We examine the management of evidence and definitions concerning whether or not there is a recession. We then examine the entities invoked, showing how (a) a range of metaphors depict the recession as either an uncontrollable agent or as a controllable thing; and (b) rhetorical strategies used by both critics and supporters of the government collude in picturing the economy as a realm abstracted from social life.<br>

Article Title: Dominance and entitlement: the rhetoric men use to discuss their violence towards women<br>
Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i40110325<br>
Date: 1 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Gavey Nicola<br>
Abstract: Academic interest in applications of rhetoric to social issues is undergoing a revival. This paper develops a rhetorical analysis of discourse generated by men who have been recently violent towards women. The texts have been drawn from transcribed interviews with 14 men who had recently begun or were about to attend stopping violence programmes. Each 90-minute interview prompted the men on their views towards women, violence and relationships. A range of rhetorical devices within the texts were identified and their effect was analysed. This paper focuses on five devices: reference ambiguity, axiom markers, metaphor, synecdoche and metonymy. The strategic effects of each device are discussed with close reference to sample passages from the transcripts. The paper explores how these rhetorical devices resource discourses of male dominance and entitlement to power, and how these in turn resource men in their violence towards women. Increased sensitivity to the nuanced effects of the rhetoric is seen to improve understanding of how men justify, camouflage and maintain positions of dominance within relationships with women.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i40110340<br>
Date: 1 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): WODAK RUTH<br>
Abstract: The concept of the nation as an imagined community has gained importance in the relevant literature during the last decade. How do we construct national identities in discourse? Which topics, which discursive strategies and which linguistic devices are employed to construct national sameness and uniqueness on the one hand, and differences to other national collectives on the other hand? These questions were investigated in our study on the Austrian nation and identity. Taking several current social scientific approaches as our point of departure, we have developed a method of description and analysis of these phenomena which has applications beyond the discursive production of national identity in the specific Austrian example studied. By focusing particularly on the discursive construction of (national) sameness, this study has broken new ground in discourse-historical analysis, which until now has mainly been concerned with the analysis of the discursive construction of difference.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i40110418<br>
Date: 3 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): ANDERSSON KJERSTIN<br>
Abstract: In this article, a young man's narratives of violence are analysed, and a culturally shared storyline is identified as the basis of these narratives. It is argued that the stories are organized so as to construct a preferred self-presentation. One strategy to achieve this is to establish boundaries for what type of violence to use, whom to fight, where and for what reasons. I also argue that the narratives are structured to avoid being categorized as either victim or perpetrator, although both categories are drawn upon. Issues of masculinity are made relevant through categorization of the characters in the narrative, and positions are made available. Different masculine categories such as the hero/villain/non-man become relevant in the analysis. Different gendered positions are used in negotiating a masculine identity around narratives of and through telling about violence.<br>

Author(s): Parks Ward<br>
Abstract: Defined as "an act of cognition that schematizes two semantic fields and simultaneously effects and denies their rapprochement," metaphor as it appears in Lycidas is subdivided into three types, quantitatively distinguished. Ornamental metaphor is the minimal unit, consisting of a single metaphoric equation. Structural metaphors operate over larger poetic blocks, typically the extended clause. Governing the entire poem, the Lycidas/King metaphor bridges the real and fictitious universes in a metaphoric act characteristic of the pastoral elegy genre. Cutting across this three-tiered classification scheme is another typology based on metaphoric conjunction among the semantic features Human/Non-Human and Abstract/Physical. Accompanying tables present the results of the analysis.<br>

Article Title: Literal Metaphors: On Reading Postmodernism<br>
Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113423<br>
Date: 7 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): van Alphen Ernst<br>
Abstract: The difference between literal and figurative language becomes evident by comparing the Dutch novel The Journey of the Customs Officer to Bentheim (1983) by Willem Brakman with Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. Certain passages in the Dutch novel can be read either as literal or as metaphorical descriptions. The reader having a reading attitude which activates that frame of "reality" which is strictly separated from the frame of reference called "fiction and representation" will read crucial passages in this novel figuratively. The reader for whom fiction and reality are inseparable and situated on the same ontological level will read them literally. Both reading attitudes, the modernist aqd postmodernist ones, are personified in the two main characters of the novel. This twofold reading implies a critique of Hrushovski's descriptive method for the analysis of metaphor which is used throughout this paper. If the position of frames of reference is undefined in his theory, in his interpretive practice it becomes clear that for him frames of reference are situated in the text. Yet The Journey's ambiguity as to whether one or two frames is applicable undermines this position. It is up to the reader to differentiate or not hierarchically between reality and fiction.<br>

Abstract: A survey of recent books on Reader-Response, broadly defined as any literary theory that investigates the process of reading. This includes not only books by Norman Holland, Stanley Fish, and Wolfgang Iser, long regarded as central figures in the area of Reader-Response, but also discussions of the contribution to this area made by Jacques Derrida and Mikhail Bakhtin. A widespread reaction is observed against the impersonality of much literary theory and the dangers of reducing reading to a science, but alternative models that stress the therapeutic, self-enhancing, or playful elements in reading are also exposed to critical analysis.<br>

Abstract: On propose ici une analyse de la structure narrative du Saint Louis de Jacques Le Goff, de ses « trois drames » dont la succession (le troisième recomposant ce que le deuxième avait démonté du premier) crée l'effet de lecture. Celui-ci est, en particulier, animé par le retour des mêmes histoires, parfois des mêmes textes, sur lesquels l'historien exerce sa critique, patiemment et modestement, nous délivrant au passage une leçon de méthode. Peut-on lire un livre d'histoire comme un roman ? C'est la question que cet essai tente de poser, en même temps qu'il revient sur l'ambiguïté de son « personnage », Saint Louis qui fut peut-être, comme le Genet de Sartre, comédien et martyr. Proposed here is an analysis of the narrative structure of Jacques Le Goff's Saint Louis, of the « three dramas » which create, by their succession (the third drama recomposes what the second had deconstructed of the first), the effectiveness of its readability. This is particularly animated by the recurrence of the same stories, sometimes of the same texts, to which the author applies his criticism, with patience and humility, delivering to us in the process a lesson in methodology. Can a history book be read like a novel ? That is the question which this essay addresses, at the same time as it reverts to the ambiguity of its « personage » - Saint Louis -, who was perhaps, like Sartre's Genet, a comedian and a martyr.<br>

Author(s): CRAMPE-CASNABET Michèle<br>
Abstract: Ce double souci s'illustre, semble-t-il, dans la préoccupation constante de Kant de conjuguer les méthodes apagogique et ostensive, d'articuler les textes des Critiques et les écrits sur l'histoire. L'unification d'une genèse idéale et d'une genèse empirique estelle possible ? N'est-elle que le signe d'une exigence théorique impossible à remplir, d'un des derniers rêves de la métaphysique ou d'une conception autre qui s'annoncerait d'une systématique en philosophie ? Even before the « Copernician Revolution » Kant's philosophy aimed at building a system, an architechtonic which would both provide a structural analysis of mental powers and describe their genesis. Is such unification of an ideal genesis and an empirical one possible ? If not, are we faced with the last dream of metaphysics or with a new systematical era in philosophy ?<br>

Abstract: Analyse de l'évolution intellectuelle depuis le début des années 50 jusqu'à nos jours du Professeur Stegmüller, un des principaux représentants de l'epistemologie germanophone contemporaine. L'importance de son oeuvre est considérée d'abord en général — c'est à lui avant tout que l'on doit le renouveau de la tradition analytique et formelle en Allemagne dans les trente dernières années. Ensuite, à un niveau plus concret, comme un des fondateurs de ce qu'on appelle le programme structuraliste dans la reconstruction des théories scientifiques depuis le début des années 70. This essay is devoted to an analysis of Professor Stegmüller's intellectual evolution from the early 1950's to the present day as one of the main figures of contemporary German-speaking epistemology. The significance of his work is mainly seen on two levels : first, in general, as the main responsible for the revival of the analytic and formal tradition in Germany in the last 30 years ; secondly, on a more concrete level, as one of the founders of the so-called structuralist program in the reconstruction of scientific theories since the early 1970's.<br>

Author(s): GAVIN William J.<br>
Abstract: Les critiques reprochent souvent à la philosophie de James d'être trop nominaliste ou subjectiviste ou, plus spécifiquement, de ne pas soutenir le statut réel des universaux, de la « possibilité actuelle ». Nous proposons ici une réponse à ces critiques. Particulièrement une analyse attentive de ce que dit James sur Dieu (dans Pragmatism) est très révélatrice. James y progresse vers une position de possibilité réelle comme elle pourrait être exprimée en termes du conditionnel « contraire-aufait ». Cette position oblige James, procédant comme un empiriste, à conclure que le « réellement réel » est plus étendu que le logique et cela essentiellement. Critics often attack James' philosophy for being overly nominalistic or subjectivistic, or more specifically for not asserting the real status of generals, of « actual possibility. » In this paper I offer one defense against such criticisms. Specifically, a careful analysis of James' statements on God (as found in Pragmatism) is extremely revealing. In these statements, James works towards a position of actual possibility, as might be verbalized in terms of the « contrary-to-fact » conditional. Such a position forces James, acting as an empiricist, to conclude that the « really real » is broader than the logical, and essentially so.<br>

Publisher: Beauchesne<br>
Issue: i40117623<br>
Date: 3 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): KIRSCHER Gilbert<br>
Abstract: A l'opposé des discours philosophiques contemporains, la Philosophie Morale (Paris, 1961) d'Éric Weil reprend pour l'essentiel l'idée kantienne de la loi morale. Mais elle déplace la problématique de la fondation en procédant selon la méthode de l'« analyse génétique » qui concilie « développement phénoménologique » et « exposé encyclopédique ». Le chemin des apories de la réflexion morale conduit à la conscience de soi philosophique de la question morale comme question, et comme question irréductible, c'est-à-dire comme question que se pose une liberté qui a déjà, sans raison, choisi la raison. Contrary to the contemporary philosophical discourses, E. Weil's Philosophie Morale (Paris, 1961) resumes in his essential part the kantian idea of the moral law. But E. Weil displaces the problem of foundation, proceeding by the method of « genetical analysis » which conciliates « phenomenological development » and « encyclopaedic exposition » . The way of the apories of the moral reflexion leads into the philosophical self-consciousness of the moral question as a question, and as an irreducible question, in other words as a question stated to a freedom which has, without reason, already chosen the reason.<br>

Author(s): THOUARD Denis<br>
Abstract: Si l'on admet que l'herméneutique part de la reconnaissance d'une intention de signifier donnée déposée dans des signes, force est de considérer que l'entreprise kantienne s'y oppose, aussi bien d'un point de vue systématique que d'un point de vue historique. On critiquera à cette occasion la tentative de tirer du kantisme, en particulier de la troisième Critique, un point de départ pour une herméneutique. L'étude de « l'herméneutique morale » de l'écrit sur la religion replacé dans le contexte de la critique biblique de son époque apporte une confirmation des analyses systématiques et souligne les limites du dispositif kantien. Les reproches adressés par les tenants de « l'école mythique » de Göttingen (J. G. Eichhorn, J. G. Rosenmüller, G. L. Bauer) à la Religion dans les limites de la simple raison reviennent à distinguer nettement jugement et interprétation : Kant met en oeuvre un jugement, et non une interprétation. If one admits that the starting point of hermeneutics is a recognition of an intention to signify facts left in signs, then one must recognize that the project of Kant is opposed to this starting point, both from a systematic and historical point of view. The temptation to take from the works of Kant, especially the Third Critique, a starting point for hermeneutics will be subject to analysis. A study of « moral hermeneutics » that is drawn from the texts of religion (and which is done within the context of the biblical criticism of their period) confirms the analysis et underlines the limits of the Kantian plan of action. The criticisms of the « l'école mythique » of Göttingen (J. G. Eichhorn, J. G. Rosenmüller, G. L. Bauer) aimed at Religion within the limits of simple reason aid to clearly distinguish between judgement and interpretation. Kant implements a judgment and not an interpretation.<br>

Abstract: La phénoménologie de Husserl est tenue pour descriptive dans la mesure où elle montre comment les choses apparaissent. Cela commence avec la visée de toute chose comme quelque chose. Voir et « voir comme », montrer et dire, sont profondément entrelacés. Toutefois, la description indirecte va plus loin. Elle se réfère à quelque chose en renvoyant à quelque chose d'autre – nous le savons depuis le concept de communication indirecte de Kierkegaard et l'analyse bakhtinienne de la parole indirecte et de la citation. Une approche indirecte est requise aussitôt que notre expérience dépasse le royaume du sens et de l'intentionnalité, car nous sommes alors confrontés à quelque chose qui nous affecte et à quoi nous répondons. Les principales figures de l'indirectivité vont au-delà du sens sous la forme de l'excès, de la déviance, ou du retrait. La voie de la description indirecte sera illustrée en référence à quelques phénomènes cruciaux: la dimension passive de l'attention, le caractère responsif de la liberté, le fait de porter témoignage de la violence, et la scission entre le dire et le dit. Husserl's phenomenology turns out to be descriptive as far as it shows how things appear. It starts with taking everything as something. Seeing and seeing as, showing and saying are deeply interconnected. But indirect description goes further. It refers to something by referring to something else, as we know it from Kierkegaard's concept of indirect communication or from Bakhtin's analysis of indirect speech and of quotation. An indirect approach is required as soon as our experience surpasses the realm of meaning and intentionality, being confronted with something we are affected by and with something we respond to. Main figures of indirectness are going beyond by excess, deviating from, or withdrawing from. The way of indirect description will be illustrated by referring to some crucial phenomena: the passive part of attention, the responsive character of liberty, bearing witness of~<br>

Abstract: Le langage de la poésie appelle une attention particulière, car son ètrangetè même témoigne d'un rapport au réel fort différent des pratiques de la langue, dans la vie quotidienne ou dans le travail scientifique. En s'aidant de la référence au Vide et aux perspectives puisées dans la tradition chinoise, Maldiney développe cette philosophie propre à la poésie à partir des oeuvres d'André du Bouchet et de Francis Ponge. Son analyse donne ainsi à l'art poétique une responsabilité rarement mise en valeur par rapport au réel: un rapport à la fois d'intimité et de proximité. The language of poetry calls for special attention, since its strangeness itself verifies a very different way to relate to real for the practices of language — in everyday life or in the scientific work. With the help of reference to Emptiness and to perspectives from Chinese tradition, Maldiney develops that philosophy peculiar to poetry from the works of André du Bouchet and Francis Ponge. Thus, his analysis gives a rarely highlighted responsibility to poetic art regarding the real: both an intimate and a close relationship.<br>

Abstract: Cet article présente une lecture des principaux textes de Claude Lévi-Strauss, de Tristes tropiques aux Mythologiques, en passant par La pensée sauvage. Il part du thème de la dissolution du sujet pour le relier à l'horizon de la catastrophe écologique qui en oriente le développement. La subjectivité est pensée à partir des restes de l'analyse structurale comme un témoignage de sociétés en voie de recomposition. This article presents a reading of the major texts of Claude Lévi-Strauss, from Tristes Tropiques to Mythologies through The savage mind, linking the theme of the dissolution of the subject with the horizon of an ecological catastrophe that orients its development. Subjectivity is described with the remains of structural analysis as a testimony of societies in a process of recomposition.<br>

Abstract: C'est dans le tome III de Temps et récit, paru en 1985 que, dans le cadre d'un chapitre intitulé « L'aporétique de la temporalité », Paul Ricœur entre directement en débat avec l'auteur d'Être et temps. Bien qu'il souligne d'emblée l'originalité proprement phénoménologique de l'analyse heideggérienne du temps qui a le mérite de rompre avec le subjectivisme d'Augustin et de Husserl, il ne l'en soumet pas moins à une critique sévère, centrée sur deux points principaux : le privilège donné à l'être pour la mort, qu'il oppose à l'insouciance spinoziste à l'égard de la mort et au privilège donné à la natalité par Hannah Arendt, et l'aporie inhérente à la conception heideggérienne d'une finitude de la temporalité et d'un concept vulgaire du temps, qui ne permet pas, selon lui, à Heidegger de rendre compte aussi bien du temps historique que du temps de la nature. On s'efforce ici, en prenant appui sur les textes mêmes de Heidegger, de répondre point par point à cette critique. In the chapter entitled « The Aporetic of Temporality » of the third volume of Time and Narrative, published in 1985, Paul Ricœur enters directly into a debate with the author of Being and Time. In spite of the fact that he begins by emphasizing the originality of the Heideggerian time-analysis which breaks with Augustine's and Husserl's subjectivism, he nevertheless submits it to a severe critique which is centred on two main points : first, the privilege given to the being toward death, which Ricœur opposes to Spinoza's carelessness regarding death and Arendt's privilege given to natality, and secondly, the aporia involved in Heidegger's conception of a finite temporality and of a vulgar concept of time, which in his view does not allow to take into account historical time as well as natural time. This paper undertakes, on the basis of Heidegger's texts themselves, to give a detailed answer to Ricœur's critique.<br>

Abstract: 'L'herméneutique de la condition historique' est un thème central de l'anthropologie philosophique de Paul Ricœur. Le présent article s'emploie à montrer, d'une part, que Ricœur redéploie son « herméneutique de la condition historique » à partir de l'analyse heideggérienne de l'expérience temporelle du Dasein et, d'autre part, qu'il le fait en marquant un certain nombre de désaccords fondamentaux (essentiellement sur les plans épistémologique et éthique) avec le cadre heideggérien initial. La thèse adventice soutenue dans l'article consiste à indiquer combien cet amendement du cadre heideggérien de départ aurait pu être encore plus massif, si Ricœur avait reçu un texte capital de Reinhart Koselleck intitulé « Théorie de l'histoire et herméneutique », dirigé à la fois contre l'ontologie fondamentale de Heidegger et l'herméneutique universelle de Gadamer. 'Hermeneutics of the historical condition' is a central theme of Ricœur'sphilosophical anthropology. The present article seeks to show, first, that Ricœur sketched up its « hermeneutics of the historical condition » on the very basis of Heidegger's analysis of the temporal experience of Dasein and, secondly, that he did so by marking some fundamental disagreements with the initial Heideggerian framework (basically from both the epistemological and ethical point of view). The second thesis argued in this article is that Ricœur 's critic addressed to Heidegger's framework could have been even more massive, if Ricœur had received the major text of Reinhart Koselleck entitled « Theory of history and hermeneutics, » which consists in a twofold attack against both the fundamental ontology of Heidegger and Gadamer's universal hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: This article reassesses the importance of historical biblical scholarship, but from the perspective of those who views are seldom considered by the academy, namely, poor, working-class and marginalized 'readers' of the Bible. Recognising that these 'readers' of Bible do have an interest in socio-historical matters, both in the present contexts and in the biblical texts, the article goes on to an analysis of how we might go about appropriating socio-historical modes of reading in our work with ordinary 'readers' of the Bible. It is here that the article engages with the historicity of myth and the myth of historicity. First, it is argued that the historically interested socially engaged scholar who works with ordinary 'readers' of the Bible should be overtly aware of the myth of historicity. Such scholars must embody a more nuanced view of history in the very act of imparting historical information in our collaborative work with non-scholars. Second, when biblical narratives are granted mythic significance – that is, they are signified as meaning, powerful and true irrespective of their historical claims – the task of the socially engaged biblical scholar is to respond with critical responsibility to the academy and with social accountability to our context.<br>

Abstract: This article interprets Mark 14:22-25, using one of the new approaches in biblical interpretation, namely, pragmatic analysis. In pragmatic analysis, a text is considered a linguistic unit composed of linguistic elements (signs) with the scope of communicating a message. Interpretation involves examining the linguistic elements, the relationship between them (the syntax), their semantic valence in view of their communicative potentiality. Reading Mark 14:22-25 with this approach leads us to the conclusion that the evangelist included the institution account in his Gospel primarily to explain the significance and effect of Jesus' death to the reader. By adequately preparing the reader on the power of the word of Jesus before coming to read the institution account, Mark achieves a rhetorical effect: the conviction of the power of the words of Jesus and an admiration for the generosity of Jesus. This elicits in the reader an attraction to enter into Jesus' covenant.<br>

Abstract: In this paper some elements of the reading process of Luke 12:35-48 are analysed according to the theory of Wolfgang Iser. Two problems are stated in the introduction, namely the impossibility of accounting for the reading process exhaustively in one all-encompassing theory, and the difficulty of "applying" Iser's theory, which is proposed as a theory of the reading process and not a method for analysing the reading process of an actual text. After a short exposition of the philosophical background and the main elements of the theory, a description of some elements of the reading process of this particular text is given. The paper concludes with a short reflection on the viability of this theory for a practical reception analysis.<br>

Abstract: The explication of contextualisation in terms of metaphor theory facilitates the utilisation of procedures of literary analysis, the idea of the model reader of a text, as well as the social analysis of discourses for the explication of the contextualisation of a text. The explication of the interaction between text and reader, or contextualiser in terms of metaphor theory explains some of the complexities involved in reading or contextualising texts. In the metaphoric interaction between text and reader the activity of contextualisation functions as a contextual or situational filter which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the discourse of the reader, implying statements about it that normally apply to the text. As a text in counter-determining context, the text is retroactively determined by the discourse which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the text, implying statements about it that normally apply to the discourse or context.<br>

Abstract: The growth of knowledge in any discipline depends on discursive practice for the assertion of claims and the assessment of claims. At times, however, that discursive practice may be ideological in nature. Ideology is here defined as being grounded in efforts at domination--the ascendance of some ideas over others. Examination of the incidence of ideology in discourse is necessarily interpretive; part of this article explores the application of hermeneutics to the analysis of discourse. A set of examples of discursive practice in library and information science (LIS), purposely selected, is examined for ideological intent. Ultimately, the aim is to demonstrate that some discourse is ideological in nature and purpose, and to point out the implications of such discursive practice for knowledge growth in LIS.<br>

Abstract: Communities, whether they are "real" or virtual, are mediated by interpretation. One's place within a community is also constituted by an ongoing metaphoric "reading" through which one attempts to understand what others within the community say and do. Virtual communities are unique in making such reading explicit through further acts of writing: participants form their communities through public performances of writing, reading, and interpreting of texts. Any analysis of virtual communities must take into account both the exchange of meaning through texts and the fact of a mediating distance between participants. The hermeneutic theories of Paul Ricoeur can support an analysis of these activities, which accounts for temporal and spatial distance in the exchange of the community's texts. Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory can be used to describe the process that drives virtual communities, which makes them into forums that attempt to "connect the scattered members of an invisible republic" [1, p. 43] in an electronic world.<br>

Abstract: As a Catholic historian, this theme raises particular difficulties for me, since the notion of specific patterns of thought is one I would not use, and the term 'contemporary history' is much too vague. Of course, Catholic scholars, no less than their protestant counterparts, still recognize the need to raise questions about the nature of history and its analysis, despite the various unsuccessful attempts in the past when systematic theologians have failed to come to terms with the reality of historical events, as in the unhistorically conceived 'New Scholasticism'. The concept of 'freedom', for example, is one which requires new conceptualization in our present historical context. If we accept the current view that all rationalist theories of knowledge are in fact based on an act of 'faith', so we have to see that the belief in the primacy of 'Reason' cannot any longer be maintained. Which does not mean that we have to take flight into 'unreason', or abandon rational categories of thought. What we need to find is some manner by which 'faith' can be anchored as a final justification, over and above any transcendental basis. In our present pluralistic world this will have to be to presented in a variety of ways. But at least it calls for a new consideration of how to relate 'faith' and 'knowledge'.<br>

Abstract: Giuseppe Capograssi (1889-1956) was an important legal philosopher and had a lively influence on the development of legal studies. The centre of his reflections lay in his many investigations into the concept of experience, which aimed to supersede the prevalent orientation in Italy, focussed on vertexes, emphasizing instead the importance of practices, both on the theoretical level and in the analysis of legal activity and political reality. Capograssi therefore paid great attention to the relationship between state and society viewed in a dynamic and pluralist perspective. No less illuminating are Capograssi's investigations into the value of the constitution and the principle of legality. During the Fascist period, Capograssi upheld the values of individual liberty and democratic principles, seeing as indispensable the continual involvement of citizens in the development of political action. This perspective played a further, particularly important role in the "ideas of Capograssi", after the war and the advent of the republican legal order. According to Capograssi, more space needed to be given to social life and to the spiritual links on which political community is based. In this sense, Capograssi found the teachings of Catholicism fundamental. His Catholicism placed great emphasis on freedom and solidarity and contained a lively, underlying sense of the cultural and spiritual, inspired by the ideal of "charity".<br>

Abstract: This article addresses how a perceived tension between the spontaneous personal and the shared textual elements of religious language is resolved in the context of Pentecostal services recorded at two Assemblies of God (AG) churches in California and Michigan. In an analysis of pray er and the metapragmatic commentary that surrounds it, I argue that the balance between spontaneously created prayer and invocation of fixed text plays on an opposition that goes beyond ritual or religious language; rather, it is best understood as characterizing two opposing text-building or entextualization strategies. Using evidence from AG prayer, sermons, and songs, I show that the preferred entextualization strategy highlights the situatedness of the text in a particular context and as emanating from a particular speaker. My findings have significance not only for research on religious language, but also for further understandings of entextualization and the discursive means of constructing personhood and affect.<br>

Abstract: Le calcul économique, dans sa forme la plus connue, celle de l'analyse coûts/avantages, est depuis quelques années confronté à de multiples remises en cause. Considéré comme technocratique, partiel, voire partial, il est de plus en plus cantonné au rôle de composante parmi d'autres de l'aide à la décision publique. Le développement, dans le Royaume-Uni d'une nouvelle approche, multicritère, de l'évaluation des grands projets d'infrastructure de transport va-t-il sonner le glas du calcul économique ? Nous ne le pensons pas. Nous défendons au contraire la thèse selon laquelle il peut retrouver un rôle important. Mais, pour cela, il est nécessaire de reconsidérer le processus des choix collectifs. Dans cette nouvelle perspective, loin de constituer un processus purement technocratique, le calcul économique, à la lumière des travaux de Keynes et Schumpeter sur le rôle de la prévision et des prix, peut s'inscrire dans une forme renouvelée de maïeutique des choix collectifs, même dans le champ controversé des infrastructures de transport. Economic calculation, and especially cost benefit analysis (Coba), is more and more criticised and accused to be technocratic and partial, leading to a narrow view of projects. An example of this loss of credibility is the New Approach To Appraisal (NATA), implemented in Great Britain at the end of the 90': a multicriteria analysis where Coba gives only one information among many others, quantitative and qualitative. Nevertheless we don't think that we are facing an unavoidable decline of economic calculation. This paper emphasises the important role that Coba can keep within the public decision process. If we remember Keyne's and Schumpeter's points of view about the roles of forecasting and prices, economic calculation could be useful to help the emergence of collective choices, even in the controversial field of transport infrastructures.<br>

Abstract: Ce texte montre combien floues, voire aporétiques, sont en fait les définitions d'une catégorie, la "légitimité", dont les usages ne cessent pourtant de s'élargir. Il montre également (surtout) combien cette imprécision voue la plupart du temps la "légitimité" à fonctionner dans un registre humaniste-théorique et moral. Contre cette dérive de l'analyse des institutions, le texte, en s'appuyant sur la philosophie de Spinoza, propose d'abandonner cette qualité occulte de "légitimité" et que les institutions ne survivent et n'opèrent que parce qu'elles sont soutenues par une configuration adéquate de puissances et d'affects. This text shows how fuzzy and even aporetic the notion of "legitimacy" is, despite its more and more widespread uses. It also shows how the notion mostly pertains to a theoreticalhumanistic and moral tone. Against this drift of institutional analysis, and relying on Spinoza's philosophy, the text suggests to drop down legitimacy as an occult quality, and rather states that institutions only persevere and work because they lean on a convenient configuration of powers and affects.<br>

Abstract: Les "institutions", comme ensemble préexistant et objectivable de ressources de justification, forment le milieu où puisent les agents économiques, pour gérer leurs problèmes de coordination et/ou leurs conflits de reproduction. Les "conventions" sont des représentations collectives de "monde commun justifié", qui activent les institutions, et légitiment les arrangements locaux, au sein des "organisations", dont la production conjointe de marchandises et de règles va reconstituer ou dégrader le milieu institutionnel de départ. Ce modèle conventionnaliste à trois termes cherche à surmonter les difficultés des autres analyses économiques des institutions. Il pose un agent économique rompu aux défauts de coordination et de reproduction, et impensable hors d'un milieu institutionnel composé au minimum du langage, de la monnaie, et du droit. La pluralité des logiques de justification fonde la diversité empirique des institutions. La dynamique des institutions est étudiée à travers les opérateurs qui font et défont les possibilités de "monde commun" à partir de la "pluralité" : la "concurrence" dans l'espace des prix doit être combinée avec la "critique" dans l'espace des valeurs (normes). L'analyse conventionnaliste du capitalisme remet le projet de Marx à l'endroit en déduisant la théorie de l'exploitation d'une théorie de la justice, plutôt que l'inverse. "Institutions", as a set of pre-existing and objective resources of justification, is the milieu where economic agents can find materials to solve their coordination problems and/or their conflicts of reproduction. "Conventions" are collective representations of "justified common worlds" that activate institutions and legitimise arrangements within "organisations", whose joint production of goods and rules will lead to the renewal -or the degeneracy- of prior institutional milieu. This "three terms conventionalist model" endeavors to face the difficulties encountered by the other economic approaches of institutions. I~<br>

Abstract: Quelle forme de pluralisme permet une démocratie viable ? Y a-t-il compatibilité entre deux types de principes et de pratiques ? Après avoir éclairci les concepts de pluralisme, pluralisme culturel, pluralisme moral et démocratie, l'article analyse les dilemmes auxquels conduisent les visions abstraites du pluralisme culturel et de la démocratie dans le contexte contemporain en montrant la symétrie du dilemme de l'homme démocratique et du dilemme du croyant. L'examen des racines sociologiques du nouveau pluralisme culturel dans la « société inconnue » conduit à l'analyse des difficultés rencontrées par la constitution d'un « nous » politique qui ne peut pas seulement dépendre d'un code « fin » et procédural. Le rejet du pluralisme radical n'est pas le résultat d'un diktat philosophique ou sociologique mais d'une analyse contextuelle et d'une démarche prudentielle tenant compte des situations historiques et politiques concrètes. What kind of pluralism allows a viable democracy ? Are the two types of principles and practices compatible? After clarifying the concepts of pluralism, cultural pluralism, moral pluralism and democracy, the article analyzes the dilemmas posed by the abstract visions of cultural pluralism and democracy in the contemporary world, showing the symmetry between the dilemmas of the democrat and those of the believer. The examination of the sociological roots of the new cultural pluralism in the « unknown society » leads to an analysis of the difficulties of creating a political « us » which does not depend only on some teleological and procedural code. The rejection of radical pluralism is not the result of some philosophical or sociological dictum ; it emerges from a contextual analysis and a careful procedure which takes account of historical situations and concrete policies.<br>

Abstract: L'analyse lexicométrique des réponses à une question ouverte posée le lendemain de la mort de Fr. Mitterrand permet de mettre en évidence le champ des représentations sociales, qui forment à ce moment particulier l'image de l'ancien président. Au-delà du discours consensuel imposé par les circonstances, il est possible de mettre à jour des différences dans l'usage des stéréotypes. Les variables classiques de la sociologie politique déterminent des représentations différentes du porte-parole: l'abolition de la peine de mort, les 39 heures, la 5e semaine de congés payés, le Grand Louvre sont diversement associés au défunt président. De la même manière, les citations sélectives de caractéristiques psychologiques comme l'intelligence, la culture ou la simplicité sont le produit de logiques sociales. On peut aussi montrer que les représentations, en tant que lieux communs, constituent des « lieux de mémoire » et sont structurées par des logiques symboliques. L'image ainsi comprise « stocke », organise et condense cognitions et affects liés aux dimensions individuelles et collectives, privées et publiques, d'un porte-parole. A lexicometric analysis of answers to an open question asked the day after François Mitterrand's death clarifies the field of the social representations which then made up the former president's image. Beyond the consensual discourse imposed by circumstances, there were differences in the use of stereotypes. The classic variables of political sociology determine different representations of the leader : the abolition of capital punishment, the 39-hour work week, the fifth week of paid vacations, and the Grand Louvre are variously associated with the late former president. Similarly, references to psychological characteristics such as intelligence, culture or simplicity are the results of social logics. It can also be shown that representations as common places make up « sites » and are structured by symbolic logics. The image thus understood « stocks ~<br>

Author(s): GENSBURGER SARAH<br>
Abstract: L'article propose de renouveler l'analyse de la mémoire historique française de l'Occupation. Il met en évidence un processus d'institutionnalisation d'une nouvelle figure, celle du Juste parmi les nations devenu progressivement Juste de France. Cette évolution repose notamment sur un rapport complexe entre ce nouveau personnage mémoriel et celui, plus ancien, du Résistant. D'une part, cette mise en place s'appuie sur des modalités symboliques proches de celles utilisées pour les résistants. D'autre part, la figure du Juste de France remplit un rôle fonctionnel autrefois exclusivement dévolu à ces derniers. À travers son incorporation s'opère la réécriture d'une rhétorique dichotomique au sein d'un régime mémoriel renouvelé où une France-patrie des droits de l'homme remplace une France-nation et territoire. Ce constat conduit à l'analyse de la portée réconciliatrice d'une telle mémoire historique et de ses modalités. Celle-ci repose notamment sur les imbrications entre individuel et collectif au cœur des représentations du passé. L'article incite enfin à un retour critique sur les travaux des tenants du « paradigme de la mémoire stratégique ». Ainsi, à travers un cas empirique concret, l'auteur se livre-t-il à une réflexion conceptuelle et méthodologique sur la notion de mémoire et ses implications. Apparaît avec force la nécessité de dépasser les approches courantes des phénomènes de mémoire, souvent trop linéaires et unidimensionnelles. The article aims to throw new light on the analysis of French historical memory of the occupation. There is the institutionalization of a new figure, that of the righteous among nations becoming progressively the righteous of France. This development is based on complex relations between this new memorial character and the older one of the Resistant. On the one hand, this character is built on symbolic processes similar to those used for the Résistants, and on the other hand, the figure of the righteous of France fulfills a functio~<br>

Abstract: Après avoir étudié les réponses des États et des systèmes politico-administratifs à l'épidémie de sida, sociologues et politistes s'intéressent depuis quelques années à la dimension politique de la lutte contre le sida et notamment à la mise en cause, par le mouvement associatif dans l'espace public, des pouvoirs constitués, politiques, mais aussi biomédicaux. Une analyse critique de ces travaux, qui s'inscrivent dans des traditions méthologiques et épistémologiques différentes, permet de soulever un certain nombre d'enjeux concernant à la fois les dispositifs de lutte contre le sida eux-mêmes (contribution du monde associatif à la constitution de l'espace de lutte contre le sida, dans son versant politique comme dans son versant biomédical), les modalités empiriques de la saisie de ces dispositifs (mobilisation et traitement des sources) et les avancées conceptuelles nourries par l'enquête sociologique. Now that the States' political and administrative responses to AIDS have been thoroughly studied, social and political scientists have for some years focused on the political dimension of fighting the AIDS epidemic. Thus, particular attention is being drawn on the questioning - by organizations - of political and biomedicai established authority. The article provides a critical analysis of these works all set in different methodological and epistemological backgrounds. This analysis reveals a number of concerns connected to this issue : first, the role of organizations and their impact on fighting AIDS strategies - both political and biomedicai ; then, the empiric modes of retrieving information - mobilizing and managing sources ; last, the conceptual developments generated by sociological investigation.<br>

Abstract: L a réintroduction des émotions dans l'analyse des mobilisations collectives requiert de nombreuses précautions méthodologiques. En tout premier lieu, les termes empruntés au langage commun doivent être redéfinis de manière contrôlée. Dans cette optique, les apports récents des neurosciences permettent notamment de bien distinguer « sentiments » et « émotions » . Par ailleurs, des concepts sténographiques, tels ceux de choc moral et de dispositif de sensibilisation, s'avèrent indispensables afin d'assurer l'ancrage empirique de l'enquête. Enfin, l'attention prêtée aux émotions doit viser avant tout la décomposition analytique des différentes opérations qui caractérisent le travail militant. L'article s'appuie sur des observations relevées auprès des militants de la cause animale. Taking emotions into account in the analysis of collective movements requires a great deal of methodological care. First of all, the vocabulary borrowed from the vernacular must be carefully (re) defined. For this purpose, recent progress in the neurosciences can be extremely helpful in distinguishing "feelings" from "emotions". Moreover, shorthand concepts such as "moral shock" and "apparatus of sensitizaron" are essential in conducting an empirical enquiry. Finally, the attention given to emotions must be geared toward an analytical deconstruction of the various components of activism. This paper is based on the observation of animal rights activists.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i40129912<br>
Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): SHOHAM HIZKY<br>
Abstract: The article seeks to revitalize the concept of tradition and re-claim its usefulness for contemporary sociological thought and research. Instead of ontological entity, tradition is defined here as an assigned temporal meaning, i. e., a symbolic activity in which various social groups attribute traditional qualities to certain sectors of life that are understood as binding together different times. The article analyzes two incompatible approaches with which tradition was hitherto conceptualized in sociology: (1) tradition as the anti-modern, and (2) tradition as synonymous with "culture." The analysis introduces a few middle-ground options that support the theory of tradition as assigned meaning. L'article entend redonner vie au concept de tradition en sociologie et montrer son utilité pour la recherche aujourd'hui. Il met en évidence les insuffisances des deux interprétations usuelles : tradition comme refus de la modernité et tradition rendue synonyme de culture. Il propose de voir dans l'appel à tradition une activité symbolique par laquelle des groupes sociaux divers attribuent des caractères « traditionnels » à certains aspects de la vie sociale regardés comme assurant un lien inter-temporel. Dieser Aufsatz setzt sich zum Ziel der Tradition in der Soziologie einen neuen Aufschwung zu geben und ihre Bedeutung für die heutige Forschung zu verdeutlichen. Er hebt die Unzulänglichkeiten zweier gängiger Interpretationsschemen hervor: Tradition als Verweigerung der Moderne und Tradition als Synonym für Kultur. Er schlägt vor, den Aufruf an die Tradition als symbolischen Akt zu begreifen, dem verschiedene soziale Gruppen traditionelle Werte im sozialen Miteinander beimessen, die als intertemporales Bindeglied fungieren<br>

Abstract: The article of Elzbieta Wolicka is consecrated to the consideration of the phenomenon of time taken in the contexts of individual human experience, contemporary cultural situation and Christian faith. The starting point of the 1st part of the article is the fragment of Confessiones (ch. XI) of St. Augustine and the short parable of Franz Kafka entitled HE. The author of the article brings to the light the dialogical basis of the human perception of time and raises up the quaestion of "a hidden sabotage of trust" which is characteristic to the social relations of our times. This is also the one among many other factors of the so called "crisis of culture" (mal du siècle). The crisis consists of a feeling of a threat, a burden of the past and a fear of the future. The 2nd part of the article is concerned with the analysis of the eschatological meaning of some words of Christ in the Gospel of St. John (4, 23; 5, 25-29; 12, 13; 12, 27, 31). They reveal the Christian sense of the human temporal condition in the light of "the economy of salvation" and the dialogue between a believer and God. A catastrophic thrill, a feeling of existential paradox, a blockage of communication - the symptoms of the crisis of cultural conscience - could be described as "the edipse of God" (M. Buber) or "the abandonment of God" (J. Ellul) in the contemporary world. The Gospel points out that in the heart of human temporal experience there is still existing conversatio sacra and the presence of God in our history is actual.<br>

Abstract: The text aims at considering from various points of view the presence of the value of truth in the work of art. The first step is a phenomenological analysis of epistemológical, ontological and aesthetic phenomena connected with perception of the work of art. Its conclusion is the statement that truth belongs to the characteristics of both creation (contents, structure) and reception (cognition of various aspects) of the work. The very fact that the aesthetic value of the object claiming to be beautiful can be discussed proves the presence of the object on the rational-veritable plane. The next aspect undertaken in the article is concerned with the epistemological and methodological criticism of the view (represented here by R. Ingarden) that there is a radical difference between the objective domains of science and art. An attempt is made to show that the view is rooted rather in ideologically understood scientism and neo-positivism than in a realistic conception of cognition through art. In a completely realistic attitude the borderline between 'what is rationally cognised' and 'what is beautiful' (the sphere of quasi in Ingarden's meaning) is not an absolute borderline. The domain of the work of art also contains cognitive elements, often existentially and morally essential for man's life. As it appears, a similar position can be found in G. B. Vico's texts that proclaim the unity of poetic and metaphysical perspective in ancient beginnings of anthropological thought about the human world. Nowadays a methodological tendency is observed on the philosophical plane that allows joining the veritable and aesthetic aspects, and hence exploring the objective domain of art in the cognitive aspect. This is expressed today, among others, in the increase of the significance of art in social, cultural and scientific life.<br>

Abstract: In the past decades the concept of recognition has moved to the center of social theory. Can this concept be of use for American Studies and, more specifically, American literary and cultural studies? My essay tries to answer this question in five parts: first, a discussion of two opposite views of the social and cultural role of recognition exemplified by Charles Taylor and Alexis de Tocqueville; second, a reconsideration of the concept of identity, since recognition is inextricably linked with questions of identity formation in current debates; third, a description of the ways in which the struggle for recognition stands at the center of fictional texts and forms an imaginary core that has often been forgotten in the professionalization of literary studies; fourth, an analysis of how recognition can be understood and described as an effect of the reading experience (and of aesthetic experience more generally); and fifth, a return to the starting question of this essay, namely what the concept of recognition can contribute to American Studies and how it can be assessed in comparison with other, currently dominant approaches in the field.<br>

Abstract: This paper is an attempt to explore the continuing relevance of Nietzsche's genealogical analysis of Western rationality to the sociology of knowledge. While Nietzsche is often neglected in classical sociological theory textbooks, this paper argues that Nietzsche has a very significant contribution to sociological theory especially in the field of knowledge production. Recent sociologists are now acknowledging this tradition. Hence this paper discusses how the basic tenets of Nietzsche's critique of Western metaphysics and positivism can be harnessed to create a powerful critique of contemporary sociological understanding of knowledge construction and its legitimation in society. Some of these themes are discussed at the end of the paper especially in relation to Philippine sociology.<br>

Article Title: War as a Form of "Apotheosis": The Militarization of the USA and Don DeLillo's "End Zone"<br>
Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138275<br>
Date: 1 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): de Marco Alessandra<br>
Abstract: The present paper investigates Don DeLillo's 1972 End Zone, arguing that football is a metaphor for war and that DeLillo's analysis of football and its culture effectively constitutes a critique of the war mentality undergirding American society. In this novel DeLillo meditates on the historical process that historian Michael S. Sherry calls the "militarization" (xi) of the USA and that, since the 1930s, turned the country into a military and economic superpower allowing a war mentality to enter deep into the grain of American culture. The essay will read DeLillo's focus on language against Nicholas Abraham and Maria Torok's psychoanalytical theories on demetaphorization as the linguistic counterpart of melancholia and against Herbert Marcuse's notion of functional language as a linguistic behavior that facilitates the annihilation of critical thinking. Both functional language and demetaphorization allow militarization to enforce its own discourse. Suffering from melancholia, the novel's protagonists fall prey to incorporation, a process whereby they disavow death as the product of war and, with it, pain, suffering, and destruction. As a result, the novel offers a cautionary tale about the consequences arising from an excessive exaltation of war as a means through which a nation seeks to affirm its "apotheosis" (End Zone 162).<br>

Abstract: Délibérément inscrit dans une perspective micrologique, les analyses présentées dans cet article interrogent l'actualisation de la mémoire individuelle sur son versant situationnel, à partir d'une enquête de terrain réalisée auprès de la population pied-noire dans le milieu des Pieds-Noirs. L'objectif de ce texte consiste à mettre au jour une partie du travail permanent d'appropriation et de reformulation de la mémoire ; un processus qui prend forme dans le détail des interactions ordinaires de la vie quotidienne. L'examen des données recueillies dans différents contextes micro-sociaux privés montre comment des éléments, sinon vrais, du moins plausibles, se maintiennent, sont réévalués ou introduits dans la mémoire individuelle. L'actualisation des cadres et contenus mnésiques, à la fois reconduits et amendés au gré d'échanges banals, obéit donc aux dynamiques propres aux interactions ordinaires, qui à ce titre, apparaissent comme des sources relativement autonomes de la « petite production mnésique ». Based on a fieldwork among the French "Pieds-Noirs," this article analyses through a "micro" perspective the enactment of individual memory in concrete situations. Its aim is to decipher elements of the everyday processes of appropriation and reformulation of memory, as it takes place in ordinary interactions. The analysis of these interactions observed in very detailed settings shows how elements that are at least believable (if not "true") are produced, maintained, reevaluated and cast in one's memory. The actualization of those frames and contents of memory seems eventually to follow the modalities of banal interactions, which can hence be considered as relatively autonomous source of the "small production of memory".<br>

Author(s): Kølvraa Christoffer<br>
Abstract: The 1990s and 2000s saw a memory and remembrance boom at both the national and supra-/transnational level. Crucially, many of these emerging memory frames were not simply about a glorious and heroic past, as in, for example, traditional nationalist narratives. Rather, groups started to narrate their symbolic boundaries in a more inclusive way by admitting past wrongdoings. In this article, we look at a corpus of so-called 'speculative speeches' by leading politicians in the European Union and, against the aforementioned historical background, analyse their representations of Europe's past, present and future. By utilising the discourse-historical approach in critical discourse analysis, narrative theory and elements of Reinhart Koselleck's conceptual history (Begriffsgeschichte), we illustrate how, first, a 'new Europe', based on admitting failure, is narrated. However, second, we also show that such a self-critical narration of a 'bitter past' is, paradoxically, transformed into a self-righteous attitude towards Europe's 'others'.<br>

Abstract: This article critically examines the assumptions and processes involved in identifying histoncally distinctive plant identities by their Latin botanical names. By following latecolonial efforts to identify a medicinal herb mentioned in some versions of the Ramayana, this paper argues for a historicist analysis of the process of "retro-botanizing." In so doing, it also distinguishes between two different forms of "tradition," the "factualized" and "embedded." Finally, it blurs the allegedly watertight distinction between histoncal and mythic pasts. Instead of trying to distinguish these pasts ontologically, I argue that it is more productive to see specific pasts in relation to the sorts of futures they produce, that is, their respective historicities.<br>

Abstract: Dans la réflexion de Jean-Pierre Vernant et Pierre Vidal-Naquet, le rapprochement entre le passé et le présent est caractéristique d'une démarche qui, pour aborder les problèmes historiques les plus difficiles, et notamment les questions politiques, n'hésite pas à recourir à ce que Nicole Loraux a pu appeler «une pratique contrôlée de l'anachronisme». L'analyse porte dans cette étude sur un point omniprésent dans leurs œuvres : l'héritage politique des Grecs ? Comment ont-ils défini, par leurs travaux, un héritage politique qui ne reprend pas tout ce que les Anciens ont pensé et fait? Comment, dans leur démarche, chacun à leur manière, ont-ils tracé et franchi des frontières, entre le passé et le présent? Quelle pertinence accorder dans ce contexte à la notion de frontière? Quel sens donner aux trois termes autour desquels est centrée cette contribution: le politique, les frontières, l'historien? In Jean-Pierre Vernant's and Pierre Vidal-Naquet's thought, the rapprochement between past and present characterizes a procedure which in dealing with the most difficult historical issues and notably the political ones, does not hesitate to resort to what Nicole Loraux once called "a controlled practice of anachronism". In this study the analysis bears on a pervasive point throughout their works: the political heritage of the Greeks? How did they define in their works a political heritage of the Greeks which does not take up all that the Ancients thought and did? How in their thought processes each of them in his own way has traced up and trespassed borders between past and present? What relevance can be accorded in such context to the notion of border? What meaning to be given to the three terms around which this contribution is centered: politics, the borders, the historian?<br>

Abstract: La revue Christianisme social (1896-1971) était l'organe de la Fédération française du Christianisme social, mouvement protestant d'action sociale orienté vers un socialisme chrétien. De 1954 à 1962, elle a vigoureusement pris parti contre la poursuite de la guerre d'Algérie et pour le rétablissement de la paix au moyen d'une négociation avec le F.L.N. Elle a joué le rôle d'une avant-garde par rapport à l'opinion publique protestante, mais sans oser se transformer en parti de la gauche protestante afin de sauvegarder son unité. Son engagement combinait des motivations fondamentalement morales et spirituelles (refus de la torture pratiquée par la police et l'armée françaises) et une analyse politique attribuant au colonialisme français la responsabilité du conflit. Rejetant le principe révolutionnaire du « la fin justifie les moyens », ses rédacteurs appartenaient aux catégories d'opposants à la guerre que Pierre Vidal-Naquet a qualifiés de « dreyfusards » et de « tiers-mondistes ». Mais une étude historique rétrospective doit constater que l'objectivité de leur vision de la guerre d'Algérie a été en partie biaisée par leur parti-pris. Christianisme social (1896-1971) was the main press organ for the Fédération française du Christianisme social, a protestant social action movement leaning toward Christian socialism. From 1954 to 1962, this magazine strongly condemned the pursuit of the Algerian war and called for establishing peace by negociating with the F.L.N. It played an avant garde role for Protestant public opinion without daring setting itself up as the Protestant left party in order to maintain its' unity. This magazines mission combined basically moral and spiritual motivations (refusing torture practised by the French police and army) and a political analysis placing responsability for the conflict on French colonialism. Having rejected the revolutionary principle "The end justifies the means", its' writers belonged to the war opponents that Pierre Vidal-Na~<br>

Abstract: This paper is based on the analysis of a corpus of letters sent to a specific Chinese institution: the Letters and Visits Administration created in 1951. Its main focus is to analyze the recent trends of this particular space of direct address to State and Party representative. This is indeed a space where situations considered to be unjust, illegitimate, unacceptable are exposed, whether individually or collectively. The article begins by stressing the importance not only of the grievances expressed but of the type of relationship posited by complainants between themselves and those they appeal to, which is also between the ruled and the rulers. It then considers how letters and visits enable those who take such initiatives to step outside the private realm and tell public authorities who they are and, more precisely, how they perceive themselves. Finally, I will try to explain why the shared arguments put forward by petitioners, although they often rely on official commitments, cannot be understood as expressing a mere inclination towards rule compliance. Ce texte prend appui sur un corpus de lettres adressées à une institution chinoise particulière: l'administration des Lettres et des Visites créée en 1951. II a pour principal objectif d'analyser les développements récents de cet espace d'adresse directe auprès des représentants du Parti et de I'État. II s'agit en effet pour ceux qui investissent cet espace de parole, que ce soit à titre individuel ou collectif, de révéler des situations jugées injustes, illégitimes, inacceptables. L'article commence par souligner l'importance non seulement des griefs exprimés mais de la relation que les plaignants rendent manifeste dans leurs lettres entre eux et ceux auxquels ils s'adressent, soit entre gouvernés et gouvernants. II analyse ensuite comment lettres et visites permettent à ceux qui prennent de telles initiatives de sortir du domaine privé pour dire aux autorités publiques qui ils sont et, de façon plus précise, co~<br>

Abstract: While there is an extensive subfield in sociology studying the sources, content, and consequences of collective memory, the study of future projections has been much more fragmentary. In part, this has to do with the challenge of measurement; how do you measure something that has not happened yet? In this article, I argue that future projections can be studied via their externalizations in attitudes, narratives, performance, and material forms. They are particularly evident in what I call "sites of hyperprojectivity," that is, sites of heightened, future-oriented public debate about possible futures. As a pilot project, I examine contending narratives about possible futures in the online documents of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development and the accompanying "People's Summit," held in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012. I propose a framework for studying how public interventions into debates about "sustainable futures" and the "green economy" differ on various dimensions of projectivity, including their temporal reach, attention to contingency and causality, and network mapping of future actors. I present a preliminary analysis at the level of narrative and grammar, by analyzing the use of predictive, imperative, and subjunctive verb forms in both programmatic and oppositional texts. I close with a discussion of how different genres of future projection might be put to analytical use in studying processes of interest to social scientists, such as coalition formation, institution building, political mobilization, and policy change.<br>

Abstract: En explorant plus avant le projet des ouvrages théologiques précédents, Au lieu de soi ne distingue pas simplement la pensée de la création de l'onto-théologie mais la sépare aussi de son dépassement heideggérien, qui demeure pour Marion aussi idolâtrique que la métaphysique elle-même. L'ouvrage se concentre ici autour de l'interprétation de l'adonné comme créature par excellence, ou créature iconique — dont le privilège tient à sa temporalité et à sa mutabilité. Indispensable à l'interprétation de saint Augustin comme penseur non métaphysique, l'analyse de la temporalité de l'homme iconique, en démontrant la manière dont la pensée de la création reste hors de l'ontothéologie et de la causa et de l'ego, suggère en même temps que saint Augustin n'affirme le devenir de l'homme qu'en lui enlevant toute innocence et, corrélativement, ne trouve pas de bonheur véritable dans l'amour du mortel comme tel. Extending the project of his prior theological works, Au lieu de soi distinguishes the thought of creation not only from onto-theology but also from its Heideggerian overcoming, which remains for Marion as idolatrous as metaphysics itself Along these lines, the work turns on the interpretation of the adonné as creature par excellence, or as an iconic creature - whose privilege stems from its temporality and mutability. Indispensable to the interpretation of Saint Augustine as non-metaphysical thinker, the analysis of iconic man's temporality, while demonstrating rigorously the way in which the thought of creation remains beyond the onto-theology both of the causa and of the ego, suggests at the same time that Augustine affirms the becoming of man only in depriving it of all innocence and, correlatively, finds no true happiness in love of the mortal as such.<br>

Abstract: Au lieu de soi marque un Haut Lieu du soi. Dans cette perspective, la hauteur du sujet s'acquiert par la verticalité (transcendance), et non pas uniquement par l'horizontalité (immanence). Interrogeant l'ambition d'une approche de saint Augustin du point de vue de saint Augustin lui-même, on montrera d'abord le mérite d'un tel renouvellement dans le cadre de la philosophie comme telle : la question de l'homme, le poids du soi, et le statut de l'èros. Une noble « disputatio théologique et phénoménologique » cependant naîtra dans la confrontation avec d'autres ouvrages (en particulier Dieu, la chair et l'autre. D'Irénée à Duns Scot [PUF, « Épiméthée » , 2008]) : doit-on nécessairement « dépasser » la métaphysique dans un tiers ordre, ou ne convient-il pas plutôt de la « transformer de l'intérieur » dans le geste que semble avoir accompli le Docteur d'Hippone lui-même ? Il en va ici du statut de la philosophie dans son rapport ci la métaphysique et à la théologie, mais aussi de la possibilité d'une « nouvelle pratique phénoménologique de la philosophie médiévale », pour aujourd'hui comme pour demain. In Place of the Self marks what we might call a « high point of the self ». From this exalted perspective the measure of the subject is taken in its verticality (transcendence) and not simply its horizontality (immanence). Jean-Luc Marion approaches St. Augustine from the point of view of St. Augustine himself, and in this article I show first the merit of such an approach within a philosophical framework, its relevance to topics such as the question of man, the burden of the self and the status of eros. A significant « theological and phenomenological disputatio » does, however, arise when In Place of the Self is put up against other works (in particular against God, the Flesh and the Other : from Irenaeus to Duns Scotus [PUF, « Épiméthée » , 2008]). Do we have to « overcome » metaphysics by moving to another order of analysis ? Is it not better to work from the inside, i~<br>

Abstract: Conspiracy accounting is often regarded as an atypical, pathological form of political reasoning, and little research has considered how ordinary social actors may refer to political conspiracies in the course of argument. In this article, we consider the spontaneous use of conspiracy narratives by politically engaged Greek citizens in interview discussions of the Macedonian crisis. Analysis revealed that conspiracy narratives were typically used to challenge dominant representations that attributed the Macedonian crisis to Greek xenophobic nationalism. Specifically, conspiracy accounts were used to dispute assumptions concerning Greece's majority status by representing the political opposition as a consortium rather than a single out-group, by recasting the threat posed to Greece as a matter of realistic rather than symbolic competition, and by extending the historical frame of reference to encompass past and prospective future threats to the Greek people and the Greek state. In conclusion, we note how the use of conspiratorial reasoning may be used to construct complex causal arguments concerning intergroup relations and to challenge dominant ideological assumptions about social hierarchy and political legitimacy. In this respect, conspiratorial reasoning might be regarded as a prototypical form of intergroup representation.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo procura abordar os papéis de sacerdote, chefe e xamã - todos presentes no ngillatun, ritual de fertilidade mapuche - da perspectiva de seus modos diferenciais de travar relações por meio da linguagem. A linguagem, conforme entendida pelos Mapuche do meio rural chileno, não emerge exclusivamente das intenções de falantes individuais, mas igualmente da força (newen) constitutiva da totalidade do ser. Sacerdotes, chefes e xamãs recorrem à fala para alinhar-se a essa força, que por meio deles se atualiza. Uma tal observação lança nova luz sobre o entendimento de Clastres quanto à relação entre chefia e linguagem. Se, acompanhando os Mapuche, enfatizamos as qualidades indexicais da linguagem, em detrimento das simbólicas, vemos que se torna um tanto problemático analisar a linguagem dos chefes em conformidade com um modelo de “troca”, como faz Clastres. This paper seeks to approach the roles of priest, chief, and shaman — all present in the Mapuche ngilUtun fertility ritual -from the perspective of their differential modes of relating through language. Language, as understood by rural Mapuche, emerges not solely from the intentions of individual speakers, but equally from the force -newen -constitutive of all being. Priests, chiefs, and shamans all seek to align themselves through speech to this force which instantiates itself through them. Such an observation casts new light on Clastres' understanding of the relationship between chiefs and language. If we follow Mapuche in emphasizing the indexical rather than symbolic qualities of language, we see that Clastres'analysis of chiefly language as susceptible to a model of "exchange" becomes somewhat problematic.<br>

Abstract: L'article est une recension très développée du dernier livre de J. A. T. Robinson, The Priority of John (Londres, 1985). Il faut distinguer plusieurs aspects dans la thèse de Robinson. Pour la date de l'édition finale de Jean, il vaut mieux retenir les données de la tradition patristique que la critique interne vient confirmer, quoi qu'en dise R. : le recenseur fait la contre-épreuve de son argumentation. L'examen interne de l'évangile laisse à bon droit les critiques hésitant sur l'identité du « disciple que Jésus aimait ». La chronologie de la vie publique a été étudiée par R. avec soin et on peut le suivre dans la plupart des cas ; mais il n'est pas le premier qui donne à Jean une telle préférence sur ce point. On peut être plus hésitant devant sa reconstruction de la « vie de Jésus », dans la mesure où il lui manque une analyse méthologique sérieuse au sujet de la notion d'­« historicité » ; il tend trop à étendre celle-ci aux détails des récits et des paroles de Jésus. Il nuance en principe la « littéralité » de ces paroles dans la catéchèse de Jean ; mais en pratique il a toujours tendance à l'étendre outre-mesure, sans tenir assez compte de leur « relecture » dans la lumière de la Résurrection et en fonction de l'expérience de l'Église. This article is an extended review of J. A. T. Robinsons's last book, The Priority of John (London, 1985). Although Robinson holds for an early date of the final edition of John, the reviewer argues to the contrary, viz., that it is better to retain the patristic tradition of a late date and that internal criticism supports this tradition. Critics are understandably puzzled over the identity of the "disciple whom Jesus loved". The chronology of the public life of Jesus has been carefully studied by R. and one can follow him most of the time, but he is not the first to prefer John on this point. But one hesitates before his reconstruction of the "life of Jesus", since he lacks a methodologically serious analysis of the notion "~<br>

Abstract: La Sagesse personnifiée en Pr 9 est tenue pour une figure féminine. Cette interprétation ne se trouve toutefois pas corroborée par l'étude du chapitre, pas plus que par l'examen des autres passages du livre présentant la Sagesse personnifiée (1,20-33; 8), ou des sept premiers chapitres à l'atmosphère sexuelle et sexuée pourtant prégnante. La Sagesse n'en est pas pour autant masculine: à l'image de Dieu, elle excède toute sexuation. Personified Wisdom in Pr 9 is considered as a feminine figure. This interpretation is nervertheless corroborated neither by the study of this chapter, nor by the analysis of the other passages of the book presenting Personified Wisdom (1,20-33; 8), or of the first seven chapters in which the sexual and gendering atmospher is nevertheless emphasized. However, Wisdom is not masculine: as God, it exceeds all sexual identity.<br>

Abstract: Une réflexion générale sur les concepts linguistiques de diachronie et de synchronie pourrait permettre de porter un nouvel éclairage sur l'herméneutique des textes bibliques. La première partie de cet article décrit donc la genèse et l'évolution de la fameuse dichotomie saussurienne, et son incidence dans l'interprétation des textes. Dans une deuxième étape, les deux catégories de Saussure sont confrontées à d'autres perspectives qui permettent de dépasser la tension entre synchronie et diachronie textuelles, notamment l'approche de Guillaume (endochronie), celle de l'herméneutique antique (métachronie) et celle de la pragmatique (autochronie). Cette comparaison débouche sur une réévaluation de la perspective saussurienne en vue de l'étude du signifié, et notamment de celui des textes bibliques. A consideration of the linguistic concepts of diachrony and synchrony could lead to a greater understanding of Biblical hermeneutics. The first part of this article discusses the origin and the evolution of the well known Saussurian dichotomy, as well as its influence on textual interpretation. In the second part the two Saussurian perspectives are compared with other categories allowing us to go beyond synchronie and diachronie textual opposition: those applied by Guillaume (endochrony), by the first to comment on literary texts (metachrony) and by a pragmatic approach (autochrony). Such a comparison permits us to make a new appraisal of the two Saussurian perspectives in order to achieve a better analysis of the signified, especially with respect to Biblical texts.<br>

Publisher: Society for Applied Anthropology<br>
Issue: i40172767<br>
Date: 4 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): BAHR HOWARD M.<br>
Abstract: Disciplinary specialties and boundaries may impede as well as facilitate understanding. Standard scholarly orientations to the study of Navajos and other ethnic populations manifest many biases of ethnocentrism and a general tendency to stereotype. Specific observer-related tendencies to distort are noted, among them tendencies to understate social dynamics and the degree to which Navajos are functioning parts of wider social systems. The literature on Navajos is a product of changing tools in the hands of changing observers applied to changing communities in the context of ongoing change in the wider societies of both observer and observed. It is argued that "multiplying glimpses," or increasing the number and types of observers and the variety of disciplines and paradigms represented, may reduce observer and position biases that distort existing views of Navajo society. An overview of the massive literature on the Navajo leads to the identification of 21 distinct genres. These genres and other Navajo texts may profitably be viewed in the perspective of textual analysis, broadly defined. Issues of meaning and interpretation are considered, including the reality-language-text nexus, construction of texts, text-context patterns, and the interaction of text, situation, and analyst in interpretation. Appropriate use of existing texts is socially responsible "green research" and should not be professionally stigmatized. It substitutes resource-efficient recycling of discarded and underanalyzed texts for the old expensive, obtrusive colonial patterns of work.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines key implications of praxis theory for applied anthropology. I am concerned with applied anthropology as a communicative and collaborative process and with a critical understanding of the anthropologist's role as consultant, practitioner, and analyst in processes of planned change. The use of praxis as a central analytic leitmotif places "practical" activity, informed by theory, at the center of applied research. The analysis is illustrated through a description of a multi-disciplinary, community-based health research and planning project in seven native communities in Ontario. I examine how practical knowledge and action constrains and transforms academic models of community based development.<br>

Author(s): Merriman Peter<br>
Abstract: What makes the figure of the passenger distinctive as both a subject and an object of mobility and transportation systems? What distinguishes the passenger from other mobile subjectivities, from nomad, flaneur to consumer? How is the passenger represented, practiced and performed? How has the passenger and their experiences been conceived, imagined, manipulated, regulated and engineered? And what kind of human-technology assemblages do passengers enact? Through four short perspectives, this paper seeks to 'profile' the passenger as a distinctive historical and conceptual figure that can help to add greater precision to the analysis of our mobile ways of life. The passenger is explored as an object of speculative theoretical debate, a figure entangled in a host of identities, practices, performances and contexts, and an important way to illuminate key conceptual problematics, from representation to embodiment.<br>

Author(s): Davies Oliver<br>
Abstract: In this paper I set out a phenomenology of social transformation, based on an analysis of the distinctively religious form of communication which underlies the trans-generational and trans-cultural transmission of world traditions, taking Confucianism and Christianity as their representatives. A phenomenological analysis of their communicative structure allows the possibility of a better understanding of what can be learnt from them in the context of contemporary debates in both China and the West on the relations between religion, ethics and politics. This analysis suggests that the ethical consistency of belief and act, which is the necessary condition for the engendering of long-term solidarity in religious community, has significant implications for ethics in politics, and especially for the legitimacy of representational leadership as a focal point for change in society. The paper concludes that the historical experience of world religions can offer new insights into the nature of political leadership and representation in today's globalised world and that the appropriate locus for this inquiry is the present negotiation and re-negotiation of relations between China and the West.<br>

Abstract: Dans la philosophie d'Emmanuel Lévinas, la réflexion éthique s'appuie en grande partie sur une analyse du temps. Ainsi la rencontre d'autrui se vit comme une rupture radicale, qui s'exprime temporellement par le surgissement d'une dimension eschatologique au cœur de l'histoire, brisant la continuité de celle-ci. C'est le développement de ce motif eschatologique dans l'œuvre d'Emmanuel Lévinas que la présente étude entend retracer, afin d'en dégager toute la portée et l'originalité. Rompant avec toute forme de téléologie, c'est la notion même de sens que Lévinas renouvelle. Il s'agira cependant d'évoquer également certains problèmes posés par une telle conception. Peut-on retrancher de l'eschatologie toute dimension d'utopie? In the philosohy of Emmanuel Lévinas, ethical reflection is largely based on an analysis of time. Encounter with others then is a radical break, expressed temporally by the springing up of an eschatological dimension at the heart of history, interrupting is continuity. The present study intends to trace the development of this eschatological motif in the work of Emmanuel Lévinas, in order to show all its scope and originality. Breaking with all forms of teleology, Lévinas renews the very notion of meaning. Certain problems raised by such a conception, however, must also be mentioned. Can all of the utopian dimension be cut off from eschatology?<br>

Abstract: The claim of this essay is that those who study ritual should make fuller use than has been made so far of the literature in philosophy of art. The relevance of aesthetic theory to several questions currently being addressed in ritual studies will be shown, and a model based on what we call "ritual spaces" will serve as the basis for interpreting certain types of ritual. We apply our theory to the ancient Zoroastrian high liturgy, the Yasna. Implications of this interpretive model will also be explored; they include discussions on the following issues: the role of ritual language, the relationship of the various dimensions of ritual, and the basic functions of liturgical performance. The essay begins with analysis and concludes with synthesis.<br>

Abstract: Metaphor, Vibration and Form identifies a process that underlies all ritual enactments. Whether it is Joseph Campbell's analysis of the Hero's journey, Victor Turner's theoretical and experiential interest in symbols, or Charles Laughlin's cycle of meaning, there is at work a particular kind of behavioral transformation system. It begins with the mind and the meanings provided metaphorically for symbols, then proceeds to an intense focus on symbolic sequences in meditation or in ritual dramas, so that the metaphor is taken into the body as physical experience. From this physical "ownership" of the metaphor, the properties associated with it are encouraged, socially and ritually, to come to the surface and be enacted in the form of everyday behavior. Questions of symbolic appropriation, the redundancy of symbol, and professional responsibility are addressed in the concluding remarks.<br>

Author(s): Brown Gavin<br>
Abstract: This paper, theoretical in nature, discusses how the study of ritual has been re-conceptualized in terms of performance theory. This involves firstly defining the difficult term 'performance' and then proceeding to explore how ritual can be recast as a (cultural) performance. Building on this discussion, it is argued that recasting ritual as performance has led the scholar of ritual to pay closer attention to how indeterminacy inheres within all ritual performances. This is explored in two senses. Firstly, by 'privileging the moment' in ritual analysis, the essentially indeterminate nature of meaning in ritual performances becomes evident. Secondly, working with Victor Turner's idea of ritual anti-structure and cultural reflexivity, I explore how rituals are constituted by cultural indeterminacy, a condition most discernible in the execution of ritual action, that is, in performance.<br>

Abstract: En opposition avec la conception linéaire et cumulative du temps dans la géographie classique, l'approche par l'analyse spatiale et les systèmes spatiaux propose de prendre en compte les temporalités multiples et discontinues qui animent l'espace géographique. Ce sont les durées variables des structures spatiales, les événements spatiaux, les phases de transition territoriale et les phénomènes de résilience qui contribuent au changement spatial. In contrast to the linear, cumulative concept of time in conventional geography, spatial analysis and a spatial systems approach offer a way of taking into account the multiple and discontinuous temporalities that punctuate geographical space. These are the variable durations of spatial structures, spatial events and phases of territorial transition, and phenomena of resilience that contribute to spatial change.<br>

Abstract: La question de la métaphore se pose à trois niveaux: celui de l'analyse sémantique (philosophie analytique du langage), celui de sa fonction herméneutique (Paul Ricœur), enfin la question proprement « ontologique » de sa portée pour l'ensemble du discours philosophique comme tel. L'étude présente est une contribution à cette dernière problématique, envisagée à partir du discours de Martin Heidegger. L'étude se fait en trois étapes : liquidation de la représentation métaphysique de la métaphore; la métaphore dans le discours philosophique de Heidegger; retour d'une nouvelle problématique de la métaphore, autour du couple métaphore morte/métaphore vivante. The question of metaphor in philosophy may be asked in three different ways: analysis of its function (anglo-saxon philosophy of language); link with the problem of interpretation (hermeneutics); finally the « ontological » question of its meaning for philosophical discourse as such. The present study is a contribution to the latter question, focused on the philosophy of Martin Heidegger. The question is developped in threee steps: elimination of the metaphysical conception of metaphor; the metaphor inside the philosophical discourse of Heidegger; come-back of a new conception of metaphor, which has not yet been completely shaped out, but which must be related to the opposition of dead and living metaphor.<br>

Abstract: Par sa notion de « lecture » et de « décréation », Simone Weil ébauche une philosophie critique en tant qu'analyse perceptive du réel que nos jugements font éclater, à tout instant, en une infinité de textes valorisés. Guidée par la méthode reflexive d'Alain et de Lagneau, elle dépasse la problématique phénoménologique des actes interprétatifs dans une herméneutique métaphysique. Le désir constitue alors le fondement de toute métaphorisation du réel à partir d'une conscience gestuelle où les signes, les symboles et les concepts préfigurent une transcendance absente, mais néanmoins réelle. Saisir, à la suite de Kant, cette contradiction en tout objet, c'est fonder la pratique perceptive sur le modèle christologique qui remplit par excellence la fonction d'une « métaphore réelle ». L'exigence proprement philosophique d'une telle synthèse permet de reconnaître une valeur originale à S. Weil dans le débat moderne autour de l'élaboration du signifié. Through her ideas of « lecture » and « décréation », Simone Weil sketches out a critical Philosophy as well as a perspective analysis of that which is real which our judgments, at every moment, split up into an endless number of valued texte. Guided by the reflexive method of Alain and of Lagneau, she goes beyond the phenomenological problematic of interpretative acts into a metaphysical hermeneutic. Desire then constitutes the foundation of every métaphorisation of the real starting with a consciousness in wich signs, symbols and concepts foreshadow an absent, but nevertheless real, transcendence. Taking hold of this contradiction in every object, following upon Kant, is to establish the perceptive practice on the christological model which fulfills belter than any other the function of a "real metaphor". The properly philosophical demand of such a synthesis allows us to recognize an original value in Simone Weil within the modern debate concerning the elaboration of that which is signified.<br>

Abstract: Cette étude propose une approche « textologique » du texte scripturaire, à l'interface de la philosophie de la religion et de la philosophie du texte. Elle repose sur deux hypothèses : 1. penser, c'est interroger; la pensée religieuse est une interrogation sur le salut. 2. le sens se textualise en achevant de saturer les trois dimensions de la signifiance (référence, communicabililé, symbolisme). Trois raisons sont données, après le textual turn en philosophie, pour distinguer « texte » et « discours » : structurelle, « érotétique », clause de clôture du Canon des Écritures. Du même coup, le rôle de l'expérience religieuse est dérivé. La méthode est celle de l'analyse conceptuelle des problématiques. This study proposes a "textological" approach to scriptural text, at the interface of the philosophy of religion with the philosophy of the text. It avances two hypothesis: 1. to think is to question; religious thought raises the question of salvation. 2. the meaning textualizes itself by completely saturating the three dimensions of signification (reference, communicabiliiy, symbolism). Three reasons are given, following the textual turn in philosophy, for distinguishing between "text" and "discourse": structure, "erotetics", and the closing clause of the scriptural Canon. At the same time the role of religious experience is explained. The method used is that of the conceptual analysis of problematics.<br>

Abstract: On donne des exemples de difficultés rencontrées par la théologie classique quand elle se réapproprie certaines catégories d'ordre philosophique. Après avoir étendu la notion de category-mistake à la logique du questionnement, on illustre par une étude de cas certains glissements, dérives, accaparements qui posent des « problèmes catégoriaux ». Une approche interrogative et textologique permet de les analyser selon un partenariat entre théologie fondamentale et une certaine philosophie (critique) de la religion. Les prémisses de cette approche qui inaugure un nouveau type de théologien et de philosophe non retranché, sans ancillarité ni sous-traitance, ont été exposées dans un article antérieur sur « la pensée expressément religieuse » (chère à Balthasar) et sa catégorisation spécifique. On prépare ici un travail ultérieur consacré aux conditions de légitimité de la reprise problématique d'un ordre à l'autre. Examples are given of the difficulties that arise when classical theology apropriates certain categories of a philosophical order. After taking the notion of category-mistake over into the logic of the questioning the study of certain cases illustrates how certain slips, spoliations, or a certain going astray, lead to « categorial problems. » An interrogative and textological approach allows their analysis via a partnership between fundamental theology and a certain (critical) philosophy of Religion. The premises of this approach which heralds a new type of unentrenched theologian and philosopher, free from subordination or belittlement, were the subject of a previous exposé on « expressly religious thought » (dear to Balthasar) and its specific categorisation. This article prepares a further work on the conditions of legitimate transfer of problematic from one order to another.<br>

Abstract: Dans l'Essai sur le mal, Jean Nabert, poursuivant une démarche déjà engagée dans les Éléments pour une éthique, affronte la question de la possibilité d'une justification de l'existence humaine, L'A. propose une analyse des grandes étapes de cet essai Dans le ch. 1, il décrit les diverses figures d'un mal excédant le champ défini par les normes de la moralité, et recherche les conditions de possibilité d'une telle expérience. Dans les ch. 2 à 4, il poursuit l'analyse de l'expérience d'un mal intérieur au vouloir propre et que dissimule la réduction de celui-ci à la transgression des normes d'un sujet autonome, et il examine la compréhension de soi du sujet de l'expérience impliquée dans cette dimension du mal. Dans le dernier chapitre, il pose la question des limites de ce que permet d'espérer une « approche de la justification » par un moi tel qu'il s'est d'abord compris par réflexion sur ces données fondamentales de son expérience; au sommet de cette approche, il aborde la question de la possibilité du pardon. Pursuing along the same lines as in his Éléments pour une éthique, Jean Nabert, in his Essai sur le mal, tackles the question of the possibility of justifying human existence. The author proposes to analyze the major stages in this essay. In chapter 1, he describes diverse representations of evil that exceed the boundaries as defined by the norms of morality, and researches the conditions in which such experiences are possible. In chapters 2 to 4, he continues the analysis of evil intrinsic to will itself, which is obscured by the reduction of this evil to the transgression of an autonomous subject's limits, and examines the subject's comprehension of self when implicated in this dimension of evil. In the last chapter, the question is asked of the limitations of that which an « approach to justification » may permit to be hoped for by a self such as first understood upon reflexion of the fundamental data of his experience; at the apex of this approach, he ad~<br>

Abstract: Relecture de l'inédit de Jean Nahert: « La conscience peut-elle se comprendre? » dans l'optique de la philosophie herméneutique contemporaine. Dès 1934, la philosophie de Nahert opère une percée en direction du concept herméneutique d'autocompréhension, même si sa formulation originale du problème exige de quiconque défend le concept de « raison herméneutique » un très sévère « examen de conscience ». C'est ce que montre une analyse de la formule « l'inquiétude du se comprendre » dont on rencontre de nombreuses occurrences dans le texte. Même si le terme « désir de Dieu » n'apparaît pas dans ce texte de 1934, on peut y discerner l'annonce de la thèse que « ce sont les conditions de possibilité de la conscience de soi qui fondent le désir de Dieu ». Rereading Jean Nabert's unpublished « Can Conscience Understand Itself » through the eyes of contemporary hermeneutical philosophy. As early as 1934, Nabert's philosophy makes a breakthrough in the direction of the hermeneutical concept of autocomprehension even if, in its original formulation, it demands a very severe « examination of conscience » of whomever defends the concept of « hermeneutical reason ». This is shown by an analysis of the expression « the unrest of understanding oneself » repeated several times in the text And even if the expression « desire for God » does not appear in this 1934 text, one can discern there the beginnings of the thesis that « it is the conditions of the possibility of conscience of self that found the desire for God ».<br>

Abstract: Confrontation de diverses lectures d'un récit, d'une scène, d'une tradition religieuse. À partir de la figure évangélique de la pécheresse (Luc 7), les analyses philosophiques du pardon s'inscrivent chez le jeune Hegel dans une réflexion sur l'opposition de la loi (le châtiment) et de la réconciliation (l'amour). Dans son Esthétique, les traités de l'art romantique et de la peinture voient en la Madeleine la figuration d'une beauté où intériorité et extériorité s'accordent harmonieusement. Dans divers écrits sur la religion, le même personnage, qui évoque les traits de la belle âme, n'est pas étranger aux méditations sur destin de Jésus, le pardon des offenses et l'idée de la grâce. Ces diverses représentations induisent une pensée en rupture avec d'autres approches philosophiques de la grâce et du pardon (Spinoza, Kant). Une deuxième partie évoque la pécheresse, souvent confondue avec d'autres femmes des Évangiles, telle qu'on la retrouve chez des écrivains de la spiritualité française (Bérulle 1627, Charles de Saint Paul 1628, Lacordaire 1859) et chez les peintres de l'époque baroque. L'article se termine par une étude des nombreuses évocations de la pécheresse chez Kierkegaard. À la différence de la spéculation philosophique ou des « élévations » mystiques, c'est dans une méditation toujours au plus près de la lettre même du Nouveau Testament que sont alors développés de manière existentielle les thèmes du repentir et du pardon. A look at diverse readings of a story, a scene, a religious tradition. Taking the gospel figure of the adulterous woman (Luke 7) as a starting point, the youthful Hegel sets his philosophical analysis of forgiveness in a meditation on Law (Punishment) versus Reconciliation (Love). In his Aesthetics, the treatises on the romantic art movement and on paintings see in Mary Magdalen the figuration of a beauty in which interiority and exteriority are harmonised. In various writings on religion, the same character, now the figuration of the bea~<br>

Abstract: Yves Bonnefoy est plus reconnu encore par sa réflexion sur la poésie que par son œuvre même. À partir de l'analyse d'un texte de 1959, on étudie cette conception, dont les mots-clés sont : finaude, présence, espoir, ici et maintenant, absolu; les références décisives : Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Léopardi. On complète grâce à des écrits ultérieurs, qui témoignent contre l'univers des notions, l'occultisme surréaliste, la clôture linguistique, et insistent sur la forme, le son de la poésie. Yves Bonnefoy is better known for his reflections on poetry than for his own works. Here based on an analysis of a text from 1959, the author studies Bonnefoy's perspective of which the key-words are perfection, presence, hope, the here and the now, the absolute; the principal influences are : Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Leopardi The study concludes with a consideration of his later works, which testify against the universe of notions, surrealist occultism, linguistic boxs, while insisting on form and sound of poetry.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur se propose de vérifier l'affirmation de Lavelle selon laquelle l'ouvrage de 1937, De l'Acte, se serait progressivement développé comme une synthèse complète de sa philosophie. Or il existe, à l'état dactylographié, une version antérieure de ce livre, qui permet de comprendre combien l'aisance presque trop grande des analyses de 1937 cache en fait une élaboration lente et un effort continu. La version inédite insiste sur l'intemporalité transcendantale de l'acte, et sur l'impersonnalité de l'acte fondateur de toutes les existences personnelles. Ces thèses seront abandonnées en 1937. On analyse ensuite l'article « Être et Acte » et la conférence de la société française de philosophie sur « Acte créateur et acte réflexif », où est discutée la position de Jean Nabert. Les thèses de De l'Acte montrent une progression de l'identité de l'être et de l'acte (dans l'acte d'être) jusqu'à l'acte en sa forme la plus haute, l'acte d'amour. Situer cette œuvre capitale implique qu'on ait bien compris l'interprétation du sensible comme de la donnée matérielle qui doit être spiritualisée. L'expérience extérieure du sensible s'oppose à l'expérience intérieure de l'esprit. Et l'acte est l'œuvre de l'être spirituel. L'ontologie dynamique de Lavelle est une affirmation de la liberté humaine comme participation à l'acte créateur divin. Divin ou humain, l'être est subjectif parce que libre. Ainsi Lavelle s'inscrit dans la tradition platonicienne moderne, celle d'Avicenne d'abord, celle de Hegel ensuite. The author proposes to verify Lavelle's assertion that the 1937 work, De l'Acte, would be progressively developed as a complete synthesis of his philosophy. Now there exists in typewritten state an earlier version of this book, which allows us to see the extent to which the almost excessive facility of analyses of 1937 in fact conceals a slow development and a continuous effort. The unedited version insists upon the transcendental atemporality of act, and upon the impersonality of ~<br>

Abstract: La philosophie herméneutique contemporaine comporte, dans sa démarche fondamentale, une rencontre avec la pensée fondatrice de Descartes que l'on peut nommer son « moment cartésien ». Celle thèse est vérifiée successivement à propos de la « phénoménologie matérielle » de Michel Henry, directement liée à une interprétation du cogito cartésien développée dans la Généalogie de la psychanalyse ; puis en dégageant les motifs herméneutiques impliqués dans la critique du cogito développée par Heidegger; enfin en analysant, dans la phénoménologie herméneutique de Paul Ricœur, la signification du « cogito blessé » , par rapport au conflit des interprétations et dans les perspectives de l'identité narrative pour une nouvelle conception du sujet. In making its fundamental approach, contemporary interpretative philosophy inevitably encounters the basic thinking of Descartes, resulting in what may be called a « Cartesian touch ». Successive examples of this are to be found in (1) Michel Henry's "physical-object phenomenology", which is directly linked with one interpretation of the Cartesian cogito developed in The Genealogy of Psycho-analysis; then in (2) Heidegger's critique of the cogito, if one isolates the interpretative aims which are implied therein; and finally in (3) Paul Ricœur's interpretative phenomenology, if one analyses the meaning of the "wounded cogito", bearing in mind the conflict of interpretation and the possibility that the identical data could give rise to new conclusions on the subject.<br>

Abstract: Through an analysis of the 40-year history of conflicts triggered by the repeated attempts to expand the Malpensa airport in northern Italy, this paper seeks to show the heuristic strength of using the concept of modes of valuation of the environment to discuss the transformations of environmental critique over time in their relation to social change. I argue that, beyond empirical specifics, the trajectory witnessed in this case – from public participation to place-based resistance – reflects more generalized dynamics that can be found in many other conflicts over large infrastructural projects in contemporary Europe. The article is organized as follows: in the first section I briefly introduce the concept of modes of valuation of the environment, which is inspired by recent work in pragmatic sociology. In particular, I distinguish between universal, local, and emplaced modes of valuation. In the second and third sections I provide an analysis of the struggles against the Malpensa airport expansion from 1970 to 2014. Here, I distinguish three phases of mobilization, which I discuss in terms of the transformations that can be observed in the arguments that actors develop to fight or support the airport expansion. I argue that these transformations are articulated not only with changing action repertoires but also with evolving social and sociotechnical imaginarles that convey specific understandings of the environment as a matter of political concern. This analysis shows that, far from being simply a case of citizens' resistance to change, the mobilization against the Malpensa airport has contributed to producing the cultural basis of an increased collective reflexivity about the many values that the environment takes on among community members in the airport region. In the final section I discuss some hypotheses concerning what modes of valuation of the environment reveal about the emergence of a new radicalism in environmental struggles.<br>

Author(s): Joad Jonathan<br>
Abstract: Recognizing the contingent entanglement between historiography's social and political roles and the conception of the discipline as purely factual, this essay provides a detailed analysis of "revision" and its connection to "revisionism." This analysis uses a philosophical approach that begins with the commonplaces of our understanding as expressed in dictionaries, which are compared and contrasted to display relevant confusions. The essay then turns to examining the questions posed by History and Theory's Call for Papers announcing its Theme Issue on Revision in History, and, where philosophically relevant, answers them. The issue of paradigm change proved to be quite significant and required particular attention. A "paradigm" is analyzed in terms of Quine's "web of belief," and that web is itself explained as an ongoing process of revision, in analogy with Rawls's concept of pure procedural justice. Adopting this approach helps clarify the entanglement between politics and historiographical revision.<br>

Abstract: With positivist and technocratic notions still prevalent, Paul Healy's (1986) insightful effort to advance "interpretive policy inquiry" both underscores the limitations of conventional analysis and helps us to grasp the policy process in human terms. Yet the article falls short of a systematic presentation of the interpretive position and, in doing so, reveals the limitations of that approach: the need for an explicitly critical posture becomes clear. This point is made with particular attention to a pre-positivist figure, Machiavelli.<br>

Article Title: Northrop Frye and the Problem of Spiritual Authority<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219691<br>
Date: 10 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Barthes Charles F.<br>
Abstract: Northrop Frye's recent criticism confronts the contemporary problem raised most powerfully by the Vietnam War-can we find a telos or definition of man on which we can ground our moral reactions and our visions of human development. Frye establishes this telos by an analysis of origins. Contained in a civilization's statements of "concern," in its imaginative treatments of its own condition, one can find an underlying structure of desire which defines the ends of man. This structure and the recurrent images it produces then can serve as the middle terms people use to justify and value their actions. Frye shares his treatment of mediation with contemporary Hegelians like Sartre, Lukács, and Ricoeur, but grounds his absolute in tradition rather than in ideal absolutes or posited evolutionary patterns. Frye's idea of mediation also provides an ethical model for literary criticism: the critic tries to combine literature as product and as cultural possession by interpreting his materials as projections of imaginative desire. Furthermore, we can use Frye to criticize the relativist denial of origins in structuralist critics like Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.<br>

Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i412005<br>
Date: 7 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Woeber Stefan<br>
Abstract: This article looks at the beginnings of anti-apartheid/anticolonial literary cultures in Johannesburg and Maputo (then Lourenqo Marques) after the Second World War. It pays specific attention to the ways in which they attempted to harness aesthetics of "newness." By focusing on the influential journals Drum (1951-) and Itinerário (1941-1955), I argue that both journals tapped into transnational intellectual currents such as Harlem Renaissance writing, but that the discrete discursive networks of English and Portuguese contributed to a differentiation of their aesthetic approaches. Itinerdrio acted out an avantgarde-like resistance to bourgeois/colonial culture. Drum was market-driven and achieved in its early phase a compromise between a racially circumscribed mass-cultural appeal and the literate ideals of mission-educated South African blacks. These differences can then be factored into an analysis of persistent differences between the literatures of South Africa and Mozambique.<br>

Author(s): NeutresAbstract: En adaptant Le Parrain, le best-seller de Mario Puzo, Francis Ford Coppola est confronté à plusieurs récits-I'histoire de la Mafia américaine, son imagerie mythique, I'interrogation identitaire italo-américaine-, auxquels il mêle des souvenirs personnels et l'héritage culturel légué par sa communauté. Dépassant la simple commande commerciale, il réussit à établir à l'écran, via la fiction, sa part de vérité. Le premier film sera complété par deux suites. Le temps de constitution de cette trilogie, près de vingt ans, renvoie à deux autres durées exceptionnellement longues: la durée du métrage final des trois films (près de neufheures) et celle de la période décrite (quatre-vingt ans de l'histoire des États-Unis). Brisant la linéarité classique, la trilogie du Parrain souligne la pertinence de l'outil cinématographique dans la construction d'un récit aux temporalités multiples. Ces temporalités concernent aussi bien le spectateur que le cinéaste lui-même, comme nous l'indique l'édition DVD, outil précieux pour une analyse historienne. Face à ses propres images, Coppola transforme la «revision» en travail de mémoire: manière supplémentaire de surmonter l'apparent paradoxe entre le film hollywoodien et le récit intime. /// Whilst adapting The Godfather, Mario Puzo's bestselling novel, Francis Ford Coppola was faced with several stories-the history of the American Mafia, the mythical image associated with it, the questioning of Italian-American identity-which he managed to combine with his own life experiences and the cultural legacy inherited from his own community. Going beyond a simple commissioned film, he succeeds in transposing onto screen, through fiction, his very own truth. This first installment was complemented by two sequels. The twenty-year time-frame within which this trilogy was made is echoed by two other remarkably long periods: the full running-time of the three films when viewed consecutively (close to nine hours) and the historical period within which~<br>

Article Title: "Say First What Cause": Ricoeur and the Etiology of Evil in Paradise Lost<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219783<br>
Date: 1 1, 1979<br>
Author(s): Webber John S.<br>
Abstract: Paradise Lost traces evil through three inceptions-Satanic, Adamic, and historical. Each origin seems to envision a different etiology: Satanic evil springs exclusively from the self in an instant of radical "Pelagian" freedom. Adamic evil emerges from the ambiguous interplay between self and seductive environment. Historical evil contaminates the whole race by means of necessary "Augustinian" inheritance. Ricoeur's analysis of the "Adamic Myth" and original sin clarifies etiological traditions Milton assimilates from Christian symbol, myth, and dogma. Through Ricoeur, we can identify the contrasting modalities of evil (inherited and imitative, physical and moral, ontological and existential, necessary and free, communal and individual) fused in Paradise Lost. Ricoeur's work reveals Milton's text to be a subtly inclusive etiological myth, one whose complex genesis of evil recovers Scripture's fullness of meaning in a new mythopoesis.<br>

Author(s): Walens Michael<br>
Abstract: This paper outlines an approach to historical narratives that replaces the atomism of actor and event with a model that stresses the integration of event, narrative, and historical practice. The notion of contact as an event is addressed in the context of the Northwest Coast. A Heiltsuk English narrative dealing with contact is analyzed in the light of Heiltsuk cultural data. The analysis centers on Jakobson's distinction between metaphor and metonymy and leads to the conclusion that for the Heiltsuk, contact with Europeans resulted in the acquisition of a linear historicity. Finally, notions of temporality are examined with respect to historical practice and North American Indian cultures.<br>

Publisher: American University in Cairo. Department of English and Comparative Literature<br>
Issue: i222581<br>
Date: 1 1, 1967<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur Nabila<br>
Abstract: The "Myth of Creation" in its East African formulation is the central chapter in a book entitled, The Sacred Meadows, by an Egyptian anthropologist who did his field work in the early seventies among the Lamu community in Kenya on the shores of the Indian Ocean. The translator, in her own introduction to the translation, presents the outline of the book and provides the geographical and cultural context of the community in question. The author, in this translated chapter, sets out by exposing his theoretical position which combines both Structuralism and Functionalism. Insights from Claude Lévi-Strauss and Bronislaw Malinowski as well as those of Paul Ricoeur and Victor Turner join to develop the author's notion of myth and its symbolic mode. Then the text of the myth, in its Lamuan formulation, is narrated, followed by a close reading and analysis of its binary oppositions, mediating terms, and the underlying existential contradiction at its crux. Angels, jinn, light, fire, earth, wind, water, Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Satan, serpent, etc. are the agents of this sacred narrative and cosmic drama. The textual unfolding of the myth is followed by an analysis, which makes use of the structural method and explores the semantic connotations of Swahili words and idioms to explain the logic of the symbolic exchange and the rigor of thought. The themes of unity and multiplicity and their different combinations are delineated in this analysis and the repetitions and their relation to transcendence are explained.<br>

Date: 12 1, 1934<br>
Author(s): Wisan Jean K.<br>
Abstract: A properly sociological definition of the concept of discourse does not exist because the notion has never been detached from the linguistic sphere. Not only linguists and semiologists, but also sociologists, use the word primarily as a linguistic category. This article attempts to define the concept of discourse sociologically. It is argued that a sociologically defined notion should be dissociated from the linguistic realm. As a linguistic category, 'discourse' is either used as a synonym for language or text, or is closely associated with one of these notions. 'Discourse' in a sociological sense should refer to a class of texts. This definition confers upon the concept of discourse an intertextual dimension. Defined in this way, the category can not only become an operative sociological concept, but it also becomes autonomous and is no longer reducible to linguistic or paralinguistic conceptual entities, such as text or language. No longer confined to the linguistic realm, the concept can designate a particular entity which possesses its own existence. Discourse can become a thing in itself. The argument is presented in three parts. The first is a critique of the current definitions of the concept 'discourse'. The second proposes, as an alternative, a sociological definition of discourse. Finally the third part applies this new definition in a sociological analysis of journalism.<br>

Publisher: Routledge Journals for the London School of Economics and Political Science<br>
Issue: i225019<br>
Date: 12 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Travers Andrew<br>
Abstract: Analysis of a sequence of literary frames suggests that a heightened experience of interactional reality is also anomically constructive of the frame. In each of 16 frames, Durkheimian anomie neither destroys the frame's integrity nor renders its routine grounds unintelligible, as Goffman and Garfinkel would claim it must. Paradoxically, anomie ritually intensifies the frame. The selves in the paper's sequence of highly ritualized frames are not routine selves, however. They are 'strangers to themselves'. The analysis shows how Mead's 'I' can re-emerge from Goffman's ritual thinking - where the 'I' is collapsed into an interactionally-bound 'me' - as an original manifestation of great importance to interactants, and therefore to society as well. (Parenthetically it is also argued that selves need an element of rituality in order to be selflike and that it is interactional rituality which guarantees the evolution of social life beyond given frames, corpora, cultural repertoires, and collective representations.) The idea that interactants can be strangers to themselves is an advance on Goffman's and Garfinkel's accounts of interactional selfhood, but one that problematizes the prosecution of the interaction sociology that Goffman and Garfinkel pioneer, since strangers to themselves disappear in normal sociological appearances.<br>

Author(s): Zharova James V.<br>
Abstract: An approach to sociocultural analysis based on the ideas of Vygotsky, Bakhtin, and others is used to provide the foundation for discussing narratives as "cultural tools." The production of official, state sponsored historical narratives is examined from this perspective, and it is argued that this production process may be shaped as much by dialogic encounters with other narratives as by archival information. These claims are harnessed to examine the production of post-Soviet Russian history textbooks, especially their presentation of the events surrounding the Russian Civil War of 1918-20.<br>

Abstract: Methods and results of the structural study of myth and Old Testament source and textual criticism are applied in this analysis of the myth of Moses. The context of the myth is first traced out through the historical circumstances conditioning the myth's textual development, and the major contradiction underlying the myth is identified. The myth is then shown to have served as a model through which the Israelites could resolve their conflicting political and religious aspirations through the details of Moses' life as presented in the myth.<br>

Abstract: A discussion of the concept of power provides the theoretical basis for a semantic analysis of a case in which power changes hands. It is argued that a relationship of power presumes the capacity of ideas to require submission and that changes of power accompany changes in actors' conceptions of reality. The semantic analysis points to a pan-Indonesian conception of how power is created and destroyed. [power, political anthropology, symbolic analysis, complex organizations, Indonesia]<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i226345<br>
Date: 8 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Whitten Michael F.<br>
Abstract: In their interpretations of magical acts and utterances, anthropologists frequently argue that magic and technology are informed by two different kinds of logic, the former "expressive" in character, the latter "instrumental." A close analysis of magical hunting songs used by the Aguaruna of Amazonian Peru reveals that the songs are part of a general ordering process that encompasses the strategic use of thoughts, speech, objects, and acts to achieve practical ends. In Aguaruna thought the expressive imagery of magical songs is an instrumental tool that shapes events in the performer's world.

Article Title: Signs in the Social Order: Riding a Songhay Bush Taxi<br>
Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i226338<br>
Date: 11 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Thompson Paul<br>
Abstract: In any field of experience anthropologists are confronted by spates of signs, many of which they fail to perceive. By way of an analysis of the mundane activities associated with riding a Songhay bush taxi in the Republic of Niger, this article probes the reflexive process through which anthropologist and ethnographic other learn to interpret the signs that comprise the discourse of social action. Having been confronted repeatedly with the signs of the other's universe, anthropologists may not only gain a new awareness of the sociocultural systems they seek to uncover but may also realize the limitations of their knowledge. Through what Dilthey called the hermeneutic, anthropologists will be more able to proceed profoundly and accurately toward an understanding of those signs that give substance and order to the complexities of social universes.

Issue: i226367<br>
Date: 2 1, 1977<br>
Author(s): el Zein Michael<br>
Abstract: The relationships among texts, readers, and moral community are explored in order to understand the dissonance and interplay of personal and textual authority in local Islamic practice (Sunni, Shaf'i branch) among Malagasy-speaking villagers of Mayotte (Comoro Islands, East Africa). A political economy of knowledge approach is linked to an analysis of recitation as a ritual activity in which illocutionary force exceeds referential meaning. The discussion has relevance for the understanding of the relationship between religious knowledge, power, and action in Islamic societies as well as of the interface between the oral and the written more generally.

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i226400<br>
Date: 5 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): White Michael<br>
Abstract: Using a broadly Aristotelian framework I propose poetic form as a means for distinguishing historicities. I analyze Sakalava performances of possession by royal ancestors as the creative production of a kind of history, distinguish it from a dominant occidental model of history, and elaborate the chronotope on which it is based and the heteroglossia and historical consciousness it enables. I argue that Sakalava spirit possession has a strongly realist bent and suggest the interest of poiesis for anthropological analysis and comparison more generally.

Author(s): Zola Matthew<br>
Abstract: Using a form of narrative analysis, I explore how marriage in contemporary China influences people's identity formation as "men with disabilities." In particular, I examine how local practices of marriage exclusion shape the definition, marginalization, and experience of men who have trouble walking. This discussion is more phenomenological than most previous accounts of men's experiences of marriage in Chinese Society. [marriage, disability, identity, body, manhood, narrative, China]<br>

Date: 6 1, 1966<br>
Author(s): Watts Karin R.<br>
Abstract: This paper focuses upon the prevalent complementary definitions of myth and history and questions their analytic utility with reference to literary documents that bespeak the transition between mythic and historic cognition. In the style of ethnosemantic analysis, these definitions are treated as a semantic domain and subjected to formal analysis. The components elicited constitute a new definition - more precisely, a two-dimensional model of the relationship between myth and history. Subsequently, the model is applied to a series of books from the Bible with the conclusion that men and women are structurally equal since, in their roles as social actors, both represent different components of myth as well as history.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i227576<br>
Date: 6 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Williams Anne M.<br>
Abstract: Recent narrative analysis in medical anthropology provides keys to both the personal meaning of illness and the historical, cultural, and institutional shaping of that experience. Yet Western psychiatric thinking and practice continue to view schizophrenic discourse as closed to interpretation. Caught in this "closed text," the self would seem obliterated. But using narratives of schizophrenia and homelessness, this essay proposes a different understanding of schizophrenic alterity. The openness of the text-as-experience is re-created collectively, from outside the subject's narration: the subject's "self" is construction through the added perspectives of his or her interlocutors in the role of storymakers.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i227580<br>
Date: 6 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Žižek Georgina<br>
Abstract: This essay uses the work of psychoanalyst Melanie Klein to reopen the dialogue between anthropology and psychoanalysis. It argues that Kleinian concepts enhance an anthropology that seeks out both intersubjective and intrasubjective difference and disjuncture, and it demonstrates the uses of major Kleinian concepts for addressing classic anthropological problems, including gender classification and the analysis of persecution in witchcraft and sorcery systems. Applying Kleinian concepts to the analysis of cultural-historical process, it shows how splitting and denial may be central to the reproduction and hegemony of dominant cultural systems through time and addresses the question of how to theorize the relationship among dominant cultural systems, social differentiation, and individual subjectivities.<br>

Author(s): Webster William A.<br>
Abstract: Arthur C. Clarke once wrote that "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." The language of magic is evident in much of popular discourse about computers. A content analysis of Time magazine reporting on computers and related technologies over a ten-year period revealed that 36 percent of all these stories used explicitly magical or religious language. Together with a qualitative analysis of implicitly magical themes, the patterns in Time's reporting reveal how magic language was used as one strategy to stabilize and close the technological frame of personal computers in the mid-1980s.<br>

Author(s): Selzer Greg<br>
Abstract: The flight of Voyager 1 past Saturn in 1981 provides an occasion for a semiotic comparison of reports in French newspapers (Le Monde and Libération), a popular science article (in, La Recherche), and specialized scientific articles in Nature. The texts differ in the distance supposed between reader and writer, in the treatment of human and nonhuman actors, in characterization of the event and assumptions about readers' interest in it, and in their narrative structure. The analysis shows that popularizations and specialized scientific articles are not related in a simple dichotomy or scale and cannot be explained by a notion of the "general public"; rather, the various types of texts must be considered in terms of more complex relations between what are called in semiotic terms the enunciator and the enunciatee.<br>

Abstract: This paper applies the critical theory of Jürgen Habermas to theoretical issues in criminology. Since criminologists have generally neglected the critical tradition, we include a brief summation of concerns central to critical sociology. These concerns include a defense of reason and a provocative critique of both culture and science. We then apply the critical model to themes and issues in criminology. Specifically, our analysis uses Habermas' three "knowledge constitutive interests" to reconceptualize cultural explanations of crime, to address the linkage between macro-and micro-levels of explanation, and to outline a novel interpretation of the relationship between culture and social structure. We conclude with a critique of Habermas' prescription for social change.<br>

Abstract: Summary: On the Relations between the Sociology and the Semiology of Music. The aim of this article is to inquire what relations are possible between the semiology and the sociology of music. The first section attempts a definition of semiology: it may be understood as the science of signs, as the use of linguistic models in the description of non-linguistic fields, or as a programme of research specific to the humanities and the social sciences which distinguishes between the aspects of production, reception and the immanence of the meaning in question. The second section, through a critical analysis of a text by Barthes, explores the question of whether semiology can be understood as the science of musical ideologies. It demonstrates that semiology has no specific methodology with which to meet these problems. The third section investigates the possibility of using semiology to assist in reconciling musical and social structures. After briefly recalling several positions on this subject, we suggest that the 'neutral level' of description, presented above as one of the elements of semiological analysis, can serve as a necessary preliminary to the harmonising of musical with social structures.<br>

Abstract: The new information technologies have transformed reading practices in meaningful ways, promoting other skills and competences, and activating new ways of interacting with reading devices. Based on a qualitative study conducted in Mexico City, this article aims to explore how communicational innovations have had an impact on a specific type of reader, whose distinctive feature is to have an intense and/or enjoyable relationship with the act of read: the cultural creators. The analysis of these practices and the reflection as a result of this, allows us to observe that, far from creating isolated readers, the emerging technologies contribute to develop, in other ways,the potential for the sociability of reading, thus stimulating work networks and collaborative projects.<br>

Abstract: This article focuses on the concepts of deliberative democracy and African palaver to conceptually (re) formulate and make intelligible the practices and performance of governance in Africa, with the aim of achieving a genuine normalization of societal behavior. Based on an analysis of the texts and a synthesis of texts analyzed, and drawing on the evidence at the present time, this is about establishing that the African palaver, often excluded from the cartography of official epistemology and relegated to the level of indigenous knowledge and practice, can define the conditions of possibility and feasibility for deliberative democracy, a political paradigm deemed dominant universal. However, the issue is that of cognitive decentering. How can one imagine that African conceptual categories, labeled as cheesy and reduced to the mere field of ethnological studies, can interact and correlate with modern recipes, with the idea of starting a process of governability, the realization of which is resilient democracy?<br>

Abstract: Taking as its starting point classical themes developed since the Greeks, the present study aims to suggest that today a threshold may be crossed by means of philosophical reflection on music. Without disregarding the meaning of the concepts of imitation and expression (expressivo), the phenomenology of the inner consciousness of time may offer new possibilities, in parallel with structural analysis. Literary criticism and methodological consideration of the task of the historian have already exploited these possibilities. Why should music not do the same? Without claiming that phenomenological analyses can found a new musical aesthetic, they may be considered worthy of the attention of musicologists.<br>

Abstract: Abstract. One of the main issues in the long-form census controversy concerned the relationship between science and politics. Through analysis of the arguments and underlying assumptions of four influential and exemplary interventions that were made in the name of science, this paper outlines a normative account of this relationship. The paper nuances the science-protective ideals that critics invoked and argues that such conceptual resources are needed if science is to be protected from undue political encroachment. However, in their zeal to defend the rights of science critics claimed for it more than its due, eclipsing the value dimension of policy decisions and failing to respect the role of politics as the rightful locus of decision making for value issues. An adequate normative account of the relationship between science and politics in public policy must be capable not only of protecting science from politics but also of protecting politics from science.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the literary genre of the written Hasidic homilies of Rabbi Aryeh Leib Alter (1848-1905), known as
         Sfat Emet. The discussion is conducted through the lens of Paul Ricoeur’s concept of “the work of the text.” This concept encompasses the elements of composition and codification of the text as well as the desired effects of the reading process. The analysis identifies the features that are at work in the homilies, along with the type of hermeneutic activity into which the reader is drawn. This activity is designed to cause the reader to become open, in new or renewed ways, toward various dimensions of reality. The article suggests that the Hasidic homily is designed to act upon the reader in and through the very reading process: what the reader learns is not confined to the content of the homily but is first and foremost due to the nature of the reading experience itself.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the connection between state order and selfunderstandings in everyday life through a case study of the “Boarding School for Gifted Disadvantaged” in Israel. It includes content analysis of governmental protocols that documented the establishment of the boarding school (governmental constitution of a new self-concept) and interviews with sixty of its graduates (self-understandings in everyday life). The findings reveal how the new cultural order invented a new selfhood, “gifted disadvantaged,” previously unknown in Israel. This category is based on structural distinctions between being “naturally” gifted versus the governmental constitution of gifted status. Interviews with graduates indicate that they experience selfhood as a philanthropic gift bestowed on them by the state of Israel and voice their gratitude toward the state. The concluding discussion suggests that the graduates experience their selfhood as “public property.” The self, perceived as having been constructed from outside, is in a continuous dialectic between the presence and the absence of certain personal qualities.<br>

Abstract: Public history sites like the West Indian Museum of Panama and the Miraflores Visitors Center have different approaches to narrating the Panama Canal story, ranging from tales of man’s triumph over nature and celebratory discourses of nationalist victories, to testimonies of the racial histories silenced by official renderings of the past. Given the important role of museums as educational institutions, sites that inform public opinion, and representational platforms for national tourism, this article explores the relationship these institutions forge between visitors and canal history. Through a comparative analysis of the narratives and experiential strategies at each site, I evaluate the degree to which Panamanians are cast as spectators in grandiose histories of triumph, or as agents, responsible for shaping the past, present and future. In contrast to these physical sites, I consider how The Society of Friends of the West Indian Museum of Panama constructs a living past through memory practices that challenge the petrified histories traditionally found in museums.<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the results of focus group interviews with members of three different Catholic communities in Poland: the Radio Maryja Family from Rzeszów, epitomizing the so-called “Closed Church,” the intellectuals from Lublin associated with the late Archbishop Życiński, who exemplify adherents to the “Open Church,” and the Club of Catholic Intelligentsia from Kraków, which adopts a middle position between these two groups. The analysis reveals that although the groups constitute varying “communities of memory” with different perceptions of the Polish national past and relations between Poles and Jews, there are no significant differences in their memory of Auschwitz. The qualitative study of these three Catholic communities confirms the results of surveys which show that over the past years in Poland the Jewish meaning of Auschwitz has gained precedence over the Polish and Catholic meanings.<br>

Abstract: Concern for human vulnerability seems to be at the heart of bioethical inquiry, but the concept of vulnerability is under-theorized in the bioethical literature. The aim of this article is to show why bioethics needs an adequately theorized and nuanced conception of vulnerability. We first review approaches to vulnerability in research ethics and public health ethics, and show that the bioethical literature associates vulnerability with risk of harm and exploitation, and limited capacity for autonomy. We identify some of the challenges emerging from this literature: in particular, how to reconcile universal human vulnerability with a context-sensitive analysis of specific kinds and sources of vulnerability; and how to reconcile obligations to protect vulnerable persons with obligations to respect autonomy. We then briefly survey some of the theoretical resources available within the philosophical literature to address these challenges, and to assist in understanding the conceptual connections between vulnerability and related concepts such as harm, exploitation, needs, and autonomy. We also sketch out a taxonomy of sources and kinds of vulnerability. Finally, we consider the implications for policy evaluation of making vulnerability an explicit and central focus of bioethics. Our investigation is in the form of a broad survey motivating a research agenda rather than a detailed analysis.<br>

Abstract: This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of the “(as yet) untold story” to consider the relationship between James Joyce's 1904 short story “Eveline” (in

Although Tóibín has denied the influence of Joyce in general, there are many similarities in the storyworlds of the two protagonists, Eveline Hill and Eilis Lacey: Eveline wishes to leave her father's home in Dublin but stays, whilst Eilis would prefer to remain at home but is forced to emigrate. Both act according to their perception of their mother's wishes and the rightness of their decisions has preoccupied readers. Through close analysis of thought and speech presentation, this essay shows that interpretive responses to the actions of Eveline and Eilis are inextricably linked to the formal qualities of each text.<br>

Abstract: In his essay “The Style of Autobiography”, Jean Starobinski remarks, “One would hardly have sufficient motive to write an autobiography had not some radical change occurred […] conversion, entry into a new life, the operations of Grace”. From the beginning, the traumatic events of Keller's childhood — her loss of sight and hearing around age two — marked her not only as “outsider” and “other” but also as “autobiographer” even before she acquired language. “I can show so little visible proof of living”, Keller confessed. Perhaps for this reason she filled the “white darkness” she lived in with writing — first with finger spelling traced in the hand, then with Braille, and finally with type. While each medium seemed to bring her closer to the dream — her own and her century's — of transparent communication, so each text she produced threatened to turn into a “black box”, an instrument designed to collect and preserve data for analysis following a catastrophic event, but one that inevitably fails to illumine the inner world of Keller's deaf-blindness. This essay explores Keller's dreaming within the black box of writing, following her impossible desire for an “instrument which will show what takes place in the mind when we think”.<br>

Abstract: Surface reading and similar developments in literary study advocate a turn away from symptomatic reading toward the superficial and self-evident. Arguing for the productivity of these approaches despite the contradictory language in which they have sometimes been formulated, this essay develops a related form of analysis: literal or denotative reading. Denotative reading does not reject deep or figurative interpretive possibilities. Rather, it insists they must be pursued in close connection with the facticity of fictional worlds, particularly in the case of maritime and other fiction deploying a specialized, technical lexicon. The essay treats Joseph Conrad's
         Heart of Darkness(1899) as an exemplary instance of such fiction, contending that its precise articulation of tidal currents, nautical maneuvers, and ship design signals the key role of “restraint” not only in this novella but throughout Conrad's corpus.<br>

Abstract: Tropes for poetic relationality proliferate and concatenate. And there is so much more to say. The topic of poetic copia is indeed so abundant as to suggest myriad forking paths of contemplation and investigation. Hidden within the present reflections are dozens of doors leading to other rooms of thought that this article unfortunately does not have the luxury to open. The poets of the Latin American neobaroque—including Argentines Néstor Perlongher, Osvaldo Lamborghini, and Arturo Carrera, Uruguyans Roberto Echavarren and Eduardo Milán, Cuban American José Kozer, and Peruvian Argentine Reynaldo Jimenez—are in deep dialogue with cannibalistic poetics, as De Campos argues in his analysis of “anthropophagous reason” (which he defines as a “ludic space of polyphony and of language in convulsion”).
         
               In the twentieth and twenty-first century there is also a suggestive plethora of poetic frauds, hoaxes, and impersonations—the Ern Malley hoax and Christopher Reid's143
            Katerina Brac, to name just two. Multilingual poetics, with its play on shifting linguistic identities, interlanguage, and polyphony, presents another avenue that would be fruitful for exploration; as does new media poetics that makes use of digital technology. As cultural processes that mingle past and present texts, such cannibalistic poetry participates in a form of cultural philosophy
               that unseats dualistic notions of genius and non-genius, source and derivative, and argues implicitly or explicitly against the metaphysics of origin.144<br>

Abstract: Apter's disengagement from most of the work now being done in World Literature and in translation studies suggests that her real focus lies elsewhere. Though she presents her book as intended “to ford the divisions between World Literature and Theory that have led to unproductive rifts” (5), over the course of the book it increasingly appears that her primary concern is with rifts within the field of Theory itself. And not necessarily to heal them: running through her chapters is a pattern of dismissal or outright occlusion of theoretical perspectives that she finds uncongenial. Thus she details Derrida's mocking critique of the Sinologist and comparatist René Etiemble (236–37), but Etiemble himself can't get a word in edgewise. For a proponent of “planetarity,” it might have been useful to take a serious look at the author of
      Ouverture(s) sur un comparatisme planétaire. Apter does directly discuss Franco Moretti on World Literature and the global spread of the novel, but ends by assessing his work as “precritical in the sense that it shakes off the influence of decades of metatheory, hermeneutics and deconstruction” (55). Surely there are few more critically acute scholars active today than Moretti, whose work is deeply informed by world-systems analysis, grounded in Marxist and also evolutionary theory, and bolstered by engagement with such non-Western theorists as Roberto Schwarz and Masao Miyoshi. Yet by a rhetorical sleight of hand, Moretti'spost-deconstructive work here becomes “precritical.” Moretti and a variety of other scholars sidelined by Apter are theorizing the world in a global perspective, but from sociological and economic standpoints rather than a base in Continental philosophy.<br>

Abstract: In her musings, the niece reveals that her aunt had left something with her: the silence she refused to take along to the grave. That silence, like all silence about human suffering, is oppressive, and it urges the niece to do something. The niece therefore has the obligation to end the tyranny of silence and her aunt's helplessness by bearing testimony, by telling us about her aunt. In her requiem, her aunt, now standing for all the dead, speaks through her niece. The panorama that Jabbeh Wesley paints here calls to mind Giorgio Agamben's analysis of Primo Levi's memoirs, cited above.<br>

Abstract: More recently, Paul Tiyambe Zeleza published the article, “African Diaspora: Towards a Global History.” On the one hand, Zeleza's approach is clearly Afrocentric, framed by notions of dispersal from, and linkages to continental Africa. Yet, on the other, Zeleza, even more forcefully than Gilroy's
            Black Atlantic, vigorously attacks the hegemony of prevailing Afro-Atlantic models in the study of the African diaspora. He notes, for example, that (1) not all Africans went west to the Americas. For centuries Africans were integral to both the Indian Ocean world and the Mediterranean world. There are long-standing Diasporas in both. Hence the constant focus on the Atlantic world, the Middle Passage as the model for African diasporic formation is simply not useful in the majority cases, and (2) even the Atlantic model itself is mostly a North American model, overly focused on Blacks in the US, wholly inadequate for framing much of the Caribbean and Latin American dynamics…. Zeleza urged increased intellectual reflection on the whole Diaspora enterprise, and especially on at least two foci: (1) the terms of analysis we adopt and (2) the problem of historical mapping.

Abstract: Paceboth Brentano and Chisholm, if the I is substance and the principle of individuation, we must steer clear of saying that the unique essence is what one has and, rather, hold that the unique essence is precisely what “I” refers to and it does not refer to a property of this referent. In this case the I-substance is self-individuating, that is,per seand not individuatedper accidensor by reason of being put in relation with another. Of course, we must keep separate the phenomenological-ontological distinctions that surface among “the ‘I’” (or “my I”) as material for eidetic analysis, what the indexical “I” brings to light, and what this indexical “I” pre-reflectively presupposes for its reference. In the latter two cases we do not need individuating markers; nor do we have to do with what/who has properties but, rather, with what/who is nonsortal and referred to nonascriptively.

Abstract: But are there new philosophies of technology? In my narrative I have implied my own style of a “postphenomenology,” which today is practiced by a significant number of younger philosophers—I would include here Peter Paul Verbeek, Evan Selinger, Robert Rosenberger, and many others who have presented and published “empirical turn studies.” Hans Achterhuis describes this concrete turn very well in
                  American Philosophy of Technology: The Empirical Turn(2001). Andrew Feenberg, himself an interpreter and critic of both Heidegger and Marcuse, has done his own analyses of new technologies. And in Europe, a social scientist-philosopher, actually more cited than Derrida, Bruno Latour is known for his distinctive “actor network theory” of analysis. And Donna Haraway must be added for her biology-centered work as well. I mention these movements in passing to show that the field has already changed and all of these are “Continental” in heritage. Indeed, the field is much larger, and “technoscience studies” are engaged in by the new sociologies of science, feminist studies of science, and many emergent cultural studies now proliferating in both Europe and America. Here, however, I did not want to do a field survey but, rather, take note of our own responses to technologies from the SPEP anniversary.<br>

Abstract: I said that the earlier contrast of idol and icon and the later fivefold analysis of the saturated phenomenon were of special interest in the present context. How so? Quite unexpectedly, we discover that both analyses invoke the concept of an inverted intentionality. In the experience of the icon (as distinct from the idol) we find “a nearly perfect inversion” of the intentionality that constitutes the idol as such: “If man, by his gaze, renders the idol possible, in reverent contemplation of the icon, on the contrary, the gaze of the invisible, in person, aims at man…. [T]he icon opens in a face that gazes at our gazes … offering its spectacle to be transgressed—not to be seen, but to be venerated…. [T]he intention here issues from infinity…. [H]ere our gaze becomes the optical mirror of that at which it looks only by finding itself more radically looked at.”

Abstract: The section entitled “Psychoanalysis: Between Neuroscience and Phenomenology” consists of two articles that probe the limits of psychoanalysis and its relation to other ways of thinking about consciousness and experience. Elizabeth Rottenberg's article, “Foreign Bodies: Psychoanalysis and Neuroscience,” considers the Oedipal dimensions of psychoanalysis's relationship to neurology. Rottenberg suggests that the desire to correlate the phenomena of psychic life with the structures and functions of the brain can be understood as a wish to return to the primal scene of the separation from neurology that was psychoanalysis's founding moment. Returning to this founding moment whereby Freud broke with the French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, Rottenberg argues that fundamental to psychoanalysis is a radical conception of trauma as essentially unlocatable, and this conception leads psychoanalysis to resist correlation with neuroscience. Laura McMahon's article, “Home Invasions: Phenomenological and Psychoanalytic Reflections on Embodiment Relations, Vulnerability, and Breakdown,” puts the psychoanalytic accounts of childhood development offered by Freud and Donald Winnicott into conversation with the phenomenological work of Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty. Drawing on these diverse traditions of thought, framed by an analysis of Ingmar Bergman's 1968 film
      Shame, McMahon explores the ways in which not only our bodies but also our lived space, as an extension of our embodied engagement with the world, are vulnerable to assault.<br>

Abstract: This example, albeit brief, already provides an important clue about the locus of the connection between Deleuze and phenomenology. For the above contrast could equally be characterized in terms of the difference between a static and a genetic phenomenology. Deleuze's transcendental empiricism, in other words, bears some resemblance to Husserl's description of the passive syntheses (temporality, habit, etc.) that precede and condition the active syntheses performed by intentional acts of consciousness. From this perspective, we can see both thinkers as inquiring into what precedes and gives rise to the meaning-formations established within a static analysis of intentional consciousness. By all accounts, Deleuze was unaware of Husserl's genetic phenomenology. But if he were, one could easily imagine that he would have been more receptive to phenomenology. And likewise, when Husserlians become aware of the new directions developed in Janicaud's minimal phenomenology, my sense is that they too will come to embrace Deleuzian insights as possible extensions of genetic phenomenology.<br>

Abstract: Current theorists, as we have seen, are eager to highlight the fact that hyperbole poses an impossible exaggeration, but they do not specifically elucidate how hyperbolic impossibility drives one toward other perspectival possibilities or how it destabilizes the very impossibility/possibility binary thinking it engages. Yet in the current context of postmodern and poststructuralist thought with its predisposition for deconstructive criticism and its inclination to abandon moderation and aesthetic proportionality, this is an important function of hyperbole that should not be overlooked. Thus, the topos of impossibility and possibility is one that needs explicit development if a theoretical framework through which a hyperbolic perspective might be employed in critical analysis is to be established.<br>

Abstract: The moment of configuration occurs uniquely within each individual text, as guided by the interpretive capacities and “productive imagination” of an individual agent or group of agents: the creators of the text.
         
               An analysis of this mimetic moment focuses on the variety of ways in which the agent writing history configures the agency, relationships, and temporality of historical subjects within the confines of the text. To draw again on the example of juvenile biographies, some creators may explicitly draw attention to these choices in their texts. Some simply execute their conscious choices in ways that leave subtle marks on the texts. Still others may not be fully aware of their interpretive role, yet their texts nonetheless bear the marks of rhetorical selection and arrangement.9

Abstract: Tragic optimism is an oxymoron entirely consonant with Shaw's customary mode of analysis: dialectical (both/and) thinking. Shaw was well aware that the historical record revealed precious little to demonstrate that humankind had made substantive progress in reducing unwarranted pain, suffering, and injustice. As his urbane Devil so eloquently puts it in
         Man and Superman, if the race excels at one particular thing it is in perfecting ever more efficient means of wreaking destruction on a massive scale and not in honing the executive skills necessary for peacefully achieving the humane society. Moreover, without a vibrant socialism to vitiate the dark side of capitalism, an eventuality that with every passing day seemed to him more and more remote, Shaw saw few if any signs that the desperate conditions of the victimized, whose numbers were growing at an alarming rate, were likely to improve. Even his flirtations with the ruling dictators of the period failed to produce the consummation he devoutly desired. In the main, humans generally struck him as simply too immature, selfish, and shortsighted to manage their affairs wisely. Hence, it is not surprising that the Shavian corpus, for all its sparkling wit and polemical precision, includes a palpable strain of simmering pessimism. At the same time, however, Shaw was not one iota less optimistic that life, in strictly biological terms, would continue to evolve unabated, one species supplanting another through the eons. As Lilith—Shaw's embodiment of the Life Force—declares in her statement that concludesBack to Methuselah, “Of life only is there no end.”
               Barring a cataclysm of biblical proportions, Shaw believed that life was indestructible. Therefore, to his way of thinking, the best use of human energy and talent lies in doing everything possible to assist the forward movement of evolution as it wends its way through the generations. In the Shavian universe, the operative principle is that livi~<br>

Issue: style.36.issue-1<br>
Date: February 25, 1984<br>
Author(s): Alber Jan<br>
Abstract: In
         Towards a ‘Natural’ Narratology(1996), Monika Fludernik reconstitutes narrativity on the basis of experientiality, i.e., humanity's embodiedness in the world, and claims that incomprehensible texts can be made more readable if one attempts to narrativize them. Since Samuel Beckett's short prose work “Lessness” is one of the most enigmatic texts of the twentieth century, it serves as an ideal test case for this new narratological paradigm. “Lessness” does indeed lose its initial strangeness if one reads this piece as narrative. Moreover, although a “natural” narratological analysis paves the way for a new interpretation of “Lessness,” the new paradigm provides only a partially satisfying analysis of it. To make the text fit into the new consciousness-oriented paradigm, Fludernik's quasi-universal naturalizing mode has to ignore certain aspects such as the mechanical structure of “Lessness.” Beckett's later prose work challenges narrativization and the “natural” narratological project. A reading of “Lessness” should be liberated from the confines of experientiality and instead concentrate on the role of chance and chaos. Beckett's text must be located in a counterworld, a limbo between signifier and signified. One should allow this limbo world to seep into the “real world” and not attempt to explain this different counterworld by means of “real-world” knowledge.<br>

Abstract: This paper presents the background, findings, and implications of a new line of research on the technical identification of linguistic metaphor. Inspired by the cognitive-linguistic approach to metaphor launched by Lakoff and Johnson, a new theoretical framework and operational definition has been developed for the identification of metaphorical expressions in authentic discourse. The paper presents a brief report of two reliability studies of the first stage of the approach, and spells out how it may be applied in linguistic, stylistic and rhetorical text analysis with reference to a poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson.<br>

Abstract: In this article, I attempt to bring together the post-structuralist, Levinas-oriented and the rhetorical-and-narratological branches of the contemporary ethical reflection on fiction and explore their respective understanding of the notion of an “implied author.” I argue that Booth's concept and its subsequent redefinitions remain fraught with ‘technical’ difficulties and prove indefensible. After reviewing discussions of the “implied author,” I compare two readings of Yann Martel's
         Life of Pito explore the relevance of the notion for the cases when one wishes to arbitrate between contrasting interpretations of the same text. I then argue that neither the rhetorical and narratological nor the Levinas-oriented ethical criticism has succeeded in rendering Booth's concept a precise and effective tool for literary interpretation. I conclude my analysis by considering the possibility that an alternative understanding of intentionality will enable practitioners of both lines of inquiry to pursue their research without needing to resort to the concept of an implied author.<br>

Abstract: Wicht announces “Joyce's deconstructive disclosure of the utopian as ideological.”
         
               He suggests in his analysis of84
            Ulyssesthat “Joyce reveals to us that the archetype of a structural pattern is fashioned that turns utopian messianism into dictatorial political practice.”
               Like Thomas More's domain sustained on slavery, Britain's colonial Utopia proves, in85
            Ulysses, no more than a “great empire … of drudges and whipped serfs”—yet its subjects, “the unfortunate yahoos,” continue to believe in its ideal of itself.
               Furthermore, as Joyce also implies, this Utopian paradox is as descriptive of Irish nationalism as it is of British imperialism.86<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Among all the critics of modern architecture and the utopianism that is to have caused its downfall, Colin Rowe was perhaps the most influential, especially by way of his book
         Collage City, written with Fred Koetter and first published in 1978 (though large parts of it were informally circulated much earlier). While there have been other architectural historians, theorists, and critics who cast a sharper eye on architecture or made a deeper analysis of its historical development, arguably none have been more influential in shaping architectural practice in the North American context and the Anglosphere more generally, either implicitly or explicitly (the reach of which has been extended worldwide by way of globalization).<br>

Article Title: The Daily Grind at Tel Dor: A Trough and Basin from an Iron Age I Kitchen<br>
Publisher: Biblical Archaeology Society<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of an Iron Age I dwelling at the Phoenician site of Dor, on Israel's Carmel coast. We provide a definition for the architectural mental template for this type of house—a Central Courtyard Hash-Plan House. By combining an analysis of the size and layout of the house, and the distribution of artifacts and ecofacts in it, we define rooms devoted to specialized economic activities such as food production and storage and also attempt to identify gendered spaces. We conclude that the house was a self-contained agrarian unit engaged in complex economic activity. The same conceptual plan, housing similar economic activities, can be identified in other dwellings in the southern Levant, from Late Bronze Age I to Late Iron Age IIA. The gradual disappearance of this house type, vis-à-vis the emergence, on the one hand, of smaller and simpler dwellings such as the ubiquitous Four-Room House and, on the other, that of public facilities for specialized economic tasks, signifies to our minds a fundamental ideological and economic transformation, a change in the
         habitusof Levantine society—namely, the gradual segregation between households and various aspects of economic life.<br>
