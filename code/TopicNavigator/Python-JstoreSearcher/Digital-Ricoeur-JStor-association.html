  Abstract: In
                  The Public and Its Problems(1927), John Dewey defended the ideal of strong publics. Challenging Walter Lippmann’s pessimistic assessment that modern states were far too complex to be managed by their citizens, Dewey offered a fluid understanding of democracy and the state that highlighted the critical role of robust “public interests.”¹ Yet, as his title suggests, Dewey’s optimism was tempered by a sense that the modern public was in trouble. In the context of expanding technology, bureaucratization, and a dehumanizing standardization of action and association, the public, he argued, was fragmenting. The problem for Dewey, as Robert Asen argues,<br>

  Abstract: In his 1915 Flag Day speech, President Wilson argued that the flag was an emblem of the nation’s possibilities. That token reminded citizens that “national life” was created not by abstract ideals, but by the “actual daily endeavors of a great people to do the tasks of the day and live up to the ideals of honesty and righteousness and just conduct.”¹ His words tied behavior to national ideals—an association that heralded the actions of “sober, quiet” citizens, not “swashbuckler[s].”² His goal was to honor the quotidian nature of citizenship, those who did not attract attention to their patriotism<br>

  Abstract: By 1920, modern historical thought had reached a certain point of maturity. My aim in this chapter is to explain this process. With improved accessibility to new types of knowledge and completely new forms of intellectual organization, the perceptual tools of educated people were modified, at first quite slowly, but by 1919, quite decisively. Though it is yet too early to speak of a genre of modern history, the development of new linguistic resources, in fact an entire semantic field, was the crucial and final element that brought the historicization process to a mature point.

  Book Title: Fighting Words-Religion, Violence, and the Interpretation of Sacred Texts<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Renard John<br>
  Abstract: One of the critical issues in interreligious relations today is the connection, both actual and perceived, between sacred sources and the justification of violent acts as divinely mandated.
      Fighting Wordsmakes solid text-based scholarship accessible to the general public, beginning with the premise that a balanced approach to religious pluralism in our world must build on a measured, well-informed response to the increasingly publicized and sensationalized association of terrorism and large-scale violence with religion. In his introduction, Renard provides background on the major scriptures of seven religious traditions-Jewish, Christian (including both the Old and New Testaments), Islamic, Baha'i, Zoroastrian, Hindu, and Sikh. Eight chapters then explore the interpretation of select facets of these scriptures, focusing on those texts so often claimed, both historically and more recently, as inspiration and justification for every kind of violence, from individual assassination to mass murder. With its nuanced consideration of a complex topic, this book is not merely about the religious sanctioning of violence but also about diverse ways of reading sacred textual sources.<br>

  Abstract: so far we have seen that evil became associated early with disobeying father and his representatives. The roots of that association stretch back into antiquity when early human beings felt contaminated by preexisting evil. Ricoeur began his study of the symbolism of evil with an analysis of defilement. Already two things have happened that must now set aside. First, evil is firmly associated with sin, guilt, impurity, and fault; there has been a move beyond pure terror to ethical terror. Second, thought already focuses on the symbol rather than the experience. “By beginning with a symbolism already there,” Ricoeur observes,<br>

  Book Title: Power and Politics in the Book of Judges-Men and Women of Valor<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Yoder John C.<br>
  Abstract: Power and Politics in the Book of Judges studies political culture and behavior in premonarchic Israel, focusing on the protagonists in the book of Judges. Although the sixth-century BCE Deuteronomistic editor portrayed them as moral champions and called them “judges,” the original bardic storytellers and the men and women of valor themselves were preoccupied with the problem of gaining and maintaining political power. These “mighty ones” were ambitious, at times ruthless; they might be labeled chiefs, strongmen, or even warlords in today’s world. John C. Yoder considers the variety of strategies the men and women of valor used to gain and consolidate their power, including the use of violence, the redistribution of patronage, and the control of the labor and reproductive capacity of subordinates. They relied heavily, however, on other strategies that did not deplete their wealth or require the constant exercise of force: mobilizing and dispensing indigenous knowledge, cultivating a reputation for reliability and honor, and positioning themselves as skillful mediators between the realms of earth and heaven, using their association with YHWH to advance their political, economic, or military agenda.<br>

  Abstract: How do children learn the meaning of their first words? Thinkers from every theoretical persuasion admit they must make the right association of sound and sense in order for communication to occur. For example, John Locke writes: “To make words serviceable to the end of communication, it is necessary as has been said that they excite in the hearer exactly the same idea they stand for in the mind of the speaker. Without this men fill one another’s heads with noise and sounds; but convey not thereby their thoughts, and lay not before one another their ideas, which is the<br>

  Abstract: “Cinema is the moving image”: the idea, which has become a commonplace, coalesced around 1900 as photography was being referred to as the still image. The opposition between photography and cinema made it possible throughout the twentieth century, and to this day, to assign distinct tasks in the representation of reality to each of these emblematic dispositives of modernity. Still, the association still/moving also structured the cinematographic dispositive as such as early as the late nineteenth century. Indeed, photography was not the other of cinema at the time, but a means used by “cinema” in its chronophotographic stage to reconstitute<br>

  Abstract: When we move from creation and flood to the figures of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and then Joseph and Moses, we move from the realm of myth to the realm of legend. Legend is a neutral and useful term because it allows for the association of both history and reality. Its description will usually reflect belief about what may be historical although unverifiable. In that sense, the traditions about certain biblical figures have often been regarded as historically reliable; they have also often been regarded as unverifiable.

However, today the French union appears as a vain attempt to maintain an already weakened authority. How can we begin to explain this apparent discordance?<br>

  Abstract: Psycho-social studies is an emerging tradition that very much focuses on emotion and affect to illuminate some of the core issues in the social sciences. Issues such as identity construction, dilemmas in public service sectors and the experience of rapid social change. It recognises that the split between individual and society, sociology and psychology is now unhelpful if we are to understand social and psychological phenomena. It therefore seeks to research beneath the surface using both psychoanalytic and sociological ideas using innovative new methodologies including the use of free association, biographical life history interviews and the development of psychoanalytic fieldwork.<br>

  Abstract: French culture has long been perceived by the English-speaking reader as somehow more ‘erotic’ than Anglo-Saxon culture. This impression is partly due to the large numbers of pornographic publications which have been imported from Paris since the sixteenth century, first into England and later into the United States, but also to the peculiarly French association of pornography and subversion, hence the fascination that the genre has held for well-known and highly regarded writers from Rabelais to Robbe-Grillet. The choice of modern French (as opposed to any other nation’s) pornography as object of study is, therefore, justified by the unique existence<br>

  Book Title: Practicing the City: Early Modern London on Stage-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Levine Nina<br>
  Abstract: In late-sixteenth-century London, the commercial theaters undertook a novel experiment, fueling a fashion for plays that trafficked in the contemporary urban scene. But beyond the stage's representing the everyday activities of the expanding metropolis, its unprecedented urban turn introduced a new dimension into theatrical experience, opening up a reflexive space within which an increasingly diverse population might begin to "practice" the city. In this, the London stage began to operate as a medium as well as a model for urban understanding. Practicing the City traces a range of local engagements, onstage and off, in which the city's population came to practice new forms of urban sociability and belonging. With this practice, Levine suggests, city residents became more self-conscious about their place within the expanding metropolis and, in the process, began to experiment in new forms of collective association. Reading an array of materials, from Shakespeare and Middleton to plague bills and French-language manuals, Levine explores urban practices that push against the exclusions of civic tradition and look instead to the more fluid relations playing out in the disruptive encounters of urban plurality.<br>

Then, a third textual movement attempted an articulation of subjectivity, history and infinity, the foremost aim of which was to show that the Hegelian subject exceeds all egological reductions, analytics of finitude or anthropological limitations. That is to say, Hegel leaves us with a subject sufficiently inclusive to allow for both reflections on models of institutional association, as well as modes of determination or the process of<br>

  Abstract: The materials that are the subject of this essay, films and their accompanying printed texts, were produced in the early and mid-1910s by the Association Koloniaal Instituut, in Amsterdam. This association was founded in 1910 as a centre for the promotion of science, education, trade, and manufacture. Alerted by a lack of interest in the Dutch colonies, in particular the East Indies (now Indonesia), the association’s founders conceived of the Colonial Institute as a center for the collection and study of data and objects of, and the dissemination of knowledge about, Dutch overseas territories. Besides exhibitions, publications or lectures, they<br>

  Abstract: A number of features characterise mortuary rituals at the end of the Neolithic and the beginning of the Bronze Age in Britain (the period covering approximately 2200–1500 BC). These include the construction of barrows of layered earth and stone cairns of mounded rubble covering the dead; the burial of individuals as inhumations or cremations enclosed in grave cuts, stone cists, or coffins; and the deposition of artefacts in close association with the dead. Outside the mortuary sphere, but necessarily connected with it, this period of prehistory also witnesses the emergence of large scale hoards of artefacts, typically metalwork, typically<br>

The issues raised are of central concern in many international contexts, where societies are coming to grips with accommodating cultural diversity within a civic identity.

  Abstract: Marshall mcluhan’s theory of “hybrid energy” adopts, almost self-evidently, a hybrid structure. Although he develops and refines this concept in association with his revelations regarding various forms of media, he also links this concept with larger cultural experiences. Connecting the interplay of media with civilians, relating society to the human psyche, and juxtaposing fission and fusion, McLuhan crosses the boundaries of diverse disciplines and concepts to reveal the interaction among them. When he observes that “everybody notices how coal and steel and cars affect the arrangements of daily existence,” he seems to assert not only the interrelationship between apparently unconnected<br>

  Abstract: If there is one thing urgently required in nations around the world confronted with growing demands for recognition of various forms of particularity—ethnic, cultural, linguistic, gender, and so on—it is a conception of civil association that reconciles recognition of difference with respect for the rights of individuals.

  Abstract: Kinship, Herzfeld argues, “carried the dead weight of outmoded assumptions” (2007:315). Like Fabian’s (1983) perceptions regarding the subject of anthropology, kinship became the “Other,” perpetually locked in direct association with Africanist structuralist theory. Nevertheless, kinship “has insidiously slipped back everywhere” (Herzfeld 2007:315) and is here to stay. Grecanici kinship is highly politicized and contributes to dense networks of governance and representation. With a strong emphasis on patrilineality, kinship is a political and genealogical order with far-reaching consequences for socioeconomic organization. The coordination of the next generation of relatives is desired by people who know exactly their own lines of relatedness.<br>

Atheism and a careful sequestration of God from current business are the two main forms in which academia deals with the long history of religion, which, notwithstanding academic reservations, goes on. For scholarship, faith, God, and religion have become curiosa. The theoretical intention has separated itself from religious commitments; it abhors edifying language and has forgotten or rejected the long history of its association with contemplation.

  Book Title: Faces of Displacement-The Writings of Volodymyr Vynnychenko<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): SOROKA MYKOLA<br>
  Abstract: "Whom do our people read? Vynnychenko. Whom do people talk about if it concerns literature? Vynnychenko. Whom do they buy? Again, Vynnychenko." So wrote Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky about the young Volodymyr Vynnychenko. An innovative and provocative writer, Vynnychenko was also a charismatic revolutionary and politician who responded to the dramatic upheavals of the first half of the twentieth century by challenging old values and bringing forward new ideas about human relationships. Despite his inseparable association with Ukraine, what is often overlooked is the fact that Vynnychenko wrote the majority of his works outside his native land following his flight from Tsarist and Soviet tyranny. In this ground-breaking study, Mykola Soroka draws on contemporary theories of displacement to show how Vynnychenko's expatriate status determined his worldview, his choice of literary devices, and his attitudes toward his homeland and hostlands. Soroka considers concepts of identity to study the intertwined experiences of the writer - as an exile, émigré, expatriate, traveler, and nomad - and to demonstrate how these experiences invigorated his art and left a lasting impact on his work. The first book-length study in English on Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Faces of Displacement is an insightful examination of an exiled writer that sheds new light on the challenges faced by the displaced.<br>

  Abstract: There is an ambiguity in the idea of “civil society” as the arena of private economic and social relations, rather than of government. First, there is the idea that these relations are freely chosen. Civil society, as Michael Walzer puts it, is “the space of uncoerced human association.” But second, there is the idea that these relations depend upon shared values. Civil society is therefore also “the set of relational networks—formed for the sake of family, faith, interest, and ideology—that fill this space.” … The idea of civil society, then, can receive both liberal and communitarian interpretation, depending<br>

  Book Title: The Superstitious Muse-Thinking Russian Literature Mythopoetically<br>
  Publisher: Academic Studies Press<br>
  Author(s): Bethea David M.<br>
  Abstract: For several decades David Bethea has written authoritatively on the “mythopoetic thinking" that lies at the heart of classical Russian literature, especially Russian poetry. His theoretically informed essays and books have made a point of turning back to issues of intentionality and biography at a time when authorial agency seems under threat of “erasure" and the question of how writers, and poets in particular, live their lives through their art is increasingly moot. The lichnost’ (personhood, psychic totality) of the given writer is all-important, argues Bethea, as it is that which combines the specifically biographical and the capaciously mythical in verbal units that speak simultaneously to different planes of being. Pushkin’s Evgeny can be one incarnation of the poet himself and an Everyman rising up to challenge Peter’s new world order; Brodsky can be, all at once, Dante and Mandelstam and himself, the exile paying an Orphic visit to Florence (and, by ghostly association, Leningrad).This sort of metempsychosis, where the stories that constitute the Ur-texts of Russian literature are constantly reworked in the biographical myths shaping individual writers’ lives, is Bethea’s primary focus. This collection contains a liberal sampling of Bethea’s most memorable previously published essays along with new studies prepared for this occasion.<br>

The association of R and S-D is part and parcel of certain assumptions, in particular that, in order for tellers to reflect on their lives and selves and to open up (self-disclose) to an interviewer, they must have a critical distance from the reported events and be given the opportunity to piece them together in<br>

That there is such an association is often claimed in relation to a number of thinkers, but most notably perhaps in relation to Heidegger.¹ Sometimes the claim is extended to encompass broader movements in contemporary thought, with environmental thinking being the most common, but by no means the only target here.² Seldom, however, is much consideration given to the way such a claim<br>

He had a respectable poetic career as a member of the Rokujō School of poetry and was invited to participate in numerous poetry contests.

Within polities, it meant the formation of constitutional processes for law making, law enforcement and broadening the access to elections of legislators and executives at all levels of the state.

Both Baudelaire’s infamous diatribe against photography and Bergson’s equally renowned denunciation of 
                  photographie animée centered on the association of the new media with a debased if professionally useful form of memory.

  Book Title: A Companion to the Works of Johann Gottfried Herder-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Koepke Wulf<br>
  Abstract: Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803) is one of the great names of the classical age of German literature. One of the last universalists, he wrote on aesthetics, literary history and theory, historiography, anthropology, psychology, education, and theology; translated and adapted poetry from ancient Greek, English, Italian, even from Persian and Arabic; collected folk songs from around the world; and pioneered a better understanding of non-European cultures. A student of Kant's, he became Goethe's mentor in Strasbourg, and was a mastermind of the Sturm und Drang and a luminary of classical Weimar. But the wide range of Herder's interests and writings, along with his unorthodox ways of seeing things, seems to have prevented him being fully appreciated for any of them. His image has also been clouded by association with political ideologies, the proponents of which ignored the message of Humanität in his texts. So although Herder is acknowledged by scholars to be one of the great thinkers of European Enlightenment, there is no up-to-date, comprehensive introduction to his works in English, a lacuna this book fills with seventeen new, specially commissioned essays.

  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): KERR LINDSAY G.<br>
  Abstract: Co-Winner of the 2014 Publication Prize awarded by the Association of Hispanists of Great Britain and Ireland Kerr traces the processes and paradoxes at work in the late parodic poetry of Luis de Góngora and Lope de Vega, illuminating the correlations and connections between two poets who have more often than not been presented as enemies.The analysis follows the parallel development of the complex parodic genre through Góngora's late mythological parody, from his 1589 Hero and Leander romance through to his culminating parody, La fábula de Píramo y Tisbe (1618) and Lope de Vega's alter ego Tomé de Burguillos, whose anthology, Rimas humanas y divinas del licenciado Tomé de Burguillos, was published a year before Lope's death, in 1634. Working from the premise that parody provides a Derridean supplément to exhausted, dominant genres (e.g. pastoral, lyric, epic), this study asks: what do these texts achieve by their supplementarity, and how do they achieve it?, and, the overarching question, why do these erudite poets turn to parody in an age of decline?

How did people who had been working side by side for several decades find themselves in the situation of choosing between the two causes—the rights of African Americans and those of women—they had previously fought for almost indiscriminately?¹ Trying to make sense of this rift, women’s rights activist Lucy Stone opted<br>

  Abstract: Desire was a defining element in early Enlightenment medievalisms, I have argued, because these medievalisms often expressed their longing for the past in an erotic or sexualized language. Embodied, performative forms of knowledge represented one response to the desire to physically touch the past. The 
                  roman genre provided another response to this erotization of the past due to its association with illicit desire and its supposedly seductive, corrupting power.

  Book Title: Love and Death in Goethe-`One and Double'<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Dye Ellis<br>
  Abstract: Goethe, in association with his younger Romantic compatriots the Schlegels, Novalis, Fichte, and Schelling, struggled with the subject-object dichotomy, and tried to bridge the gap between self and other, consciousness and nature. His theory and practice prefigured the Romantics' determination to display and interrogate the linguistic and cultural structures informing their own thinking and modes of representation--what Goethe calls one's "Vorstellungsart." His work exploits, subverts, and supplants inherited conventions and signs, demonstrating with virtuosic irony that literature is a system of texts, pre-texts, and pre-established but dynamic conceptual models. 'Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double"' explores Goethe's use, in a wide range of his poetry and prose, of the theme of 'Liebestod' (love and death) and related embodiments of the paradox of unity in duality. Ellis Dye also examines Goethe's use of other themes related to love and death--the 'femme fatale', the 'vagina dentata, Frau Welt', the Lorelei, venereal disease, the 'Lustmord' --and considers issues of selfhood and individuation as well as the possibility that the love-death theme contains an implicit gender bias toward the existential fact of personal separateness. Poems, plays, and novels are dealt with, nevertheless, as works of art, not only as illustrations of an idea or as points of intersection in a system of rhetorical conventions, and are examined for intellectual cohesiveness, elegance, and integrity of design as well as special meanings and effects. ' Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double" ' explores the meaning of the central theme of Romantic poetry in the works of the most important Romantic poet of all. Students of literary culture, both the lay reader and the Goethe specialist, will be enlightened by its approach and find pleasure and instruction in its revelations. Robert Ellis Dye is professor of German at Macalester College.<br>

Author(s): Lichterman Paul<br>
Abstract: The two main empirical cases presented here portray “civil society”—the public or potentially public settings in which uncoerced participants engage in ongoing, voluntary association, outside of the immediate demands of family, work, or government (Walzer
         1992; Barber1984; Alexander1995, p. 6; Fraser1992; Habermas1992; Cohen and Arato1992). Many scholars and politicians have worried about the “tone” of American civic life, lamenting what they hear as narrowness in American public discourse (e.g., Hughes1993; Etzioni1996; Hunter1994,1991; Gitlin1995; MacIntyre1981; Marty1997; Bellah et al.1985; Wuthnow1998; Putnam2000,1995). Groups such as ACES and the Buffalo Club are just the sorts of places these observers would search for the cultivation of civic engagement and public spiritedness (Alexander1995; Boyte and Evans1986; Cohen and Arato1992; Fraser1992; Goldfarb1980; Goodwyn1978; Habermas1992;1989. Rosenzweig1983; Ryan1985; Tocqueville [1831]1969). A study of culture in interaction offers a more systematic method for analyzing the “tone” of these groups. Thus, the bar patrons and the suburban activist group’s styles were not just not neutral, transparent conveyors of cultural meanings. Neither were they justpro‐ orantidemocratic. The concept of culture in interaction operationalizes an insight from students of public life such as Dewey (1927), Mead (1964), and others that meaning and practice—or “content and form”—are intertwined, creating varied kinds of openings for members to become democratic citizens.<br>

Abstract: In my role as historian of Americanist anthropology, I have long mused over the disproportionate influence of a small number of linguistic anthropologists over the discipline as a whole. Duranti cites two recent American Anthropological Association presidents who are linguistic anthropologists: I note that Jane Hill crosses into cultural as well as biological anthropology and Don Brenneis is difficult to identify solely as linguistic or cultural anthropologist. My own explanation tends toward the rhetoric of continuity within the three variants of linguistic anthropology. Because we are not contentious among ourselves, moving comfortably across both the subdisciplines of anthropology and the disciplines of the social sciences and humanities, linguistic anthropologists are often identified as effective mediators and synthesizers. The seminal role of Edward Sapir in the Rockefellersponsored interdisciplinary social science of the interwar years provides an early exemplar; Sapir persuaded his colleagues that Chicago sociology and psychology/psychoanalysis were not in conflict but explored different sides of a single coin (his metaphor). He had moved beyond descriptive and historical linguistics as handmaidens to ethnology into the psychological reality of the phoneme and the theory of culture.<br>

In the fall issue, theJEHwould publish the papers of the annual meeting of the Economic History Association. “In the winter, spring, and summer numbers, comment and reporting on the current literature of economic history and allied fields will fill about half of each issue, or perhaps a little more than half, as it has in past issues ofThe Journal.This half ofThe Journalwill now contain two parts: ‘Review Articles and Discussions’ and ‘Reviews of Books.’ Under the first of these general headings will be published the more extended reviews devoted to recent works of importance, but we include ‘Discussions’ in the title of this section because we plan to present here critical analyses that focus on a theme rather than on a book. In a review, the reviewer is under obligation to give a judgment on the whole of the publication under consideration. We believe there should be opportunity also to discuss a theme or thesis without assuming obligation to give a balanced judgment on the whole book within which it has been presented.”<br>

Abstract: Smith’s
            Lectureselevate the principle of brevity virtually above all other compositional norms: “When there are no words that are superfluous but all tend to express something by themselves which was not said before and in a plain manner, we may call it precision.”42The effect of precision or conciseness is also associated with clarity, or what Smith calls “perspicuity.” Again, this association is present in antiquity, wherebrevitasandclaritasare frequently linked. But in Smith these norms are correlated in such a way as to supersede the balance of norms Quintilian described as “correctness, lucidity, and elegance.”43If lucidity or clarity implies brevity here, elsewhere elegance harbors the complementary value ofcopia.44<br>

Abstract: The effectiveness of doctrine in forming communities appears to depend, however, on a partial or complete concealment of this sociopolitical function. The outward form of religious doctrines as descriptive statements of objective reality gives the impression that the association of a doctrine with a particular social group is merely accidental. The formation of a religious community appears to be merely symptomatic of the recognition of the propositional truth of a given set of doctrines. This concealment of the community‐forming intent of religious doctrines can perhaps be regarded as an instance of the broader social phenomenon Peter Berger terms “reification,” that is, the apprehension of social reality as grounded in the very nature of things rather than as a product of human activity.
         40Understood in this way, the surface grammar of doctrine conceals the human origin of doctrinal formulations—and therefore that of the institutional processes they regulate—by suggesting that these reflect the very nature of reality. The understanding of doctrines primarily as performative expressions of communal identity implies that classical doctrines have a mythological aspect, in the sense that their appearance as simple representations of objective reality conceals the more complex expressive and regulative dimensions of their meaning.<br>

Abstract: Joan W. Scott sees a similar problem in Haraway’s use of women of color in relation to traditional socialist feminism. Scott writes, “What is the difference between Haraway’s looking to these groups for the politics of the future and (the association such a gesture has for me) the romantic attribution by white liberal or socialist women to minority or working‐class women of the appropriate (if not authentic) socialist or feminist politics?” (
            1989, 216–17).<br>

Abstract: As Frei discusses in
         The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative, the study of philology and the grammar of scripture has been a central component of redaction and historical criticism. By and large, grammatical study has examined the language of scripture in light of the uses of language in the historical settings in which texts were written. Grammatical analysis took the form of historical analysis of the verbal forms used in the composition of the texts; as Frei writes of Johann Philipp Gabler, it “meant working out from a text’s words, as used at the time they were written, and the single, and never more than single, meaning of the text and its author, quite regardless of one’s estimate of the soundness of his position.”37This single, ostensive meaning of words, in association with the world of the author, subsequently permeated historical‐critical studies, dogmatic theology, and hermeneutics. This historical determination of grammatical meaning comes to fruition in the work of Schleiermacher, whose hermeneutics oscillated dialectically between the poles of psychological, “technical” interpretation and grammatical interpretation. Grammatical understanding involves understanding “the discourse as a focus within a language as a whole, characterized by its relation to the total linguistic stock” of the author, for whose completion, quoting Schleiermacher, “there would have to be a complete knowledge of the language.”38While grammatical interpretation is necessary, and always remains incomplete, the “divinatory” element of psychological interpretation governs and guides the interpretation, leading the reader to the text’s meaning, in knowing the author better than she knows herself.<br>

Abstract: An example of a similar project being attempted for very different ideological purposes is Hilton Kramer and Roger Kimball’s “Farewell to the MLA,”
                  New Criterion13 (1 Feb. 1995),http://www.mugu.com/cgi‐bin/Upstream/People/Kimball/mla.html.Here Kramer and Kimball compile anecdotal information on what is being cited at the Modern Language Association convention:
                        
                  Meanwhile, as one of us listened to these assaults on Conrad and Cather, the other chose to visit the session on “Feminist Perspectives on the Frankfurt School,” which drew a standing‐room‐only crowd and turned out to offer a little of everything—except, of course, literature. No sooner had we seated ourselves and unpacked the trusty tape recorder than we heard the familiar whine of the dentist’s drill—no, sorry, our mistake: it was only the sound of the first speaker, who had come to “clarify the function of femininity in Frankfurt School thought, with an emphasis on re‐reading the work of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer in the context of gender.” Ah, yes, we knew it well: the “critique of patriarchy and logocentricsm,” old friends such as the feminist icons Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva, not to mention Judith Butler, the young philosopher of queer theory who our rough tabulation identified as the second most frequently referred to person at the convention. The most frequently cited figure was undoubtedly Walter Benjamin, the hapless Marxist critic and protege of Adorno who committed suicide while fleeing from the Nazis in 1940.<br>

Abstract: When I propose that the complex of multicivilization problems should be tackled in the framework of human rights, this does not imply an approach based on specific human rights, for example, the first generation of human rights, which includes the rights to freedom of conscience, religion, association, assembly, and freedom of the press. I also do not have in mind the rights to elementary necessities of life, like food, housing, health care, work, and education, all of which belong to the second generation of human rights. Nor do I have in mind the third generation of human rights, for example, the right to a healthy environment or cultural and religious minority rights, however important they may be. I have in mind an approach premised on the fundamental principles of human rights—human dignity, freedom, and equality, including the principle of nondiscrimination. Hence, my approach focuses on the religious implications of these principles.<br>

Abstract: Another scenario can be used here to connect values to ALA’s Code of Ethics. The main speaker at a library association conference program dealing with codes of ethics focuses on the ALA Code of Ethics (the revised version adopted by the ALA Council in 1995). The code includes items about intellectual freedom, intellectual property rights, privacy and confidentiality, and ensuring that personal or private interests do not interfere with access to information. The speaker, though, spends most of his time on one item of the code: “We provide the highest level of service to all library users through appropriate and usefully organized resources; equitable access; and accurate, unbiased, and courteous responses to all requests” [
         17]. The speaker adamantly defends this part of the code. A responding speaker on the program challenges the main speaker’s position and that item of the code saying that the addition of accuracy in the statement introduces bias. The second speaker argues that accuracy is a construction based on domination and oppression and should be challenged in the interests of pluralism and cultural sensitivity. She brings up the report of ALA’s Core Values Task Force II and points out that accuracy appears nowhere in it; not even the value of service mentions accuracy. She further says that the value of social responsibility implicitly urges advocacy on social issues and argues that advocacy trumps accuracy, becoming our genuine ethical goal. Can/should a code of ethics explicitly address things such as accuracy? Is there a realistic and/or objective norm for accurate responses to questions? Should truth be a tenet of a code of ethics?<br>

Abstract: In fact, it is this very confrontation between the claims of the collective singular, initiated by the expansion of capital (and its proxy, the nation‐state), and received special histories lived by peoples encountered along its route that brings into the immanent time of modernity the forceful contact of a history that has its own unique, internal time with countries like Japan and the colonized world outside of Euro‐America. The opening up of the globe and especially the creation of a world market often brought diverse cultures into violent clash in a synchronous drama that inevitably was recoded in a diachronic narrative upholding a chronologically uniform time ranging from barbaric to civilized and insisting on authorizing discrete comparisons. While it was in the context of this expanding world market that forms of unevenness were first perceived—then later described as noncontemporaneous contemporaneity—it was undoubtedly Marx who first called attention to the uneven development of material production and the coexistence of a dominant mode of production and surviving prior modes that often appear in “stunted form, or even travestied,” which thus “assign rank and influence to the others.”
         17And it is this contest between these prior modes of production and a universalizing world history (personified by the world market) appointed to unify and incorporate the plural special histories that is subsequently put into play by discussions in prewar Japan and elsewhere throughout the colonized and semicolonized worlds of the interwar period. Capital’s desire to reduce this plurality to a singular space of experience undermines itself because the space already bears the mark of difference, owing to its association with the nation‐state. But to say this is not to invite the possibility of an alternative modernity. As Ricoeur observed: “The paradox is great: history is proclaimed to be a world phenomenon by historian‐patriots” (MHF,p. 301). But what Ricoeur insis~<br>

Abstract: In other areas of library practice, King and Rubin [
            11] and Gary P. Radford [7] viewedtruth, along with the termsjusticeandbeauty, as one of three “interrelated fundamental ideals that serve as the foundation for librarianship in general and reference services in particular” [11, p. 249]. King and Rubin argued that these three terms form a conceptual basis from which to understand the public purpose of librarianship, particularly as it applies to reference service, within the larger milieu of democratic idealism. The idea of truth in this context forms the basis for understanding issues of intellectual freedom and freedom of expression, where the library serves as the penultimate setting for the free exchange of opinions, beliefs, and ideas. King and Rubin proposed that the existence of “untruths” is also important to the philosophy of service in librarianship because untruths, as described by John Swan [33], can “stimulate thinking and reveal pathways in the search for truth” [11, p. 251]. Embracing the concepts of truth and untruth in librarianship is foundational because they support and promote the Jeffersonian vision of an enlightened marketplace of ideas. Specific provisions within the Library Bill of Rights and other official policies of the American Library Association are cited by King and Rubin to demonstrate the practical expressions of these ideals.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: Augustine would add that our affections are not merely individualistic; they are intersubjective and attach themselves to political and collective goods (among other shareable values). We “feel together” in ways that led Augustine to be keenly attentive to the moral quality of his friendships as well as to matters that bear on a common life. “The life of a city is inevitably a social life,” he writes.
         52He expressed these ideas most famously in his account of what constitutes a people. For Augustine, we understand a “people” to be an “association of rational beings united by a common agreement on the objects of their love.”53Unity is experienced dialogically and intersubjectively, for which love and desire provide the social glue. Hence the fact that citizens in the res publica justifiably share a worry about injury to their attachments when injustice occurs: their common goods, cherished traditions, and political values. For Augustine, these goods are legitimate objects of attachment insofar as they furnish essential conditions of creative freedom.<br>

Author(s): Andrew Dudley<br>
Abstract: In France, film scholarship has been looked at suspiciously as well, though less by university snobs than by sophisticated cinephiles who write for the numerous French film journals. Many of them worry that the savage power of the movies, their unpredictability, will be disciplined by academic study, that is, brought into line and tamed. Inevitably, this anarchist cry has become muffled over the years as the success of these very journals has helped bring cinema into the mainstream of French life, including its educational structure. So much is this the case that a film has been included on the national baccalaureate exam every year since 1987. To prepare thousands of high school students for this exam, academics have turned out primers of film analysis and history, clarifying the findings of research that now goes on in most French universities. In short, while cinephilia and its particular forms of
         écriture(let's just call it criticism) remain robust in France, the fact is that a coordinated field has been laid out by scholars there, most of whom belong to AFECCAV (Association Française des Enseignants et Chercheurs en Cinéma et AudioVisuel).<br>

Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: There are two reasons for this. The first is that he is trying to protect his own interpretation as foundational and fundamental. Second, the strain between Lévinas's two strategies of reading is indicative of a more fundamental tension between building up the Jewish community and the impulse to make Judaism universally applicable. When Lévinas emphasizes the plurivocity of the text, he consistently speaks of the renewal of the Jewish people. In these passages there is no mention of the universalization of Judaism. When he universalizes the category, he also deemphasizes the text's plurivocity, prioritizing its philosophical essence. As Moshe Halbertal has shown, the emphasis on rabbinic plurivocity goes hand in hand with other strategies of policing the border of the community. Without a clear demarcation of who has the authority to engage in interpretation, the principle of interpretive openness threatens to disrupt community cohesion.
         23Conversely, Lévinas's universalization of Judaism can only function meaningfully if agreement can be established concerning the tradition's core teachings. Otherwise, there can be no clear criteria for association or identification.<br>

Abstract: IN 1978, the esteemed scholar G. S. Rousseau surveyed the state of the field of literature and science in the pages of
         Isis. As he noted, the work of Marjorie Hope Nicholson inspired a generation of scholars during the 1950s to establish a new Literature and Science division within the Modern Language Association of America (MLA). The story Rousseau tells is largely one of the impact of science—and of history of science—on the study of literature by literary and intellectual historians. While carefully taking account of the diverse approaches informing the practice of literature and science through the late 1970s, Rousseau observed with concern just how vulnerable to methodological critiques were studies of the “influence” of science on literature that then dominated the field. Ultimately, his essay strikes a pessimistic note. Specifically, Rousseau voiced concern that “structuralism” would undermine any question of the “validity of literature and science as a field”; “as proof,” he cited the “sharp plunge” in the number of “members of the [MLA] division” of Literature and Science.1The future did not look bright for this field.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 653501<br>

Author(s): Schildgen Brenda Deen<br>
Abstract: However, the Aristotelian topos of the “sagacity of bees,” found in Bartholomeus Anglicus, Albertus Magnus, Vincent of Beauvais, and Thomas Aquinas, was adopted to signify the wonder of nature.
      70Thus, whether in their natural environment, as parallel to an idealized monastic setting, or linked with the “celestial realm,” bees, as the least animal-like creatures who were deemed closest to the heavenly sphere, offered Dante an image for an idealized golden age, an eschatological future already realized in the natural world. Dante's transfigured golden age, however, is not in the past but in the immanent present of the actions of bees, which as nonhuman creatures most like angels, and as poetic vehicles, make transcendence visible in the immanent world of nature. But there is more here, because Dante's use of the nonhuman animal simile places the immanent creature outside itself, and knowledge of self, and makes this a condition of blessedness to which humans might aspire. This has both an aesthetic and heuristic function because it poses a question about the philosophical boundaries that place man above all other creatures. The fact that the poet chooses insects, bees, birds, or fish and avoids mammals (except of course the lamb) as his vehicles to convey this insight suggests these creatures are more analogous to this “blessed” condition than wolves or other predatory creatures. Mammals, in Dante's bestiary, tend to fall easily into the static allegory/personification realm, in step with the “common association” notion of the metaphor, whereas Dante's similes with insects, bees, birds, or fish show how a close observation of nature can become the poetic means for making the immanent transcendent and the transcendent present in the immanent.<br>

Abstract: The Protestant attack on the idea of intrinsically magical language was an inflection of the broadly confessional attack on sacramentality. Arguments connecting the formula for conjuration to the Catholic Eucharist began to emerge in Germany and Denmark in the 1560s and ’70s, and these arguments were imported into England by a distinctly heterogeneous group of devotional writers.
      6Gifford and Perkins are often reductively characterized as Puritans, perhaps for their early interest in Presbyterianism, although in fact they both embraced the Elizabethan settlement before they published their major tracts on magic.7Other writers who rehearsed the continental account of conjuration had little association with nonconformity: Henry Holland, for instance, was settled in his London living by the establishment dean of Westminster, and Robert Burton, the author ofThe Anatomy of Melancholy(1621), used the opportunity of his Oxford fellowship to ignore theological controversy almost entirely. James I (then James VI of Scotland) repeated verbatim the new Protestant arguments about magic in his 1597Daemonologie, as did the seventeenth-century physician John Cotta inThe Triall of Witchcraft(1616).8The new reformed discourse of magic was, then, generated in pastoral, academic, royal, commercial, and theatrical spaces to various and divergent ends. Historians of the English reformation have generally seen the emergence of a reformist theory of magical language as linked to pastoral attempts to discredit “cunning” men and women as medical authorities and to reinterpret witchcraft as a form of spiritual affliction.9But this model of the pastorate attacking popular practices from above, as it were, in order to consolidate its own spiritual authority against the traditions of the laity tends not to provide for the breadth of perspectives and interests that generated and disseminated the new account of the spiritual instrumentality of representation.<br>

These principles have been subject to critical questioning: they are charged by some to be underdetermined, by others to be culturally and politically biased.<br>

Abstract: The origins of this essay trace back to an undergraduate honors thesis written in 1994 at Brigham Young University under the direction of Richard Duerden and Bruce Young. It was presented in revised form at the 2007 meeting of the Shakespeare Association of America in a seminar organized by Douglas Trevor and Kristen Poole. Its current state owes a great deal to the generosity and insight of several anonymous readers.<br>

Abstract: Webster’s play, more than any other surveyed here, links the very genre of tragedy to metaphorical thinking. His self-conscious engagement with the genre incorporates both tragic action and tragic reflection or interpretation. That is to say, Webster integrates his own Bradley-like critics into the play itself, making room for both the pessimistic figure of pain and the redemptivist response to it, offering multiple options for affective response to the audience. His universe is one of doubt and uncertainty, and the play seems to be suggesting that metaphor—with all the issues of imprecision and distortion that accompany associative thinking—is an apt cognitive process for facing the tragic world. In the imagery of poison as fire, plays like
      Women, Beware Womenuse association to convey both sensory information and thematic significance. InKing Lear, Shakespeare’s characters speak in metaphors that build on sensory experience to process spiritual truth. But inThe Duchess of Malfi, metaphor becomes, in essence, the only way of knowing because the play continually undermines the veracity of sense perception. Over the course of the play, the Duchess has three children. Numerous characters see her pregnant body, and yet Bosola, employed to spy on her, still must seek further proof that she is with child. At one point, he feeds her unripe apricots, which cause her to go into labor. To conceal her condition and confuse Bosola, a rumor is circulated that she was poisoned—a reinterpretation of her pain that is so effective that even Bosola fears that the apricots might have been poisoned without his knowledge (2.2.31–32).
            And in the final act, the Duchess’s brother the Cardinal is murdered as his guards stand just outside the door, listening to his cries for help. But they had been told by the Cardinal himself that he would “faigne [him]self in danger” (5.4.15), and so they refuse to be taken in by what they think is his counterfeiting.

Abstract: As well known, Sullivan tended to dismiss the importance of his year at MIT, where he studied from1872 to 1873, and his year at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. His negative attitude toward the institution and its philosophy was expressed in a number of his writings, especially in his
                  Autobiography of an Idea(New York: Press of the American Institute of Architects, 1924). And yet, as historians Mario Manieri Elia (Louis Henry Sullivan, 1856–1924, New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 1996, 16) and David Van Zanten (The Function of Ornament: The Architecture of Louis Sullivan, ed. Wim de Wit [New York: Chicago Historical Society and the Saint Louis Art Museum in association with W.W. Norton, 1986]) argue, Sullivan owed the Ecole much more than he was willing to admit. As historian Edward Bosley reported in hisGreene & Greene(London: Phaidon, 2000), 12, Henry and Charles Greene were known to make statements that diminished the importance of their Beaux-Arts education at MIT. However, Bosley also noted that later in their lives both Charles and Henry spoke quite warmly of their Beaux-Arts training and admitted that it influenced their approach to the profession of architecture.<br>

Abstract: Reliability has traditionally been taken for granted as a necessary but insufficient condition for validity in assessment use. My purpose in this article is to illuminate and challenge this presumption by exploring a dialectic between psychometric and hermeneutic approaches to drawing and warranting interpretations of human products or performances. Reliability, as it is typically defined and operationalized in the measurement literature (e.g., American Educational Research Association [AERA], American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, 1985; Feldt & Brennan, 1989), privileges standardized forms of assessment. By considering hermeneutic alternatives for serving the important epistemological and ethical purposes that reliability serves, we expand the range of viable high-stakes assessment practices to include those that honor the purposes that students bring to their work and the contextualized judgments of teachers.<br>

Wallace: "It is the premise of every religion-and this premise is religion's defining characteristic-that
souls, supernatural beings, and supernatural forces exist. Furthermore, there are certain minimal categories
of behavior which, in the context of the supernatural premise, are always found in association with one
another and which are the substance of religion itself' (1966: 52).

Article Title: Embracing Augustine: Reach, Restraint, and Romantic Resolution in the "Confessions"<br>
Publisher: Society for the Scientific Study of Religion<br>
Issue: i260003<br>
Date: 3 1, 1965<br>
Author(s): Woollcott W. Paul<br>
Abstract: Psychodynamically, Augustine's conversion responds to and reconstitutes tensions and relational ambivalences generated by his experiences with the "betraying embrace," principally as he has encountered its symbolic representation in his mother Monica's retentive and rejective tears, in one of her controlling dreams, and in his association with and loss of an unnamed friend. Those experiences crucially affect his own betrayals of secular covenants in his passage to conversion -- covenants with language and rhetoric, with order, and with "lower instincts," among others -- and are themselves transformatively replicated in divine and divinely sanctioned alliances scrupulously structured by his emotional requirements to prevent betrayal: in particular, Augustine's "Romantic" relationship with deific embrace perpetuates in an altered mode the discontent that brought him to seek it.<br>

su totalidad en Morales (2002). Continúo en éste mis meditaciones sobre el Testimonio publicadas
en la última década (\blek 1993, 1994, 1997 y 1998). Como el libro editado por Mario Roberto
Morales en Guatemala tendrá muy limitada circulación fuera de su país, agradezco el ofrecimiento
de David W. Foster de publicarlo en Chasqui; como siempre, he aprovechado la oportunidad para

Article Title: Professional Ethics in Social Work—What Future?<br>
Publisher: OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS<br>
Issue: i23714806<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): BANKS SARAH<br>
Abstract: This paper examines the ethical implications of recent changes in social work, particularly in relation to the conception of social workers as professionals guided by a code of ethics. These changes include the fragmentation of the occupation, the increasing proceduralization of the work and the growing focus on consumer rights and user participation. Some people have argued that codes of ethics are becoming increasingly irrelevant in this climate, in that they assume a unified occupational group and are based upon professionals' definition of values without consultation with service users. On the other hand, it has also been maintained that it is ever more important to retain and strengthen codes of ethics in order to maintain professional identity and to defend the work of the profession from outside attack. This paper explores the relevance of a code of professional ethics for social work, focusing particularly on the British Association of Social Workers' code, in the context of the changing organization and practice of the work. It considers two alternative approaches: the 'new consumerism' which focuses on the worker's technical skills (rather than professional ethics) and consumer rights (as opposed to professional obligations); and a 'new radicalism' which stresses the worker's own personal or political commitment and individual moral responsibility (as opposed to an externally imposed code of professional ethics). It is concluded that the changes in social work do threaten the notion of a single set of professional ethics articulated in a code, and that, in some types of work, this model is less appropriate. However, there is still mileage in retaining and developing a code of ethics, not as an imposed set of rules developed by the professional association, but as part of a dynamic and evolving ethical tradition in social work and as a stimulus for debate and reflection on changing and contradictory values.<br>

Abstract: Disciplina acuñada en el XIX, la filología surge como historicidad fundamental, identificando la significación de una obra con sus condiciones de producción originarias, un discurso de la ciencia (historia) sobre la lengua y la literatura. La hermenéutica contemporánea supone una ruptura de la razón histórico-filológica y una afirmación de los nuevos significados que a un texto se le añaden al pasar de un contexto cultural u otro nuevo. Para la filología, el criterio pedagógico único de explicación de los textos es la restitución de la intención deliberada y originaria del autor. Hermenéutica y teoría de la literatura afirman que no hay adecuación lógica necesaria entre sentido de la obra e intención de autor. Tras la “muerte del autor” del formalismo semiótico, la posmodernidad niega el texto mismo y afirma que éste tiene tantos sentido como lectores. A discipline minted in the 19th century, philology, emerges as a fundamental historicist approach, identifying the significance of a work with its original conditions of production, a discourse from science (history) about language and literature. Contemporary hermeneutics assumes a break with historical-philological reason, as well as an affirmation of the new meanings added to a text by passing from one cultural context to another new one. For philology, the only pedagogical criterion in explaining texts is the restitution of deliberate and original authorial intent. Hermeneutics and literary theory assert that there is no logical association necessary between the meaning of the work, and authorial intent. Since the “death of the author” of semiotic formalism, postmodernity has denied the text itself, instead asserting that it has as many meanings as it has readers.<br>

Abstract: A. Fouillée, La psychologie des Idées-Forces (2 vols.), Paris 1894, Bd.I,
Kap. 2, La force d'association des idées, S. 209ff. Dort heißt es u. a. : C'est l'habitude
tantôt à l'état naissant, tantôt plus ou moins complète, qui se révèle à elle-même
dans la conscience par un sentiment spécial, et ce sentiment spécial fait le fond de la
reconnaissance. D'autre part l'habitude est une adaptation au milieu, selon la
grande loi de sélection universelle; c'est l'adaptation de la puissance à la
résistance, de l'activité à son objet. Reconnaître, c'est donc avant tout avoir con-
science d'agir avec une moindre résistance. Mais, pour que l'habitude aussi formée
devienne consciente de soi, il faut que nous puissions apercevoir tout ensemble la
différence et la ressemblance du nouveau avec l'ancien, de l'accoutumé avec le
familier. Reconnaître, c'est donc saisir à la fois des différences et des ressemblances,
saisir des rapports, comparer (S. 242).<br>

Article Title: Zum Phänomen der Deckerinnerung: Eine Auseinandersetzung zwischen Freud und Husserl<br>
Publisher: FELIX MEINER VERLAG<br>
Issue: i24358470<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Serra Alice Mara<br>
Abstract: The concept Deckerinnerung (en. screen-memory), which appeared in Freud's work in 1899, points towards the important epistemological question about the possibility of adequation or coincidence (Deckung) between past experience and the current act that is being presentified. This can take the form of remembering as such or be conceived as fantasy. In order to clarify the differences between fantasy and memory, or rather their interconnection in the Deckerinnerung, they need to be looked at phenomenologically, and in doing so various aspects should be analysed, such as: the character of positional and neutralised acts of presentification; the interference of conscious attention and the phenomenon of inhibition in the act of presentification; the state of memories in the unconscious and the possibilities of their association between themselves or modification by other current acts. While Freud introduces the subject without further analysing it, Husserl's theories offer a valuable contribution here. In this context, there is first a need to outline the way in which Husserl's investigations into memory come close to Freud's discourse, in the sense that they lead to a "Phenomenology of the Unconscious" (Hua XI; Mat. VIII).<br>

Abstract: Cécile et Étienne sont amants. Elle est âgée de trente-six ans, mariée et mère, vit à Paris; il a dix ans de moins, est célibataire, provincial et sans expérience sexuelle. Leur importante correspondance a été déposée à l'Association pour l'autobiographie et le patrimoine autobiographique (APA) et constitue une source d'une grande richesse. Faisant appel à la microhistoire et attentive à l'analyse des discours, nous proposons de suivre le développement de l'histoire d'amour de Cécile et Étienne entre 1945 et 1960, en s'attardant sur ses prémices entre 1945 et 1949. L'analyse d'une relation adultère vécue de l'intérieur permet de mieux comprendre les métamorphoses de l'intimité au cours de cette période du baby-boom, en particulier les rôles masculin et féminin. Cette histoire singulière permet aussi d'éclairer, par un jeu de contrastes, les représentations de la conjugalité pendant les décennies d'après-guerre — période de doutes au sujet de l'intimité. En quoi ce couple adultère interroge-t-il et contourne-t-il les normes conjugales, tout en cherchant à s'y conformer? Cécile and Étienne were lovers. She was a thirty-six year-old mother, married and living in Paris; he was ten years younger, single, living in the suburbs and lacking in sexual experience. Their vast correspondence, deposited with the Association pour l'autobiographie et le patrimoine autobiographique (APA, Association for Autobiography and Autobiographical Heritage), constitutes a documentary source of great value. Referencing the phenomenon of microhistory and relying upon discourse analysis, we shall attempt to follow the trajectory of Cécile and Étienne's relationship between 1945 and 1960, focusing in particular on its beginnings from 1945 to 1949. Analysing an adulterous relationship from such an inside perspective will shed light on the metamorphosis of intimacy that occurred during the Baby Boom era, in particular with regard to male and female gender roles. By playing with contrasts, this uni~<br>

Abstract: Parmi les sources locales de sa narration, Tidjani-Serpos cite feu daagbo Hunon Huna et les
membres âgés de l'UGDO (Union générale pour le développement de Ouidah), une association
composée, depuis le milieu des années 1980, par un groupe de notables et d'intellectuels qui se sont
constitués en groupe de pression politique et économique. En misant entre autres sur la richesse du
passé historique et du patrimoine immobilier de leur ville, l'action de l'UGDO comptait sur
l'apport potentiel de la coopération internationale et du tourisme. Sur le rôle joué par l'UGDO
dans la valorisation culturelle du passé de l'esclavage et de sa connexion avec le renouveau culturel
du vodun, cf. Ugdo (1985).<br>

Goodwin la définit comme : « un processus intérieur par lequel les impressions sensorielles sont
transportées d'un sens vers un autre » (1992 : 50).<br>

Abstract: This paper was prepared for the Third International Symposium of the Association for Calvin-
ist Philosophy, On Being Human', and presented on August 15,1987 at Zeist, The Netherlands,
in celebration of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Association.
To facilitate international discussion I have referred to English-language publications as much
as possible, in both the text and the notes. As a regrettable but unavoidable result, a number of
publications important to the Association have been left out of consideration.
I wish to thank especially, among those to whom I am indebted, dr. J. D. Dengerink and dr.
M. D. Stafleu, for their extensive and documented commentaries on an earlier version of the
text.<br>

Abstract: Dooyeweerd does indeed speak of actual transcending of cosmic time. In the well-known
note in NC I, 31-32, in reaction to the Divergentierapport I' written by Vollenhoven and
circulating among board members of the Association for Calvinistic Philosophy, he writes:
" (...) Some seek the concentration-point of human existence in time and suppose, that this
religious centre must certainly be pre-functional but not supra-temporal. But, at least within
the horizon of cosmic time we have no single experience of something 'pre-functional', i.e.
of anything that would transcend the modal diversity of the aspects. We gain this
experience only in the religious concentration of the radix of our existence upon the
absolute Origin. In this concentration we transcend cosmic time. How could man direct
himself toward eternal things, if eternity were not 'set in his heart'? Even the idolatrous
absolutizing of the temporal cannot be explained from the temporal horizon of human
existence. For the latter nowhere provides a point of contact for an idea of the absolute,
unless it be related apriori to the supra-temporal. This act of concentration presupposes a
supra-temporal starting-point in our consciousness.
This, however, is not to say that the religious centre of human existence is found in a rigid
and static immobility. That is a metaphysical-Greek idea of supra-temporality."
Reading this passage we should realize that Dooyeweerd's notion of time refers to cosmic time,
which is related to modal diversity (and coherence) rather than transience. This is the reason
why Dooyeweerd cannot but say that the unity of existence can only be grasped by
transcending temporal diversity. So, we can conclude that the difference between Dooyeweerd
and Vollenhoven with respect to the supra-temporality of the heart depends on different views
on time and the cosmic time order. Vollenhoven's rejection of the notion of cosmic time order
and his exclusion of numerical and spatial modal qualifications fr~<br>

Publisher: Maney Publishing<br>
Issue: i25479101<br>
Date: 7 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Soroka Mykola Iv.<br>
Abstract: Because of the close association between ideology and utopia, Volodymyr Vynnychenko's three-volume utopian novel "Soniachna mashyna" (1921-24, published in 1928), one of the most well known and discussed works in Ukrainian literature, has more often been approached as a product of his political and ideological preoccupations. While I do not disregard this, in my paper I propose a new reading from a largely neglected perspective of geographical displacement as a social, cultural and psychological phenomenon in an effort to bring fresh theoretical insight into the study of utopian writings. It maintains that Vynnychenko's utopia was largely inspired by his involuntary stay outside his homeland, in Germany, which led to a state of existential uncertainty, feelings of extreme uprootedness, and the desire to overcome this conflict with the reality of his day. The paper examines the writer's personal attitude to his displacement and uses the theoretical paradigm of utopia and nostalgia to argue that his utopia was aimed at a 'reconstruction' of his highly unstable identity by transcending the intolerable present and a projection of a better future.<br>

Date: 2 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Tourage Mahdi<br>
Abstract: This paper is a phenomenological study of one of Simin Behbahani's better known poems, "Raqqaseh," which is about the nightly ritualized dance of a dancing girl in a tavern. It will argue that the tavern in this poem could be viewed as a cultural container for socially dangerous representations and impulses, like the metaphoric sexualized body of the dancing girl. The tavern could also be viewed as a semiotic register for the symbolic representation of the dominant normative social discourse. By viewing the dance as performance, the communicative association of the symbolic significance of the dancing girl's body and the tavern and its audience will also be discussed. This paper will argue that the reader too is implicated in the performative function of the text.<br>

Abstract: Public financial education is an emerging theme in international public policy, presented by its promoters as a way of protecting citizens faced with the liberalization of financial markets, which shifts risk from the State and collective actors to individuals. This article will examine its development in France, and its overlap with the transformation of social work. We will first describe the social space of financial education, which brings together an unexpected coalition of representatives from financial institutions and social service and aid organizations. We will then go on to focus on one of this space’s central actors,
         Finances et Pedagogie(an association created by the bankCaisses d’Épargne), analyzing its partnerships with associations and social services.<br>

Abstract: At least since Aristotle, phronesis (practical wisdom) and poetics (making or creating) have been understood as essentially different activities, one moral the other (in itself) non-moral. Today, if anything, this distinction is sharpened by a Romantic association of poetics with inner subjective expression. Recent revivals of Aristotelian ethics sometimes allow for poetic dimensions of ethics, but these are still separated from practical wisdom per se. Through a fresh reading of phronesis in the French hermeneutical phenomenologist Paul Ricoeur, I argue that phronesis should be viewed as at least in part poetic at its very core. That is, phronesis deals with the fundamentally tragic human situation of moral incommensurability, and it responds to this by making or creating new moral meaning. Such a poetics of practical wisdom helps phronesis stand up to significant and important critiques made of it by a range of modernists and post-modernists, pointing a way forward for some important contemporary moral debates.<br>

Abstract: Tal discusión se encuentra de nuevo en Andrew Abbott, ibid., ps. 226-230. La section espe-

con artículos de gente tan significativa como George Steinmetz, Mary Jo Maynes, Margaret R.
Somers, Janet Hart y Luisa Passerini. Un argumento provocador y claramente favorable a la
narración lo defiende Alan Megill en "Recounting the Past: Description, Explanation and
Narrative in Historiography", The American Historical Review, 94, 3 (1989), ps. 627-653 (tra-
ducción en Historia Social, 16, 1993). Tratamientos más amplios del tema se encuentran,
como se sabe, en Paul Ricoeur, Tiempoy narración. Configuratión del tiempo en el re lato
histórico, Ediciones Cristiandad, Madrid, 1987 y en Hayden White, The Content of the Form.
Narrative, Discourse and Historical Representation, The Johns Hopkins University Press,

Abstract: Hannah Arendt hat einmal von der perfiden Auffassung der Nationalsozialisten “guilt
by association" gesprochen, womit gemeint war, dass jeder, der mit “Juden" umgehe,
sich “schuldig" mache, vgl. Hannah Arendt, Elemente und Ursprünge totaler Herr-
schaft. Antisemitismus, Imperialismus, totale Herrschaft, München 2000, S. 696. Auf-
fällig ist die bei Fest und anderen zu findende, ständige Hervorhebung “jüdischer
Freundschaften" bis hin “zur selbstlosen Hilfsbereitschaft und Sorge" seiner Familie
auch unter der Gefahr der Verfolgung. In der auffälligen Art und Weise der fortwäh-
renden Betonung steckt ein signifikantes Erzählmuster, das die persönliche Abgrenzung
gegenüber den Nationalsozialisten noch einmal herausstellt. Auf die Problematik einer
trennenden Semantik in “Deutsche" und “Juden", wie sie von Fest vorgenommen wird
(vgl. ebd., z.B. S. 344), kann nicht weiter eingegangen werden.<br>

Publisher: British Forum for Ethnomusicology<br>
Issue: i354683<br>

Author(s): Witherspoon Timothy<br>
Abstract: Musical meaning is examined from three perspectives, with ethnographic examples from Bulgarian music. First, music's significance for human life and its very nature are understood through metaphorical predication - for example, music is art; music is social behaviour; music is commodity; music is symbol or text. Interpretations of musical signification result from processes of identity, iconicity, association and contrast, which help to create multiple meanings for music. Finally, while states and other institutions often try to control music's meaning, its polyvalent nature and the differing social and historical positions of its interpreters militate against all such efforts.<br>

Article Title: The Development of Religious Research in the United States: Retrospect and Prospect<br>
Publisher: Religious Research Association<br>
Issue: i284834<br>
Date: 10 1, 1968<br>
Author(s): Zuck W. Widick<br>
Abstract: This paper examines the professionalization of religious research in the United States and related topics. Because professional societies illumine value orientations and practices among workers in a given field, the nature of the American Catholic Sociological Society, the American Society of Christian Ethics, the Religious Research Association, and the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion are briefly considered. The differential appropriation of religious research in various ecclesiastical bodies, the problem of funding religious research in the American situation, and the shift in emphasis from a pragmatic problem-solving approach focused on institutional survival to a more theoretical approach to the understanding of religious phenomena are discussed. The bifurcation between persons interested in religious research trained under theological faculties and those trained under social science faculties is noted. Likely future lines of development in theory and research are projected.<br>

Abstract: This essay expresses ambivalence about the use of the term "evil" in analyses of terrorism in light of the association of the two in speeches intended to justify the United States' "war on terrorism." At the same time, the essay suggests that terrorism can be regarded as "evil" but only when considered among a multiplicity of "evils" comparable to it, for example: rape, war crimes, and repression.<br>

Publisher: Scholars Press<br>
Issue: i40000773<br>
Date: 4 1, 1988<br>
Author(s): Gunnemann Jon P.<br>
Abstract: Accepting MacIntyre's teleological argument that the notion of individual rights is an invention or fiction, the article argues, against MacIntyre, that such a fiction may be interpreted as a creative response to the social requirements of modernity. Such rights language discloses the essential features of modernity but also the underlying teleological and moral structure of all human association. But whether rights language is perceived as a fall from morality or as a creative differentiation of moral language depends on a reading of history and especially on the interpretation of the Enlightenment project. Jürgen Habermas is used for an alternative reading of the Enlightenment and the relation of rights to the normative teleology of language itself. But both readings of history turn out to be theodicies, dependent upon hidden theological assumptions. Whether a society centered on a notion of rights can be governed by teleology can only be answered theologically.<br>

Article Title: Plato's Brush with the Golden Rule<br>
Publisher: Scholars Press<br>
Issue: i40000936<br>
Date: 4 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Wattles Jeffrey<br>
Abstract: The drama of Plato's brush with the kind of thinking formulated in the golden rule--"Do to others as you want others to do to you"--discloses (1) ambiguity in the rule, due to its association with the popular Greek practice of helping friends and harming enemies, and (2) an unnoticed philosophic and/or religious solution to a problem raised by this ambiguity. Revising Albrecht Dihle's influential analysis in "Die Goldene Regel" (1962), this article explores the philosophic implications of golden-rule thinking in three of Plato's sources--Homer, Herodotus, and Isocrates--and in three texts from the dialogues: "Crito" 50a-54d, "Phaedo" 62b-c, and "Laws" 913a.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40044033<br>
Date: 5 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Barber Michael<br>
Abstract: Dorion Cairns correctly interprets the preconstituted stratum of Edmund Husserl's Fifth Cartesian Meditation to be the primordial ego and not the social world, as was thought by Alfred Schutz, who considered Husserl to be insufficiently attentive to the social world's hold upon us. Following Cairns's interpretation, which involves recovering and reconstructing strata that may never exist independently, one better understands how the transfer of sense "animate organism" involves automatic association, or somatic apprehension. This sense-transfer extends to any animate organism, not just humans, and draws on extensive unreflected-upon similarities despite the distinctive fact that the other's body is never given to oneself as is one's own. Following Cairns's interpretation, one can also understand the second epoché as an imaginative, reconstructive abstraction rather than as an example of failed ascesis. Consequently, Husserl appears as less intellectualized in his approach to empathy than often thought to be and more confident in the phenomenologist's capacity to imagine and attend selectively to experience.<br>

Abstract: Le Quilt possède une double dimension, singulière et militante : chaque panneau, chaque nom énoncé lors du déploiement signifie l'unicité de chaque disparu ; mais l'assemblage des patchworks, leur abandon à l'association qui va les recueillir, les assembler et les utiliser pour porter à l'attention du monde entier l'énormité de la catastrophe renvoie à la dimension sociale inhérente au décès de chaque individu mort du sida. Le développement fulgurant du rite du patchwork aux États-Unis s'explique par ce double enjeu et par la réappropriation de symboles fondateurs de l'imaginaire américain. En se réappropriant un symbole commun, le Quilt légitime et réintègre la communauté gay porteuse du projet dans cette société qui l'a niée. The Quilt has from the outset both a singular and militant dimension : each panel, each name mentioned during the unfolding means the uniqueness of each dead ; but the assembled patchworks, their donation to the association which will conserve, assemble and use them to draw worldwide attention to this dreadful disaster refer to the social dimension inherent to each individual having died of AIDS. The extremely rapid development of the patchwork rite in the United States can be explained by these two functions and within the reappropriation of founding symbols of the Americans'world of imagination. By reappropriating a common symbol the Quilt legitimates and reintegrates the gay community, bearer of the project, into a society from which it was rejected. Von Anfang an hat der Quilt eine eigenartige und zugleich militante Dimension. Jeder Teil des Patchworks, jeder Name, der während der Entfaltung ausgesprochen wird, besagt die Eigenartigkeit jedes Gestorbenen. Doch verweisen das Zusammenfügen der Patchworkwerke und ihre Überlassung dem Verein, der sie bewahren, zusammenfügen und verwenden wird, um die Aufmerksamkeit der ganzen Welt auf diese schreckliche Katastrophe zu lenken, auf die dem Tode jedes AIDSkranken inhärente soziale Dimension.

Abstract: This paper reviews a body of data that identifies underlying influences that have contributed to an evolving change in American Psychiatry toward a more positive and receptive stance toward religion and spirituality over the past three decades. This development, surprising in light of the remedicalization of psychiatry and its predominantly neuro-biological orientation, is attributed to five foundational ideas that have helped to leverage this change. These are significance of culture, creative power of ritual, psychic function of belief, neuro-biology of spirituality, and relevance of recovery narratives. The impact of these factors for psychiatric assessment and treatment is described, as well as the contribution of the Oskar Pfister legacy and award to the ongoing dialogue between religion and psychiatry. Adapted from the American Psychiatric Association's 2011 Oskar Pfister Lecture in Religion and Psychiatry.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113416<br>
Date: 10 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Burgan Mary<br>
Abstract: Despite recent critical denigrations of the representation of temporality as a defining interest in narrative, it is important to reappraise the epiphany as a feature of the short stories of "founding" modernist women writers like Virginia Woolf and Katherine Mansfield. Nevertheless, the association of the epiphanic story with "feminine" writing drove a writer like Doris Lessing to reject the epiphany as an organizing principle in her stories; she chose, instead, the more fabular, allegorical model of a writer like D. H. Lawrence. Finally, however, Lessing, like other women writers of the short story, kept in touch with the intuition of revelation in moments of being whose power act not only as organizers of narrative but also as significations of a kind of feminine sensory apprehension of temporality. This discursive implementation of the moment as the center of modernist women writers' short fiction may be recuperated so as to preserve their achievements from the preference for a decentered écriture féminine.<br>

Abstract: Cet article prend en examen les occurrences de maintenant dans Du côté de chez Swann. Cet adverbe figure en association avec différents temps verbaux, du présent (déictique et historique), à l'imparfait, au passé simple. Après avoir passé en revue les théories attribuant à maintenant en contexte non embrayé la fonction de créer un effet de point de vue ou d'éclairer la conscience d'un personnage, l'auteur décrit deux cas où l'emploi du déictique apparaît par contre comme un stratagème pour employer cet «éternel imparfait» que Proust théorisa dans À propos du style de Flaubert.<br>

Article Title: A Discourse on Theory II: Three Tyrannies of Contemporary Theory and the Alternative of Hermeneutics<br>
Publisher: The University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i40132187<br>
Date: 10 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Corner James<br>
Abstract: This essay is about the crisis of creativity and meaning in contemporary Western culture and how the use of modern landscape and architectural theory works to perpetuate an excessively "hard" or neutral world—a world in which culture can no longer figure or recollect itself. A brief critique of three predominant approaches toward contemporary theory is presented: positivism, the use of paradigms, and the Avant-Garde. In different ways, each approach derives from modern techno-scientific thinking and invariably seeks closure, certainty, and control. The built landscapes that result often suffer from an equally closed explicitude: a stifling immanence where all is exposed and nothing is left to imagination. The essay suggests an alternative strategy grounded in the tradition of hermeneutics. Here, theory is something ever-open, permitting a free association of ideas through the mechanics of situational interpretation and metaphor. Hermeneutics provides the basis for a landscape architectural theory that transcends pictorial image and historical style by critically engaging contemporary circumstance and tradition. The landscape itself is a hermeneutic medium and becomes the ground for such an endeavor, enabling the remembrance, renewal, and transformation of a cultural tradition. The author argues that a hermeneutic approach to the theory and practice of landscape architecture is a way of returning to our designed landscapes the powers of the everyday and the revelatory—the grounds of memory and hope.<br>

Abstract: Des ciseaux et de la colle. Des ailes sur une page. La grandeur des caractères. Ces matériaux ont tous eu leur importance lorsque les lecteurs du début du XVIIe siècle ont tenté de comprendre leur théologie du temps à travers les pages de leurs livres. Cet article montre que la poésie de George Herbert revêt une profonde association entre les idées concernant le texte et celles relevant de l'histoire théologique, association qui était familière pour les lecteurs d'almanachs et d'harmonies bibliques. Les poèmes d'Herbert impliquent que l'individu puisse donner une signification à sa propre vie, dans le cadre d'une histoire théologique linéaire et cohérente basée sur la création, la chute, la rédemption et la résurrection des morts. Puisque cette histoire linéaire se basait sur les Écritures et sur son interprétation dans l'Angleterre du XVIIe siècle, la démarche consistant à donner une signification à une vie individuelle dans le cadre de cette histoire théologique était expérimentée à travers le texte, considéré à la fois comme un contenu intellectuel et comme une forme matérielle. The Temple révèle également des tensions entre l'exploration d'Herbert dans le temps de chaque jour apparemment chaotique et sa foi dans la cohérence de l'histoire théologique linéaire. Ses efforts pour réduire ces tensions le conduit à utiliser des métaphores impliquant la matérialité du texte, renforçant ainsi les liens entre la théologie du temps et la matérialité du texte dans son œuvre, ainsi que dans l'expérience de ses lecteurs contemporains.<br>

Publisher: Becker Associates<br>

Abstract: Thousands of child Holocaust survivors arrived in Montreal, Quebec, between 1947 and 1952, looking to remake their lives, rebuild their families, and recreate their communities. Integration was not seamless. As survivors struggled to carve spaces for themselves within the established Canadian Jewish community, their difficult wartime stories were neither easily received nor understood. When remembering this period, survivors tend to speak about employment, education, dating, integration into both the pre-war Jewish community and the larger society, and, perhaps most importantly, the creation of their own social worlds within existing and new frameworks. Forged in a transitional and tumultuous period in Quebec's history, these social worlds, as this article demonstrates, are an important example of survivor agency. Although survivors recall the ways in which Canadian Jews helped them adjust to their new setting, by organizing a number of programs and clubs within various spaces—Jeanne Mance House, the Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association, and the Jewish Public Library—they also speak about how they forged their own paths upon arriving in this postwar city. For instance, survivors created the New World Club, an informal and grassroots social organization where they could prioritize their own needs and begin to be understood as people, and not just survivors. Establishing the interconnections between these formal and informal social worlds, and specifically, how survivors navigated them, is central to understanding the process through which they were able to move beyond their traumatic pasts and start over. Nightmares and parties are parts of the same story, and here the focus is on the memories of young survivors who prioritized their social worlds. Des milliers d'enfants survivants de l'Holocauste sont arrivés à Montréal, au Québec, entre 1947 et 1952, cherchant à refaire leurs vies, reconstruire leurs familles et recréer leurs communautés.

Abstract: But I'm getting ahead of myself. A clueless graduate student, I wandered onto this pockmarked battlefield in 1964, when I learned that the third SPEP meeting would be held at Yale. (An aside here: if the first meeting was in 1962, shouldn't we be celebrating in 2012? Maybe the first meeting was really in 1961. In any case, I wouldn't know, because I wasn't there.) Some of my fellow graduate students and I were puzzled and wondered what to expect. We thought of phenomenology, and especially existentialism, as rather antiestablishment currents, and the idea of an academic conference devoted to them seemed incongruous. I remember Chip Dallery wondering if there would be an “existentialist smoker.” Some of you may find this hard to believe, but “smoker” was the name given to the evening receptions at conferences like the American Philosophical Association (APA) in those days. The word perfectly encapsulated the hugely male-dominated, tweed-jacketed, pipe-smoking atmosphere of the era. We wondered: Would there be black sweaters and black berets instead of tweeds and Gauloises instead of pipes? Maybe we even enjoyed thinking of ourselves as outsiders and thought the idea of founding a society was too much like imitating the ways of the APA and other establishment groups. We didn't understand the politics of academia or feel the need for establishing ties with like-minded philosophers elsewhere. But that just shows how naive we were.<br>

Abstract: There was, for example, nothing phenomenologically promising about assurances that theory discovery was now to be made just as important as confirmation, when confirmation of predictive theories was still taken to be the “essence” of all science. In general, it is useful to remember that one of the best-known opponents of positivism at the time—someone historians of analytic philosophy now usually depict as the pioneer postpositivist—was Quine, who was still assuring his fellow revisionists in the 1970s that even after the demise of logical empiricism, “philosophy of science is philosophy enough.”
      
            Perhaps in mid-twentieth-century America, this was a good slogan for the Philosophy of Science Association; but for the American Philosophy Association (APA), it was intellectual bigotry. Analytic postpositivism was really just positivism-lite.8

Abstract: For this fiftieth anniversary of the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP), my idea is to characterize the association then and now in terms of an actual trajectory of learning, thinking, and writing that shows concrete experience of how phenomenology has changed while still remaining what I found it to be then: a philosophic movement vital to the time in which I was living—now, the twenty-first century. I do not think of my experience as the paradigm but, rather, one of many exemplifications, and the one I understand best. It has been a trajectory of four distinct beginnings in phenomenology.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>

Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: I want to thank the organizers for allowing us to go back to those halcyon days of yore when we were young, the world was ours, and we, the carriers of the coals, were unintentionally about to bring critical theory to the United States. No doubt I played a minor role in that process, and looking back there was no singular event that led to my association with critical theory but, rather, a curious set of happenings that led to encounters, friendships, and a richness of life that I could not have fathomed when I made a simple trip to Germany in 1971. At the time I considered myself to be a thoroughgoing phenomenologist and hermeneuticist. I had written my first book on Paul Ricoeur and was hired to teach philosophy of religion, having had the good fortune of having been a student directly of Mircea Eliade and indirectly of Paul Ricoeur. No doubt I would still be teaching and writing about the philosophy of religion had it not been for the events of the day. America was “all shook up” with the opposition to the Vietnam War, the dilemma of the draft and the reaction to it on college campuses, Kent State, the invasion of Cambodia, the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, and numerous other incidents. True, I had no particular qualifications to deal with those things; none of us did. But I was prone to try. I was equipped by sentiment if not by intellect.<br>

Abstract: In 1961 the relatively few philosophers in the United States who were interested in phenomenological and existentialist thought had few occasions to teach it or to work together professionally. Most philosophers in the tradition of positivism or that of what came to be known as analytic philosophy did not consider either phenomenology or existentialism as proper philosophy, and most philosophy departments were not interested in hiring even token colleagues in either area of expertise. The American Philosophical Association, of course, did not welcome papers in those areas. The New School for Social Research and Duquesne University had a core of philosophers, many of whom came to the States consequent to German National Socialism, who knew well the major phenomenological works. Northwestern University also became a leader in phenomenological thought, while Yale, thanks primarily to George Schrader, and Purdue, thanks to Cal Schrag and Richard Grabau, had graduate programs in 1961 where people could concentrate in phenomenology and existentialism (although Purdue formulated its Ph.D. program in philosophy in 1963, an M.A. in philosophy was possible in 1961). The full story of the early development of those two areas in the United States is complex and has yet to be told, but I want to note that the effort of many people who were on the front lines confronting a hostile professional atmosphere made possible SPEP's origination and set it on a course that worked a major change in our profession. That is a change that is not unlike the one effected by postmodern developments within SPEP itself, as we shall see.<br>

Abstract: Indeed, the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health reports that individuals with hope deficits experience a range of enervating feelings that include helplessness, guilt, and despair; and in extreme cases, says the institute, the hopeless may succumb to depression and suicide.
         
               Similarly, the American Psychological Association links hopelessness with helplessness, self-blame and, most notably, depression.7
            
               “People who are depressed,” the association observes, “may become overwhelmed and exhausted and stop participating in certain everyday activities altogether. They may withdraw from family and friends. Some depressed individuals may have thoughts of death or suicide.”8
            
               Clinically speaking, the hopeless are mired in distress, immiserated. They cannot lead fulfilling lives, let alone thrive. In acute circumstances, they may even choose not to live at all. Clearly, when hopelessness metastasizes into depression, it becomes a life-threatening disease. Hence, without the therapeutic restoration of hope, the forlorn remain in grave danger of frantically treading water for a while and then, with no lifeline in sight, eventually drowning from sheer debilitation in a sea of isolation and anguish. Hope, then, is undeniably critical to wellness, and, in my judgment, hope is precisely the quality that best accounts for the buoyancy Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur demonstrated throughout their long and productive lives—lives that included frustration, disappointment, and adversity along with success, satisfaction, and recognition.9<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>

Abstract: For Vidler, dissolution of the Soviet Empire, especially the ritualized razing of the Berlin Wall, amounted to a requiem for Marx and communism, and with them, Utopia—apparent confirmation that there really is
         no alternativeto capitalism, just as neoliberals have long believed. Arguably, this self-serving conviction does not so much bespeak a crisis of Utopia as it is a failure of imagination (which makes envisioning subversion from within all but impossible). While Vidler's association of “the fall of the Berlin Wall” with “the proclaimed death of communism and Marx” may seem reasonable enough, interpreting this as ensuring the end of Utopia disregards thepermanence of desire. In this regard, Zygmunt Bauman observes, “Imagining a better life than the existing one, a life that does not yet exist but one that could and should exist—the eternal source of ‘utopian thinking’ that never runs dry—is as rich, and possibly even richer than at the time of Sir Thomas More.”
