  Abstract: The narrator of
                  In Search of Lost Timeis beset by trauma. By his own admission, he locates suffering in two maternally marked experiences in his past. The event he cites first is that fateful evening when his “mother abdicated her authority,” in the young Marcel’s bedroom at Combray; the second encompasses the many months during which the narrator observed the slow death of his grandmother.¹ The narrator is anguished: not only did he inflict pain on his mother when he “traced in her soul a first wrinkle and caused a first white hair to appear,” but also he wounded<br>

  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: This chapter argues that moving beyond realism—to post-realism—requires moving beyond the gender-blindness of conventional accounts.¹ My argument weaves together areas of inquiry that are usually treated in isolation. Intellectual developments associated with the rise of systematic inquiry in ancient Greece—marked by the shift from rhetoric to philosophy and its foundational dichotomies of reason over affect, mind over body—comprise one area of inquiry. Another is the study of historical-political developments—the shift to centralized authority and its dichotomies of public over private, civilized over “other”—within which Western science and political theory “emerged.” A third area of<br>

  Abstract: The intifada dramatically influenced the Palestinian symbol system. Writing in 1989, Rashid Khalidi observed that the intifada had created a “strong sense of national unity, of loyalty to a unified set of symbols and concepts and of mutual independence which were lacking in 1967.”¹ Without question, the engine of Palestinian symbol transformation was the intifada. The intifada, in turn, helped make possible the Oslo agreement, which led to Yasir Arafat’s return to Gaza in July 1994 and the creation of the Palestinian National Authority.<br>

  Abstract: The musical score is iconic in classical music. Only with the score can fully composed music, musical works, be transmitted intact for realization in multiple performances. The score, one would think, is a wonderful invention. But in recent years the score has lost a good measure of the authority and prestige that once seemed to accrue to it automatically. For some, at any rate, the chief features of the score are its incompleteness and imprecision, up to and including a fundamental falseness.<br>

  Abstract: A concern with time is intrinsic to the internal logic of modernity. “More than anything else,” Zygmunt Bauman writes, modernity is the “history of time: the time when time has history” (“Time and Space Reunited,” 172). Radically breaking with the authority and legitimacy of the past, modernity offers a totalizing vision of progress toward an illimitable future.¹ Its universal narrative of irrepressible global development presupposes a uniform scale of spatial and temporal measurement. In this context the legislative creation of world standard time at the International Prime Meridian Conference of 1884 stands as a signal moment in the history of<br>

  Book Title: A Problem of Presence-Beyond Scripture in an African Church<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Engelke Matthew<br>
  Abstract: The Friday Masowe apostolics of Zimbabwe refer to themselves as “the Christians who don’t read the Bible.” They claim they do not need the Bible because they receive the Word of God “live and direct” from the Holy Spirit. In this insightful and sensitive historical ethnography, Matthew Engelke documents how this rejection of scripture speaks to longstanding concerns within Christianity over mediation and authority. The Bible, of course, has been a key medium through which Christians have recognized God’s presence. But the apostolics perceive scripture as an unnecessary, even dangerous, mediator. For them, the materiality of the Bible marks a distance from the divine and prohibits the realization of a live and direct faith. Situating the Masowe case within a broad comparative framework, Engelke shows how their rejection of textual authority poses a problem of presence—which is to say, how the religious subject defines, and claims to construct, a relationship with the spiritual world through the semiotic potentials of language, actions, and objects. Written in a lively and accessible style, A Problem of Presence makes important contributions to the anthropology of Christianity, the history of religions in Africa, semiotics, and material culture studies.<br>

  Author(s): Hammoudi Abdellah<br>
  Abstract: Challenges to ethnographic authority and to the ethics of representation have led many contemporary anthropologists to abandon fieldwork in favor of strategies of theoretical puppeteering, textual analysis, and surrogate ethnography. In
      Being There,John Borneman and Abdellah Hammoudi argue that ethnographies based on these strategies elide important insights. To demonstrate the power and knowledge attained through the fieldwork experience, they have gathered essays by anthropologists working in Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tanzania, the Canadian Arctic, India, Germany, and Russia that shift attention back to the subtle dynamics of the ethnographic encounter. From an Inuit village to the foothills of Kilimanjaro, each account illustrates how, despite its challenges, fieldwork yields important insights outside the reach of textual analysis.<br>

  Book Title: Reconfiguring Modernity-Concepts of Nature in Japanese Political Ideology<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Thomas Julia Adeney<br>
  Abstract: Julia Adeney Thomas turns the concept of nature into a powerful analytical lens through which to view Japanese modernity, bringing the study of both Japanese history and political modernity to a new level of clarity. She shows that nature necessarily functions as a political concept and that changing ideas of nature's political authority were central during Japan's transformation from a semifeudal world to an industrializing colonial empire. In political documents from the nineteenth to the early twentieth century, nature was redefined, moving from the universal, spatial concept of the Tokugawa period, through temporal, social Darwinian ideas of inevitable progress and competitive struggle, to a celebration of Japan as a nation uniquely in harmony with nature. The so-called traditional "Japanese love of nature" masks modern state power. Thomas's theoretically sophisticated study rejects the supposition that modernity is the ideological antithesis of nature, overcoming the determinism of the physical environment through technology and liberating denatured subjects from the chains of biology and tradition. In making "nature" available as a critical term for political analysis, this book yields new insights into prewar Japan's failure to achieve liberal democracy, as well as an alternative means of understanding modernity and the position of non-Western nations within it.<br>

  Book Title: Controlling Contested Places-Late Antique Antioch and the Spatial Politics of Religious Controversy<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Shepardson Christine<br>
  Abstract: From constructing new buildings to describing rival-controlled areas as morally and physically dangerous, leaders in late antiquity fundamentally shaped their physical environment and thus the events that unfolded within it.
      Controlling Contested Placesmaps the city of Antioch (Antakya, Turkey) through the topographically sensitive vocabulary of cultural geography, demonstrating the critical role played by physical and rhetorical spatial contests during the tumultuous fourth century. Paying close attention to the manipulation of physical places, Christine Shepardson exposes some of the powerful forces that structured the development of religious orthodoxy and orthopraxy in the late Roman Empire.Theological claims and political support were not the only significant factors in determining which Christian communities gained authority around the Empire. Rather, Antioch's urban and rural places, far from being an inert backdrop against which events transpired, were ever-shifting sites of, and tools for, the negotiation of power, authority, and religious identity. This book traces the ways in which leaders like John Chrysostom, Theodoret, and Libanius encouraged their audiences to modify their daily behaviors and transform their interpretation of the world (and landscape) around them. Shepardson argues that examples from Antioch were echoed around the Mediterranean world, and similar types of physical and rhetorical manipulations continue to shape the politics of identity and perceptions of religious orthodoxy to this day.<br>

  Abstract: The investigation of fourth-century Antioch has revealed that the manipulation, and particularly the narrative construction, of topography played a significant role in shaping the increasing visibility of Christianity in urban and rural contexts, as well as in establishing the type of Christianity that became most prominent. The transference of relics, especially the final transfers of Babylas and the saints buried in the floor of the martyrion at the Romanesian Gate, granted more authority to Bishop Meletius’s community in Antioch, while diminishing the authority of the temple of Apollo and of local homoian Christians. John Chrysostom’s numerous rhetorical efforts further shaped<br>

  Book Title: In Defense of Doctrine-Evangelicalism, Theology, and Scripture<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Putman Rhyne R.<br>
  Abstract: Questions surrounding the relationship of Scripture and doctrine are legion within the Protestant tradition. How can doctrine develop over time and maintain fidelity to the sacred text, especially for communities who cling to the Reformation principle of sola scriptura? Does not an appeal to contemporary, constructive theology belie commonly held Protestant and Evangelical convictions about the sufficiency of Scripture? Does admission and acceptance of doctrinal development result in a kind of reality-denying theological relativism? And in what way can a growing, postcanonical tradition maintain a sense of continuity with the faith of the New Testament? This study is an apologetic for the ongoing, constructive theological task in Protestant and Evangelical traditions. It suggests that doctrinal development can be explained as a hermeneutical phenomenon and that insights from hermeneutical philosophy and the philosophy of language can aid theologians in constructing explanatory theses for particular theological problems associated with the facts of doctrinal development, namely, questions related to textual authority, reality depiction, and theological identity. Joining the recent call to theological interpretation of Scripture, Putman provides a constructive model that forwards a descriptive and normative pattern for reading Scripture and theological tradition together.<br>

  Author(s) Putman Rhyne<br>
  Abstract: While the Lord tarries, doctrine develops. The progress and growth of ideas is an inevitable historical reality, even in religious traditions purportedly rooted in divine revelation. In post-critical Christian theology, attitudes toward this phenomenon are undergoing considerable change. Once met with contempt and anxiety from Protestants and Roman Catholics alike, the idea of postcanonical doctrinal development nowadays meets with a far more favorable, even enthusiastic consent in both circles. Evangelicals, however, meet with the prospect of doctrinal development in the tension between two poles: an unwavering commitment to the supreme authority of God’s unchanging word (
                  sola scriptura) and a need<br>

  Abstract: Like the outer shell of a Kosta Boda bowl, the outer shell of the soul’s world is the moral universe. The moral universe is structured according to the principles of justice. We invoke these principles of justice—such as goodness, rightness, fairness, caring, loyalty, authority, and sanctity, when engaging in self-justification. However, we rarely stop to analyze our worldview, which includes our moral universe. We take it for granted, even though without it our very souls would disintegrate into emptiness.<br>

  Abstract: The third division of the Old Testament canon, the Writings (

That is true first because it is not a coherent body of literature as are the other two, but a miscellaneous collection. There is no agreement on the proper sequence of books, and the order varies from place to place. The second reason it is not properly a canon is that it does not seem to hold the same authority as the other parts of the canon.¹ In the first century ce, the Jewish<br>

Allegory is characterized by violence and is not at all beautiful, admittedly lacking “all ‘symbolic’ freedom of expression, all classical proportion, all humanity” (166;Der Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels145). Any time allegory is subjected to the critical palate of philosophical taste, it will seem a bitter alternative to beauty.

  Book Title: Human Rights, Inc.: The World Novel, Narrative Form, and International Law-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SLAUGHTER JOSEPH R.<br>
  Abstract: In this timely study of the historical, ideological, and formal interdependencies of the novel and human rights, Joseph Slaughter demonstrates that the twentieth-century rise of world literatureand international human rights law are related phenomena. Slaughter argues that international law shares with the modern novel a particular conception of the human individual. The Bildungsroman, the novel of coming of age, fills out this image, offering a conceptual vocabulary, a humanist social vision, and a narrative grammar for what the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and early literary theorists both call the free and full development of the human personality. Revising our received understanding of the relationship between law and literature, Slaughter suggests that this narrative form has acted as a cultural surrogate for the weak executive authority of international law, naturalizing the assumptions and conditions that make human rights appear commonsensical. As a kind of novelistic correlative to human rights law, the Bildungsroman has thus been doing some of the sociocultural work of enforcement that the law cannot do for itself. This analysis of the cultural work of law and of the social work of literature challenges traditional Eurocentric histories of both international law and the dissemination of the novel. Taking his point of departure in Goethe's Wilhelm Meister, Slaughter focuses on recent postcolonial versions of the coming-of-age story to show how the promise of human rights becomes legible in narrative and how the novel and the law are complicit in contemporary projects of globalization: in colonialism, neoimperalism, humanitarianism, and the spread of multinational consumer capitalism.Slaughter raises important practical and ethical questions that we must confront in advocating for human rights and reading world literature-imperatives that, today more than ever, are intertwined.<br>

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, eac~<br>

  Author(s): KEARNEY RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: This important book brings together in one volume a collection of illuminating encounters with some of the most important philosophers of our age-by one of its most incisive and innovative critics.For more than twenty years, Richard Kearney has been in conversation with leading philosophers, literary theorists, anthropologists, and religious scholars. His gift is eliciting memorably clear statements about their work from thinkers whose writings can often be challenging in their complexity. Here, he brings together twenty-one originally published extraordinary conversations-his 1984 collection Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, his 1992 Visions of Europe: Conversations on the Legacy and Future of Europe, and his 1995 States of Mind: Dialogues with Contemporary Thinkers. Featured interviewees include Stanislas Breton, Umberto Eco, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Herbert Marcus, George Steiner, Julia Kristeva, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard. To this classic core, he adds recent interviews, previously unpublished, with Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Jacques Derrida, and George DumZzil, as well as six colloquies about his own work.Wide-ranging and accessible, these interviews provide a fascinating guide to the ideas, concerns, and personalities of thinkers who have shaped modern intellec-tual life. This book will be an essential point of entry for students, teachers, scholars, and anyone seeking to understand contemporary culture.ContentsPrefacePart One: Recent DebatesJacques Derrida: Terror, Religion, and the New PoliticsJean-Luc Marion: The Hermeneutics of RevelationPaul Ricour: (a) On Life Stories (b) On The Crisis of Authority (c) The Power of the Possible (d) Imagination, Testimony, and TrustGeorges Dumzil: Myth, Ideology, SovereigntyPart Two: From Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, 1984Emmanuel Levinas: Ethics of the InfiniteHerbert Marcuse: The Philosophy of Art and PoliticsPaul Ricour: (a) The Creativity of Language (b) Myth as the Bearer of Possib~<br>

Meeting this challenge successfully requires effective practices of socialization, identity formation, role modeling, intergenerational transference of authority, and so on. Many other factors, however, typically play into the success or breakdown of social reproduction, including competing institutional demands and changing social environmental conditions that make passing on a collective way of life over time more or less difficult.

Ideological debates in the humanities will benefit immeasurably once we recognize that philosophical inquiry is not a hindrance to but an essential ally of empirical history. As Adorno frequently reminded us, the attempt to renounce all pretensions to subjective expression and surrender oneself to the objective authority of what exists (or has existed) is no less likely to lapse into idealism than the most detailed elaboration of self-reflexive<br>

  Abstract: Human narrators come in many forms. Some are completely reliable: most epic narrators speak with detachment, and thus with authority. They elicit trust. But human narrators may also be revealed as immoral by giving tongue to lies, by speaking themselves buffoons, unreliable, or dubious. Then their stories will
                  ring false, for while we may notknowthat the story is a lie, something about its presentation betrays its teller. When narration is allied to music, sensing truth demands doubly acute ears. Strauss’s Clytaemnestra says, “was die wahrheit ist, das dringt kein mensch heraus” [“what is true, what is untrue, no<br>

  Book Title: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan-Modernity, Loss, and the Doing of History<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Karlin Jason G.<br>
  Abstract: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan is a historical analysis of the discourses of nostalgia in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japan. Through an analysis of the experience of rapid social change in Japan’s modernization, it argues that fads (ryūkō) and the desires they express are central to understanding Japanese modernity, conceptions of gender, and discourses of nationalism. In doing so, the author uncovers the myth of eternal return that lurks below the surface of Japanese history as an expression of the desire to find meaning amid the chaos and alienation of modern times. The Meiji period (1868–1912) was one of rapid change that hastened the process of forgetting: The state’s aggressive program of modernization required the repression of history and memory. However, repression merely produced new forms of desire seeking a return to the past, with the result that competing or alternative conceptions of the nation haunted the history of modern Japan. Rooted in the belief that the nation was a natural and organic entity that predated the rational, modern state, such conceptions often were responses to modernity that envisioned the nation in opposition to the modern state. What these visions of the nation shared was the ironic desire to overcome the modern condition by seeking the timeless past. While the condition of their repression was often linked to the modernizing policies of the Meiji state, the means for imagining the nation in opposition to the state required the construction of new symbols that claimed the authority of history and appealed to a rearticulated tradition. Through the idiom of gender and nation, new reified representations of continuity, timelessness, and history were fashioned to compensate for the unmooring of inherited practices from the shared locales of everyday life. This book examines the intellectual, social, and cultural factors that contributed to the rapid spread of Western tastes and styles, along with the backlash again~<br>

  Abstract: At least three different and influential theories of interpretation claim to be pragmatist. Knapp and Michaels’s theory is rigidly intentionalistic and author bound, while Richard Rorty’s contrastingly emphasizes the production of nonauthorial readings. The third, advanced by Stanley Fish, submits (and dissolves) both author and reader to the notion of the interpretive community as the authority determining the proper meaning of a text. In this essay I investigate two of these rival theories, examining them in the light of more general pragmatist principles. The purpose of this exercise is not to award a prize for the most authentically pragmatist theory<br>

This phase differs from theology’s historical or positive phase, wherein the theologian is seeking to recover from the past just what it is that has been revealed within that tradition.

As we saw, self-interpretation is a matter of strong evaluation, a second-order evaluation of oneself. Are my desires, goals, and commitments good? Am I living the way I should? Is it good that I “am”? We evaluate ourselves, in this strong sense, within a horizon of significance—i.e., a set of background assumptions regarding what is good, meaningful, and valuable. Moreover, this strong evaluation takes place before some authority. The category of “existence before” is therefore essential to becoming a self. I experience myself as<br>

  Author(s) Ansell Nik<br>
  Abstract: The theology of Friedrich Schloiermacher arose from the atempt to consider in relation to one another the New Testament witness to Jesus Christ and the contents of human consciousness. For Schleiermacher, the New Testament and human consciousness provided jointly authoritative testimony to the being of God, but Schleiermacher was well aware of the predilections of his age, particularly the growing skepticism about biblical authority and the increased confidence in the deliberations of the rational mind. G. E. Lessing (1729–1781), who represented well the intellectual climate in which Schleiermacher wrote contended that the testimony of the New Testament “no longer<br>

  Abstract: Evangelicals uphold the supremacy and authority of the Holy Scripture. As noted by Anthony Lane, the
                  sola Scripturaprinciple essentially holds that Scripture is the final authority or norm for Christian belief. As Lane acknowledges, the finality of Scripture should always be fiercely defended, but it is not the sole source or resource for theology. Lane further explains that there is no need to regard thesola Scripturaprinciple as antithetical to the validity of church tradition, Christian experience, human reason, or cultural understanding.¹ Without undermining thesola Scripturaprinciple, this paper asserts that it is possible to construct a<br>

In our next context, we find yet another function and meaning for divine sight—establishing worth. A disconcerting and yet pivotal chapter in the story of Abraham, Gen 16 has traditionally been assumed to recount a failed human attempt to build a legacy.

And the nuancing was soteriologically critical, as evidenced in the long-running conversations Wesley joined in progress as he sought to stake out the theological foundations of a Methodist morphology of conversion.

  Book Title: Reading Scripture to Hear God-Kevin Vanhoozer and Henri de Lubac on God's Use of Scripture in the Economy of Redemption<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Storer Kevin<br>
  Abstract: Recent theological discussions between Catholics and Evangelicals have generated a renewed appreciation for God's ongoing use of Scripture for self-mediation to the Church. Noting the significant influence of Henri de Lubac (one of the drafters of 'Dei Verbum' and proponent of a renewal of the Patristic and Medieval emphasis on a spiritual sense of Scripture), and Kevin Vanhoozer (the leading Evangelical proponent of a theological interpretation of Scripture), Kevin Storer seeks to draw Evangelical and Catholic theologians into dialogue about God's ongoing use of Scripture in the economy of redemption. Storer suggests that a number of traditional tensions between Catholics and Evangelicals, such as the literal or spiritual sense of Scripture, a sacramental or a covenantal model of God's self-mediation, and an emphasis on the authority of Scripture or the authority of the Church, can be eased by shifting greater focus upon God's ongoing use of creaturely realities for the building of the Church in union with Christ. This project seeks to enable Evangelicals to appropriate the insights of de Lubac's Catholic Ressourcement project, while also encouraging Catholic theologians to appreciate Vanhoozer's Evangelical emphasis on God's use of the literal sense of Scripture to build the Church.<br>

  Book Title: Body or the Soul?-Religion and Culture in a Quebec Parish, 1736-1901<br>

  Author(s): ABBOTT FRANK A.<br>
  Abstract: There are many analyses of Tractarianism – a nineteenth-century form of Anglicanism that emphasized its Catholic origins – but how did people in the colonies react to the High Church movement? Beating against the Wind, a study in nineteenth-century vernacular spirituality, emphasizes the power of faith on a shifting frontier in a transatlantic world. Focusing on people living along the Newfoundland and Labrador coast, Calvin Hollett presents a nuanced perspective on popular resistance to the colonial emissary Bishop Edward Feild and his spiritual regimen of order, silence, and solemnity. Whether by outright opposing Bishop Feild, or by simply ignoring his wishes and views, or by brokering a hybrid style of Gothic architecture, the people of Newfoundland and Labrador demonstrated their independence in the face of an attempt at hierarchical ascendency upon the arrival of Tractarianism in British North America. Instead, they continued to practise evangelical Anglicanism and participate in Methodist revivals, and thereby negotiated a popular Protestantism, one often infused with the spirituality of other seafarers from Nova Scotia and New England. Exploring the interaction between popular spirituality and religious authority, Beating against the Wind challenges the traditional claim of Feild’s success in bringing Tractarianism to the colony while exploring the resistance to Feild’s initiatives and the reasons for his disappointments.There are many analyses of Tractarianism – a nineteenth-century form of Anglicanism that emphasized its Catholic origins – but how did people in the colonies react to the High Church movement?

  Book Title: Ethos and Narrative Interpretation-The Negotiation of Values in Fiction<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): Herman David<br>
  Abstract: Ethos and Narrative Interpretationexamines the fruitfulness of the concept of ethos for the theory and analysis of literary narrative. The notion of ethos refers to the broadly persuasive effects of the image one may have of a speaker's psychology, world view, and emotional or ethical stance. How and why do readers attribute an ethos (of, for example, sincerity, reliability, authority, or irony) to literary characters, narrators, and even to authors? Are there particular conditions under which it is more appropriate for interpreters to attribute an ethos to authors, rather than to narrators? In the answer Liesbeth Korthals Altes proposes to such questions, ethos attributions are deeply implicated in the process of interpreting and evaluating narrative texts.<br>

  Abstract: The Grecanici of Southern Italyprovides a comprehensive ethnography that examines the ways the minority developed and sustain enduring cultural forms of solidarity and relatedness. Stavroula Pipyrou proposes the concept of "fearless governance" to describe overlapping and sometimes contradictory systems of power, authority, and relational networks that enable the Grecanici to achieve political representation at the intersection of local, national, and global encounters. Refuting easy assumptions of top-down governmental influence, Pipyrou shows how the Grecanici find political representation through the European Union and UNESCO, state policy, civic associations, family networks and illegal organizations; not being afraid to take risks, incur wrath, lose friends, or risk death in challenging the political status-quo.<br>

  Abstract: Postclassical narratology has reached a new phase of consolidation but also continued diversification. This collection therefore discriminates between what one could call a critical but frame-abiding and a more radical frame-transcending or frame-shattering handling of the structuralist paradigm. Postclassical Narratology: Approaches and Analyses discusses a large variety of different aspects of narrative, such as extensions of classical narratology, new generic applications (autobiography, oral narratives, poetry, painting, and film), the history of narratology, the issue of fictionality, the role of cognition, and questions of authorship and authority, as well as thematic matters related to ethics, gender, and queering. Additionally, it uses a wide spectrum of critical approaches, including feminism, psychoanalysis, media studies, the rhetorical theory of narrative, unnatural narratology, and cognitive studies. In this manner the essays manage to produce new insights into many key issues in narratology.<br>

Despite contemporary reactions against it, the Enlightenment continues to shape our own time and still distinguishes Western culture from any other.<br>

Words fly in and out of the mind, and the hum and buzz of implication rises and subsides as the world grows older. New words are coined, old words are lost, others survive only at the expense of their former authority. “Taste” for example, or “temperament”—words that once summoned a complicated set of notions about the world and human nature—retain today only an echo of the intellectual resonance that other centuries took for granted. Another case in point—one that may surprise—is<br>

  Abstract: This book aims to explain how and why jihadism wove its way into a Sunni social fabric in the throes of a leadership crisis. It shows how this new phenomenon is both exploiting and provoking a deep crisis of authority within Sunni Islam. The setting is the predominantly Sunni Muslim city of Tripoli, Lebanon’s second largest city, with a population of 350,000 inhabitants. Yet the story also encompasses other parts of North Lebanon, as well as western Syria, especially since the outbreak of the Syrian crisis in 2011.<br>

  Book Title: Precarious Visualities-New Perspectives on Identification in Contemporary Art and Visual Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Ross Christine<br>
  Abstract: Through the study of exemplary media works and practices - photography, film, video, performance, installations, web cams - scholars from various disciplines call attention to the unsettling of identification and the disablement of vision in contemporary aesthetics. To look at an image that prevents the stabilization of identification, identity and place; to perceive a representation that oscillates between visibility and invisibility; to relate to an image which entails a rebalancing of sight through the valorization of other senses; to be exposed, through surveillance devices, to the gaze of new figures of authority - the aesthetic experiences examined here concern a spectator whose perception lacks in certainty, identification, and opticality what it gains in fallibility, complexity, and interrelatedness. Precarious Visualities provides a new understanding of spectatorship as a relation that is at once corporeal and imaginary, and persistently prolific in its cultural, social, and political effects.

  Book Title: Literature Against Criticism-University English and Contemporary Fiction in Conflict<br>
  Publisher: Open Book Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Eve Martin Paul<br>
  Abstract: This is a book about the power game currently being played out between two symbiotic cultural institutions: the university and the novel. As the number of hyper-knowledgeable literary fans grows, students and researchers in English departments waiver between dismissing and harnessing voices outside the academy. Meanwhile, the role that the university plays in contemporary literary fiction is becoming increasingly complex and metafictional, moving far beyond the ‘campus novel’ of the mid-twentieth century. Martin Paul Eve’s engaging and far-reaching study explores the novel's contribution to the ongoing displacement of cultural authority away from university English. Spanning the works of Jennifer Egan, Ishmael Reed, Tom McCarthy, Sarah Waters, Percival Everett, Roberto Bolaño and many others, Literature Against Criticism forces us to re-think our previous notions about the relationship between those who write literary fiction and those who critique it.<br>

Cosmopolitanism, then, is committed to a process of internationalization in which human beings everywhere are world citizens with basic rights grounded in natural law, that is, with rights which cannot be denied by any person(s), group(s), institution(s), or constituted authority, including the nation-state. Stressing the rights of the individual rather than those of the sovereign state, cosmopolitanism thus favours what Brown and Held call a “non-national sense<br>

As such, it is presumed to be objective, neutral, presuppositionless, the only source of reliable knowledge.

  Book Title: Wittgenstein Reads Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Descombes Vincent<br>
  Abstract: Offering a critical view of all the texts in which Wittgenstein mentions Freud, Bouveresse immerses us in the intellectual climate of Vienna in the early part of the twentieth century. Although we come to see why Wittgenstein did not view psychoanalysis as a science proper, we are nonetheless made to feel the philosopher's sense of wonder and respect for the cultural task Freud took on as he found new ways meaningfully to discuss human concerns. Intertwined in this story of Wittgenstein's grappling with the theory of the unconscious is the story of how he came to question the authority of science and of philosophy itself. While aiming primarily at the clarification of Wittgenstein's opinion of Freud, Bouveresse's book can be read as a challenge to the French psychoanalytic school of Lacan and as a provocative commentary on cultural authority.<br>

  Author(s) WILLIAMS ROWAN<br>
  Abstract: The theme of tradition, the handing on of something to be both treasured and handed on again, harbors within it the apparently counter theme of betrayal. All traditions are vulnerable to betrayal for, in the very process of handing on, the original gift may be distorted or even lost. Different traditions no doubt develop different strategies for minimizing the element of betrayal, often centering on the authority to interpret, but these strategies themselves bear witness to the impossibility of reducing the risk of betrayal to zero. Yet the theme of betrayal remains itself ambiguous, for while the guardians or recipients<br>

  Abstract: Nothing presents more problems for those who would enter the mentality of the medieval philosophical theologian than the task which has been set for this volume. Trying to judge the influence on Thomas Aquinas’s doctrine of one of his authoritative ancient sources requires us to surrender, at least provisionally, what we think we know about the authority in question. As heirs of Renaissance and modern philology, and of the modern constructions of the history of philosophy, we will almost certainly have a different, perhaps even opposed, view of the source than a medieval theologian would have had.

  Abstract: Science and philosophy did not develop spontaneously within Judaism. The intellectual activities of traditional Jewish cultures generally focused on the canonical texts of the tradition: the Bible, the Mishnah, the Talmud. Any other type of knowledge, that is, any knowledge not vested with the authority of the canonical texts and of revelation, was considered “foreign.” This point, fundamental for understanding Jewish intellectual history, was forcefully stated in 1933 by the great historian Julius Guttmann: “The history of Jewish philosophy is a history of the successive absorption of foreign ideas.”¹<br>

  Abstract: The literary and philosophical traditions of many cultures reveal that the urge for revenge is an ancient, deep-rooted human need that has only tentatively been transferred to central authority in the form of state-sponsored retribution. If that need for revenge is not acknowledged by being in some way incorporated into formal systems of justice, as are the Furies by Athena in the 
                  Oresteia, it reemerges as private vengeance, as it does with Paulina in Death and the Maiden. It has the potentiality of “dripping poison over all the land,” as Athena fears the unsatisfied Furies will do in the Oresteia.<br>

Beginning with women's emergence into what has been defined as the most paradigmatic of Moroccan male institutions-the marketplace-the book elucidates how gender and commodity relations are experienced and interpreted in women's aesthetic practices.

  Abstract: The frequency of oaths, proverbs, blessings, and scripture in Moroccan oratory make it a formal or ritualized language like those historically associated with tradition and rhetorical power.¹ Yet despite its highly stylized form, the pragmatic revoicing of this oratory by women opens the interpretive possibilities of traditional speech events. Formal language in the informal setting of the suq does not limit meaning; rather, by embodying words and gestures customarily performed by and for men, women orators create a multivocalic and hybrid discourse in a context of heteroglossia. By appropriating the authority vested in public discourse, women marketers challenge traditional notions<br>

If so, one could be excused perhaps for thinking that “scriptures” are an inherently unstable category bound up with the life and changing fortunes of a community.

  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): DROR OLGA<br>
  Abstract: Princess Liễu Hạnh, often called the Mother of the Vietnamese people by her followers, is one of the most prominent goddesses in Vietnamese popular religion. First emerging some four centuries ago as a local sect appealing to women, the princess’ cult has since transcended its geographical and gender boundaries and remains vibrant today. Who was this revered deity? Was she a virtuous woman or a prostitute? Why did people begin worshiping her and why have they continued? Cult, Culture, and Authority traces Liễu Hạnh’s cult from its ostensible appearance in the sixteenth century to its present-day prominence in North Vietnam and considers it from a broad range of perspectives, as religion and literature and in the context of politics and society. Over time, Liễu Hạnh’s personality and cult became the subject of numerous literary accounts, and these historical texts are a major source for this book. Author Olga Dror explores the authorship and historical context of each text considered, treating her subject in an interdisciplinary way. Her interest lies in how these accounts reflect the various political agendas of successive generations of intellectuals and officials. The same cult was called into service for a variety of ideological ends: feminism, nationalism, Buddhism, or Daoism.<br>

  Book Title: Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): MATSUMOTO STACIE<br>
  Abstract: The first three centuries of the Heian period (794–1086) saw some of its most fertile innovations and epochal achievements in Japanese literature and the arts. It was also a time of important transitions in the spheres of religion and politics, as aristocratic authority was consolidated in Kyoto, powerful court factions and religious institutions emerged, and adjustments were made in the Chinese-style system of ruler-ship. At the same time, the era’s leaders faced serious challenges from the provinces that called into question the primacy and efficiency of the governmental system and tested the social/cultural status quo. Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries, the first book of its kind to examine the early Heian from a wide variety of multidisciplinary perspectives, offers a fresh look at these seemingly contradictory trends. Essays by fourteen leading American, European, and Japanese scholars of art history, history, literature, and religions take up core texts and iconic images, cultural achievements and social crises, and the ever-fascinating patterns and puzzles of the time. The authors tackle some of Heian Japan’s most enduring paradigms as well as hitherto unexplored problems in search of new ways of understanding the currents of change as well as the processes of institutionalization that shaped the Heian scene, defined the contours of its legacies, and make it one of the most intensely studied periods of the Japanese past.<br>

  Abstract: In this rigorous and imaginative study, Seligman seeks to discover a durable source of moral authority in a liberalized world. His study of shame, pride, collective guilt, and collective responsibility demonstrates the mutual relationship between individual responsibility and communal authority. Furthermore, Seligman restores the indispensable role of religious traditions--as well as the features of those traditions that enhance, rather than denigrate, tolerance. Sociologists, political theorists, moral philosophers, and intellectual historians will find Seligman's thesis enlightening, as will anyone concerned with the ethical and religious foundations of a tolerant society.<br>

  Abstract: The previous chapter ended with the problem of recognition, which lies at the core of the “politics of identity.” With authority internalized as individual right, mutual recognition becomes an elusive goal as, in de Tocqueville’s words, “each man is narrowly shut in himself and from that basis makes the pretense to judge the world.”¹ With recognition lost, the self comes increasingly to rest solely on the calculus and negotiation of power. Wills are, to return to the nomenclature of our opening chapter, coerced from without, rather than subjugated from within. The result is a situation fraught with paradox: the very<br>

In some Scriptural parables, he found, hidden beneath the surface of the text, a structure of transitions that enabled astute interpreters to move from one figure to another, thus establishing multiple meanings.

  Abstract: In Part I, "Trajectories," the author explores early Jewish-Muslim interactions, studying such areas as messianism, professions, authority, and class structure and showing how they were reshaped during the first centuries of Islam. Part II, "Constructions," looks at influences of Judaism on the development of the emerging Shi'ite community. This is tied to the wider issue of how early Muslims conceptualized "the Jew." In Part III, "Intimacies," the author tackles the complex "esoteric symbiosis" between Muslim and Jewish theologies. An investigation of the milieu in which Jews and Muslims interacted sheds new light on their shared religious imaginings. Throughout, Wasserstrom expands on the work of social and political historians to include symbolic and conceptual aspects of interreligious symbiosis. This book will interest scholars of Judaism and Islam, as well as those who are attracted by the larger issues exposed by its methodology.<br>

Both epics accommodate a variety of interpretive voices, episodes, and dramatic and discursive exchanges that resist the monological containment of the poems’ dominant narratives. Through the inclusion of the multiple, even “unauthorized” voices and creation narratives, the poems are brought into a constructive tension with the Genesis story and its received biblical and literary traditions, as well as with accounts of England’s own tragic history.

For understandable reasons, however, prime ministers, premiers, and others in high political office have been inclined to view the business of bestowing discretionary rewards — that is, the dispensing of patronage — in a less altruistic light, and their power over it as less of a blessing than, as Brian Mulroney put it, “a pain in the neck” (Simpson, 1988:355).<br>

  Abstract: Moving away from Jacques Derrida's deconstructionism and Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutics, and building on his experiences as a politician, Vattimo asks if it is still possible to speak of moral imperatives, individual rights, and political freedom. Acknowledging the force of Nietzsche's "God is dead," Vattimo argues for a philosophy of pensiero debole or "weak thinking" that shows how moral values can exist without being guaranteed by an external authority. His secularising interpretation stresses anti-metaphysical elements and puts philosophy into a relationship with postmodern culture.<br>

  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Thurén Lauri<br>
  Abstract: For far too long, Lauri Thurén argues, the parables of Jesus have been read either as allegories encoding Christian theology—including the theological message of one or another Gospel writer—or as tantalizing clues to the authentic voice of Jesus. Thurén proposes instead to read the parables “unplugged” from any assumptions beyond those given in the narrative situation in the text, on the common-sense premise that the very form of the parable works to propose a (sometimes startling) resolution to a particular problem. Thurén applies his method to the parables in Luke with some surprising results involving the Evangelist’s overall narrative purposes and the discrete purposes of individual parables in supporting the authority of Jesus, proclaiming God’s love, exhorting steadfastness, and so on. Eschatological and allegorical readings are equally unlikely, according to Thurén’s results. This study is sure to spark learned discussion among scholars, preachers, and students for years to come.<br>

In the midst of the disintegration of and disillusionment with mainstream jurisprudence, legal scholars looked outside law to economics for law’s missing authority and the autonomy of legal discourse. Of all the social sciences, economics was the most promising candidate offering “right answers” for law’s problems.<br>

  Abstract: Elites and planning: at first glance, these two terms suggest an irreconcilable opposition. In fact, planning implies co-ordinating activities and defining long-term projects on a basis of technical criteria. The latter should be more or less imposed on the multiplicity and incoherence of individual wants and goals. The elite, on the contrary, represents an authority delegated spontaneously by groups. The leader is not a ‘good talker’ or even necessarily a ‘learned man,’ but he who proposes a representation of his own milieu and objectives for action in which other men may recognize their own viewpoint and desire for change.

On the other hand, it also addresses the ontology of political life: the basic concepts of human plurality, living in common in ordered societies, freedom, sovereignty, and the like.

  Author(s): Stavrakakis Yannis<br>
  Abstract: In recent years psychoanalysis – especially Lacanian theory – has been gradually acknowledged as a vital resource in the ongoing re-orientation of contemporary political theory and analysis. Of particular note is that the work of Jacques Lacan is increasingly being used by major political philosophers associated with the Left. This indicates the dynamic emergence of a new theoretico-political horizon: that of the ‘Lacanian Left’. However, this has yet to be properly conceived and structured as a field. The Lacanian Left is the first book to bring it into academic consciousness and to draw its implications for concrete political analysis in a systematic way. It offers:• An accessible mapping of its main contours. • A detailed examination of the points of convergence and divergence between the major figures active or at the periphery of this terrain, including Slavoj h the central Lacanian notion of ‘enjoyment’, The Lacanian Left puts forward innovative analyses of political power and authority, nationalism, European identity, consumerism and advertising culture, de-democratisation and post-democracy. It will be of value to everyone interested in exploring the potential of psychoanalysis to reinvigorate political theory, critical political analysis and democratic politics.<br>

  Abstract: Anthropology’s engagement with the sensuous has shifted over the last century and a half from a concern with measuring bodies and recording sense data to an interest in sensing patterns, then from sensing patterns to reading texts, and finally from reading texts to writing culture. In the course of the latter shifts, the content of anthropological knowledge has changed from being multisensory and social to being spectacularly stylized and centered on the individual ethnographer. The result is that ethnographic authority now depends more on the “reflexivity” with which one writes than the accuracy with which one “represents” a culture (e.g.,<br>

In the academy today, one encounters a mistrust of disciplinarity as laying false claims to authority. There is also often a curious absence of the notion of “profession”—perhaps because both critics and supporters emphasize academic disciplines rather than those disciplines, such as medicine and law, that are recognized to prepare professionals.

Yet hidden within this melancholic tradition are the resources for a renewed challenge to prevailing regimes of historicity, a passion that has the power to reignite the dialectic of revolutionary thought.<br>

  Abstract: German Romantic literature rests on unstable ground. For example, Friedrich Schlegel’s notion of Romantic irony as a “permanente Parekbase” (permanent parabasis)¹ denies the authority of a single vantage point. As parabasis—the Greek term for the chorus stepping out of the action of the play and addressing an ode to the audience—irony is the constant possibility of assuming another subject position, of viewing and representing the world from a different and even contradictory angle. Whether in Brentano’s

  Abstract: The collapse of Castilian royal authority in the 1460s challenged the wielders of power there to redefine in practice where, in relation to Enrique iv’s much-weakened monarchy, their interests and allegiances now lay. It also called in question the ethically and juridically grounded models of royal rule as sanctioned by providence, promoted among them by the secular court culture of Enrique’s father Juan ii. For most individuals, no doubt, this meant adjusting the theory to validate their newly identified interests – which was what happened collectively in the settlement eventually established by the Reyes Católicos.

  Author(s) Torres Isabel<br>
  Abstract: Herrera’s heliocentric formulations fixed the linguistic aspirations of the late sixteenth century upon the iconic authority of natural and perfect form, the circle. In a post-Copernican allegorical system, the vernacular ‘sol’ was figured as the ideal centre around which not only the fates of individual poets, but the destiny of the Spanish empire itself could, and should, revolve in conterminous motion. Notwithstanding the anxieties and ambivalences which, as we have seen, complicated this correlative arrangement, other paradoxes would ultimately destroy the illusion of centric stability. Firstly, the allegorical frame itself was intrinsically flawed. Herrera’s new brand of collective cultural heroism,<br>

The practice of autobiography necessarily confers on the autobiographical text an implied truth value upon which the weight of contemporary theory since existentialism and structuralism has cast considerable doubt.

Yet the formula does have the appearance of something that comes close to Benjamin’s very own style of thinking and writing, to such an extent that one could easily take it for a quotation of the “real” Benjamin.³<br>

The book is ambitious, covering moral relativism, political authority, the rule of law, consequentialism and deontology on role‐relative morality, and more. Weaving these strands together is “the dilemma of legal perspectivalism” (p. 1). The rule of law seems to imply that the judge is required to punish the disobedient citizen, but a deeply held retributivist principle forbids punishing justified action.<br>

Abstract: But ACES did not try to disconnect itself altogether from surrounding standards of cultural authority or duty. On the contrary, members identified enough with the local community and its “suburban” norms of privacy (Baumgartner
               1988) to be wary of speaking out. ACES used the language of personal empowerment in a way that fit, or at least did not seriously threaten, this aspect of the group style. Thus, personal empowerment did not mean “do your own thing,” in a cultural vacuum. Instead, when the ACES members associated personal “empowerment” with developing opinions and voicing them, they were in effect saying, “It’sOKfor normal, local people to speak out individually.” No wonder the ACES leader kept encouraging herself and other members to develop personal “empowerment”; they identified themselves with the “normal,” family‐oriented people of Airdale who, they imagined, would find speaking out unseemly. The culture in interaction was different from the meanings that Bellah and his coauthors ascribed to expressive individualist language. Given the group’s relations to the wider world, ACES members’ association of personal empowerment with public commitment makes sense.<br>

Abstract: Thus, by incorporating the computer as the physical extension of his own body, Hawking can mobilize and extend his intellectual capabilities. He can excorporate and make visible the neuromotor functions of his body,
         60as well as all the dysfunctions in the technical system surrounding him, and can mobilize the human competences required for the smooth functioning of this collective. Finally, and consequently, he can simultaneously fulfill his role as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics. That is to say, he can write his own history by answering my questions on his role in the scientific community, the intellectual authority of his status, the changes it underwent over time, the characteristics he would like to see in his successors, and the importance of his peers’ role as regards the authority of his own status. We thus witness the operation, maintenance, and(non)simultaneousarticulation, through the mediation of the computer, of what I call, to paraphrase Ernst Kantorowicz, Hawking’s three bodies: first, anatural human bodycollectivized—this natural human body cannot function without this collective; second, acollective body(human body/computer/assistants) naturalized—this collective body becomes “his” body; and third, asacred body—the representative of the Lucasian Chair of Mathematics (which “is not subject to Passions as the other is, nor to Death, for as to this Body the [Professor] never dies).”61<br>

Abstract: Creating a historical identity for a new generation of Dissenters in eighteenth‐century England had certain limits. Calamy’s
      Continuationof 1727 had been alert to the problems of bridging generational differences within Dissent and rebuilding links between the very different worlds of Restoration and Hanoverian Dissent. Neal’sHistory of the Puritansis alert to a different set of problems having to do with with inclusions and exclusions.The History of the Puritansacknowledges the diversity of Hanoverian Dissent. Nevertheless, Neal also draws some lines demarcating legitimate from illegitimate forms of Dissent. The “we” of legitimate Dissent has theological, political, and social boundaries. Thus some refugees from Germany during the 1540s are described as anabaptists “who, besides the principle of adult baptism, held several wild opinions about the Trinity, the Virgin Mary, and the person of Christ.”50Neal is generally more conciliatory in commenting on the Baptists. Nevertheless, his anxieties about radical sectaries disturbing social order and challenging the intellectual authority of their superiors run through his account of the seventeenth century, with its clear implications for artisan Baptists in Hanoverian England. One of them, the Baptist’s own historian Thomas Crosby, grouched about Neal’s misrepresentations: “many, even of the learned, and so late an author as Mr Neal, from whom we might have looked for more Christian treatment, have made it their business to represent the Anabaptists, as they are pleased in contempt to stile them, in odious colours, and to write many bitter things, even notorious falsehoods concerning them, nay, to fasten doctrines upon them which they never approved.”51<br>

Abstract: Let us return to Hegel’s interpretation of Adam’s privilege in the book of Genesis. There, man has the power to name, to understand, and thus to dominate; but Adam exercises this privilege only upon the animals, never upon God or upon himself. Why do these two escape naming and thus escape the comprehension and, finally, the domination of man? That God would escape is conceived without any difficulty: the Creator is not easily understood, and thus named, by his creature. But why is it that man does not name himself? No interdict is brought to bear here. Nothing more than the second commandment is necessary, which forbids making “for yourself a graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above” (Exod. 20:4)—anything, therefore, that would claim to represent God through comprehension. But is man, too, “in heaven above”? Most certainly—for this is the decisive paradox—because that which is fitting for God (of whom no name, no image, and no concept can claim comprehension) is also fitting for man: man, and he alone among all the living, was created not “according to [his] kind” but “in [the] image … [and] likeness” of God (Gen. 1:24, 26). This paradox receives a precise commentary from Saint Augustine: “
         be renewed in the newness of your mind. That is not a makingaccording to kind[secundum genus], as if renewal were achieved by imitating a neighbour’s example or by living under the authority of a human superior. For you did not say ‘Let man be made according to his kind’ [secundum genus], but ‘Let us make man according to our image and likeness,’ so we may prove what your will is.”24Man remains unimaginable, because he is formed in the image of the One who admits no image whatsoever. By right, man resembles nothing, because he resembles nothing other than the One who is properly characterized by incomprehensibility, the One who David Tracy has named “the Incomprehensible‐Comprehensible God.”25Or again, if God remains incomprehensible, man, who r~<br>

Abstract: Braudel addressed the critics directly in
            The Mediterranean,2d ed. (1972), 2:1243–44: “The question is frequently put to me, both by historians and philosophers, if we view history from such a distance, what becomes of man, his role in history, his freedom of action?” A classic example is embodied in Braudel’s portrait of Philip II himself. “What degree of freedom was possessed by Philip II, or by Don Juan of Austria as he rode at anchor among his ships, allies, and troops? Each of these so‐called freedoms seems to me to resemble a tiny island, almost a prison.” See the conclusion of Part III, 2:1236 that recounts the death of Philip II on September 13, 1598, based on three secondary sources of the 1920s, not from contemporary accounts of Philip’s “good death.” Braudel’s last poignant paragraph suggests that Philip did not know what he was doing: “[Philip] was not a man of vision: he saw his task as an unending succession of small details. Every one of his annotations is a small precise point, whether an order, a remark, or the correction of a spelling mistake or geographical error. Never do we find general notions or grand strategies under his pen.” The king’s “grand strategy,” however, is exactly what Geoffrey Parker set out to demonstrate inThe Grand Strategy of Philip II(New Haven, Conn., 1998). Braudel may be correct that Philip, as a prince, was not a student of geography. But what Philip did study, architecture, emphasized design. No discipline was more useful to understanding “general notions or grand strategies.” Thus, Braudel’s Part III, as traditional as it is often said to be, appears to get the story and the king wrong because Braudel’s steering assumption, not Philip II, was in control: “Good reasons for us to reflect once more on the distance separating biographical history from the history of structures, and even more from the history of geographical areas” (2:1237).

Abstract: These tensions were interestingly played out in the twentieth century in the teaching of business and professional writing. The first attempts to teach business, professional, technical, and scientific people how to write were by and large undertaken by persons in those fields. The aims of this pedagogy were very close to those expressed by the originators of the memo form: to break with the old rhetoric and to fashion new genres of writing. Even as late as 1929, Philip McDonald complained in his
            English and Scienceabout the way in which English was taught in the schools, which he saw as promoting obscurity, pomposity, and ornateness.63But McDonald means to indict a rhetorical style. His conclusions favored the continued segregation of technical writing from English departments. Yet after the Second World War, business and technical writing came under the province of English and composition teachers, who were more disposed to favor the norm of clarity descending from belletrist culture than the norm of technicity regnant in the professions.64The technical fields put up little resistance to this transfer of teaching authority because they were themselves increasingly troubled by the tension between technicity and clarity.65<br>

Abstract: Why the history of reading? What historical difference does this casual activity make? By now, historians have become accustomed to scholarly accounts of seemingly incidental matters, such as pet ownership and melodrama, which at first blush may seem rather removed from dynamics of historical change like war, revolution, and industrialization. But in the hands of historians like Roger Chartier and Robert Darnton, the history of reading has become a significant field in the social history of ideas. It has far‐reaching implications, especially in the early modern period, for the development of individual and group consciousness, of new religious beliefs and related institutions, and of the state and its bases in society, culture, and the economy. The Enlightenment, for instance, looks very different from the perspective of the consumers of printed matter. In the eighteenth century, readers took very selectively to heart the ideas of the philosophes for a host of reasons we now know: with a few exceptions—for instance, Jean‐Jacques Rousseau’s
      La nouvelle Héloïse(1761) and J. W. von Goethe’sThe Sorrows of Young Werther(1774)—the major publications of the century’s great intellectuals were much less well circulated than those by the period’s hack writers. And readers received these texts with other things in mind than the philosophes’ challenge to think rationally, deductively, and independently of established authority. Moreover, Jürgen Habermas’s notion of the public sphere (inThe Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere,trans. Thomas Burger and Frederick Lawrence [Cambridge, Mass., 1989]) makes sense only if there are engaged readers as well as engaged writers to create a bourgeois civil society on the eve of the French Revolution of 1789.<br>

Abstract: With regard to individual lives and libraries in the life of persons, Wiegand points to the failure of information science to “construct models of a personal ‘information economy’ for individuals,” ones that analyze how individuals appropriate information “in efforts to make sense of the world around them in their everyday lives” [
         2, p. 24]. He argues that, relative to other disciplines, researchers in LIS have not benefited from the critical thinking that has been available; he cites, for example, work done on the relationship of power to knowledge. Invoking Douglas Zweizig, he calls for a switch in emphasis to the library in the life of the user and away from the user in the life of the library, which has so captured our imaginations to date. Furthermore, he concludes that the arena of study we call “information science” continues to be defined by the technology that is characteristic of the field as we know it today. He argues that, built on expertise rather than authority, this discourse, with its focus on technology, renders people and their culture invisible; those not using the technologies at the heart of information science are being ignored [3].<br>

Abstract: Whether or not this reader’s reaction was warranted, he was relying on a fundamental function of the humanities footnote: it allows us a means of evaluating the level of scholarship of an essay. As Grafton points out, before the academic footnote came into existence, the authority of the author, his or her moral and intellectual stature, were inherent in what he or she said, not in his or her sources.
      6Thucydides and Joinville did not footnote; they didn’t need to. It seems our anonymous, theory‐driven author who incited one reader’s anger was writing for a different century. Today, footnotes in a scholarly essay are not uniformly marginal, minor, or digressive. They can be, but much more often they are a humanist’s lab report, our empirical data. In a general sense, footnotes are the mark of the author’s status as a professional. Because, as Grafton notes, footnotes persuade, we look to them for proof that the author has sufficiently covered the field, that enough evidence has been marshalled, that the status of the evidence has been sufficiently questioned. The profession requires not only the traditional recognition of the work of like‐minded scholars but also a consciousness of their place in the field, one’s own place in the field, and the field’s status as a field of study. The footnote is written by an individual whose own voice has been rendered into a collective voice of similarly educated authors. That is, in the footnote the individual author purposefully loses his or her writerly voice to become part of this professional collective.<br>

Abstract: The questions this case calls forth sit at the nub of that conflict, and as such are both crucially timely and almost endless. What does it mean, for example, to teach theologically certain students disciplines in which questioning is not only normative but necessary, an integral dimension of the discipline itself? Relatedly, what happens when humanistically questioning teachers teach theologically certain students or vice versa?
         26What happens, in other words, when students raised in Eternal Grace families attend public schools? If Mrs. Barrett’s believing students would rather not oppose unjust governmental decrees, given that they are saved regardless of the perils of our democracy, what kinds of citizens might they become? Are the trade‐offs of obedience to governmental authority worth the price of supporting potential dictatorships? Is the erosion of a pluralistic democracy worth the affordance of theological comfort, and, if not, should our government support private religious education at all? While a few scholars have begun to explore these issues in earnest (notably, Apple2001; Berliner1997; Boyer2005; Peshkin1986; Rose1988; Zimmerman2002), much work remains to be done on the central questions of how the competing collective memories associated with theological certainty and humanistic questioning should, can, and do enter into the arena of public schooling. The case of Mrs. Barrett’s classroom represents only an initial inroad investigating what is fast becoming the minefield of the American public sphere. To say that more educational research needs to be done in this area is a dreadful understatement.<br>

Abstract: A critical analysis of the Vatican II document on freedom of religion brought me to the conclusion that people are indeed free in their choice of a religion, but this freedom, at least for Catholics, ceases once they have accepted the faith. Then only obedience to the institution representing the church’s doctrinal authority counts. Whoever does not submit to this authority can expect some form of punishment, for example, a reprimand, a warning, denial of the sacraments (which seems to be the case in the United States in 2004 with John Kerry, the Catholic presidential candidate, who is in favor of prudential abortion laws and stem cell research), compulsory public recantation, suspension, expulsion from office, laicization, and excommunication. Thus it is often stated in defense of the church—at least the Catholic Church—that it is a case of the “right of truth” versus the “right of the person” and that the latter is obviously subordinate to the former.
            29But if one is to avoid lapsing into personifying abstractions, the right of truth is tantamount to the right, hence the power, of a particular group to dictate to others what the truth is, so the right of the person is set up in opposition to the right of the group, here the church’s doctrinal authority.30<br>

Abstract: Omissions are plentiful in these accounts: the selection of a field, the routines of teaching, squabbles with colleagues, rivalries, ambition and desire for recognition. Exceptions surface here too—women who discuss gender bias in their profession, authors from the working class who struggle to adapt to the academic world—but most authors keep mute on the same questions. Popkin offers several explanations for these silences, ranging from shame to fear of colleagues’ reactions to narrative concerns (tedium, lack of drama). The most significant and fascinating factor, however, is that these authors write autobiographies as, first and foremost, members of a profession. They free themselves, it is true, from this profession’s norm of self‐effacement by expressing their individuality and discussing private matters. But they do not shed their disciplinary identity in the process. On the contrary, their autobiographies sustain the profession’s norms and values. They minimize conflicts, belittle individual achievements (in the classroom, for instance), and omit mention of aspirations that question the ideal of fraternal, disinterested scholars who live a pure life of the mind. This is true of other disciplines as well, but history, reliant as it is on cumulative, collective scholarship, finds it especially difficult to celebrate individual achievement. Autobiography, this most personal of genres, hence services collective authority, professional community, and an ostensible containment of the self.<br>

Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: In a move that proves Derrida even more heretical than Patočka, he shows that the concept of responsibility resists all final thematization. It is a “paradoxical concept” in that, in addition to seeking to cognitively unify what responsibility means in one intuition, it also defies such an effort insofar as “it has the structure of a type of secret—what is called, in the code of certain religious practices, mystery. The exercise of responsibility seems to leave no choice but this one, however uncomfortable it may be, of paradox, heresy, and secrecy. More serious still, it must always run the risk of conversion and apostasy: there is no responsibility without a dissident and inventive rupture with respect to tradition, authority, orthodoxy, rule, or doctrine” (
      GD,p. 27). With this we have already begun to broach Derrida’s own—radically heretical—take on responsibility.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: This is not to argue against the kind of verification fundamental to scientific history, though it does side with Warnock’s observation that a positivist approach can miss the role of human imagination in not merely perceiving but also constructing reality. Rather, it is to argue for something besides the power of description at work in certain narratives, especially those that rise to the level of mythos and make a claim to religious authority. Smith’s narratives do not display fact to be assented to but draw the reader into a malleable reality by means of the malleable plots that traditionally provided the basis for Jewish and Christian ethos and ethic. It can be said that Smith was translating time, not text. Specifically, he translated biblical time in service to, he said, an “ushering in of the dispensation of the fullness of times … a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers … from the days of Adam even to the present time.”
         97Whatever his intention, the effect was to deploy the biblical text in a manner that radically subverted centuries of theologizing on who God is and how humans are to worship God.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: We can view Advaita’s proximity to Sāṃkhya from another angle. If we recall Edgerton’s thesis that a commitment to the path of pure knowledge and a concomitant renunciation of all activity were the defining characteristics of early Sāṃkhya, then we can perhaps regard Śaṅkara’s rejection of the
         jñānakarmasamuccayadoctrine as a return of sorts to the Sāṃkhya position. That Śaṅkara’s Advaita was perceived in this way is indicated by Bhāskara, whose commentary on the Gita contains several passages that associate Śaṅkara’s teaching regarding the total abandonment of ritual activities with the Sāṃkhya school.108If, as suggested above, an uncompromising commitment to Vedic authority distinguished early Vedānta from the rationalistic Sāṃkhya school, then perhaps thejñānakarmasamuccayadoctrine, or an early version thereof, functioned as a key factor in differentiating the two schools. This situation would reflect an early phase when the two Mīmāṃsās existed in a reasonably harmonious and complementary relationship.109As the Advaita school distanced itself from the ritual orientation of the Mīmāṃsā, however, it moved—inadvertently!—closer to the older Sāṃkhya position.110That this was allowed to happen may be taken as an indication that Sāṃkhya’s influence was on the wane during the emergence of the Advaita school. As mentioned above, the anti‐Sāṃkhya sections of theBhāṣyamay have been simply holdovers from an earlier stage in the evolution of the Vedānta tradition. They would be similar in this respect to Śaṅkara’s refutation, in II.2.18–27, of Buddhist realism (Sarvāstitvavāda), which, as Ingalls notes, had been dead in India centuries prior to the time of Śaṅkara.111<br>

Author(s): Plate Liedeke<br>
Abstract: Seen in the light of canon formation, then, re‐vision is a necessary and integral part of canonicity, adding to a canon’s cultural capital rather than transforming or overturning it.
         12Seen from the perspective of the publishers, however, it may well be the interdependency of canonical text and rewrite—its being, as Attridge says, “already canonized”—that makes rewritings particularly interesting. Whereas rewritings have long been known to be a form of productive reception that contributes to the canonicity of texts while deriving critical attention and authority from them, the success of feminist re‐vision in the literary marketplace is equally linked to changes in the book‐publishing industry that are due to the globalization of capital. In the 1970s, the financial success of a publishing house depended on a large publishing list, which was achieved through economies of scale and a high gross margin due to printing a large number of copies in one print run. In the 1980s, capitalism shifted to a model of short‐turnover cycles of capital: short lead times with a small number of copies, low stocks, and regular reprints (Harvey1989). One of the most visible effects of this global shift is that publishers rely increasingly on front lists, generating more and more of their overall sales from fewer books and fewer authors. “Given a choice, publishers would rather release a new title from a bestselling author with a proven customer base than take a chance on a title written by an unknown author,” the executive summary of Simba Information’sBusiness of Consumer Book Publishing 2005report states, adding wryly, “The reasons are pure economics” (Simba Information2005, 2). It is in this post‐Fordist economic context that rewriting emerges as a literary genre that allows for feminist literary and political aims to be realized in a commercially viable form.

Abstract: 4.
         Philosophy brings clarity to general guiding practices and principles of an individual or group. Philosophy facilitates the exploration of, as well as alignment with, the distinctive cultures of an organization. In this sense, philosophy provides a lens through which to view workplace mission and purpose, traditions of power and authority, organizational governance (how decisions are made), and organizational form (how the process of governance is structured) [19]. It encourages and reinforces collective behaviors and value systems that are essential for successful fulfillment of collective purpose. In a personal context, philosophy not only informs concepts of ethical judgment, values, and reflection, as described above, but also facilitates personal journeys of understanding with regards to moral action, personal responsibility and accountability, and principled reasoning in relation to others and in relation to the organization as a whole.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 592372<br>
Date: 01 2009<br>
Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Wars that do pass muster on just‐war terms have both moral and political benefits. Put more abstractly, when just‐war morality is expanded to connect with the habits of social criticism, it can contribute to the twin needs of legitimation and justification in democratic contexts. Obviously these points take us beyond Augustine and his vision of a just war. As a product of the premodern era, just‐war doctrine is typically viewed as enabling us to address a war’s moral justification (or lack thereof). But legitimation is different. In modern, democratic settings legitimation turns on the presence of consent (tacit or explicit) to acts authorized by public officials. Its value lies in the democratic commitment to hold authorities accountable to citizens and to provide a firm basis for political representation.
         73Concerns about legitimation are part of a broader theory of justified political coercion: reasons should be provided to persons whose liberties are restricted by a policy. Otherwise such restrictions are tyrannical, imposed heteronomously. Thompson and Gutmann remind us that legitimation is premised on the idea that “the moral authority of collective judgments about policy depends in part on the moral quality of the process by which citizens collectively reach those judgments.”74Drawing on the habits of self‐restraint, critical self‐analysis, and willingness to deliberate publicly, the ethics of war can seek the best of both worlds. Just‐war morality can provide moral resources for ensuring that we enter a war that reflects the popular will, one that does not seek to impose its will unjustly on that of others.<br>

Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: In this light, the idea that religion might be humanized is attacked by many proponents of the religions. Around the world religious leaders decry secular humanism, rant against the godlessness of modern science, and lament what they see as mounting moral decay. Within the academy there are thinkers, like Charles Taylor, who worry about “exclusive humanism” and its loss of a sense of transcendence and also about how this form of humanism is driven by a “rage for order” to transform and control every facet of life for human benefit. Mystery seems drained from human existence, Taylor complains.
         25Some Christian theologians challenge humanistic claims in the name of a theocentric outlook meant to thwart anthropocentrism. Others want to draw a strict line between the Christian community, as a community of peace, and the “world” as a domain of violence.26Those theologians cannot imagine that truth might be found outside the walls of the church. Conversely, the so‐called new atheists of Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennet, and company find laughable or lamentable the idea that religion obviously elevates, invigorates, and ennobles human dignity and destiny. It is doubtful for them that some truth might be encoded in the myths, symbols, and practices of the religions. Religious claims to authority, deference, and even obedience sound to these critics like nothing but crass authoritarianism and priestcraft.27Feuerbach speaks anew, even if in less sophisticated form.<br>

Abstract: The Victorian geologist is highly important here, writing the narrative of time and thus rescuing both the individual and the human species from apparently inevitable destruction by claiming the authority to interpret deep time. The abyss of time may dwarf the individual, but it is also meaningless without the geologist-narrator, who thus claims the authority to control the past. Zimmerman focuses very much on the work of Lyell here, though she also brings in Gideon Mantell, the connections between the work of those two geologists being well known. The brief encapsulation of early and mid-Victorian geology appears, to the eye of the specialist historian of geology, a little lightweight. Nevertheless, it leads nicely into the discussion of the effects of Victorian geology on Tennyson's poetry. Nature “red in tooth and claw” is the oft-used example of the influence of geological writings on Tennyson, and Zimmerman does look at
      In Memoriam; her main focus, however, is a more unusual case study. She examinesThe Princess, tracing the use of both catastrophist and uniformitarian language throughout the poem and emphasizing that the fairy tale, in this case, does have a happy ending, providing some comfort to those Victorians lost in the great expanse of time.<br>

Abstract: That promise was tendered as a battle cry in film's initial struggle for respect within the university; in those days the word
         disciplineserved as a rationale for the autonomy film studies sought from the units in which it grew up. More recently, it is played as a trump card in the high‐stakes game among leaders in a now‐recognized, albeit undefined, field. For today, film studies unquestionably stands as a legitimate member of the humanities, often commanding full voting rights. Those who teach and research in this field exude that impression. The Society for Cinema and Media Studies (SCMS) boasts twenty‐four hundred members, with fourteen hundred attending its 2008 convention to listen to nearly eight hundred papers given under the rubric of three hundred panels. The topics of those panels, like the arguments of the papers, may be subject to debate, but nearly everyone recognizes that the debate itself takes place within a legitimately constituted disciplinary field. Whether it is currently emergent or residual, to use the terms of this inquest, is up for dispute, though there is no question that in the 1960s and for some time thereafter film studies grew rapidly across whatever terrain it found at all hospitable. To sustain that growth, its identity and constituency has never ceased to expand. First it dropped its pretentious name, Society of Cinematologists, shortening things to SCS in 1966; to increase membership and authority, it took on an increasing number of topics until adding theMin 2002. Its website now announces that members of “this scholarly organization are involved in various fields of study, including (but not limited to): Film Studies, Cinema Studies, Television Studies, Media Studies, Visual Arts, Cultural Studies, Film and Media History, and Moving Image Studies.”7Today media studies stands as the society's umbrella term, with film studies its chief subset, but one that may be ceding ground, at least in many quarters, before the wildfir~<br>

Is it claimed or granted?—the existence of vulnerability and passivity within autonomy and initiative, and the relationship between moral ideals and historical manifestation, questions that exist more on the margins ofOneself as Another. Those interested in Ricoeur’s religious thought will find little of direct interest here. Those who see a deep connection between his moral philosophy and his philosophy of religion will find some confirmation, but there are other places where the connections are more explicitly manifest.Reflections on the Justis best approached as a companion volume to earlier philosophical works, certainlyThe Justbut perhaps more importantlyOneself as Another. As such, it holds an important place in Ricoeur’s oeuvre.<br>

Abstract: Despite these oppositions, secularization and resacralization should be regarded as complementary phenomena that arose in response to the problem of a radically transcendent, hidden God. The studies under review, then, are of crucial importance, but their full significance requires a supplementary analysis. Novel conceptions of society, the nation, Scripture, and personhood followed from an intensification of divine transcendence, and, at the same time, necessitated a reworking of the immanent relations between worldly persons, institutions, and things. It was not merely that secularization, now understood by Bell and others as the translation of divine authority into a worldly register, entailed that the latter incorporate the properties and prerogatives once reserved for God alone. Enlightenment-era efforts to resacralize the self as an object of a totalizing force—situated either in the mystic divine or in a purely immanent, materialist conception of nature—suggest another dynamic at work: the closing of the chasm between the divine and terrestrial spheres and the identification of one with the other. Even if human effort was increasingly regarded as the source of one's understanding of the world, the humans undertaking this work had become newly alien to themselves, and in a manner that recalled the radical distance of the divine.<br>

Abstract: The real evils in war are love of violence, revengeful cruelty, fierce and implacable enmity, wild resistance, the lust of power, and such like; and it is generally to punish these things, when force is required to inflict the punishment, that, in obedience to God or some lawful authority, good men undertake wars. Thus John allowed soldiers to take up arms by law, but did not authorize them to avenge themselves personally: “Do violence to no man, accuse no man falsely, and be content with your wages” (Luke 3:14). … To the Centurion Christ gave due praise. He did not tell him to leave the service (Matt. 8:9–10).

Author(s): Thistleton Anthony C.<br>
Abstract: Throughout the work, his approach is one that focuses on the key thinkers in the history of Western thought so as to illuminate the continuities and changes within the understanding of hermeneutics. Friedrich Schleiermacher, for instance, is named as the first turning point for inaugurating the modern subjective turn in hermeneutics by shifting its task from “rules of interpretation” to the “art of understanding.” He names Hans-Georg Gadamer as the second turning point for retrieving and rehabilitating notions of community, authority, history, and tradition for a more robust and rounded theory of hermeneutics. In addition to Schleiermacher and Gadamer, Thistleton accordingly devotes substantial sections and even separate chapters to other key thinkers in modern hermeneutics such as Wilhelm Dilthey, Rudolf Bultmann, and Paul Ricoeur. Thistleton is at his best in this work when he gives the sustained attention and acute analyses that these seminal thinkers in modern and contemporary hermeneutics deserve.<br>

Abstract: The Protestant attack on the idea of intrinsically magical language was an inflection of the broadly confessional attack on sacramentality. Arguments connecting the formula for conjuration to the Catholic Eucharist began to emerge in Germany and Denmark in the 1560s and ’70s, and these arguments were imported into England by a distinctly heterogeneous group of devotional writers.
      6Gifford and Perkins are often reductively characterized as Puritans, perhaps for their early interest in Presbyterianism, although in fact they both embraced the Elizabethan settlement before they published their major tracts on magic.7Other writers who rehearsed the continental account of conjuration had little association with nonconformity: Henry Holland, for instance, was settled in his London living by the establishment dean of Westminster, and Robert Burton, the author ofThe Anatomy of Melancholy(1621), used the opportunity of his Oxford fellowship to ignore theological controversy almost entirely. James I (then James VI of Scotland) repeated verbatim the new Protestant arguments about magic in his 1597Daemonologie, as did the seventeenth-century physician John Cotta inThe Triall of Witchcraft(1616).8The new reformed discourse of magic was, then, generated in pastoral, academic, royal, commercial, and theatrical spaces to various and divergent ends. Historians of the English reformation have generally seen the emergence of a reformist theory of magical language as linked to pastoral attempts to discredit “cunning” men and women as medical authorities and to reinterpret witchcraft as a form of spiritual affliction.9But this model of the pastorate attacking popular practices from above, as it were, in order to consolidate its own spiritual authority against the traditions of the laity tends not to provide for the breadth of perspectives and interests that generated and disseminated the new account of the spiritual instrumentality of representation.<br>

Abstract: There are also evident similarities between Larmore’s account and Korsgaard’s analysis of “self-constitution” via the unity of reasons (theoretical and practical) that one acknowledges and maintains. Larmore’s book first appeared in French in 2004 and thus was presumably composed around the same time as Korsgaard’s Locke Lectures—and Larmore’s analysis of reasons develops themes already introduced in his
      The Morals of Modernity(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996, esp. chap. 5). But Larmore’s view is clearly distinguished from Korsgaard’s and Sartre’s (which is discussed in detail) by his cogent arguments that reasons which hold together a self (92) cannot get their normative force merely from the agent’s choice or endorsement (95) but require an authority that comes from the apparent objective worth of their objects. Like Gary Watson, Eleonore Stump, Susan Wolf, and others, he also rightly applies this modification to Harry Frankfurt’s account, noting that a second-order desire (or volition) only has the requisite authority if it “embodies an evaluation of the desires to which it refers” (98). Larmore might have clarified this by referring to Charles Taylor’s concept of “strong evaluation,” but he obscures Taylor’s distinction by arguing that all desires involve a normative element. His account is notable for this detailed “Normativist Conception of the Mind” (chap. 4), his related reconstruction of “first person authority” (chap. 5), and his sustained critique and reconstruction of “authenticity” ideals (chaps. 1–3). I begin with brief comments on the narrative account of chapter 7.<br>

Abstract: Some of the earliest forms of the generic notion of evil demarcate
            abominations—acts that, like incest, cannibalism, patricide—elicit horror and disgust. Abominations are violations, disorders of nature that issue in natural sanctions: plagues or expulsions. The world in whichevilis construed as a form ofsinful disobedienceis a world defined by a divinity who gives commands, exacts obedience, punishes, or rewards (Genesis and Exodus). A world focused on virtue andviceis a naturalistic, social world (Theophrastus, Butler, Mandeville). Virtues are those traits that—like courage and justice—preserve and enhance a community. The vices—greed, disloyalty, envy, self-indulgence, disrespect—threaten the social order. The origins and sanctions for vices are social: an unfortunate upbringing in a malformed polity can issue in the kind of corruption whose sanction is the loss of trust and cooperation. Withmalevolence(Pope Innocent III, Calvin), we enter a new world, a world of individual will and responsibility. While malevolence is normally marked by a defective will,sinfuses disobedience with a defiant will (Aquinas, Jonathan Edwards). But while the earliest forms of disobedience can be relatively innocent, sin presupposes that Everyman, in the full knowledge of the difference between good and evil, right and wrong, willfully violates the divine order by presumptuous pride (Milton’s Satan, Goethe’s Faust). When the disposition or proclivity to sin—construed as pride or egoism—becomes an inherently dominant and psychologically structuring motive, only divine grace can set aside divine punishment. Evil becomes less fraught when morality returns to the secular, social order during the Renaissance and Enlightenment. Setting aside the theology and metaphysics of sin, the new psychology turned to characterizing character traits that—like wanton cruelty—generate “man’s inhumanity to man” (Montaigne, Voltaire).Partiality, egoism—the desire for glory or selfinterest—remai~<br>

Abstract: Where Cordelia’s self-exposure pitched Lear into a fiery passion in act 1, it works differently on him in act 4. What we see now is not rage but responsiveness. When Cordelia bows her head to receive his blessing, Lear does not hold his hand over her in the gesture of authority but kneels before her in a posture of humility. This action, as Richard McCoy points out, revisits an earlier instance in which Lear has kneeled sarcastically to beg a daughter for food, bed, and raiment. There, the action was cruelly derisive and was rebuked as such (“Good sir, no more. These are unsightly tricks” [2.2.321–22]). But when Lear takes to his knees in act 4, the gesture seems genuine.
      
            His submissiveness is so stirring, so sublime, that A. C. Bradley finds the scene “almost a profanity to touch.”39

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>

Abstract: Bonhoeffer believed that Christianity must be something more than the cultural constructions of whatever society it is known within; indeed, when necessary, it must take its stand against the prevailing political and moral orders.
            
                  Even though the embrace of a religionless Christianity takes us to a place of suffering the cross, for Bonhoeffer it has nothing to do with escaping the world in individual piety or otherworldly mysticism. Rather by our very immersion and being in the world—sharing its duties, sorrows, and sufferings—we gain the credibility and authority to call the world into question. Willingness to suffer the wounds of the wounded themselves is by no means equivalent to a move to passivity and surrender to worldly powers; rather it constitutes a place of profound power in powerlessness.127
               
                  Pugh even speculates that a “religionless Christianity could well take the form of public resistance to the ‘way things are.’”128
               
                  Bonhoeffer stresses, however, that confronting power may never come from our power but from the powerlessness that God’s own self experiences in the cross of Jesus. This awareness results in Bonhoeffer’s radical conviction regarding the role of ecclesia in the world: “The church can defend its own sphere … only by battling, not for that sphere but for the salvation of the world. Otherwise the church degenerates into a ‘religious society,’ fighting for its own existence, and thus automatically is no longer God’s church in the world.”129

Abstract: This article focuses on intellectuals—writers, philosophers, academics, scientists, and artists—who, by virtue of their accomplishments and talents, or simply because of their renown, wielded such moral authority that they became at times veritable “leaders of conscience,” influencing public opinion and, indeed, government policy in France. Responding to major events, whether colonial wars, international crises, or significant domestic political battles, French intellectuals weighed in time and again, from the Dreyfus affair to the bogus Sarkozy debate on “national identity.”
         
                  This article reviews the stance of French intellectuals on the question of Palestine and the wider Arab-Israeli conflict, and examines how the ideological and political assumptions underlying their positions were not always amenable to rational explanation or easily ascribed to traditional attitudes of the Left and Right.1<br>

Abstract: By utilizing the textual products of extraterrestrial-inspired religious thinkers like George Van Tassel, Raël, and Patricia Cori, as well as related materials by Erich von Däniken and Zecharia Sitchin, this article explores the concept of revisionism in ET-inspired religions. The authors examined in this article reread ancient religious texts, especially the Bible, as containing evidence of extraterrestrial influence in the course of human history. The anatomy of this "drive to revise" human history is explored, including an examination of how an improvisational millenarianism combines with a cultic milieu suspicious of authority and hegemonic narratives, and the conspiratorial intellectual maverick willing to work with "stigmatized" knowledge to produce narratives that are highly critical and suspicious of established intellectual authorities and procedures.<br>

Abstract: At a time when immanent abandonment of plural marriage was sorely testing the faithful's confidence, rituals commemorating Joseph Smith's birth established three aspects of his legacy as the core of L.D.S self-conception: restored church order, divine authority, and continuing revelation. These three claims, inscribed on the Vermont monument, were given particular force by the church's new Progressive-Era uses of the autobiographical narrative of Joseph Smith's early life. Specifically, during this period the narrative of Smith's original theophany achieved the primacy once accorded plural marriage, allowing the Latter-day Saints to forget as a practical matter, the once-definitive marriage practice. This essay uses theories of narrative and myths of origin to show how uses of Smith's theophany allowed the Latter-day Saints to jettison plural marriage without destroying their identity, much less their confidence in Joseph Smith as church founder.<br>

Article Title: Architecture and Historical Representation<br>
Publisher: Butterworth-Heinemann<br>
Issue: i262155<br>
Date: 8 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Kramer Réjean<br>
Abstract: As a basis for the professionalization of their field, architectural historians have assumed the autonomy and verifiability of historical knowledge. Central to these premises is the view that the archives and monuments of the past are the primary sources of the discipline. The historian's task is conceived as the gathering, selection, and verification of facts, the interpretation of which is presented in "literary" form for the sake of communicability. As such, a separation of form from content is assumed. However, recent studies in historiography insist on the determinant role played by the language of the historian upon the representation of history. In these works, critical insights developed in the fields of linguistics, rhetoric, and literary theory are brought to bear upon the analysis of historical accounts, pointing to the other "source" of history: discourse and rhetoric. This article reassesses the link among history, literature, and language. It raises the issue of the nature and authority of historical narratives and encourages rethinking their role within the discipline of architecture.<br>

Article Title: Jonathan Edwards and the Language of God<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263722<br>
Date: 12 1, 1960<br>
Author(s): Edwards William J.<br>
Abstract: Part 1 shows that while Edwards and Berkeley both regard nature as God's discourse and speak of this discourse in similar ways, Edwards differs from Berkeley in believing that the signs of this discourse signify spiritual and divine realities. Part 2 explains why Edwards thought it reasonable to believe that our world is a world of types and images. Because our world is a world of resemblances and imitations, because spiritual things are its "alpha and omega," and because its beauty is a reflection of God's beauty, our world can be expected to contain images or shadows of divine things. Scripture provides evidence that this expectation is realized. Part 3 shows that these images are not symbols but emblems, and that because emblems are consciously invented, their occurrence implies theism. Part 4 attempts to show that, given the assumptions of classical Christian theism, it is in principle no more difficult to decipher the meaning of the book of nature than to decipher the meaning of an allegorical poem or tale. Part 5 criticizes Perry Miller. Edwards's reflections on types were not influenced by the new science. He did not anticipate Coleridge on the imagination, nor did he "elevate nature to a level of authority coequal with revelation."<br>

Publisher: Taylor & Francis Ltd<br>
Issue: i302185<br>
Date: 6 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Wolf George Clement<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the relation of authority to legitimacy through the social construction of local histories that validate claims to 'authentic' rulership. Using the historical example of the Chiefdom of Uyombe in northern Zambia, I intend to argue that the construction of these local histories has been a crucial element in the process of domination, subjugation, resistance and collaboration between rulers and those they would rule. Exploring specific Gramscian concepts, I will also argue that historical narratives contain hegemonic and ideological components that are critical to relating authority to legitimacy in an active manner. These narratives contain African voices, which express varied local interests. Through the narratives, Africans may be seen as active agents in contributing to the making of their own local histories of rulership. Thus, authority and legitimacy are conjoined through the fabrication, inscription and recitation of historical narratives and are an essential part of governance.<br>

Abstract: Puritanism and Confucianism have little in common in terms of their substantive teachings, but they do share an emphasis on bounded, authoritative, localized human arrangements, and this profoundly challenges the dominant presumptions of contemporary globalization. It is not enough to say that these worldviews are "communitarian" alternatives to globalism, for that defines away what needs to be explained. This article compares the ontology of certain elements of the Puritan and Confucian worldviews, and, by focusing on the role of both authority and activity in these systems, assesses (with the assistance of Max Weber) the theories of harmony that each invoke. It concludes by identifying the distinct options that these two modes of human existence suggest for those who wish to defend the relevance of boundedness and authority, and thus the very possibility of a human-scaled politics, in today's world.<br>

Author(s): Jenson Michael<br>
Abstract: A recurrent misconception about the concept of utopia fails to realize fully that its essential endeavor constitutes a speculative act involving the distribution of power and resources. Consequently, utopian desire is closely linked to structures of power and can be manipulated by interests in positions of influence within these structures. It is these connections to the machinations of power that bring utopian visions their potential for social/political influence. However, these same types of links also provide avenues for these conceptions to be cynically influenced in ways that can usurp individual autonomy. The role of power and utopia can be analyzed in the formative process of a specific social structure as well as in their contribution to the conception of a common heritage or history. The "historical perspective" often serves as the foundation for the production of propaganda seeking to capture the imagination of a populace either to instigate positive social change or to legitimize an oppressive regime. Through the lens of Collingwood's philosophy of history, this article investigates the connection that the "historical consciousness" has to the attributes of power and utopia as well as the role that this relationship plays in the formation of a collective mentality. In short, it studies the essential characteristics of the bond between individuals that allows a community or collective to perpetuate itself. It also explores how the attributes of power and utopia can use latent historical perceptions to strengthen the process of ideological integration that underlies any social action or formal structure of authority.<br>

Abstract: Remonstrances (jian ﻿諫) reveal a great deal about the writing of history in China during the Eastern Zhou. As represented in the Zuozhuan and Guoyu, remonstrances, like other speeches, are normally delivered in court and address questions of official policy. They tend to test contemporary phenomena against the lessons of the past, especially as those lessons have been formulated in the Shijing, the Shangshu, aphorisms, and other forms of what I term "inherited speech." Remonstrances also have the support of the third-person historical narrative which surrounds them; the ruler who ignores a remonstrance always suffers for his obstinacy. After briefly discussing the importance of speeches in the Zuozhuan and Guoyu, I outline the structure of a remonstrance and examine four passages in which critical speech, including remonstrance, is said to have circulated freely in the courts of an idealized early period. Next I show how remonstrances match observed historical particulars with fragments of inherited speech. The famous remonstrance of Gong zhi Qi, an exemplary episode, shows how this application of inherited speech guides rhetorical choices and establishes Traditionalist or Confucian terms as the keys to historical intelligibility. Finally, I examine a set of remonstrances which are exceptional in that they do not include overt citations of inherited speech. Among these, military remonstrances can genuinely eschew explicit citation of lessons of the past, while others borrow the authority of inherited speech without seeming to do so. In one case, a brief remonstrance has apparently acquired the status of an aphorism, so that already when it is first uttered it qualifies as a sort of inherited speech. In another case, a precursor of the indirect remonstrances (fengjian ﻿諷諫) of later periods, remonstrators use a theatrical combination of actions and speech to criticize their superior's departure from correct ways. As texts in which the speakers (and behind them the aut~<br>

Abstract: IN THIS ESSAY I EXPLORE THE WAYS IN WHICH OBEDIENCE TO AUTHORITY functions as a moral norm in evangelical ethics, with the potential of constraining and even endangering the multifaceted nature of Christian morality. I consider two particular sources of moral authority in evangelicalism: the Bible and leaders. I discuss the reasons and ways in which obedience to these two sources of moral authority functions in evangelical ethics and provide an ethical critique to these two moral norms and ethical practices. My primary aim is to expand an understanding of Christian morality that takes seriously the narrative dimensions of Christian ethics, conscience formation, moral agency, and skills in moral discernment.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines how two Jefferson biographies represented the Thomas Jefferson—Sally Hemings relationship in the post—civil rights movement era: Fawn Brodie's Thomas Jefferson (1974), a controversial publication that claimed that Hemings and Jefferson loved each other, and Joseph Ellis's American Sphinx (1996), one of the last mainstream biographies to deny that they had any children together. The story in both cases serves as an allegory of founding authority and national membership. The author finds that Ellis and Brodie characterize Jefferson as a fallible founder to affirm that founding ideals can accommodate and overcome racial differences and injustices.<br>

Author(s): Rock Paul<br>
Abstract: Two visions of homicide, murderers and victims are contrasted. One, conventional in criminology, has it that murders are the culmination of drawn-out, acrimonious transactions occurring within demographically homogeneous sectors of the population. It leads to a blurring of moral identities and causal relations. The other is championed by homicide 'survivors' organizations, and it claims an existentially validated authority. Homicide is experienced by 'survivors' as a chaotic episode which gives way to strong, antagonistic archetypes of victim and offender. The two visions are examined, in part, to promote an appreciation of the analytic complexities of the phenomenon of murder; in part, to point to the fraught politics that are beginning to emerge around resolving the character of murder.<br>

Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23653923<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Taylor Betsy<br>
Abstract: The global justice movement reveals a diverse array of emergent publics striving politically for a sustainable world. Working partly from John Dewey, we try to illuminate democratic grounds for knowledge and action in these endeavors. We begin by situating Dewey's ideas in the politics of American history, especially historian John Diggins' countervailing approach to issues of authority, knowledge and opinion. Diggins, against Robert Westbrook and others, contends that Dewey's philosophy of politics chased radical democratic illusions, whereas he might have learned from Charles S. Peirce to uphold the boundary between professional communities and other entities including democratic publics. Dewey saw no democratic alternative to harness the political energy of ordinary people. We argue that Dewey had come to understand that a corporate state system of political economy had come to engulf both the liberal democratic polity and the professions. Dewey's political challenge to the professions and his illumination of the aesthetic ecology of democratic publics prefigure a democratic republican alternative that opens up a new basis for participation in the global justice movement confronting, among other obstacles, a transnational corporate state based in the USA. A Marxist-progressivist notion of the ongoing socialization of markets by corporate capitalism too often reinforces an anti-Populist intellectual sensibility that is coupled with, whether wittingly or not, either a social-democratic elitism or a revolutionary vanguardism. Globalization struggles need, on the contrary, a pragmatic vision of democratic publics instituting a true diversity of policies assuring a world-in-common. The fight for public spaces in the treacherous politics of civil society and global consumerism is a struggle against subjectivization. The fact that corporate state elitism, in the U.S. context, feeds on a rightist version of nationaism does not mean we can junk the history of democratic s~<br>

Abstract: The myth of Śunaḥśepa (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 7.13-18) constitutes a primary acknowledgment by brahmanic tradition of the existence of peoples living outside of the varṇa system. The principal themes of this account served as the grounds for a socio-religious ideology that continued to develop throughout the history of brahmanic literature. This ideology established an opposition between the center—authority, sacrifice and cows of the brahmin Vasiṣtḥa; and the periphery—antinomian power and asceticism of the non-brahmin Viśvāmitra, and haunt of marginals and their dogs. This ideology breaks down in late variants of this myth, in which the expanded universe of bhakti can even encompass the excluded. Le mythe de Śunaḥśepa (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 7.13-18) constitue un premier constat par la tradition brahmanique de l'existence de peuples hors du système des varṇa. A partir des éléments principaux de ce récit, une idéologie socioreligieuse ne cessera de s'élaborer à travers l'histoire de la littérature hindoue. Cette idéologie opposera au centre, à l'autorité et au sacrifice du brahmane Vasiṣtḥa vivant par ses vaches, la périphérie : « chaos » dominé par le pouvoir antinomien de l'ascète non brahmane Viśvāmitra, où les exclus vivent par leurs chiens. Dans des variantes tardives de ce mythe, il y a un effritement de cette idéologie, du fait que l'univers élargi de la bhakti englobe même les exclus.<br>

Abstract: Situé au nord ouest de la Chine et base de la guérilla communiste avant même l'arrivée de Mao Zédong en 1935, Yan'an a longtemps constitué, officiellement du moins, l'instant de pureté morale de la révolution chinoise. Les événements de la place Tiananmen en juin 1989, moment certes éphémère, ont définitivement mis fin au mythe de Yan'an, même si la réalité de cette révolution avait disparu bien avant. A son époque, Yan'an rayonna vers toutes les bases révolutionnaires et à travers toute la Chine, et ce, malgré le contexte de guerre et de révolution. Ce fut le moment de transition entre l'échec et le succès à la fois pour Mao Zédong en personne à travers son ascension au sein du Parti communiste chinois et pour le Parti lui-même. Les mots et la langue furent, à cet égard et plus que toute autre chose, d'une importance cruciale. "Faiseur de mythe", conteur, architecte moral, créant à la fois la logique et le texte de la révolution, Mao parvint à symboliser le discours hégémonique de la révolution chinoise comme l'unique culture politique possible. Les luttes pour le pouvoir menées par Mao s'articulèrent sur la prétention au monopole d'un "cosmos" défini par luimême autour d'une idéologie (le marxisme sinisé), d'un pouvoir de domination militaire, d'un pouvoir administratif, et d'un pouvoir intellectuel. Mao utilisa en effet ces quatre dimensions pour asseoir son autorité avec un savant mélange de finesse analytique et tactique que l'on retrouve aussi dans ses textes. Mais il se heurta à des compétiteurs à l'intérieur même du PCC. Aussi chacune de ces luttes révèle-t-elle une dimension différente du processus de monopolisation. Chacune était nécessaire mais même ensemble, elles étaient insuffisantes, en l'absence de l'ingrédient final, le capital symbolique. Situated in China's Northwest, and communist guerrilla base before Mao arrived, Yan'an hab been constituted during a long time, officially at least, the moral moment of the chinese revolution.

Abstract: Finke, pp. 41-42: "In the Middle Ages, torture was not regarded simply as a form of
punishment. It was, as Foucault has shown, a technique and a ritual, a semiotic system which 'must
mark the victim.' Torture inscribed on the victim's body the 'signs' of the ruler's power. It was
one of the most visible displays of that power, an art, 'an entire poetic' that competed with other
visual displays of theocratic rule. The marking of the victim's body signifies the power that
punishes. "In the 'excesses' of torture, a whole economy of power is invested". In her excesses,
the mystic becomes at once both torturer and victim. This, it seems to me, is the whole point. The
mystic's pain - her inflicting of wounds upon herself — grants her the authority to speak and be
heard."<br>

Abstract: Within the papal eneyelieals (exhortations) ranging from Leo XIII (1878) to Pope Francis (2013), concern for authority in general and for obedience and duty, in particular, is in decline. This longterm trend signals intra-ecclesial secularization at the elite level. A second negative trend supports this finding: textual indicators for Catholic uniqueness such as: Catholic, Doctrine and Pope have steadily lost prominence. Upwardly directed, the textual indicators for God, Jesus, Gospel, Spirituality and Love follow positive long-term trends. The traditional eschatological code, with its keywords sin, death, final judgment, heaven or hell, reaches only low levels of attention. Overall, there is an eschatological loss, where Heaven, due to a slower decline, wins over Hell. Christ the Inexorable Judge is retreating in favor of the loving Jesus and God as Love. The millennia-old process of civilizing God persists. Technically, the quantitative content analysis was carried out mainly with TEXTPACK.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo está orientado a precisar las relaciones entre experiencia corporal de las mujeres y testimonio. Un largo hábito de subalternidad ha expropiado a las mujeres de la posibilidad de tomar la palabra sobre sus experiencias corporales. Es por ello la importancia que tiene la singularidad de sus testimonios, que implica tomar la palabra en una situación de imposibilidad del lenguaje; es siempre el relato de un acontecimiento traumático del que se habla, pero del que también podría no hablarse. El sujeto/a que toma la palabra da cuenta de un conocimiento que - si bien es precario - constituye un saber del que antes no se tenía registro. Es que el testimonio pone en juego la relación entre la lengua y el archivo. Exige una subjetividad que atestigüe sobre la posibilidad misma de hablar, un/a sujeto capaz de pronunciar lo "inaudito", produciendo con su palabra una intervención ética. La autoridad del testimonio depende de una relación inmemorial entre lo indecible y lo decible, produce una palabra que nombra una experiencia singular. Las palabras de las mujeres que relatan experiencias corporales nombran una dimensión fundamental de nuestra experiencia, la de la diferencia sexual produciendo un dislocamiento en la presunta neutralidad de la lengua. Se trata de una reflexión que abre la posibilidad de poner palabras a lo innombrable. The aim of this article is to specify the relationships between corporal experiences of women and testimony. A long habit of subordination has expropriated the women of the possibility of speaking of their bodily experiences. Thus, the importance of the singularity of their testimonies, which implies beginning to speak in a situation of impossibility of the language. This is always the account of a traumatic event, but which could also not be spoken about. The individual who speaks shows an awareness that, even though insufficient, constitutes a knowledge that has not been registered before. The testimony brings into play the link b~<br>

Abstract: A prominent factor in opening the possibilities of individual choice was the influence of
mothers, fortified with married women's autonomy in disposing of their wealth. Often endorsed by
their husbands but often independently of them, women offered their children the possibility of
framing their own social identity without direction from the structures of patriarchal authority,
paternal or governmental. On the varieties of adult experience, see Stanley Chojnacki, 'Measuring
adulthood: adolescence and gender in Renaissance Venice',/Fam Hist, 17 (1992), 371-95. On the
role of mothers in providing opportunities for elective adult vocation for both sons and daughters, see

Abstract: In the first half of the twentieth century noncognitivism was the predominant metaethical point of view in analytical philosophy. This perspective came under critical scrutiny as early as the late 1950s, and by the 1970s its authority began to be undermined. For various reasons cognitivist theories began to be put forward with confidence. Different philosophers tried ways to restore the role of reason in ethics. This shift in the philosophical climate was influenced by—or was at least in accordance with—the thought of the later Wittgenstein. In particular, this article will consider the relevance of Wittgenstein for cognitivist views, such as that of S. Toulmin, relativists like G. Harman, and British moral realists like S. Lovibond and J. McDowell. In fact, Wittgenstein is one of the founding fathers of antifoundationalism. He gives us the hopeful insight that the end of foundationalism does not necessarily imply the end of moral philosophy but must be considered a new start of it.<br>

Abstract: Cet article analyse les expériences de mobilité interne de femmes atteintes par le VIH résidant au moment des enquêtes ethnographiques dans la ville de Gondar, dans le nord-ouest de l'Éthiopie. Les expériences biographiques de cinq femmes séropositives, vivant dans des conditions de marginalité sociale et originaires de zones rurales, seront étudiées plus largement dans les principales configurations que la mobilité féminine interne prend en fonction de l'âge et de l'origine sociale des sujets migrants. L'article mettra au jour le caractère multiforme et la condition permanente d'instabilité de ces parcours migratoires. Initiés depuis un premier projet de départ, ils se sont poursuivis au fil des opportunités et des contraintes que les femmes migrantes ont rencontrées tout au long de leur parcours de migration dans une tension constante vers un avenir que les expériences biographiques cristallisent comme le temps du changement. Nous démontrerons que l'état de séropositivité au VIH, avec ses manifestations et ses conséquences, apparaît comme un facteur de conditionnement prééminent sans pour autant constituer une « rupture biographique ». Il participe au processus d'« assujettissement » d'individus se situant en marge de la société et des espaces d'action des pouvoirs établis. Plus particulièrement, l'analyse de la relation subjective de ces femmes aux normes et aux catégories du discours dominant présidant à la construction de leur « identité sociale virtuelle », mettra en exergue que le VIH représente à la fois une opportunité et une contrainte dans la détermination de leur relation subjective à l'avenir. This article analyses the experiences of internal mobility of HIV-positive women who at the moment of the ethnographic surveys lived in the city of Gondar, in North Western Ethiopia. The "biographical experiences" of five women who migrated from rural areas and used to live in conditions of social marginality will be placed in the context of a wider analysis of th~<br>

Abstract: Sven Arntzen arrive, par une analyse détaillée, à une conclusion qui n'est
pas loin de l'idée de J. Patocka : « Duty to oneself requires that one resist
political authority under certain circumstances and thus is a basis for
permissible resistance. ».Kant on duty to oneself and resistance to political
authority, in Journal of the History of Philosophy, juilllet 1996, vol. 34, n°3,
pp. 409 sq. Il faut ajouter que la parole kantienne « Ne devenez point esclaves
des hommes. Ne souffrez pas que votre droit soit impunément foulé aux pieds
par les autres » a dans le texte de Kant une portée limitée. Elle avertit contre la
perte de l'indépendance économique de l'individu (car les dettes peuvent
mener à ce qu'on devienne mendiant), contre la génuflexion devant les images
et contre un comportement trop révérencieux par rapport aux hommes
(lorsqu'il exprime par exemple la différence des états, la courtoisie mutuelle
entre égaux étant en revanche compatible avec l'estime de soi-même). Ces
formes d'estime n'ont aucune dimension politique et Kant ne provoque pas à
une résistance dans le cadre de la défense contre l'injustice. Et pourtant, les
analyses de Patoika et Arntzen peuvent s'appuyer sur l'œuvre de Kant dans
son ensemble. Du point de vue d'ensemble, le droit à la résistance chez Kant
n'est pas seulement une question de légalité, mais de moralité.<br>

Author(s): AKRAM MUHAMMAD<br>
Abstract: This paper discusses the issue of the relationship between theology and religious studies, drawing on certain principles of Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutical theory. Leaving aside differences between Gadamer and his critics, it is argued that his rehabilitation of prejudice, authority and tradition as well as his notions of the fusion of horizons and intersubjective dialogue put into question the utility of dichotomous categories like subjective-objective, normative-descriptive, and insider-outsider in approaches to religion. It is suggested, therefore, that a clearer distinction between theology and religious studies can be established in terms of the subject matter of these disciplines rather than on the basis of their methodological principles. However, as both disciplines venture to understand at least some overlapping dimensions of religious phenomena which make up their common subject matter, to this extent, they can be viewed as dialogical partners and as providing different but complementary perspectives on religion.<br>

who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are

Author(s): Seerveld Calvin<br>
Abstract: I am open to David Carroll's considération that American 'deconstructionists' (and
those in art historical circles?) may have oversimplified Derrida's thought into a 'newer
form of new criticism' (in Paraesthetics, Foucault/Lyotard/Derrida ILondon:Methuen,
1987) pp.81-89). Yet even Carroll notes that 'a critical reading of Derrida should have as
one of its goals to make a practical criticism derived from Derrida's work very diflicult, if
not impossible to realize' (p.207 n.3). Possibly Derrida's disciples, like those of Dooye-
weerd or Dewey or Hegel, misrepresent his genius, but Derridean authority is constantly
invoked on the world academie circuit today for its assembly-line scholarship of profes-
sional articles which continue to marginalize both philosophical and literary criticism. So
there is more warrant than chagrin to André Lefevere's sardonic remark: 'To produce
more and more interprétations of texts that have been interpreted for centuries may
appear to be a trifle redundant, except that it is a matter of bread and butter for most
interpreters.... (quoting Vincent Leitch, Deconstructive Criticism, 1983) 'There can never
be <correct> or <objective> readings, only more or less energetic, interesting, careful or
pleasurable misreadings.' Often the same person who writes this kind of thing then goes
home and grades the 'misreadings' of others, so that they, too, can take their place within
the academy, or be denied it, as the case may be.' Lefevere, '"Beyond Interprétation" or
The Business of (Re)Writing,' in Comparative Literature Studies 24 (no. 1, 1987): 18.
William Rowe, however, asks for a patient, 'more internai' critical reading of Derrida's
nomadic no-position. Cf. 'Critical study of [Sander Griffioen'sl The Problem of Progress',
in Philosophia Reformata 55 (no. 1, 1990): 80-83.<br>

Author(s): Geertsema Hendrik<br>
Abstract: Putnam's own position represents another attempt at overcoming the dilemma of
objectivism and relativism. See, for example, Reason, pp. ixff. He criticizes both metaphysical
realism and cultural relativism. He, too, fails, however, to overcome it because in his critique
of the one standpoint he is forced to argue from the standpoint of the other, and conversely.
It is tempting to compare the debate that is presently taking place in philosophy with the
struggle that has been going on for a long time in the Christian religion. The same fate that
befell faith in Scripture, when this canon of the Christian religion was understood in the
context of history, now also befalls the trust in reason, as the ultimate authority of humanism.
In both instances one sees fundamentalism pitted against relativism.<br>

"universal" yet not "exhaustive" or "omnicompetent".... We might say that the scope of the

intensive — it may not compromise the irreducible, non-transferrable authority of a social
institution arising from its "sphere sovereignty".' (Chaplin 2004, 6)<br>

Abstract: The main aim of this article is to offer a critical reflection on the need of rethinking the teachers' professional skills and their academic pathway, given the changes and current transformations (crisis, in its etymological sense). In fact, a series of changes, transformations, are identified and affect directly the educator's comprehension. Amongst others: the transformation of work bound up with the processes of the economic globalization, and the transformation of the learning environments imbued by the TICs; the population growth, a demographic transformation with geopolitics relevance, and finally, as a result from the previous ones, the raise in the migratory flows. Under this context, this paper tries to reconceptualize teachers' training and their depiction as professionals from the view of Gustav Mahler in his statement Tradition is the spreading of fire and not the veneration of ashes. Thereupon, some categories that help in the teaching update, are proposed and explained; such as authority (as reputation or moral authority, role model and, hence, less so as bare exercise of power), the personalization of education, the importance of home community (society), and, lastly, the alternation within school-society and work-study. El objetivo de este trabajo es ofrecer una reflexión acerca de la necesidad de re-pensar la profesionalidad de los docentes y de su itinerario formativo, a la luz los cambios y transformaciones actuales (crisis, en sentido etimológico). En efecto, se identifican una serie de cambios, de transformaciones, que afectan directamente a la comprensión del docente, del enseñante. Entre otros: la transformación del trabajo vinculada a los procesos de la globalización económica y la transformación de los entornos de aprendizaje imbuidos en las TICs; el aumento de la población, la transformación demográfica con trascendencia geopolítica; y por último, y como confluencia de las dos anteriores, el aumento de los flujos migratorios.

Article Title: The Regime of Authenticity: Timelessness, Gender, and National History in Modern China<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342994<br>
Date: 10 1, 1990<br>

Abstract: While there is much writing on the nation as the subject of linear history, considerably less attention has been paid to the dimension of the nation as the always identifiable, unchanging subject of history. This unchanging subject is necessitated by the ascendancy of the conception of linear time in capitalism in which change is viewed not only as accelerating, but can no longer be framed by an ultimate source of meaning such as God. Ostensibly, linear history is the falling of events into the "river of time," but national history also posits a continuous subject to gather these changes. Such a subject is recognizable only by the spiritual qualities of authenticity, purity, and sacrality. The nation-state and nationalists stake their claim to sovereign authority, in part, as custodians of this authenticity. A range of figures, human and non-human, come to symbolize a regime of authenticity manipulable to some extent by nationalists and state-builders. This essay focuses on the instance of women in early twentieth-century China. Nationalists and cultural essentialists tended to depict women as embodying the eternal Chinese civilizational virtues of self-sacrifice and loyalty and to elevate them as national exemplars. The essay also examines cases of how women themselves may have perceived this role as exemplars and concludes that while there was considerable subversion in their enunciation of this role (to their advantage), there was sufficient reference to the prescriptive code of authenticity in their self-formation to sustain the regime of authenticity. The essay ends with some thoughts about the changing relationship between authenticity and intensifying globalization in the contemporary world.<br>

Abstract: An inset on loan. 1, 29 (Β, fol. 7va, but not in Ρ or S) : 'Alia ratio, que
est in Amalario, sicut habetur in Iohel : Filii Israel, timentes captivari, cum fletu
dicebant : Parce Domine, parce populo tuo; et si cum illi timentes captivitatem
temporalem, dicebant hoc, verbis scilicet Parce etc, ita nos timentes eternam,
dicimus : Agnus Dei miserere nobis, et hoc bis. Tertio dicimus : Dona nobis pacem,
quia illi dicebant : et ne des hereditatem tuam gentibus'.
This quotation of Ioel 2, 17 as the précèdent for the words of the canon is not
to be found in the liturgical works of Amalarius, ed. I. M. Hanssens (Studi e testi
139-140) 1948-50; but John Beleth gives it, ed. cit. 2, 84-85. On patristic use of
the liturgy as an authority see B. Capelle, Autorité de la liturgie chez les Pères,

Abstract: Sorel, Montesquieu, p. 7. Carr notices that Usbek and Rica may stand for a distant
monarch, perhaps Louis XIV, one 'who in some sense is remote from his obligations and
responsibilities'. Given the differences in character between Usbek and Rica, one
expects that it may be better simply to see Usbek as a distant authority figure, since he is
the remote ruler of his seraglio. See Carr, 'The Secret Chain of the Lettres persanes',

Abstract: Freud, 'Civilization and its Discontents', XXI, pp. 115,116. Freud was highly crit-
ical of Woodrow Wilson, whom he considered a naive leader who misread the mutual
hostility inherent in social life. On this point, see Brunner, Freud: The Politics of Psycho-
analysis, ch. 4. It is important to note that when fascism emerged in Europe, Freud's sug-
gestion that the leader is essential to the formation of groups was strongly criticized.
Erich Fromm, for example, saw in his age a disintegration of the super-ego or conscience
(p. 167), and suggested that it is precisely the lack of individuality that springs from this
disintegration that propels men and women to crave an all-powerful leader and external
source of authority (or the anonymous rein of public opinion, the norm and science in
democratic regimes). Fascism, according to this interpretation, springs from the inability
of modern men and women to cope with their freedom and individuality, and with their
corresponding aloneness (or homelessness) in the world. See Erich Fromm, Escape
From Freedom (New York, 1941), especially chs. 5 and 7.<br>

Article Title: Sorcery and Sovereignty: Taxation, Witchcraft, and Political Symbols in the 1880 Transkeian Rebellion<br>
Publisher: Carfax Publishing Ltd.<br>
Issue: i324967<br>
Date: 6 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Scott Sean<br>
Abstract: The paper examines the causes of the 1880 Transkeian Rebellion and attempts to build upon previous explanations. In particular, the paper looks at the way in which taxation and witchcraft beliefs combined to make the colonial state appear especially malevolent. The information on hut tax registers represented a potential threat to the African population, a threat that was both material and supernatural. With that information state officials could confiscate property, deny bridewealth claims, and do harm through the means of sorcery. This threat motivated many Africans to rally behind the precolonial authority and social harmony symbolised by the chiefs and to rebel in October 1880. Once colonial forces had squashed the rebellion, however, the collection of hut taxes became a state ritual that recreated and reinforced bonds between ruler and ruled. A high proportion of Africans paid their hut taxes in the years after the revolt: in the 1887-97 period in the three districts discussed, compliance rates averaged in the 80-100 per cent range. Yet, this was a period in which officials were often reluctant to use physical coercion or property seizure to enforce collection, because of the fear of provoking more unrest. The high compliance rates can instead be explained by the symbolic content of tax payments. Believing that state officials had access to supernatural powers and knowing that they had overcome the power of the chiefs. Africans paid their taxes as a way of deflecting those powers, thereby enabling themselves to farm in relative peace. Compliance with tax laws reflected an acknowledgement of the historical reality of the loss of African independence, but it also helped create and maintain the political reality of colonial control in the aftermath of the rebellion.<br>

Issue: i27643230<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Doja Albert<br>
Abstract: The system of beliefs and practices related to Bektashism seems to have corresponded to a kind of liberation theology, whereas the structure of Bektashi groups corresponded more or less to the type of religious organization conventionally known as charismatic groups. It becomes understandable therefore that their spiritual tendency could at times connect with and meet social, cultural and national perspectives. In turn, when members of the previously persecuted religious minority will acquire a degree of religious and political respectability within society at large, the doctrines of heterodoxy and liberation theology fade into the background. In the end, the heirs of the heterodox promoters of spiritual reform and social movement turn into followers and faithful defenders of a legitimate authority. They become the spokespeople for an institutionalized orthodoxy whose support is sought by the political regime.<br>

Author(s): Leach James<br>
Abstract: International and national agendas are redesigning the terms of intellectual-property (IP) Laws to create cultural property for developing nations. Debates over IP and cultural-property "rights" or legal needs for "protection" are critical to anthropology's effort to reflect on how the production of knowledge, even culture itself, is variously construed to originate with, or "belong to," particular individuals, ethnic communities, or nation-states. We explore the implications of two Indonesian legal documents to show the disjunction between discourses of regional artists who describe the ritual exchanges, relationships, and transgenerational messages their arts shape and (inter)nationalists legal initiatives that bypass artists' concepts of process, access, and authority in an effort to disembed and control ritual-based expressions as products with exclusive owners.<br>

Abstract: There is a curious tendency, particularly marked in American cultural anthropology, to combine elements of the post-modernist programme with a radical political engagement. Though insisting that nothing can be known for certain, and certainly that ethnographers have no independent authority, some argue that nevertheless authentic - and preferredm - native voices may be identified, articulating the genuine sentiments and aspirations of a people. This premiss opens the way for an obvious challenge: if it is true, then only the native can speak for the native. The foreign ethnographer would then be merely an interpreter, a medium. As the study of ethnicity moves to the centre of the anthropological agenda, these assumptions must be urgently questioned. That requires a reassessment of the nature and purpose of ethnography.<br>

Article Title: Rereading the Book in Henry James's The Ambassadors<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: i345794<br>
Date: 12 1, 1909<br>
Author(s): James Kevin<br>
Abstract: This essay argues that in Henry James's The Ambassadors (1903) Mrs. Newsome, who appears to be merely a representative of everything un-Jamesian, particularly a lack of moral and aesthetic imagination, should not be so quickly dismissed. Post-structuralist critics do not hesitate to denounce her. They typically identify Mrs. Newsome's "book" of expectations for Strether, her emissary, and for Chad, her successor, with the closed book of logocentric tyranny; both are said to rely on unambiguous reference and to enforce the cold rationality of linear causation. Derridean readers of The Ambassadors unmistakably prefer Madame de Vionnet's Paris, embodying as it apparently does their own essentially skeptical doctrines about representation. James, however, plays a more subtle game of balance and synthesis, suggesting that while Newsome's book is firm against new impressions, expecting experience to submit utterly to preconceived plans and moralistic evaluations, it also successfully asserts against Parisian representational openness and mystery the viability of reasonable explanation. Her book is vindicated insofar as it stands for the persistent relevance of linear causality and for the nonabsolute grounding of speculation in the concrete world of events and consequences. Newsome's extreme rationalism is in fact denied full authority early in the novel, whose true subject is located when extreme skepticism seems to dominate and explanation seems irrelevant. During the course of the story, time's subtle order slowly reemerges, and James the realist steps forward from behind the post-structuralist veil.<br>

Publisher: Irish University Review<br>
Issue: i29777260<br>
Date: 12 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Lin Yu-chen<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the drama of selfhood and the attendant problem of ethics in Brian Friel's Faith Healer. Drawing from the tenets of Freudian psychoanalysis, I scrutinize the protagonist's narrative identity through fissures created by the discrepancy between his story and the other two characters' versions. These crevices register the protagonist's post-traumatic affects for an uncanny home, which, intertwined with his equally uncanny talent to become the place of trauma, compels him to return time and again instead of acknowledging its loss. Symptomatically, in his fixation on an uncanny home in order to disavow its loss, the protagonist sutures his privation, to such an extent that he not only bars memory exchange with other characters, but appropriates them into a master narrative. Given the fact that the three characters' stories are addressed to invisible auditors who converge with the play's actual audience, the healer's final act of authority is limited as long as it is subject to the audience's interpretation of his memory narrative. In its appeal to the audience's decision on ethical justice for the healer's narrative imagination among multiple proposals, this play is an exercise of poetical ethics of memory.<br>

Author(s): White Sheldon H.<br>
Abstract: The rhetoric of social work often seeks its legitimacy and authority on the idea that knowledge can be translated into skills. Knowledge is made in universities in the form of timeless, objective, context-free truths about people and social institutions. Such knowledge rationalizes and justifies the professional practices of social work. It is not clear, however, that the knowledge-into-skills story fully explains social work practices. Practice is often ineffective and tends to throw social workers into moral quandaries, leaving them to practice in a context of faith and doubt. In addition to skills, social workers share values, purposes, the wielding of and submission to power, and mythic stories. Timely, value-expressive, contextual knowledge helps social work to create and maintain social solidarity and to shift its dispositions of skills, purposes, power, and myth to keep up with the pace of social change.<br>

Author(s): Stock Robert A.<br>
Abstract: Of the many surviving Romanesque cartularies, very few are illuminated. After reviewing general considerations of the oral, textual, and visual elements at play in these works, this paper then focuses on the Vierzon Cartulary, particularly on the processes of its charters' transcription to codex. Specifically, this paper argues the performative role of the scribe and illuminator, who, by their transformation of the mise-en-page, appropriation of papal notarial authority, and translation of sealing practice, participated in a new diplomatic ceremony of conveyance. This paper advances a reconsideration of text-image relations to account for ritual performance, both actual and symbolic.<br>

Issue: i274774<br>

Author(s): Young Jon W.<br>
Abstract: Whose perspective is reflected in ethnographic accounts is the enduring problem in bringing ethnographic observation forward in the construction of ethnographies. Both ethnographic research and modes of account display a liminal character that puts this problem in a more organizational perspective on their heterogeneous authority and unites doing ethnography and constructing ethnographies in similar ontological ambiguities arising in the social organization of communication.<br>

Author(s): Ury Jane M.<br>
Abstract: This paper addresses several problems in experimental ethnographies: the integration of first- and third-person texts, ethnographic authority, and incorporation of dialogue in ethnographies. These problems can be traced to a relationship between discourse and text that hinges on splitting subject/object and process/product. Both splits are antithetical to dialogue in defining relationships between self and social life. A dialogic approach is developed through use of indexing in social distance, and discussed in Japanese usage of register. Implications for intersubjective, reflexive, and pluralistic approaches to social life are traced out.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses several problems in experimental ethnographies: the integration of first and third person texts, ethnographic authority, and incorporation of dialogue into texts. These problems can be traced to a relationship between discourse and text that focuses on reference, and results in "representing" dialogue. This obscures dialogue in the larger sense of constituting social reality. An indexical, rather than a referential approach to dialogue is developed through examination of indexing of social distance, discussed in Japanese usage of register. Implications are traced out for intersubjective, reflexive, and pluralistic approaches to social life.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000937<br>

Author(s): Prasad Leela<br>
Abstract: This article presents material from my ethnographic study in Śringēri, south India, the site of a powerful 1200yearold Advaitic monastery that has been historically an interpreter of ancient Hindu moral treatises. A vibrant diverse local culture that provides plural sources of moral authority makes Sringeri a rich site for studying moral discourse. Through a study of two conversational narratives, this essay illustrates how the moral self is not an ossified product of written texts and codes, but is dynamic, gen dered, and emergent, endowed with historical and political agency and an aesthetic capacity that mediates many normative sources to articulate "appropriate" conduct. In so doing, the essay shows the value of including oral narrative in ethical inquiry, especially in narrative ethics, which, for most part, has focused on written sources.<br>

Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i40002579<br>
Date: 10 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Buurma Rachel Sagner<br>
Abstract: This essay considers the persistence of collective and corporate models of literary authority within late-Victorian literature and print culture. While modern critics often understand Victorian authorship to be individually centered and governed by a dynamic of secrecy and disclosure, the periodical debates about anonymity that intensified in the fin de siècle suggest that Victorian readers and writers embraced a more flexible, collective notion of authorship. The plot, language, and paratext of Mary Elizabeth Hawker's pseudonymously published Mademoiselle Ixe, as well as the author-publisher correspondence concerning the novel, offer a representation of the corporate and collective interpretive modes that would have been familiar to late-Victorian readers, if not to recent critics. Hawker's text and the archival material it brings to light also suggest that modern readers might productively turn to the Victorian past to expand the definitions of authorship that circulate throughout nineteenth-century scholarship today.<br>

Abstract: A comparison of Giuseppe Bagetti's landscape sketches, watercolours, oil paintings and engravings with contemporary maps and the existing landscape reveals that in the creation of Bagetti's landscapes, narrative played a role that differed in cartographic and artistic representations. The comparison also demonstrates that his images were powerful constructions that were more successful in reflecting a narrative of glorious conquest than was possible through cartography. This paper offers a critical examination of Bagetti's representations of Napoleon's northern Italian campaign, which he sketched and painted between 1802 and 1809. Bagetti's paintings were neither pacifist nor an expression of Piedmontese patriotism but instead were inspired by, and constructed according to, a narrative about the conquest that reflected the views of the French authorities. The narrative found expression in formal written instructions from the central cartographical office in the Dépôt de la guerre, Paris, in verbal and written instructions from Bagetti's immediate superior, Jean François Martinel, and in letters personally addressed to Bagetti from the officer commanding the Dépôt. It is clear from a careful reading of the correspondence and from a comparison of Bagetti's paintings with both the present landscape and maps made at the time that Bagetti's disputes with his supervisors revolved around protecting his artistic integrity and reputation rather than resisting the authority of a foreign regime. /// Une comparaison entre les dessins, aquarelles, peintures et gravures de paysages de Giuseppe Bagetti avec des cartes de son temps et les paysages actuels révèle que dans la création des paysages de Bagetti le récit ne joue pas le même rôle que dans les représentations cartographiques et artistiques.

Abstract: La mayoría de las tradiciones religiosas posee en común un canon conformado por un texto o grupo de textos a los que se les concede toda la autoridad. Sin embargo, toda doctrina canónica es sujeto de exégesis, o interpretación, que presenta un riesgo, pues no reproduce de manera íntegra la ortodoxia recibida. En este ensayo se exploran dos casos de interpretaciones divergentes en las tradiciones de la India del s. II y la Inglaterra en vísperas del romanticismo. Los textos son la Tripurã-tãpinī-upanisad, de autor anónimo, y TheMarriage of Heaven and Hell, del poeta William Blake. A lo largo de este artículo el autor argumenta que ambos, en su momento, comprendieron tentativas por realizar una relectura de unos cánones religiosos que, más que rechazar abruptamente nociones o términos manejados por una tradición teológica, fueron resignificados bajo el concepto doctrinario de una energía que debe ponerse en acción. Así, un punto en común en los dos textos es que se acepta el mundo material y se le vincula con el espiritual, en vez de condenarlo. /// A large majority of religious traditions share the commonality of possessing a canon made up of a text, or a set of texts, from which all authority is said to emanate. However, canonical doctrines are the constant subjects of ex-egesis, or interpretaron, which presents a risk, given that these forms of rereading do not tend to faithfully reproduce received orthodoxy. The ob-ject of this text is to explore two exemplars of divergent interpretations within the very different canonical traditions of India in the second century AD and England at the outset of the Romantic movement of the nineteenth century. The chosen works are Trípurã-tãpinī-upanisad, which was written by an anonymous author, and William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. Throughout this article the author maintains that both texts repre-sented important rereadings of established religious canons; however, rathern than presenting an abrupt rejection of ~<br>

Abstract: L'article examine les conceptions de Foucault concernant l'histoire de la vérité, ainsi que les rapports entre la volonté de savoir, la volonté de vérité et les formes du pouvoir. Il rappelle comment les notions nietzschéennes de volonté de vérité et de volonté de puissance font place dans son oeuvre à la volonté de savoir comme instrument des rapports de domination. On examine ensuite comment la notion d'autorité, entendue à la fois au sens institutionnel et au sens discursif, peut permettre une sociologisation des approches traditionnelles de la vérité, élaborées par les philosophes. Comment la visée de vérité du discours s'est-elle combinée historiquement avec la volonté de savoir des institutions ? Y a-t-il différents régimes de vérité, liés à des modalités de discours différentes, mais aussi à des formes d'autorité institutionnelle ? Est-il possible de construire une généalogie des figures de l'autorité discursive ? The paper examines Foucaultian views about the history of truth, as well as the relationships between the will to truth and the different forms of power. It reminds how Nietzsche's conceptions about the will to truth and the will to power are replaced in Foucault's work by the will to truth as a means of power relationships. The paper looks furthermore at the possibility of using the notion of authority, understood both in the institutional and in the discursive sense, as a tool for a sociologization of traditional approaches to truth, constructed by philosophers. How did the pursuit of truth historically combine with the will to knowledge belonging to the institutions ? Are there different regimes of truth, tied to different discursive modalities, as well as to institutional forms of authority ? Is it possible to construct a genealogy of figures of discursive authority ?<br>

Author(s): Simas-Almeida Leonor<br>
Abstract: Since its first publication, A Costa dos Murmúrios has attracted the critics' attention to the paradox of the explicit denial of its own authority over the historical facts that are part of the narration and its implicit, if qualified, affirmation of the same authority. This article also focuses on the sort of subliminal tension but from the angle of the literary construction of emotions, rather than examining either the poetics of historiographic metafiction or the role of memory in the narration of the past. Analyzing various aspects of A Costa dos Murmúrios (such as the predominant points of view, the structure of the narrative, the disintegration of the characters' identities, the emotional impact of a few vivid scences, the personalization of national events), a case is made for reading this novel as an intimate chronicle of historical facts.<br>

Abstract: This article analyzes the strategies by which the narrator of Caesar's Bellum Civile constructs his authority and promotes his version of the civil war. Despite being generally omnipresent, omniscient and un-intrusive, the narrator can abandon his covert position and all-encompassing knowledge and use multiple devices to guide the readers' perception of salient events. Switches of focalization, inferred motivation, presentation through negation and intratextual echoes color the narrative of key episodes, such as the negotiations of peace with Pompey in Book 1 and the descriptions of the battles at Dyrrachium and Pharsalus.<br>

Abstract: As oral historians, we devote a great deal of time to painstakingly designing our projects, cognizant of the fact that our research requires us to interact with human beings in often intimate ways. For this same reason, though, our careful methodology and meticulously designed projects are constantly being tested. This article is a reflection on some of the ethical and methodological challenges that the authors faced during their life story interviews with Holocaust survivors in Montreal, Canada. In particular, it explores three major themes: the elaborate process of learning to "share authority" and build trust with interviewees; the limitations of "deep listening" and their implications; and the struggle to deal with contentious politics, such as perceived racism, that emerged out of some interviews. Reflection on these methodological and ethical challenges not only opens up a wider and important discussion among researchers about how practice relates to theory but also teaches us about our interviewees. For example, what does an interviewee's refusal to engage deeply about his or her past tell us about how they formed their identity in the aftermath of mass violence? Challenges, such as this one, are part of the story. They shed light on questions of narrative formation, the identity politics that result from survival, and how individual memory interacts with dominant narratives about atrocity. They force us to recognize that both our interviewees—and ourselves—are human beings, and not just collections of stories.<br>

Abstract: Reconsidering previous exchanges between the économie des conventions (EC) and historical research, the article puts right different prejudices against EC and shows grounds for going deeper into cooperation. The first part is dedicated to the genesis and dynamics of conventions, in an open perspective on the ways value is placed on forms coordinating with others, the environment and oneself. Rather than looking for abstracts values, the article suggests to find the basis for repertoires of evaluation in empowering dependencies between human beings and their environment. This approach is favorable to a dialogue with historians on the domain of work identity, occupations and products or services. The second part deals with the politics of convention in a long-term perspective on power, authority and protest. Considering powers issuing from coordinative forms, it is claimed that this view helps to situate in a comparative and historical perspective nation-states among a variety of authorities which govern - possibly transnationally - through reduced conventions.<br>

Abstract: In the context of globalization, cultural anthropology gained a new momentum by highlighting the self-conscious persistence of cultural differences. Against the background of an ever increasing intensity of societal and economic entanglements, the vital claim of cultural differences must be a reflexive process associated with the idea that one's own culture is creative and adaptive to innovations. Anthropologists have defined a set of tools in order to describe these processes of cultural changes. These tools have the names of hybridization, creolization and domestication, but, in particular also of cultural appropriation. Historically cultural appropriation was mainly relevant in contexts of unequal power relations. Appropriation thereby became a strategy of the powerless, who used appropriation in order to undermine the structures defined by the powerful. Cultural appropriation can also be practised through mimesis, and thereby negates the authority of powerful actors. Cultural appropriation requires moments of negotiations and does not aim at definitive results, but merely at the transgression of boundaries. Well defined fields of cultural appropriation within anthropology are media studies and consumption. Empirical approaches to a more detailed documentation of appropriation can be the following: (1) Naming, (2) Contextualization, (3) Incorporation and (4) material transformation.<br>

Abstract: In spite of the Reformed tradition's profound respect for the bible as the living Word of God, it has often tolerated an uncritical stance on cultural-historical biases both within the bible and during its history of interpretation. Consequently, dynamic processes of interpretation and reinterpretation within these documents have often been neglected as important hermeneutic keys for later audiences. Amidst many opportunities posed by postmodern thinking, and by voices from feminist, womanist and other contextual theologies, the Reformed tradition remains particularly challenged to account for its identity and ethos in terms of its primary theological orientation and God images. The essay aims at providing a possible theological-rhetorical path towards reopening the transformative potential of two texts that are life-inhibiting for many people today, namely 1 Cor 14:33-40 and Eph 5:21-6:9. Both are surrounded by references to the resurrection of Jesus Christ, with the implied rhetorical effect that the church may be edified and unified in love. However, through the history of interpretation of these texts, the functioning of the body of Christ was often inhibited while church leadership was distorted. The essay therefore centers biblical "authority" - as ultimate test for the relevance and lifegiving potential of the Reformed tradition - within the multidimensional (albeit patriarchal) nature of these texts, particularly within their soteriological perspectives on God and humanity. The theological framework of these texts is thus emphasised as a visionary strategy towards the liberation and healing of creation.<br>

Abstract: The tradition-historical method emerged at the turn of the century. It is used to understand biblical texts not only as products of the final author or redactor, but as documents which evolved over a period of time within a particular society. Consequently it grapples with the problems of how such texts refers to historical events, how one relates individual and collective religious experience and what authority these texts have in the lives of Christians today. Luke 12:35-48 is used to investigate the application of these ideas to practical exegesis.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the complicated workings of Japan's mnemonic praxis in its establishment of moral authority. The atomic bombing of Hiroshima was a decisive moment inaugurating Japan as the torch-bearer of pacifism. Given Japan's ideational multiplicity as the victim and the victimizer, its pacifist ideology needs further examinations in conceptual and empirical manifestations. This research situates the ambivalent amnesia and political compromises demonstrated during the renovation project of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum from 1985 until 1994. As for a nation yet to achieve meaningful reconciliation over the past with Asian neighbors, the political divide opens room for utilitarian considerations in its pacifist discourse. The Hiroshima experience suggests that Japan's pacifism can be a problematic representation given its selective mnemonic praxis and situational ethics. This paper argues that Japanese pacifism should be redefined as 'pacifist movement.' Pacifism is foundational ethics, whereas pacifist movement accommodates political contextualization.<br>

Abstract: Après avoir étudié les réponses des États et des systèmes politico-administratifs à l'épidémie de sida, sociologues et politistes s'intéressent depuis quelques années à la dimension politique de la lutte contre le sida et notamment à la mise en cause, par le mouvement associatif dans l'espace public, des pouvoirs constitués, politiques, mais aussi biomédicaux. Une analyse critique de ces travaux, qui s'inscrivent dans des traditions méthologiques et épistémologiques différentes, permet de soulever un certain nombre d'enjeux concernant à la fois les dispositifs de lutte contre le sida eux-mêmes (contribution du monde associatif à la constitution de l'espace de lutte contre le sida, dans son versant politique comme dans son versant biomédical), les modalités empiriques de la saisie de ces dispositifs (mobilisation et traitement des sources) et les avancées conceptuelles nourries par l'enquête sociologique. Now that the States' political and administrative responses to AIDS have been thoroughly studied, social and political scientists have for some years focused on the political dimension of fighting the AIDS epidemic. Thus, particular attention is being drawn on the questioning - by organizations - of political and biomedicai established authority. The article provides a critical analysis of these works all set in different methodological and epistemological backgrounds. This analysis reveals a number of concerns connected to this issue : first, the role of organizations and their impact on fighting AIDS strategies - both political and biomedicai ; then, the empiric modes of retrieving information - mobilizing and managing sources ; last, the conceptual developments generated by sociological investigation.<br>

Abstract: In Britain, as in France, 'mainstream' anthropologists were hesitant to acknowledge studies within their own country as proper subjects for anthropological enquiry. British social anthropology defined itself as the study of 'other cultures' and became entrenched in a tradition in which Otherness was confused with manifest difference. This naivete, elevated into a scientific principle, precluded the recognition of 'self as anything other than a scientific instrument; but also led to the invention of a generalisable Other, and thereby ignored the complexity of variation within the cultures it studied. By the same token, it blinded anthropologists to heterogeneity within their 'own' local cultures as well, and was finally changed only by a series of related paradigm leaps. Our understanding of culture changed from a set of prescriptive influences which integrated society, to a ragged and non-systemic array of interpretive tools which aggregated society. Consequent upon this change, symbols were acknowledged as vehicles of expression and of negotiable meaning rather than as having stipulated and invariant referents. The demise of modernist theories liberated anthropology from its scientific illusions and positivistic pretensions, enabling it to acknowledge the personal and speculative nature of the enterprise. This admission of the subjective, of the anthropologist's self, was necessary in order to see Otherness as inhering in 'person' rather than in an abstraction such as 'culture' and, therefore, to be enabled to recognise diversity within cultures rather than merely between them. This enhanced perception of internal heterogeneity clearly places the Self of the anthropologist at the centre of the stage and has led to the contemporary debates about the nature of ethnographic writing and the status of ethnographic 'authority'. It has also had obvious consequences for anthropological research, including the raising anew of the relationship of individual to society; and t~<br>

Abstract: Serge Lifar built his career during the 1930s, a decade crucial to understanding his 'années noires'-or 'black years', as the French historian Henry Rousso called the period of the German occupation of Paris (1940—1944). Lifar's powerful and respected position at the Paris Opéra, the social connections he had built and maintained and the psychological impact of exile: all these elements help clarify Lifar's accommodating attitude towards the German occupants of his adopted city. During the 1930s Lifar came to be accepted in French intellectual society as the 'heir' of Serge Diaghilev. Through his publications he made a powerful contribution to the process by which Diaghilev's Ballets Russes assumed its paramount position in the development of modern ballet, a process set in motion by the impresario himself. Lifar played this role chiefly in France. In the English-speaking world, where relatively few of his books appeared in translation, other writers served to canonise the Diaghilev endeavour, albeit for somewhat different ends. A list of Lifar's publications in Russian and other languages (French above all) displays the growing influence of his actions and authority, the power of his connections (inherited primarily from Diaghilev), and his relentless will to overcome the problems of emigration as he secured not only success as a dancer and choreograph but also a public reputation as an intellectual. The recent discovery of new evidence has led to the identification of the respected Pushkin authority Modeste Hofmann as the writer whose unacknowledged work enabled Lifar to establish himself as an historian. This evidence, provided by Hofmann's grandsons André and Vladimir Hofmann, raises serious questions about the authority of Lifar's books. An interplay of subjective relationships is woven into the texture of these narratives in which survival and ambition, a paternal attitude and filial respect, exist in constant tension. Neither the making of these books nor the~<br>

Abstract: The term intellectuals(s) has been in use for scarcely more than one century. What is its definition? What conditions of possibility govern the emergence of the Modern intellectual? How many of these conditions can be traced to the past? The typological approach used here sets the origin of the intellectual's role and status in the new paradigm of power established in Carolingian times (781-804), which displayed a peculiar axiom: the idea that all Power is intrinsically divisible. This view was already five centuriesold when Petrarch claimed the autonomous position of cultural critic—not the Modern intellectual's status, but some of his authority, though on different grounds.<br>

Abstract: The radical Chinese intellectual Li Zhi (1527-1602) is known for his habit of opposing traditional interpretations of canonical texts. Juxtaposing Li Zhi's irreverent strategies of reading and writing with those of his French contemporary, the essayist Michel de Montaigne (1533-1592), this paper casts both writers as responding to analogous social and economic pressures characteristic of the developing early modern world. Unlike earlier generations, who sought to recapture authorial intentions, readers in this era increasingly took upon themselves the authority to impose meaning subjectively upon texts. And the books they composed, in turn, provoked impassioned debate among readers.<br>

Abstract: Penelope Fitzgerald's first novel The Golden Child is often considered apart from her subsequent novels, mainly because it is detective fiction. Though her uncle, Father Ronald Knox, was a well-respected master of this genre, Fitzgerald came to it with certain misgivings, which were especially pronounced when she considered its limitations against the achievements of modern fiction. However, those elements of the detective genre that may be found in The Golden Child did, along with the underlying interest in the question of authority, carry forward into her own more modern achievements in the novel.<br>

Abstract: Dans la Vie d'Apollonios de Tyane, Philostrate construit, au moment de la rencontre entre son protagoniste et Iarchas, le chef des brahmanes, un dialogue dans lequel autorité et charisme sont essentiels. Cette mise en scène l'autorise ensuite à produire un discours concernant la domination romaine et ses représentants, à destination des Grecs comme des Romains. La question du destinataire permet de mettre en lumière certains des enjeux les plus fondamentaux de l'œuvre du sophiste. Elle montre de quelle manière Philostrate interroge les Hellènes sur leurs choix de vie et leur identité dans le monde gréco-romain du début du IIIe siècle. In the Life of Appolonios of Tyana, Philostratos builds up, when his protagonist meets larchas, the chief of the Brahmins, a dialogue in which authority and charisma are essential. That staging allows him to produce a speech concerning Roman sway an dits representatives, addressing Greeks and Romans alike. The question of addressee enables him to highlight some of the more fundamental point at stake in the sophist's work. It shows in what way Philostratos questions the Greeks about their life choices and their identity in the Greco-Roman worlf at the beginning of the IIIrd century.<br>

Author(s): O'SULLIVAN MICHAEL<br>
Abstract: Animal experience is central to the fiction of J.M. Coetzee and Franz Kafka. In light of new approaches to animal awareness in science and philosophy, this essay investigates how Coetzee's deliberations on the animal, initially by way of Kafka, extend the range of narrative authority and reappraise human empathy.<br>

Article Title: 'Not to be riten': The Mormon Temple Rite as Oral Canon<br>
Publisher: Department of Religious Studies, University of Pittsburgh<br>
Issue: i40184391<br>
Date: 7 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: The manner in which the LDS Church administers its temple rite constitutes a strategic use of the conventions of an oral tradition in a modern, literate society. Three effects of this strategy are considered. First, refusing to make a text of the rite available and insisting that its specific content not be revealed or otherwise subjected to discursive thought sustains the rite's canonical authority as immutable truth, notwithstanding its periodic mutation. Secondly, the conventions of oral tradition structure the relationships created by the ritual and constitute a principal means by which the Church's historic separatism is maintained. Finally, these conventions when applied to the temple rite maximize ritual's capacity to adapt the canon to the needs of successive generations of the faithful while minimizing skepticism and schism.<br>

Abstract: Rompant avec la quasi-unanimité de la philosophie occidentale, de Platon à Marx, laquelle a conçu le pouvoir en termes de pouvoir-sur, de domination de l'homme sur l'homme, H. A. propose de le penser autrement, comme expression de l'aptitude d'un groupe à agir en condition de pluralité de façon concertée, et donc comme pouvoir-en-commun. L'A. différencie soigneusement le pouvoir, qui trouve en lui-même sa propre fin, d'avec la violence, d'ordre instrumental, qui n'est jamais légitime, et d'avec l'autorité, qui présuppose la reconnaissance inconditionnelle et le respect. Elle se demande finalement si tout pouvoir peut se passer du facteur de durabilité qu'est l'autorité d'une fondation. In breaking with the near unanimity of Western Philosophy which, from Plato to Marx, had conceived of power in terms of "power over," of a domination of humans over humans, H. A. proposes instead to think of power as an expression of a group's aptitude to act in a pluralistic environment and in concert, thus as power in common. The A. takes care to distinguish power as an end in itself from violence of an instrumental order which is never legitimate, and from Authority which presupposes unconditional recognition and respect, wondering in the end if all power can do without the durability factor that is the authority of a foundation<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219736<br>
Date: 3 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Bogel Dianne F.<br>
Abstract: Little Dorrit is both a narrative about authority and an examination of the authority of narrative. The novel links vocation with sonhood and storytelling with fatherhood and self-generation. Little Dorrit, however, tells a double story, of a daughter as well as of a son. If the son's story relates the search to replace the father and to discover paternal authority, the daughter's story details the horrors and consolations of incestuous desire and generational collapse. Storytelling that seeks the father as origin reveals paternal deception and inauthenticity; incestuous structures of desire attempt to collapse genealogy on the hero and heroine, making paternal origin unknowable and creating an overdetermined narrative ending. Dickens' double story, then, identifies yet questions genealogy and the patriarchal family as metaphors for narrative structure.<br>

Publisher: American Oriental Society<br>
Issue: i225333<br>
Date: 12 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): Feenberg Sheldon<br>
Abstract: The long-held view concerning the absence of a historical understanding in traditional India merits reconsideration on the basis of recent scholarship on the notion of history as such, the rhetorical foundations of historiography, the nature of narrativity, the character of historiography in classical antiquity, and the actual historical documents that are available from premodern India. Yet the absence of a historical-referential dimension of Sanskrit discourse remains a serious problem, one that Mīmāṃsā views on the referential sphere of the Veda may help us to understand. Mīmāṃsā makes the authority of the Veda dependent on its timelessness, and thus must empty the Veda of its historical referentiality. Since learned discourse (śāstra) in general is subject to a process of "vedicization," it adopts the Veda's putative ahistoricality; and the same set of concerns comes to inform the understanding of the genre itihāsa ("history") and the interpretation of itihāsa texts. History, consequently, seems not so much to be unknown in Sanskritic India as to be denied.<br>

Abstract: The relationships among texts, readers, and moral community are explored in order to understand the dissonance and interplay of personal and textual authority in local Islamic practice (Sunni, Shaf'i branch) among Malagasy-speaking villagers of Mayotte (Comoro Islands, East Africa). A political economy of knowledge approach is linked to an analysis of recitation as a ritual activity in which illocutionary force exceeds referential meaning. The discussion has relevance for the understanding of the relationship between religious knowledge, power, and action in Islamic societies as well as of the interface between the oral and the written more generally.

Author(s): Woolard Webb<br>
Abstract: Sumbanese descriptions of the "traditional house" as a microcosm and emblem of local identity are neither unproblematic expressions of a cultural totality nor simply objectifications imposed by ethnography or modernity. One way the house is able to serve as a discursive object reflects, in part, specifically Sumbanese models of action and beliefs about language as refracted in changing historical circumstances. In ritual, speakers seek to engage and elicit responses from powerful others, whereas current religious and political developments reframe ritual words as means of describing a cultural world. Both sets of practices draw on the authority of "entextualized" language but interpret it in different ways. Emerging representations of cultural meaning are shaped by long-standing speech genres and by recent social and cultural transformations, mediated by shifting language ideologies.

Abstract: Violent appropriation of sovereignty and the articulation of the experience of oppression are also at issue in M. NourbeSe Philip's
         She Tries Her Tongue, Her Silence Softly Breaks. Philip, a Canadian poet born in Moriah, Trinidad and Tobago, addresses the silencing and sexual assault of women in conjunction with colonial history in the Americas. The Ovidian figure of Philomela, who was raped and had her tongue torn out so that she could not relate what had happened to her, is central toShe Tries Her Tongue. Persephone's search for Ceres is another major theme. Philip foregrounds the problem of “the mother tongue” as she reworks Ovidian myths with excerpts from invented didactic texts (such as language tests, which are akin to those of Theresa Hak Kyung Cha'sDicteeor Myung-Mi Kim'sCommons, both of which also problematize language acquisition as an engine of hegemony). Some invented texts offer recommendations for the treatment of slaves: “Edict II: Every slave caught speaking his native language shall be severely punished. Where necessary, removal of the tongue is recommended. The offending organ, when removed, should be hung on high in a central place, so that all may see and tremble” (“Discourse on the Logic of Language”).
               Philip destabilizes the notion of a linguistically unified Caribbean history by mixing genres and weaving the demotic with Latin citations, as McMorris notes: “It's difficult to tell at first glance whether or not the poet has invented her ‘quoted’ texts, and this keeps things unsettled, shadowy, and undecided. In the later poems of the book, where the imitation of other genres takes place, we hover between belief and doubt, unable without a quantity of research to separate the fabrication from the real. It's as if Philip wants to contaminate the library of Western disciplines—founded in the Latin language—by destroying our confidence in the truth of its texts.”125

Abstract: In
         Survival in Auschwitz, Levi recounts how the inmates of the camps used the word “Muselmann” to designate those so debilitated by hunger and sickness that they resembled the living dead more than human beings.
               Giorgio Agamben describes them as the body “of the overcomatose person and the neomort attached to life-support systems today” (156). The existence of nearly every so-called Muselmann ended in the gas chamber. For Agamben, even though those who were eventually led to the gas chambers were the perfect witnesses of the evils of the Holocaust, they cannot bear witness because they took their experience to the grave. Nevertheless, Agamben argues that a life that had become “bare, unassignable and unwitnessable” is not necessarily condemned to silence (156–57). However, the only way it can speak is through the survivor, through the witness, whose authority “consists in his capacity to speak solely in the name of an incapacity to speak—that is, in his or her being a subject” (158). In light of Agamben's explanation, we understand that Primo Levi, who barely survived extermination, speaks not just for himself but also on behalf of all who did not survive. Testimony consists of any action taken by the survivor of violence to ensure that the Muselmann is not forgotten. Agamben argues that “it is because there is testimony only where there is an impossibility of speaking, because there is a witness only where there has been desubjectification, that the2
            Muselmannis the complete witness and that the survivor and theMuselmanncannot be split apart” (158).<br>

Abstract: Is philosophy, perhaps all philosophy, ultimately founded on the absolute certainty of death, that we are all, in one way or another, sentenced to death? Derrida demonstrates philosophy's bind to death and the death penality. Yet, in his last seminar, while powerfully calling into question the meaning of death and who can die, Derrida also appeals to the fact that every living being dies as perhaps the ultimate ethical bind. Has death, then, as the absolute and only equalizer, replaced the absolute authority of God, whether Kant's rational one or Levinas's Other one? The death penalty as executed in this country makes clear that both ethics and politics demand that we think through our own death drive rather than bank on the fantasy of equality through death, the fantasy of instant death, or the fantasy of death as the final and absolute resting place. To do so covers over the differences between deaths and death penalties—to be blunt, between so many ways of dying and so many ways of being executed, assassinated, or killed.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: I am not the first to give a rhetorical reading to Mannheim. Paul Ricoeur, in
         Lectures on Ideology and Utopia, also offers a reinterpretation of Mannheim's concept that makes it seem part of rhetorical theory. For Ricoeur, the function of utopia is criticism of systems of authority rather than change itself. Ideology, then, would function to legitimize systems of authority, and utopia would function to challenge systems of authority. At its best, utopia could offer possibilities for the future, but at its worst it would be the unrealizable vision, merely an escape from reality into illusion or fantasy.
               Ricoeur adds a dimension that is particularly attractive to the rhetorician: the screen of symbolic reality rather than only what is materially real and unmediated. This addition would seem to confirm that Ricoeur sees utopia as a type of rhetoric. In particular, his concept of utopia is relevant to the interpretive function of rhetorical theory. The critic cannot exist outside of historical progress (which involves ideology), but to engage in criticism at all one must presume what is utopian—the viewpoint of what is ideal for humankind.22
            
               Mannheim also makes clear in23
            Ideology and Utopiathat utopia can only be seen as an interpretation of historical events. This is because he sees knowledge as partial and dependent on the social location of the observer—a condition that his idea of utopia shares with contemporary understandings of the rhetorical situation (the social and temporal locations of the rhetor and the audience).<br>

Abstract: Ruth Levitas has suggested that “in the move beyond modernism, the Utopian method needs to be seen as provisional … dialogic … and … reflexive.”
         
               Joyce himself makes this move: his work does not engage in the theoretical absolutism of so much classical modernism—an absolute faith in the transcendental authority of theoretical ideals that so often led toward a political fundamentalism of the Left or of the Right. By contrast, Joyce's writing operates from a heteroglossic perspective that parallels Bakhtin and preempts postmodernist pluralism. Unlike Orwell or Huxley, Joyce demonstrates that a democratic literary response to absolutist Utopianism need not take the form of a cautionary dystopianism. Joyce instead offers an affirmatory and comedic set of possibilities.167<br>
