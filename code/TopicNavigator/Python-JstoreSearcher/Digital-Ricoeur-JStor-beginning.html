  Author(s) Leitão Henrique<br>
  Abstract: In the summer of 1581, Philippe de Monte (1521–1603), the chapel-master of Emperor Rudolf ii (r.1576–1612) of Habsburg, published his first book of spiritual madrigals (
                  Il primo libro de’ madrigali spirituali a cinque voci) in Venice. He dedicated it to the newly elected superior general of the Society of Jesus, Claudio Acquaviva (1543–1615), and in the dedicatory letter—printed, as was customary, at the beginning of each partbook—he explained why. “When the news came that Your Reverend Fatherhood had been elected with broad consensus Superior-General of your most holy order, it seemed to me, that, in<br>

  Abstract: Privatization promised a policy revolution born in the legitimating discourses of Social Security. In this spirit, advocates of privatization, who made their case through multiple congressional hearings beginning in earnest in the mid-1990s, pressed the logic of the rights claims asserted by the original supporters of Social Security. They, too, saw Social Security benefits as a right secured by a worker’s contributions, but advocates rebuked government control of these contributions as usurping the title to an individual’s property. Since rights rested properly with their bearers, any break in this connection by another party without the full consent of the rights<br>

  Book Title: Enigmas of Sacrifice-A Critique of Joseph M. Plunkett and the Dublin Insurrection of 1916<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Cormack W. J. Mc<br>
  Abstract: Enigmas of Sacrifice: A Critique of Joseph M. Plunkett and the Dublin Insurrection of 1916is the first critical study of the religious poet and militarist Joseph M. Plunkett, who was executed with the other leaders of the Dublin insurrection of 1916. Through Plunkett the author gains access to areas of nationalist thought that were more often assumed or repressed than publicly formulated.In this eye-opening book, W. J. Mc Cormack explores and analyzes Plunkett's brief life, work, and influence, beginning with his wealthy but dysfunctional family, irregular Jesuit education, and self-canceling sexuality. Mc Cormack continues through Plunkett's active phase when amateur theatricals and a magazine editorship brought him into the emergent neonationalist discourse of early twentieth-century Ireland. Finally, the author arrives at Holy Week 1916, when Plunkett masterminded the forgery of official documentation in order to provoke and justify the insurrection he planned. Mc Cormack analyzes Plunkett's significant texts and provides context through critical perspectives on his milieu.Enigmas of Sacrificeis unique in its effort to understand a major figure of Irish nationalism in terms that reach beyond political identity.<br>

  Abstract: Simone Weil’s

Compatriots, Weil and Girard each retell the long story of French history from the Middle Ages, beginning in medias res and dwelling upon many of the same modern turning points—1789, 1815, 1914, 1940. Girard explicitly links his own childhood memories of the war years with the Free French radio broadcasts from London and the names of Maurice<br>

  Abstract: How can intimacy become a subject for critical reflection?¹ Intimacy is typically understood to focus on emotions of love and supportive family bonds. But if family life is the beginning point for reflection on intimacy, it is not the only terrain we can explore in an effort to understand it. Helpfully, Julia Kristeva both broadens and narrows the field for critical reflection on intimacy. She broadens it when she links intimacy to art, religion, and psychoanalysis and cites the unique capacity of these forms of cultural expression to
                  protect the singularity of human life.² Kristeva narrows the context for critical<br>

  Abstract: I address in this book the relationship between the mass media and Christian ʺtribesʺ in America. At its core this relationship is a dynamic tension between civil generality, on the one hand, and a sectarian particularity, on the other. The Christian metanarrative of transcendence assumes a theistic perspective where God acts in real human history; this God-oriented view of human affairs is never fully in accord with the mainstream mediaʹs own subnarratives of immanence, which morally assume that human action is the beginning and end of history.

  Book Title: Symposium of the Whole-A Range of Discourse Toward an Ethnopoetics<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Rothenberg Diane<br>
  Abstract: Symposium of the Wholetraces a discourse on poetry and culture that has profoundly influenced the art of our time, with precedents going back two centuries and more. Beginning with a reassertion of the complexity of poetry among peoples long labeled "primitive" and "savage," many recent poets have sought to base a new poetics over the fullest range of human cultures. The attempt to define an ethnopoetics has been significantly connected with the most experimental and future-directed side of Romantic and modern poetry, both in the Western world and, increasingly, outside it. As a visionary poetics and as a politics, this complex redefinition of cultural and intellectual values has involved a rarely acknowledged collaboration between poets and scholars, who together have challenged the narrow view of literature that has excluded so many traditions.In this gathering, the Rothenbergs follow the idea of an ethnopoetics from predecessors such as Vico, Blake, Thoreau, and Tzara to more recent essays and manifestos by poets and social thinkers such as Olson, Eliade, Snyder, Turner, and Baraka. The themes range widely, from the divergence of oral and written cultures to the shaman as proto-poet and the reemergence of suppressed and rejected forms and images: the goddess, the trickster, and the "human universe." The book's three ethnographic sections demonstrate how various poetries are structured and composed, how they reflect meaning and worldview, and how they are performed in cultures where all art may be thought of as art-in-motion.Among the poetries discussed are the language of magic; West African drum language and poetry; the Huichol Indian language of reversals; chance operations in African divination poetry; picture-writings and action-writings from Australia and Africa; and American Indian sacred-clown dramas and traditional trickster narratives. The cumulative effect is a new reading of the poetic past and present-in the editors' words, "a changed paradigm of what~<br>

  Abstract: As a major anthropological linguist, Hymesʹs early and ongoing contribution to an ethnopoetics has been a practical ʺstructuralismʺ that attempts to examine and represent ʺways in which narratives [or, as here, songs] are organizations of linguistic meansʺ—a work he has pursued not by ʺleaping to universalsʺ but by ʺthe development of theories adequate and specific to each tradition.ʺ Beginning with the present essay—a criticism and virtual ʺdeconstructionʺ of earlier translation work—Hymes later focused on the performative side of traditional oral poetry (i.e., on its ʺrealization in performanceʺ) in ways akin to the proposals and practice of Dennis<br>

  Book Title: Alef, Mem, Tau-Kabbalistic Musings on Time, Truth, and Death<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfson Elliot R.<br>
  Abstract: This highly original, provocative, and poetic work explores the nexus of time, truth, and death in the symbolic world of medieval kabbalah. Demonstrating that the historical and theoretical relationship between kabbalah and western philosophy is far more intimate and extensive than any previous scholar has ever suggested, Elliot R. Wolfson draws an extraordinary range of thinkers such as Frederic Jameson, Martin Heidegger, Franz Rosenzweig, William Blake, Julia Kristeva, Friedrich Schelling, and a host of kabbalistic figures into deep conversation with one another.
      Alef, Mem, Taualso discusses Islamic mysticism and Buddhist thought in relation to the Jewish esoteric tradition as it opens the possibility of a temporal triumph of temporality and the conquering of time through time. The framework for Wolfson's examination is the rabbinic teaching that the wordemet,"truth," comprises the first, middle, and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet,alef, mem,andtau,which serve, in turn, as semiotic signposts for the three tenses of time-past, present, and future. By heeding the letters ofemetwe discern the truth of time manifestly concealed in the time of truth, the beginning that cannot begin if it is to be the beginning, the middle that re/marks the place of origin and destiny, and the end that is the figuration of the impossible disclosing the impossibility of figuration, the finitude of death that facilitates the possibility of rebirth. The time of death does not mark the death of time, but time immortal, the moment of truth that bestows on the truth of the moment an endless beginning of a beginningless end, the truth of death encountered incessantly in retracing steps of time yet to be taken-between, before, beyond.<br>

These threshold crossings involve both poetic and religious issues, nor can the two ever be far apart for Dante. The canto, which introduces a major classical poet and discusses the influence of Virgil’s poetry, is also the first in which we meet a soul fully cleansed of sin and ready to ascend to Paradise.

  Abstract: Since the end of the colonial era, many of the territories where anthropologists have worked have been witness to an increasingly visible “humanitarian presence.” The massive army of volunteer workers, international experts, local staff, and soldiers associated with humanitarian intervention has had a remarkable impact on local cultural landscapes. Despite the increasing proliferation of these zones of humanitarian and military intervention, anthropologists are only beginning to examine the theoretical and practical consequences of these new forms of intervention. Intervention studies present a perilous but necessary challenge to the anthropological community. They force us to consider both new sites of intervention<br>

  Book Title: The Language of the Gods in the World of Men-Sanskrit, Culture, and Power in Premodern India<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Pollock Sheldon<br>
  Abstract: In this work of impressive scholarship, Sheldon Pollock explores the remarkable rise and fall of Sanskrit, India's ancient language, as a vehicle of poetry and polity. He traces the two great moments of its transformation: the first around the beginning of the Common Era, when Sanskrit, long a sacred language, was reinvented as a code for literary and political expression, the start of an amazing career that saw Sanskrit literary culture spread from Afghanistan to Java. The second moment occurred around the beginning of the second millennium, when local speech forms challenged and eventually replaced Sanskrit in both the literary and political arenas. Drawing striking parallels, chronologically as well as structurally, with the rise of Latin literature and the Roman empire, and with the new vernacular literatures and nation-states of late-medieval Europe,
      The Language of the Gods in the World of Menasks whether these very different histories challenge current theories of culture and power and suggest new possibilities for practice.<br>

Most of the doctrines of rebirth discussed earlier have both historical and contemporary relevance, but for Greece one has no choice but to deal exclusively with the historical traditions, beginning with the figure most associated with rebirth doctrines, Pythagoras. Pythagoras, like similar figures in religious history, is simultaneously a historical and mythic persona such that it makes little sense to differentiate the two. Myth

  Book Title: Gadamer’s Repercussions-Reconsidering Philosophical Hermeneutics<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Krajewski Bruce<br>
  Abstract: Certainly one of the key German philosophers of the twentieth century, Hans-Georg Gadamer also influenced the study of literature, art, music, sacred and legal texts, and medicine. Indeed, while much attention has been focused on Gadamer's writings about ancient Greek and modern German philosophy, the relevance of his work for other disciplines is only now beginning to be properly considered and understood. In an effort to address this slant, this volume brings together many prominent scholars to assess, re-evaluate, and question Hans-Georg Gadamer's works, as well as his place in intellectual history. The book includes a recent essay by Gadamer on "the task of hermeneutics," as well as essays by distinguished contributors including Jürgen Habermas, Richard Rorty, Gerald Bruns, Georgia Warnke, and many others. The contributors situate Gadamer's views in surprising ways and show that his writings speak to a range of contemporary debates—from constitutional questions to issues of modern art. A controversial final section attempts to uncover and clarify Gadamer's history in relation to National Socialism. More an investigation and questioning than a celebration of this venerable and profoundly influential philosopher, this collection will become a catalyst for any future rethinking of philosophical hermeneutics, as well as a significant starting place for rereading and reviewing Hans-Georg Gadamer.<br>

  Abstract: The tradition of mystical allegorical commentary on Homer has survived in substantial form only in the writings of the Neoplatonists, but evidence from the first two and a half centuries of the Christian era—before the great synthesis of Plotinus, which marks the beginning of Neoplatonism proper—indicates that this period was a crucial one in the development of that tradition. Félix Buffière’s insistence on the second century as the time of the birth of mystical allegory needs qualification, as the discussion of the role of the Pythagoreans has suggested, but this does not alter the fact that Numenius and<br>

  Author(s): Renard John<br>
  Abstract: One of the critical issues in interreligious relations today is the connection, both actual and perceived, between sacred sources and the justification of violent acts as divinely mandated.
      Fighting Wordsmakes solid text-based scholarship accessible to the general public, beginning with the premise that a balanced approach to religious pluralism in our world must build on a measured, well-informed response to the increasingly publicized and sensationalized association of terrorism and large-scale violence with religion. In his introduction, Renard provides background on the major scriptures of seven religious traditions-Jewish, Christian (including both the Old and New Testaments), Islamic, Baha'i, Zoroastrian, Hindu, and Sikh. Eight chapters then explore the interpretation of select facets of these scriptures, focusing on those texts so often claimed, both historically and more recently, as inspiration and justification for every kind of violence, from individual assassination to mass murder. With its nuanced consideration of a complex topic, this book is not merely about the religious sanctioning of violence but also about diverse ways of reading sacred textual sources.<br>

The yawning emptiness of the void, the “gap”

  Abstract: so far we have seen that evil became associated early with disobeying father and his representatives. The roots of that association stretch back into antiquity when early human beings felt contaminated by preexisting evil. Ricoeur began his study of the symbolism of evil with an analysis of defilement. Already two things have happened that must now set aside. First, evil is firmly associated with sin, guilt, impurity, and fault; there has been a move beyond pure terror to ethical terror. Second, thought already focuses on the symbol rather than the experience. “By beginning with a symbolism already there,” Ricoeur observes,<br>

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, eac~<br>

  Book Title: Passing on the Faith: Transforming Traditions for the Next Generation of Jews, Christians, and Muslims-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Heft James L.<br>
  Abstract: From the beginning, the Abrahamic faiths-Judaism, Christianity, and Islam-have stressed the importance of transmitting religious identity from one generation to the next. Today, that sustaining mission has never been more challenged. Will young people have a faith to guide them? How can faith traditions anchor religious attachments in this secular, skeptical culture?The fruit of a historic gathering of scholars and religious leaders across three faiths and many disciplines, this important book reports on the religious lives of young people in today's world. It's also a unique inventory of creative and thoughtful responses from churches, synagogues, and mosques working to keep religion a significant force in those lives.The essays are grouped thematically. Opening the book, Melchor Sanchez de Toca and Nancy Ammerman explore fundamental issues that have an impact on religion-from the cultural effects of global consumerism and personal technology to pluralism and individualism. In Part Two, leading investigators present three leading studies of religiosity among young people and college students in the United States, illuminating the gap between personal values and organized religion-and the emergence of new, different forms of spirituality and faith. How religious institutions deal with these challenges forms the heart of the book-in portraits of best practicesdeveloped to revitalize traditional institutions, from a synagogue in New York City and a Muslim youth camp in California to the famed French Catholic community of the late Brother John of Taiz. Finally, Jack Miles and Diane Winston weave the findings into a broader perspective of the future of religious belief, practice, and feeling in a changing world.Filled with real-world wisdom, Passing the Faith will be an essential resource for anyone seeking to understand what religions must, and can, do to inspire a vigorous faith in the next generation.<br>

  Book Title: The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER THOMAS M.<br>
  Abstract: The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence explores themes in classical American philosophy, primarily that of John Dewey, but also in the thought of Ralph Waldo Emerson, George Santayana, and Native American traditions. The primary claim is that human beings exist with a need for the experience of meaning and value, a "Human Eros." Our various cultures are symbolic environments or "spiritual ecologies" within which the Human Eros can thrive. This is how we inhabit the earth. Encircling and sustaining our cultural existence is nature. Western philosophy has not generally provided adequate conceptual models for thinking ecologically. Thus the idea of "eco-ontology" undertakes to explore ways in which this might be done beginning with the primacy of Nature over Being, but also including the recognition of possibility and potentiality as inherent aspects of existence. I argue for the centrality of Dewey for an effective ecological philosophy. Both "pragmatism" and "naturalism" need to be contextualized within an emergentist, relational, non-reductive view of nature and an aesthetic, imaginative, non-reductive view of intelligence.<br>

  Book Title: Missing Link-The Evolution of Metaphor and the Metaphor of Evolution<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): DONALDSON JEFFERY<br>
  Abstract: We look for missing links in the sciences and humanities, but the essential missing link - metaphor - is always in front of us. In Missing Link, Jeffery Donaldson unites literary criticism and evolutionary and cognitive science to show how metaphor has been with us since the beginning of time as a seed in the nature of things. With examples from centuries of poets, critics, philosophers, and scientists, he details how metaphor is a chemistry, an exchange of energies forming and dissolving, and an openness in the spaces between things. He considers the ways in which DNA learns how to liken things that have been, how mutation makes errors and then tries them on, and how evolution is hypothesis - nature's way of "thinking more." The mind is a matrix of relations: neural synapses cascade into ever-changing pathways and patterns. Metaphor is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. It is the unbroken thread between matter and spirit. Whether offering analysis of a turn of phrase or chemical reaction, Missing Link presents a vision of literature that is also a vision of the cosmos, and vice versa. It enters the debate between evolution and religion, and challenges scientists, literary theorists, and religious advocates to rethink the relations between their disciplines.<br>

  Abstract: “In our beginning is our end” (
                  Complete, 177). T.S. Eliot’s Alpha-and-Omega shell game is sometimes used as a first salvo in long arguments; it makes my case succinctly, so I’m pressing it into service again. Whatever end we human beings currently represent as evolved metaphoric thinkers is already present and active in whatever beginning the Big Bang represents for our universe. The launching of the metaphoric initiative and the launching of the universe are one and the same event. They consist of the same fabric, a material condition and a pattern of behaviour, a content and a form, as one.<br>

  Book Title: Italian Irish Filmmakers-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lourdeaux Lee<br>
  Abstract: "This penetrating study examines how these filmmakers confronted their cultural heritage and used it as a counterpoint to their depiction of mainstream America." --American Cinematographer In this unique film history, Lee Lourdeaux traces the impact of Irish and Italian cultures on four major American directors and their work. Defining the core values and tensions within each culture, and especially focusing on the influence of American Catholicism, he presents John Ford, Frank Capra, Francis Coppola, and Martin Scorsese as ethnic Americans and film artists. Lourdeaux shows each filmmaker on set with writers and actors, learning to bypass stereotypes in order to develop a shrewd reciprocal assimilation between his ethnic background and Anglo America. Beginning with D. W. Griffith's depiction of Irish and Italian immigrants, the author discusses Hollywood's stereotypical portrayals of ethnic priests, cops, politicians, and gangsters, as well as their surface acculturation in the movies of the 1920s. By the decade's end, John Ford was using all-American stories to embody the basic myths and tensions of Irish-American life. In his later westerns and foreign films, he tried to understand both Irish political strife and the key figures of Irish liturgy. Frank Capra pitted Italian family values against the Anglo success ethic, turning out social comedies about oppressed little people. Several decades later, Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola were highly critical of their religio-ethnic heritage, though they gradually discovered that to outline its weaknesses, like the blind pursuit of success, was to fashion a critical mirror of mainstream America. Lourdeaux discusses a number of recent films by Coppola and by Scorsese that have not yet been analyzed in any book. And, in the chapter on Scorsese, a personal interview with the director reveals how his ethnic childhood shaped his work in film. Examining the conflicts within American culture, Lourdeaux shows how the filmmake~<br>

  Abstract: The literary approach to the parables here focuses on the form critical issue of the parable genre. Since the beginning of form-critical research on biblical texts about one hundred years ago, the parable genre has been a popular paradigm for demonstrating the results of form criticism. Scholars believed that in the parables they had a group of texts that were based on oral precursors and that ultimately could be traced back to the historical Jesus. Because of meager analogies to earlier and contemporary texts, scholars simultaneously saw the parables as a genre

From the beginning of the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in 1940–1941, and especially from 1944 until Stalin’s death in 1953, the Christian churches in Lithuania were brutally attacked as “the biggest obstacle to the smooth sovietisation of the occupied country.”¹ Many priests were deported, parishioners<br>

  Author(s): Werbner Richard<br>
  Abstract: Richard Werbner takes readers on a journey though contemporary charismatic wisdom divination in southern Africa. Beginning with the silent language of the divinatory lots, Werbner deciphers the everyday, metaphorical, and poetic language that is used to reveal their meaning. Through Werbner's skillful interpretations of the language of divination, a picture of Tswapong moral imagination is revealed. Concerns about dignity and personal illumination, witchcraft, pollution, the anger of dead ancestors, as well as the nature of life, truth, cosmic harmony, being, and becoming emerge in this charged African setting.<br>

Hence, the moral emphasis of his criticism is striking when he attacks the praxis of exploiting poor people and their fear of Hell to the benefit of the church, the pope, and the clergy.

  Abstract: The relationship between nature and grace was arguably the most-debated topic in Catholic theology in the early to middle twentieth century, a period that is now largely seen as culminating in the change in ecclesial and theological atmosphere surrounding the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965). These midcentury debates are the inevitable historical and theological backdrop for any contemporary study of nature and grace. This chapter thus explores the development of Catholic thought on nature and grace beginning with the work of Maurice Blondel against the backdrop of the Modernist controversy, continuing with the contributions of Pierre Rousselot, and concluding with<br>

  Book Title: A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VENEMA HENRY ISAAC<br>
  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's entire philosophical project narrates a passion for the possibleexpressed in the hope that in spite of death, closure, and sedimentation, life is opened by superabundance, by how the world gives us much more than is possible. Ricoeur's philosophical anthropology is a phenomenology of human capacity, which gives onto the groundless ground of human being, namely, God. Thus the story of the capable man, beginning with original goodness held captive by a servile will and ending with the possibility of liberation and regeneration of the heart, underpins his passion for the more than possible. The essays in this volume trace the fluid movement between phenomenological and religious descriptions of the capable self that emerges across Ricoeur's oeuvre and establish points of connection for future developments that might draw inspiration from this body of thought.<br>

  Book Title: Ascent into Heaven in Luke-Acts-New Explorations of Luke's Narrative Hinge<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Pao David W.<br>
  Abstract: In comparison with other aspects of Jesus’ life and ministry, his ascent into heaven has often been overlooked within the history of the church. However, considering its placement at the end of the Gospel and the beginning of Acts—the only narrative depictions of the event in the New Testament—the importance of Jesus’ ascent into heaven is undeniable for Luke’s two-volume work. While select studies have focused on particular aspects of these accounts for Luke’s story, the importance of the ascension calls for renewed attention to the narratological and theological significance of these accounts within their historical and literary contexts. In this volume, leading scholars discuss the ascension narratives within the ancient contexts of biblical, Second Temple Jewish, and Greco-Roman literature; the literary contours of Luke-Acts; and questions of historical and theological significance in the wider milieu of New Testament theology and early Christian historiography. The volume sets out new positions and directions for the next generations of interpreters regarding one of the most important and unique elements of the Lukan writings.<br>

  Abstract: Among the New Testament (NT) writings, only Luke provides an explicit account of the public ascension of Jesus. The significance of Jesus’s ascension in his writings is further accentuated by the fact that it appears in both his first and second volumes. While it is widely acknowledged that the ascension account found at the end of Luke’s Gospel serves to provide a proper conclusion to this gospel (Luke 24:50–53),¹ and the one found at the beginning of Acts serves to introduce the mission of the apostles after Jesus’s departure (Acts 1:9–11),² the programmatic significance of the ascension narrative<br>

  Book Title: Hope and the Longing for Utopia-Futures and Illusions in Theology and Narrative<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Boscaljon Daniel<br>
  Abstract: At present the battle over who defines our future is being waged most publicly by secular and religious fundamentalists. 'Hope and the Longing for Utopia' offers an alternative position, disclosing a conceptual path toward potential worlds that resist a limited view of human potential and the gift of religion. In addition to outlining the value of embracing unknown potentialities, these twelve interdisciplinary essays explore why it has become crucial that we commit to hoping for values that resist traditional ideological commitments. Contextualized by contemporary writing on utopia, and drawing from a wealth of times and cultures ranging from Calvin’s Geneva to early twentieth-century Japanese children’s stories to Hollywood cinema, these essays cumulatively disclose the fundamental importance of resisting tantalizing certainties while considering the importance of the unknown and unknowable. Beginning with a set of four essays outlining the importance of hope and utopia as diagnostic concepts, and following with four concrete examples, the collection ends with a set of essays that provide theological speculations on the need to embrace finitude and limitations in a world increasingly enframed by secularizing impulses. Overall, this book discloses how hope and utopia illuminate ways to think past simplified wishes for the future.<br>

  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Bartholomew Craig G.<br>
  Abstract: The Christian Scriptures could be theologically described as beginning and ending with an epistemological outlook. The first episode of humanity’s activity centers on the knowledge of good and evil. The final stage of humanity is pictured by Jeremiah as a universally prophetic and knowing society: 'And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord', for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord' (Jer 31:34). What happens to knowledge in between? In this work, Dru Johnson reconsiders epistemology with the tool of biblical theology: an approach to knowledge as developed in Genesis 2 and explored throughout the Tanakh (i.e., the Old Testament) and New Testament. By re-examining the neglected idea that Christian Scripture might be developing robust descriptions of knowing that can direct us today, the ambition of this book is to lay the groundwork for a biblical theology of knowledge - how knowledge is broached, described, and how error is rectified within the texts of the Christian canon. Proper knowing as it occurs in the Scriptures means that there are better and worse ways to know. Even more, the epistemology that is found to be advocated in Scripture is not relegated to religious knowing. Johnson argues that scientific epistemology and biblical epistemology make significant points of contact suggesting that they are fundamentally consistent with each other.<br>

  Abstract: Demographic transition is a well-known theory in demography, and it is still considered one that is “alive” (Hirschman, 1994). The ideas of a changing demographic pattern as societies modernize appeared sometime at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Among the first who gave a shape to this theory were Notenstein (1953) and Davis (1963). They observed that fertility and mortality decreased in most of the industrialized world and noted the relationships between these demographic phenomena and some other components of social life, such as modernization and economic development. The classical form of demographic transition states that industrialization and urbanization created<br>

  Abstract: The large Cantonese community in Canada and, in particular, in British Columbia can trace its origin back to the 1858 gold rush on the Fraser River and the beginning of the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in 1881. Yet, these events do not in anyway prepare anyone for a full understanding of the experience of the Chinese community in Canada or explain why it was not until 1979 that the first anthology of Chinese- and Japanese-Canadian writing,

Beginning during the frightening period of 1814–1815, between Napoleon’s first and second exiles, Carey began to pull together his concerns regarding potential national disintegration and the limitations of republican institutions and political<br>

  Abstract: Critical studies of African and Caribbean women writing remain scarce.¹ The reasons for this absence are twofold. First, at the beginning of the formation of African literary studies in the mid-twentieth century, there were relatively few women writers in Africa and the Caribbean. This was mainly due to the external violence of colonialism, which privileged the schooling of the male. It was also attributable to internal violence originating from precolonial and postcolonial patriarchal conceptions that prevented women in traditional and contemporary societies from expressing themselves or acquiring the same educational level as men.

  Book Title: Forms of Life-Character and Moral Imagination in the Novel<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): PRICE MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Martin Price writes here about ways in which character has been conceived and presented in the novels of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Beginning with chapters that cogently argue the artistic value of character, Price then deals with the different forms character has taken in individual novels. His first discussions center on authors-Jane Austen, Stendhal, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, and Leo Tolstoy-who define individuals by their adherence or opposition to social norms. The next chapters deal with novelists for whom the moral world is largely internalized. The characters of Henry James, Joseph Conrad, D.H. Lawrence, and E.M. Forster live in society and act upon it, but the authors are particularly concerned with the confusions, terrors, and heroism that lie within consciousness. The last chapter uses novels about the artist by James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Thomas Mann in order to apprehend the process by which experience is transformed into art.<br>

  Book Title: Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging meditation on the nature and purpose of hermeneutics, Gerald L. Bruns argues that hermeneutics is not merely a contemporary theory but an extended family of questions about understanding and interpretation that have multiple and conflicting histories going back to before the beginning of writing.What does it mean to understand a riddle, an action, a concept, a law, an alien culture, or oneself? Bruns expands our sense of the horizons of hermeneutics by situating its basic questions against a background of different cultural traditions and philosophical topics. He discusses, for example, the interpretation of oracles, the silencing of the muses and the writing of history, the quarrel between philosophy and poetry, the canonization of sacred texts, the nature of allegorical exegesis, rabbinical midrash, the mystical exegesis of the Qur'an, the rise of literalism and the individual interpreter, and the nature of Romantic hermeneutics. Dealing with thinkers ranging from Socrates to Luther to Wordsworth to Ricoeur, Bruns also ponders several basic dilemmas about the nature of hermeneutical experience, the meaning of tradition, the hermeneutical function of narrative, and the conflict between truth and freedom in philosophy and literature. His eloquent book demonstrates the continuing power of hermeneutical thinking to open up questions about the world and our place in it.<br>

  Abstract: Clifford Geertz (1926–2006) was one of the main figures to build a new kind of anthropology, beginning in the 1960s. In doing so, he borrowed many ideas from philosophy. Although some of his works have been read by philosophers too, the influence of his anthropology on philosophy is negligible. The reception of his thoughts does not conform to the generally accepted significance of his writings, appropriate to their philosophical content. Most often, Geertz is read only superficially and the reading is confined to his two most famous texts – ‘Thick Description’ (1973) and ‘Deep Play: Notes on Balinese Cockfight’ (1972).<br>

This contribution is marked by a clear ambivalence. On the one hand, it is obvious that it was in no way gratuitous.

  Abstract: World urbanization is one of the most significant developments facing the planet and the mission of the church. While at the beginning of the twentieth century less than ten percent of the world’s population was urban, with the dawn of the twenty-first century more than half of Earth’s population is/will be living in cities. Ahead is an urban millennium. As a result, urban mission is one of the primary expressions of the mission of the church in the world today.<br>

  Abstract: Near the beginning of the

This was a commonplace for Aquinas and his interlocutors, and it might seem that he only affirms it out of deference to a long-established tradition.¹ But Aquinas is very well able to distance himself from traditional claims when his overall position requires him to do so, and that is not what we see him doing here. On the contrary, he takes this claim as the starting<br>

  Book Title: The Intimate. Polity and the Catholic Church-Laws about Life, Death and the Family in So-called Catholic Countries<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): PÉREZ-AGOTE ALFONSO<br>
  Abstract: The waning influence of the Catholic church in the ethical and political debate. For centuries the Catholic Church was able to impose her ethical rules in matters related to the intimate, that is, questions concerning life (from its beginning until its end) and the family, in the so-called Catholic countries in Western Europe. When the polity started to introduce legislation that was in opposition to the Catholic ethic, the ecclesiastical authorities and part of the population reacted. The media reported massive manifestations in France against same-sex marriages and in Spain against the de-penalization of abortion. In Italy the Episcopal conference entered the political field in opposition to the relaxation of several restrictive legal rules concerning medically assisted procreation and exhorted the voters to abstain from voting so that the referendum did not obtain the necessary quorum. In Portugal, to the contrary, the Church made a “pact" with the prime minister so that the law on same-sex marriages did not include the possibility of adoption. And in Belgium the Episcopal conference limited its actions to clearly expressing with religious, legal, and anthropological arguments its opposition to such laws, which all other Episcopal conferences did also. In this book, the authors analyse the full spectrum of the issue, including the emergence of such laws; the political discussions; the standpoints defended in the media by professionals, ethicists, and politicians; the votes in the parliaments; the political interventions of the Episcopal conferences; and the attitude of professionals. As a result the reader understands what was at stake and the differences in actions of the various Episcopal conferences. The authors also analyse the pro and con evaluations among the civil population of such actions by the Church. Finally, in a comparative synthesis, they discuss the public positions taken by Pope Francis to evaluate if a change in Church policy might be possible i~<br>

  Abstract: The management of death, the regulation of pregnancy termination and medically assisted procreation and the institutionalization of same-sex couples and same-sex parenting: in the different European countries that we have studied, the public authorities are preoccupied by such issues which relate to questions concerning life (from its beginning until its end), sexuality and gender. As per Michel Foucault¹, new bio politics are being developed, a new “government of bodies” (according to Didier Fassin and Dominique Memmi²). This usually concerns women’s bodies, regardless whether it is abortion, medically assisted reproduction – as Frisina writes in the chapter on Italy – or same-sex marriage.³<br>

  Abstract: The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening and broadcasted by FOX Broadcasting Company. The plot revolves around a dysfunctional family of five, living in a fictional town of Springfield. At the beginning, the creators of the show planned the Simpsons to be the protagonists of short episodes shown during The Tracy Ullman Show. That form lasted only for three seasons, between its debut on 19 th April 1987 till 1989, as the popularity of the show made the producers rethink the whole idea, redesign slightly the characters and expand the universe by introducing many supporting characters.<br>

  Abstract: The prestige of the Enlightenment has declined in recent years. Many consider its thinking abstract, its art and poetry uninspiring, and the assertion that it introduced a new age of freedom and progress after centuries of darkness and superstition presumptuous. In this book, an eminent scholar of modern culture shows that the Enlightenment was a more complex phenomenon than most of its detractors and advocates assume. It includes rationalist as well as antirationalist tendencies, a critique of traditional morality and religion as well as an attempt to establish them on new foundations, even the beginning of a moral renewal and a spiritual revival.<br>

  Abstract: Artistically the Enlightenment may not compare favorably with the Renaissance or Baroque periods, but the aesthetic criticism of the eighteenth century surpassed that of the two earlier periods and provided most of the categories used in the two centuries that followed. One of its major achievements was to raise the idea of beauty to the level of truth. It accomplished this in three stages: at the beginning the imitation theory prevailed, next the expressive theory, and at the end the symbolic theory made a tentative entrance.

To the reader who might think that we are about to launch into a question of restricted and basic motor physiology, that is, far removed from cognitive function, I would say that posture is none other than “preparation to act,”¹ and locomotion is not only about making successive steps but also navigating in space.

  Abstract: Western philosophy grew from that of the ancient Greeks at the end of the seventh century bce. Among the first were the Milesians: Thales (ca. 624–548 bce), Anaximander (ca. 611–547 bce), and Anaximenes (ca. 570–500 bce). As Geoffrey Lloyd recounted in 1970, this was a time of important technological progress, the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age. Classification developed from observation and rationalization. These early philosophers discovered nature and distinguished between natural and supernatural, and they then avoided the supernatural. Thales declared that gods were everywhere, but he left them there.<br>

  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): Thacker Robert<br>
  Abstract: Willa Cather at the Modernist Cruxexamines Willa Cather's position in time, in aesthetics, and in the world. Born a Victorian in 1873, Cather made herself a modernist through the poems, stories, and novels she wrote and published into the twentieth century. Beginning with a prologue locating Cather's position, this volume of Cather Studies offers three sets of related essays.The first section takes up Cather's beginnings with her late nineteenth-century cultural influences. The second section explores a range of discernible direct connections with contemporary artists (Howard Pyle, Frederic Remington, and Ernest Blumenschein) and others who figured in the making of her texts. The third section focuses onThe Song of the Lark, a novel that confirms Cather's shift westward and elaborates her emergent modernism. An epilogue by the editors ofThe Selected Letters of Willa Catheraddresses how the recent availability of these letters has transformed Cather studies. Altogether, these essays detail Cather's shaping of the world of the early twentieth century and later into a singular modernism born of both inherited and newer cultural traditions.<br>

The increased use of these services has become possible as a result of legislative change in countries such as the U.S. (in which many states now allow for the contracting of surrogacy services), in addition to the provision of services in countries where the<br>

Beginning with the site of the First Party Congress in Shanghai (yida huizhi一大会址) and ending with Tiananmen Square in Beijing, the eight photographs gave readers a virtual tour of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) history. Designed to celebrate the party’s July anniversary, the images were paired with eight poems in the format of a traditional tourist’s itinerary of eight vistas. Yet this kind of tour was different: the eight places were official revolutionary sites,<br>

  Abstract: In the preceding parts of this book, I have demonstrated several reasons why contemporary fiction may choose to represent the academy, mostly focusing on the fact that in contemporary metafiction, the critical space is shared by the academy and fiction. This results in a struggle for the right to express critique and then a legitimation battle. Beginning with Tom McCarthy’s oblique engagement with the academy through his public intellectualism and canny understanding of generic conventions, I suggested that C, although not a work that directly depicts academia, is a novel tightly bound to formalist criticism and canon formation and a<br>

  Abstract: Despite the changes that are beginning to appear in fourteenth-century England, by the same time in Italy the sublimation and spiritualization of love has long established itself as the dominant theme of European poetry, a theme that is exported to England in the sixteenth century, briefly sweeping aside much of the spirit we have seen developing in Chaucer. To understand how and why this happened, we will have to circle back and spend a little time with Plato.<br>

Beginning with their pre-migration lives – characterised for many by fractured belonging in the UK – upper and more proximate structures enabled and facilitated their agency in moving to Spain in retirement. We have also seen that women’s positionalities and unique biographies are also significant in shaping migration choices, decision-making processes and their post-migration lives.

  Abstract: Throughout Europe, standardised approaches to social policy and practice are being radically questioned and modified. Beginning from the narrative detail of individual lives, this book re-thinks welfare predicaments, emphasising gender, generation, ethnic and class implications of economic and social deregulation.Based on 250 life-story interviews in seven European Union countries, Biography and social exclusion in Europe: analyses personal struggles against social exclusion to illuminate local milieus and changing welfare regimes and contexts; points to challenging new agendas for European politics and welfare, beyond the rhetoric of communitarianism and the New Deal; vividly illustrates the lived experience and environmental complexity working for and against structural processes of social exclusion; refashions the interpretive tradition as a teaching and research tool linking macro and micro realities. · · Students, academic teachers and professional trainers, practitioners, politicians, policy makers and researchers in applied and comparative welfare fields will all benefit from reading this book.<br>

  Abstract: The complex and diffuse identity of the Hui as outlined in the preceding chapter challenges traditional approaches to ethnicity theory. Anthropology in the past was ill-equipped to address this kind of expansive ethnic identity. Given their widespread distribution and lack of cohesion, one may very rightly question the validity of Hui ethnic identity. The Hui regard themselves as an ethnic group, however, and the Chinese state registers them as an official nationality. The Hui are also beginning to play an increasingly important role in the Chinese state’s domestic affairs and in international ethnopolitics. The Hui thus pose an interesting problem<br>

Dreaming tends always toward a delirium syndrome, but the corresponding impairment of verbal-reflective thinking allows a positive release of visual-spatial metaphor and intuition, the frames or modules of mind that are based on a relative simultaneity of expression.

Beginning with the two-part recognition that the world is a smaller place and that it is indeed many worlds, Cosmopolitanism and Place critically explores what it means to assert that all people are citizens of the world, everywhere in the world, as well as persons bounded by a universal and shared morality.<br>

  Abstract: By the time of home rule agitation in both Ireland and India, anticolonial movements blended into a more internationalist vision then beginning to emerge in the years following World War I. To extreme nationalists, internationalism was a complete anathema, a more refined term to prolong the evils of colonialism indefinitely under the guise of a universal humanism. However, to those who still considered themselves nationalists, but believed they had a responsibility that extended far beyond the immediate goal of liberation from colonial rule, internationalism was the only solution to a world totally sundered by ethnic fratricide.

  Abstract: Selected by

Beginning with women's emergence into what has been defined as the most paradigmatic of Moroccan male institutions-the marketplace-the book elucidates how gender and commodity relations are experienced and interpreted in women's aesthetic practices. Deborah Kapchan compellingly demonstrates that Moroccan women challenge some of the most basic cultural assumptions of their society-especially ones concerning power and authority.<br>

  Abstract: Few other states in the continent can claim to have emerged from a ten-year civil war under more promising circumstances than Burundi. The transition process, however long and painful, has been exemplary. Beginning with the Arusha agreement of 2000, a constitutional formula was finally worked out whereby the rights of the Tutsi minority could be reconciled with the demands of the Hutu majority.¹ The 2005 legislative and presidential elections went remarkably smoothly, giving birth to a consociational government² headed by a Hutu president, Pierre Nkurunziza, where Hutu and Tutsi held respectively 60 and 40 percent of the ministerial portfolios.

  Author(s) Bastos Susana<br>
  Abstract: Postmodern and post-colonial discourses have praised hybridity and ambivalence as enriching traces of identity-building in our age of multidirectional migrations as if only travelling between and across cultures through transnational dislocations could provide the experience of developing diasporic, hyphenated or deterritorialised identities. But some authors are beginning to challenge what may be too narrow a perspective of the social conditions from which such identities can spring. The Portuguese sociologist Santos recently highlighted the fact that since its inception Portuguese colonialism has always been an experience of ambivalence and hybridity in the relationship it promoted between the coloniser and the colonised.<br>

  Book Title: The Bioregional Imagination-Literature, Ecology, and Place<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): ZEITLER EZRA<br>
  Abstract: Bioregionalism is an innovative way of thinking about place and planet from an ecological perspective. Although bioregional ideas occur regularly in ecocritical writing, until now no systematic effort has been made to outline the principles of bioregional literary criticism and to use it as a way to read, write, understand, and teach literature. The twenty-four original essays here are written by an outstanding selection of international scholars. The range of bioregions covered is global and includes such diverse places as British Columbia's Meldrum Creek and Italy's Po River Valley, the Arctic and the Outback. There are even forays into cyberspace and outer space. In their comprehensive introduction, the editors map the terrain of the bioregional movement, including its history and potential to inspire and invigorate place-based and environmental literary criticism. Responding to bioregional tenets, this volume is divided into four sections. The essays in the "Reinhabiting" section narrate experiments in living-in-place and restoring damaged environments. The "Rereading" essays practice bioregional literary criticism, both by examining texts with strong ties to bioregional paradigms and by opening other, less-obvious texts to bioregional analysis. In "Reimagining," the essays push bioregionalism to evolve-by expanding its corpus of texts, coupling its perspectives with other approaches, or challenging its core constructs. Essays in the "Renewal" section address bioregional pedagogy, beginning with local habitat studies and concluding with musings about the Internet. In response to the environmental crisis, we must reimagine our relationship to the places we inhabit. This volume shows how literature and literary studies are fundamental tools to such a reimagining.<br>

  Book Title: Marrow of Human Experience, The-Essays on Folklore by William A. Wilson<br>

  Author(s): Call Diane<br>
  Abstract: Composed over several decades, the essays here are remarkably fresh and relevant. They offer instruction for the student just beginning the study of folklore as well as repeated value for the many established scholars who continue to wrestle with issues that Wilson has addressed. As his work has long offered insight on critical matters-nationalism, genre, belief, the relationship of folklore to other disciplines in the humanities and arts, the currency of legend, the significance of humor as a cultural expression, and so forth-so his recent writing, in its reflexive approach to narrative and storytelling, illuminates today's paradigms. Its notable autobiographical dimension, long an element of Wilson's work, employs family and local lore to draw conclusions of more universal significance. Another way to think of it is that newer folklorists are catching up with Wilson and what he has been about for some time.<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy of Communication-  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Butchart Garnet C.<br>
  Abstract: To philosophize is to communicate philosophically. From its inception, philosophy has communicated forcefully. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle talk a lot, and talk ardently. Because philosophy and communication have belonged together from the beginning--and because philosophy comes into its own and solidifies its stance through communication--it is logical that we subject communication to philosophical investigation. This collection of key works of classical, modern, and contemporary philosophers brings communication back into philosophy's orbit. It is the first anthology to gather in a single volume foundational works that address the core questions, concepts, and problems of communication in philosophical terms. The editors have chosen thirty-two selections from the work of Plato, Leibniz, Hegel, Husserl, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Benjamin, Lacan, Derrida, Sloterdijk, and others. They have organized these texts thematically, rather than historically, in seven sections: consciousness; intersubjective understanding; language; writing and context; difference and subjectivity; gift and exchange; and communicability and community. Taken together, these texts not only lay the foundation for establishing communication as a distinct philosophical topic but also provide an outline of what philosophy of communication might look like.<br>

  Abstract: The narrative turn in the study of aging has brought forth a variety of nonpositivist, nonrealist approaches to examining an elder’s life story within the terms of the story itself, independent of its truth content. Beginning with the early 1980s, anthropology witnessed a flood of studies concerning the life history approach (cf. Bertaux 1981; Crapananzo 1980; Shostak 1981). By 1988, however, the influence of illness in the construction of one’s life history received little attention (Kaufman 1988, 217). Since then, bolstered by interpretive approaches to narrative in anthropology (e.g., Rabinow and Sullivan 1987), as well as theory and methods from<br>

In gruesome detail it tells of the destruction of the walls and protective fortifications around the city and how enemy forces gained entry into her innermost sanctuary, desecrating her secret places.

Beauvoir’s comprehensive and still controversial text also initiated existential feminism, as she developed her themes within the emergence of existentialist philosophy—an open-ended, anti-essentialist, and nonsystematic philosophy that studies life as an undecided project-in-the-making.

  Book Title: Heidegger and the Thinking of Place-Explorations in the Topology of Being<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Malpas Jeff<br>
  Abstract: The idea of place--topos--runs through Martin Heidegger's thinking almost from the very start. It can be seen not only in his attachment to the famous hut in Todtnauberg but in his constant deployment of topological terms and images and in the situated, "placed" character of his thought and of its major themes and motifs. Heidegger's work, argues Jeff Malpas, exemplifies the practice of "philosophical topology." In Heidegger and the Thinking of Place, Malpas examines the topological aspects of Heidegger's thought and offers a broader elaboration of the philosophical significance of place. Doing so, he provides a distinct and productive approach to Heidegger as well as a new reading of other key figures--notably Kant, Aristotle, Gadamer, and Davidson, but also Benjamin, Arendt, and Camus. Malpas, expanding arguments he made in his earlier book Heidegger's Topology (MIT Press, 2007), discusses such topics as the role of place in philosophical thinking, the topological character of the transcendental, the convergence of Heideggerian topology with Davidsonian triangulation, the necessity of mortality in the possibility of human life, the role of materiality in the working of art, the significance of nostalgia, and the nature of philosophy as beginning in wonder. Philosophy, Malpas argues, begins in wonder and begins in place and the experience of place. The place of wonder, of philosophy, of questioning, he writes, is the very topos of thinking.<br>

  Author(s) Vasvári Louise O.<br>
  Abstract: Is it possible to mourn Auschwitz? "Kaddish" is the name for the traditional Jewish prayer of mourning uttered on behalf of the dead by those left living. The term forms part of the title of Imre Kertész's
                  Kaddis a meg nem született gyermekért(Kaddish for an Unborn Child). It is the third book in a trilogy of fictional texts beginning withSorstalanság(Fatelessness) andA kudarc(The Failure). Although disclaimed by Kertész as autobiographies in any strict sense, in my opinion the texts mimic the autobiographical form and are reflections on his own experiences of the nazi concentration camps—Auschwitz,<br>

  Abstract: As Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714–1762) indicates at the beginning of his treatise

This is the opening statement of a work that is considered to be the genealogical moment in the creation of aesthetics as an autonomous philosophical field—a creation prompted by the need to rescue the senses from the primacy of reason. The association of feelings (aisthesis) with the fallacious world of experience has a long history that goes back to<br>

  Author(s): Burns Robert P.<br>
  Abstract: Burns explores the rich narrative structure of the trial, beginning with the lawyers' opening statements, which establish opposing moral frameworks in which to interpret the evidence. In the succession of witnesses, stories compete and are held in tension. At some point during the performance, a sense of the right thing to do arises among the jurors. How this happens is at the core of Burns's investigation, which draws on careful descriptions of what trial lawyers do, the rules governing their actions, interpretations of actual trial material, social science findings, and a broad philosophical and political appreciation of the trial as a unique vehicle of American self-government.<br>

  Book Title: The Undivine Comedy-Detheologizing Dante<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): BAROLINI TEODOLINDA<br>
  Abstract: Accepting Dante's prophetic truth claims on their own terms, Teodolinda Barolini proposes a "detheologized" reading as a global new approach to the
      Divine Comedy. Not aimed at excising theological concerns from Dante, this approach instead attempts to break out of the hermeneutic guidelines that Dante structured into his poem and that have resulted in theologized readings whose outcomes have been overdetermined by the poet. By detheologizing, the reader can emerge from this poet's hall of mirrors and discover the narrative techniques that enabled Dante to forge a true fiction. Foregrounding the formal exigencies that Dante masked as ideology, Barolini moves from the problems of beginning to those of closure, focusing always on the narrative journey. Her investigation--which treats such topics as the visionary and the poet, the One and the many, narrative and time--reveals some of the transgressive paths trodden by a master of mimesis, some of the ways in which Dante's poetic adventuring is indeed, according to his own lights, Ulyssean.<br>

In this important study of the relationship of literature and politics, Mark Patterson argues that this scene restates political issues in literary terms and embodies the essential problems of American democracy facing both politicians and writers: What is autonomy? How does representation work? Where does true authority lie? Beginning with the debate over ratification of the United States Constitution, Patterson follows out the complex literary consequences of these questions.<br>

It may occur, as Donne wrote, when a painting is first made. Or it may occur repeatedly, as often as viewers imaginatively reexperience the creative instant when artist and painting both were<br>

  Abstract: At the beginning of this book I surveyed scholarly opinion concerning the obscurity of the early Islamic period in the historical study of Judaism. Having now investigated several dimensions of the symbiosis between Muslim and Jew, I find it remains remarkable how few personalities emerged from this study. It is not only that the preponderance of figures studied here (necessarily) remain anonymous. The impossibility of ascertaining the social location, much less the specific identity, of many of the actors in the social drama of symbiosis should not, however, incapacitate the student of symbiosis—for the symbiosis, on my conception, constituted<br>

  Abstract: From the beginning of his reflections, Nietzsche is in search of “a new philosophy of language” (CM 1976, 1:340 [8, 52]), a philosophy which would wisely consent to lose its head and which could give, in a positive manner, an account of the bacchanalian revel, the festive inordinateness of the dithyramb, “this beautiful and savage folly of poetry” (CM 1976, V: 100-1). One is to understand the “nature” of language beginning with its derailment and its loss. This new philosophy seeks to give back to language all its striking force, all its power to cast a spell, its mysterious and<br>

There was no necessity to demonstrate the same for Stevens, since it is widely assumed that his view of religion was essentially that of a Humanist – that religious beliefs are fantasies or fictions.

Although to my knowledge Narayan, the creator of Malgudi, did not use the expression, this essay comes close to defining his “postcolonial” position. He addresses here the craze for the Raj that was exemplified through a number of films, including

Is he not simply a representative of a now outmoded “humanism”, a philosophy of the “subject” and of the phenomenology of consciousness? That he was a humanist in some sense of that rather vague word is undeniable; he was certainly concerned to affirm human values and believed that there are such values to affirm. But<br>

  Abstract: It is hard to imagine a more optimistic beginning than the early movement of second-wave feminist theology.¹ Bolstered by the momentum of secular feminism² and by a boundless confidence in the critique of Christian orthodoxy, these pioneering scholars set about the task of liberating all women. It is easy to appreciate this initial enthusiasm. As Rosemary Radford Ruether notes, the fundamental impetus for change was at first simply to challenge the patriarchal notion that women are inferior.³ The fight for equality ensured that feminist scholars across all disciplines would argue for the status of women alongside men, especially in regard<br>

  Book Title: Reading Theologically-  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Barreto Eric D.<br>
  Abstract: Reading is one of the basic skills a student needs. But reading is not just an activity of the eyes and the brain. Reading Theologically, edited by Eric D. Barreto, brings together eight seminary educators from a variety of backgrounds to explore what it means to be a reader in a seminary context--to read theologically. Reading theologically involves a specific minset adn posture towards texts and ideas, people and communities alike. Reading theologically is not just about academic skill building but about the formation of a ministerial leader who can engage scholarship critically, interpret Scripture and tradition faithfully, welcome different perspectives, and help lead others to do the same. This brief, readable, edited volume emphasizes the vital skills, habits, practices, and values involved in reading theologically. Reading Theologically is a vital resource for students beginning the seminary process and professors of introductory level seminary courses.<br>

Women across Europe lacked access to scholarly training until the beginning of the twentieth century.

An anthropologist by training, author of works whose technical complexity exclude all but a small group of specialists, everything would seem to confine this figure to the rarefied sphere of academic exchange. And yet Lévi-Strauss’s reputation extends far beyond his own area of specialisation.

  Book Title: Ethno-Baroque-Materiality, Aesthetics and Conflict in Modern-Day Macedonia<br>

  Author(s): Dimova Rozita<br>
  Abstract: In post-1991 Macedonia,
      Barokfurniture came to represent affluence and success during a period of transition to a new market economy. This furniture marked the beginning of a larger Baroque style that influenced not only interior decorations in people's homes but also architecture and public spaces. By tracing the signifier Baroque, the book examines the reconfiguration of hierarchical relations among (ethnic) groups, genders, and countries in a transnational context. Investigating how Baroque has come to signify larger social processes and transformations in the current rebranding of the country, the book reveals the close link between aesthetics and politics, and how ethno-national conflicts are reflected in visually appealing ornamentation.<br>

  Author(s): TIBI Bassam<br>
  Abstract: Dedicated to increasing our knowledge and awareness of the ever-growing diversity and pluralism of global society, Forum A. & A. Leysen has initiated an annual debate/lecture series, beginning with a focus on Islam in today's world and in Europe in particular. Seven well-known influential authorities - each an active participant in the public debate on the global role of Islam past, present and future - recently presented papers at the first Intercultural Relations Conference sponsored by Forum A.& A. Leysen. These important contributions, on the topic Islam and Europe: Challenges and Opportunities, are reprinted in this volume. Although each contributor speaks from his own distinctive point of view, a common message emerges from all seven texts: only dialogue - on the one hand between the West (countries that manifest themselves as Western Democratic constitutional states) and Islam, and on the other hand within and among societies historically identified with Islam- will overcome entrenched confrontation and negative animosity, engender new possibilities and understandings, and, by encouraging free and critical thinking, pave the way to social equity and the scientific innovation that, potentially, can lead to more prosperity. In the course of the conference all seven talks led to fascinating debates. This book includes the most important questions asked and the speakers' responses. Although the question of how to actually construct the dialogue remains unsettled, this ground-breaking book takes a giant step toward an answer.<br>

  Abstract: Although the phenomenon of liminality appears in the earliest children’s texts, it doesn’t appear in children’s literature scholarship until the beginning of the twenty-first century, chiefly in the adjective form, “liminal,” a polyseme whose other meanings relate to psychology and mysticism. “Liminality” is a coinage from the Scottish anthropologist Victor Turner (1969 ), who drew on “liminaire,” a term used by Arnold Van Gennep (1909) in his ethnographical writings on preindustrial societies to designate the middle, transitional stage of a three-stage paradigmatic rite of passage (“rites which accompany every change of place, state, social position and age”).

  Abstract: “In the beginning was the word,” was the book—the Hebrew Bible, which provides the foundation of our being. On that foundation Jews built, layer upon layer, the cultural house of the people of Israel: translations of the Bible, the apocrypha and pseudepigrapha, Jewish-Hellenistic literature, all the genres of rabbinic literature from all its periods both in aggadah and halacha, ancient liturgical poetry from the land of Israel (

  Abstract: Most commentaries on the destruction of the Tower of Babel regard it as a second Fall, a fragmentation of the perfect language of naming that Adam conceived and so the beginning of the split between word and thing that brought into the world lying, ambiguity, irony, negation, artifice, the unconscious, ideology, the subject, the Other, and all the various woes and pleasures we now associate with language. In the Zohar we read that the biblical phrase “the whole earth was of one language” indicates that “the world was still a unity with one single faith in the Holy One” (253),<br>

  Abstract: The sweep of the feminist tradition in the United States, arguably the locale of its most radical innovations, throws up both enormous achievements and dispiriting failures. Of the failures, none has been more noticed, more pronounced than feminism’s difficulties in making an enduring common cause with democratic race politics. Facing the blockages, historians have searched for a logic that explains the inadequacies of a women’s politics which, some have argued, were indelibly marked from the very beginning by racism and a fixation on race-privilege: all the perfidies conjured up by the category “whiteness.” In the 1960s, scholars exaggerated the egalitarianism<br>

  Abstract: In his sermon entitled “Increase of Faith,” the Reverend James Stratten of Paddington Chapel identifies three avenues by which “conviction and enjoyment [are] realized in the mind.”¹ His identification of the senses as an inlet of knowledge is both Lockean and Romantic; his extended valuation of intellect is both Augustinian and Enlightenment-inflected; and his naming of faith as the third and greatest inlet of knowledge reaches as far back as the biblical proverb “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge” (where “fear” means reverence).

  Abstract: THE PHENOMENON of the massive transplantation of Latin American intellectuals to other areas of the world, particularly to more economically developed countries, that began in the 1970s has generated a varied literature dealing with the problems of transculturation, exile, and the symbolic relationships of the individual with these diverse societies.

Negotiated in 1987 in the hope of creating the political conditions necessary for Quebec to join the constitution, the agreement faced opposition in the legislatures of Manitoba and Newfoundland.

  Abstract: Representations of war are determined not only by the ages in which they appear, but also by the boundaries understood to define war. The idea, for example, that it is not battle but war itself that leaves behind scars presumes that war has both a beginning and an end, or that we can differentiate between the event and its traces. War is, however, an extended process, one that can hardly be isolated or made wholly distinct from peace. The vagueness of the concept suggests that much remains unknown about its limits.

Ignoring these fundamental facts, the idealists sought to transcend the time process by rational system and they imposed a rational pattern upon the course of historical events.

Many philosophical discussions of the narrative self touch upon the end of life.¹ End-related terms and concepts that occur in these discussions include finitude, completion, closure,

In order to set in motion an investigation into this question, I will need to begin at the beginning, with an inquiry into the nature of memory. How can it be defined? And what are the implications of those definitions for thinking about cinema? The first section of this chapter draws on a range of modes of thinking about memory, from the philosophical to the psycho-sociological to the scientific. However, in pursuing this subject such disciplinary demarcations become unclear. Memory, that elusive topic, seems to pervade and trouble the boundaries not<br>

  Abstract: This chapter will first consider the odd relationship that existed between the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) and the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and its successor, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), during the waning days of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War. In addition to surveying a number of pertinent memoirs and biographies, it will examine fictional accounts of espionage. The lion’s share of the analysis will be devoted to John le Carré’s classic espionage novel

  Abstract: To speak of travellers’ tales of wonder in late twentieth-century literature may well strike some as oxymoronic, anachronistic, quaint: more tall tale than area of inquiry. Already at the end of the thirteenth century, the ‘wise and learned citizen of Venese’ (Polo 1938: 73) was beginning to tire of accounts of the Provinces. What promise for wonder voyaging, then, when the idiom of the ‘global village’ (McLuhan 1988: 28-31) itself rings overly familiar? Travellers’ tales of wonder belong, according to most accounts, in bygone ages: to Messer Polo; to the medieval Wonder Book; to Columbus and Ralegh and the first<br>

  Abstract: The academic field of international political economy (IPE) is a relatively young one. As an established part of international relations (IR), it rose to prominence in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Scholarly writings that would now be called IPE date back much further,¹ but they were not widely-recognized as part of a distinct field until the 1970s.² This means that the field is only about thirty years old. The period of oil shocks in the developed countries beginning in the early 1970s provided a strong impetus to the organization of the field. It brought to the fore a set<br>

  Abstract: From the beginning, cinema has been held up as a unique medium partly by virtue of the kind of attention it seems to demand. Appreciating a film involves a special combination of perception, cognition, imagination, and emotion. Cinema engages us across a wider range of our embodied mental capacities than any other medium of representation, extending from low-level reflexes to abstract reflection. Cinema engages not only our visual and auditory senses, in a direct fashion, but also our senses of touch and balance and, perhaps, even those of taste and smell, in an indirect fashion.

  Abstract: Habermas first developed a positive conception of legitimacy at the beginning of the 1970s, when he took up Max Weber’s sociology of government (
                     Herrschaftssoziologie) and the Marxist critique of capitalism (Legitimation;Rekonstruktion). Legitimacy, as he has defined it, means the “worthiness of recognition [Anerkennungswürdigkeit] of a political order” (Rekonstruktion, 271).Legitimation Crisis, which dates from this period, focuses on the production of meaning (and crises of meaning) within the capitalist system—when the administration can shoulder economic problems but can no longer account for its operations (Legitimation, 98).<br>

  Book Title: Randall Jarrell and His Age-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burt Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Burt's book examines all of Jarrell's work, incorporating new research based on previously undiscovered essays and poems. Other books have examined Jarrell's poetry in biographical or formal terms, but none have considered both his aesthetic choices and their social contexts. Beginning with an overview of Jarrell's life and loves, Burt argues that Jarrell's poetry responded to the political questions of the 1930s, the anxieties and social constraints of wartime America, and the apparent prosperity, domestic ideals, and professional ideology that characterized the 1950s. Jarrell's work is peopled by helpless soldiers, anxious suburban children, trapped housewives, and lonely consumers.
      Randall Jarrell and His Agesituates the poet-critic among his peers -- including Bishop, Lowell, and Arendt -- in literature and cultural criticism. Burt considers the ways in which Jarrell's efforts and achievements encompassed the concerns of his time, from teen culture to World War II to the Cuban Missile Crisis; the book asks, too, how those efforts might speak to us now.<br>

  Abstract: The global justice movement is without a doubt the most important phenomenon of antisystemic resistance of the beginning of the twenty-first century. This vast, nebulous “movement of movements,” which has taken visible form since the regional or world social forums and the great protest demonstrations—against the WTO, the G8, or the imperial war in Iraq—does not correspond to the usual forms of social or political action. A large decentralized network, it is multiple, diverse, and heterogeneous, joining trade unions and peasant movements, NGOs and indigenous organizations, women’s movements, as well as ecological associations, intellectuals, and young activists.

It was now governed by a growing recognition of the evils of racism.

  Author(s): LYNCH RICHARD A.<br>
  Abstract: Philosophers debate the death of philosophy as much as they debate the death of God. Kant claimed responsibility for both philosophy's beginning and end, while Heidegger argued it concluded with Nietzsche. In the twentieth century, figures as diverse as John Austin and Richard Rorty have proclaimed philosophy's end, with some even calling for the advent of "postphilosophy." In an effort to make sense of these conflicting positions-which often say as much about the philosopher as his subject-Isabelle Thomas-Fogiel undertakes the first systematic treatment of "the end of philosophy," while also recasting the history of western thought itself.<br>

  Abstract: Deeply shaped by the presentiment of an impending catastrophe, the dialogue between Adorno and Benjamin depicts a melancholy constellation. In a previous chapter, we have already observed the ambivalent assessments of Benjamin on melancholy, as they appear in both his book on the German tragic drama and his strongly critical review of Erich Kästner’s novels. Now, it is important to emphasize the melancholic character of Benjamin himself. According to many witnesses, melancholy was his deepest disposition; it also explains his fascination with

Heidegger was steeped in Catholicism to the extent that his bishop subsidized his studies, and he was considered the bright promise of German Catholic thought at the beginning of his career. Perhaps this relationship to Christianity will appear in a new light after the release of more unpublished works in addition to those that have appeared in recent years. Among the latter, the “Einleitung in die Phenomenologie der Religion” (Introduction to the Phenomenology of Religion)¹ has a central place. This is a transcript of the<br>

  Abstract: In this groundbreaking book, David Roberts sets out to demonstrate the centrality of the total work of art to European modernism since the French Revolution. The total work of art is usually understood as the intention to reunite the arts into the one integrated whole, but it is also tied from the beginning to the desire to recover and renew the public function of art. The synthesis of the arts in the service of social and cultural regeneration was a particularly German dream, which made Wagner and Nietzsche the other center of aesthetic modernism alongside Baudelaire and Mallarmé.<br>

As the paradigmatic example of a new cultic theatre, of art religion in the full sense of the term, it provided a model for the avant-garde search for a synthesis of the arts.

The return of Jews to York after 1190, and the new Jewish community which flourished in the early thirteenth century, was the subject of later papers by Dobson, now reprinted in a single<br>

  Abstract: The illusionistic nature of language finds its first elaboration in Schmidt’s concept of literary realism, which dominated his writings in the 1950s. As I showed in the previous chapter, Schmidt’s early writing already shows his awareness of the impossibility of ideal literary representation in Foucault’s sense of the classical age of representation.² Schmidt’s call for a literature emulating the lack of continuity typical of modern existence attests to that awareness,³ as does his criticism of traditional prose forms — the epistolary novel, epic novel, and diary — with their classic sequence of beginning, middle, and end.

As for animal germs, their significance for resurrection is that they are imperishable. How else could one explain the rain of tiny frogs the author claims to have seen in Languedoc and supposedly common in hot countries? Frogs lay their eggs in marshes; when water from these marshes evaporates, fertilized eggs rise with it; if they happen to end up in the clouds of a storm, they develop, and the result is a rain of minute, perfectly formed frogs (see

Abstract: The three dimensions of group style—group boundaries, group bonds, and speech norms—all work together; beginning one’s analysis with one or with another will be a result of the particular researcher’s own confrontations with puzzles. But wherever one begins, the two cases portrayed here—in addition to other studies we have analyzed with the same framework—all suggest that the three dimensions will usually be crucial for understanding the ways that a group incorporates and filters collective representations.<br>

Abstract: 4. Are the paradigm shifts I identified for the study of language as culture in the United States of more general relevance?This possibility was also raised by psychologists in the audience when I presented an earlier draft of the article at the Universit di Padova in October 2000. In the printed version I purposely left out my own speculations in this direction because I felt that I did not have the data and the expertise to venture into other fields, but this is a worthwhile project for others to pursue. After all, many of the writers I mentioned were or are part of wider networks of scholarship extending to other disciplines and other countries. One in fact might see van Dijks comments as the beginning of a widening of the discussion by a major figure in another field, namely, discourse studies. His complaints about what is typically left out of the analysis in linguistics and anthropology not only underscore the privileging of certain contexts for analysis (e.g., spontaneous talk), which is to be expected, but also remind us that text itself is one of those key terms that can be interpreted very differently across disciplines and, I would add, across paradigms. I suspect that a study of how the term text has been interpreted and used in the humanities and social sciences would be an equally exciting exercise, although it would be difficult to justify the same temporal restriction to the 20th century given the ancient hermeneutical traditions from which our contemporary notions of text derive.<br>

Abstract: But are there not objections to be made? For example, following Heidegger, one could assimilate the biblical definition according to image and likeness to the Greek definition according to the possession of λόγος in order to understand both as imposing upon man the mode of Being “im Sinne des Vorhandensein” (“in the sense of subsistence [occurring and Being‐present‐at‐hand]”).
         40But what proof does Heidegger give of the equivalence between these two definitions? If necessary, the definition by λόγος could fall under reproach; but does the definition according to the image of God not exclude, precisely, anything having to do, in God and thus in man, with Being as subsistence (vorhanden)? Unless, that is, Heidegger includes neither definition in the division of finite being from infinite being.41But there too, does he not take up, as if it goes without saying, the metaphysical distinction par excellence of theensintofinitumandinfinitum, introduced by Duns Scotus through to Suarez, without seeing that this distinction doubtless contradicts the incomprehensibility of the image and likeness? Does he simply want, in the end, to deny theology the right to tackle the question of man’s status, just as he denies it that of responding to the question, “Why is there something rather than nothing?” by holding that “anyone for whom the Bible is divine revelation and truth already has the answer to the question … before it is asked: beings, with the exception of God Himself, are created by Him. God Himself ‘is’ as the uncreated Creator.” This remains, Heidegger believes, unacceptable, because “one who holds on to such faith as a basis can, perhaps, emulate and participate in the asking of our question in a certain way, but he cannot authentically question. … He can act only ‘as if’ [nun so tun `as ob'] … in the beginning God created heaven and earth, etc.’”42This argument presupposes in its turn that, by invoking creation, the believer confidently knows and thus comprehen~<br>

Abstract: If the norm of brevity is troubled by the possibility of linguistic poverty, the weedy verbosity springing up alongside our information highways may be a misguided attempt at a remedy. These weeds are, in a way, our flowers of Parnassus. But the roots of verbosity are more complex still because they are intertwined with the other norm governing informational writing, clarity. Again, we must begin by acknowledging the ancient pedigree of clarity, but with the caveat that the concept of clarity did not mean quite the same thing after a theory of communication such as Smith’s challenged the agenda of the old rhetoric. The norm of clarity is in fact extrinsic to the development of information genres, despite the deference it is paid in these genres. It emerged as an ideal of belles lettres in the eighteenth century. For the belles lettrists—the literary critics and grammarians who dominated the public sphere of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries—clarity was the supreme aim for all the genres of discourse, including the literary. Linked more to notions of
            politesseand correct usage than to knowledge or information, the center of gravity for belletrist discourse was not science but literature and journalism (forms of writing seldom distinguished at the time). The norm of clarity arose from thepublicnessof print culture, which presupposed that written communications were addressed ideally to everyone, to the hypothetical general reader. The belles lettrists thus cultivated a strong bias against terms of art, the diction that was specific to professions and crafts. Reinforced by the usual social snobbery, belles lettrist norms were from the beginning at odds with the linguistic needs of the sciences and professions, which required the freedom to devise “technical” lexicons if they were to advance at all.58Such terms of art became indispensable because these terms can be arbitrarily and therefore precisely defined. They can be forcibly removed from a domain ~<br>

Abstract: Of course, not all of the possibilities revealed in interreligious encounter are compatible with one’s religious identity. The normative claims that, together with the practices with which they are correlated, define that identity will ultimately decide whether a given possibility is a theologically viable possibility. At this point the normative theological judgments that were suspended in order to allow the religious other to present itself to our understanding reassert themselves. An approach to the religious other governed by the
         epocheprinciple eventually gives way to theology proper. The former approach—represented by the complex of disciplines falling under the rubric of “the study of religion”—represents a constitutive, though only provisional, moment within the larger project of comparative theology.33But what renders the detour through interreligious understanding theologically significant is the conviction that one’s home tradition will be understood differently at the end of the process than it was at the beginning, thanks to the real changes undergone by the self in the moment of interreligious encounter.<br>

Abstract: By extending these ideas on reading to a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur is able to argue that identity is a temporal structure that rests on narrative, as well as a project that is ongoing for individuals during their lifetime. Reading is central to this project because it is only in reading that the dynamism of configuration completes its course; in other words, the passage from prefiguration via configuration to refiguration results in transfiguration of worlds. In this relationship of worlds, it is the person as reader who takes this journey [
         21]. His thesis is that “the process of composition, of configuration, does not realize itself in the text but in the reader, and under this condition configuration makes possible refiguration of a life by way of the narrative” [44, p. 430]. As part of this, a person can be called upon to make an account of herself, and such an account, Ricoeur argues, involves a positing of a beginning, a middle with its highs and lows, and an ending [14]. Through composition, or configuration, this account is dynamic; we can weave different plots about our lives. Ricoeur reminds us that “just as it is possible to compose several plots on the subject of the same incidents … so it is always possible to weave different, even opposed, plots about our lives” [30, p. 248]. But, simultaneously, a life can have the quality of being singular and complete. In terms of a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur best captures this when he argues that “to understand oneself is to understand oneself as one confronts the text and to receive from it the conditions for a self other than that which first undertakes the reading. Neither of the two subjectivities, neither that of the author nor that of the reader, is thus primary in the sense of an originary presence of the self to itself” [44, p. 17]. For Ricoeur, it is through this task that we achieve, by dint of effort, a dynamic balancing of a sense of self, which is, on the one~<br>

Abstract: Early in the essay, Rubin demonstrates a clear awareness of the prohibitive nature of the race‐sex power apparatus. As an illustration of right‐wing ideology linking sexual deviance with political weakness, she cites the pamphlet
         Pavlov’s Children, which charged the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States with allying to “‘destroy racial cohesion,’ by exposing white people (especially white women) to the alleged ‘lower sexual standards of black people’” (Rubin1984, 273).4The lines between sexual normality and abnormality, health and unhealthiness, and virtue and vice are sharply drawn through the axis of race. Indeed, as mentioned above, beginning with the advent of modernity and colonialism, the sexual mores of the West began to be defined in contradistinction to the practices of the peoples of Africa, Asia, and South America. The exhibition of Saartjie Baartman’s body in Paris in the early nineteenth century was the culmination of decades of prurient Western male obsession with the supposedly lascivious body parts of Hottentot women (Gilman1985, 225–40). In the United States, in addition to affiliation with Europeans, difference from African Americans has centrally defined white sexuality.<br>

Abstract: Whether or not the picture of liberalism and pluralism that these critics paint is entirely fair and accurate, it must be admitted that their emphasis on the nature of religions as radically different communal‐social practices is certainly a welcome reality check for any overenthusiastic and premature envisioning of the harmony of all religions and even their convergence.
         9Furthermore, their—especially the neotraditionalists'—exposure of the political concerns of the modern West underlying the pluralist discourse is perhaps their most significant contribution to the subject of interreligious dialogue. Yet if their untiring emphasis on the particularity of each religious community does not make them reject interreligious dialogue altogether, it leads them to regard the latter at best either as ad hoc apologetics necessitated by the merely occasional and tangential encounters of the largely isolated cultural‐linguistic enclaves that are religions or as the work of evangelization and conversion in another garb that follows the innate logic of the universalizing horizon of Christianity.10As analyses of and positive proposals for interreligious relationships rather than interreligious differences, however, these positions overall fail to take adequately into account the postcolonial or neocolonial character of the concrete economic, political, and cultural context of today’s religious plurality. The so‐called global village and the culturally and religiously plural nation‐states of today are largely products of a colonial and postcolonial history in which the centuries‐long imposition of relations of economic, political, and cultural dominance and subservience has closely interwoven the fate of different communities and brought them into a common space of living. The birth of new ethnically and religiously plural nation‐states along the arbitrarily drawn boundaries of the colonial governing units, the forces of neocolonial global economy and the increasing econo~<br>

Issue: jr.2005.85.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Young III William W.<br>
Abstract: Obedience to God unifies Christ’s identity by incorporating his powerless submission to the circumstances in which he finds himself and his love of neighbor. As Frei notes, at several central points in the passion narrative, where Jesus is powerless, he nonetheless turns others’ power to his own ends—either by appropriating their words or reshaping the significance of their action. Moreover, Jesus’s agency is far stronger in the Gospel of John than in the Synoptic Gospels.
         44John’s portrayal of Jesus’s agency also progressively emphasizes Jesus’s unity with the Father, such that what is presented at the beginning as the Father’s intention becomes Jesus’s own through the course of the story.45Frei presents this conjunction as demonstrating that one cannot simply highlight Jesus’s powerlessness in the Synoptic Gospels; rather, to be faithful to the narrative one must grasp both his power and his powerlessness, in these disparate depictions. This exemplifies what one might call a “narrative typology,” which, like Midrash, conjoins apparently disparate or conflicting texts so as to deepen the literal sense.<br>

Abstract: I trust that what I have written here clarifies, in the course of the discussion, the relevance and significance of the seven characteristics of Don Browning’s style of theologizing. Following in his footsteps I hope to have made a contribution to the public theology he espouses—the first characteristic I mentioned at the beginning of this article. I trust that I have likewise shown my interest—the second characteristic—in the institutions determining people’s concrete daily lives, as well as influencing and coloring their norms, values, and religiosity. I have referred specifically to the institution of law, especially human rights law. The third characteristic is also clear: as Browning’s study of marriage and the family is conducted in a global, more especially an interreligious perspective, I have paid due attention to interreligious interaction and dialogue, which dominate not only politics and the mass media but also the conversations in our living rooms. Both of us are convinced that any public theology must be characterized by an empirical approach—the fourth characteristic. In his family project, Browning not only collaborates with social scientists but also incorporates their empirical research into the goal and content of his project. In this article, I, too, have used insights from political and social sciences, as well as empirical‐theological research, in order to relate the assumptions and principles of interreligious interaction and dialogue directly to empirical reality.<br>

Issue: jmh.2006.78.issue-2<br>

Author(s): Todorova Maria<br>
Abstract: The fact that the destruction of the mausoleum came not as a spontaneous act on the heels of a popular upheaval at the time of the “velvet revolution” but as a hastily organized and sloppily executed performance a full decade after “the changes” contributed, of course, to the general indifference to the fate of this particular site, despite the emotional pathos of some of the articulated opinions. Most important, it explains the richness and diversity of nuanced assessments as well as the complete freedom of their expression. Indeed, if the demolition had taken place in the fall of 1989 or even at the beginning of 1990, one would be tempted to make sense of it in the framework of revolutionary struggles over meaning.
         92The destruction of the Vendôme Column on May 16, 1871, came two and a half weeks after the proclamation of the Commune. It was a highly theatricalized spectacle, with a crowd of over twenty thousand assembled, waiting for three hours while a brass band played “La Marseillaise.”93In contrast, the 1999 mausoleum spectacle was a poorly staged mimicry of a revolutionary act, minus the music, minus the public, exactly ten years after the triggering event—a mimicry that raised again all the conceptual questions of how exactly the original event of 1989 should be designated and assessed. Should it be called a revolution (even if a “velvet” one), thus focusing on its quality of rupture? Or should it be seen as an internal coup that, despite denoting a break, emphasizes the agents' continuity? Or can its significance best be captured by the innocuous and meaningless term “changes,” which, however, has in its favor the fact that it has become the preferred and most widely utilized expression by the public, no matter what their political preferences, and has thus withstood the withering effects of time?<br>

Abstract: The appeal of this language of children’s agency is twofold. First, it helps the social sciences distinguish themselves from the otherwise dominant methods of developmental psychology, which, it is argued, start from the point of view of what children are not yet, namely, developed adults, rather than what they are and can do in and of themselves, as well as in their full cultural and individual diversity. While some would argue that this critique is unfair, nevertheless a stand is taken that you cannot understand childhood without understanding children as competent and diverse social actors. Second, and more important for our purposes, the notion of children’s agency is appealing because it suggests an alternative to how children have generally been understood throughout history. Children actively participate in their social worlds rather than being passive recipients of adult socialization. This claim expands and further develops the Enlightenment view beginning with John Locke and Jean‐Jacques Rousseau that “unenlightened” practices of child rearing ignore children’s distinctive human capabilities. What is added by the new social sciences perspective, however, is both an empirically precise method of stripping away easy adult preconceptions about childhood and, most important, a resulting and perhaps even unprecedented appreciation for children’s own social agency in all its fullness and complexity.<br>

Abstract: Plato did not start this ancient quarrel, but he did draw its lines especially sharply and influentially. At least a seventh of his
         Republicaddresses why the poets—such as Homer, Hesiod, Aeschylus, and Sophocles—not only fail to articulate the essential “idea” (eidos) of goodness and justice but, as poets, distort it.1It is not the philosophers who corrupt the youth (as Plato’s teacher Socrates had been executed for) but the “makers” of pleasant and beguiling images and stories. According to Plato, “The imitative poet produces a bad regime in the soul of each private man by making phantasms that are very far from the truth and by gratifying the soul’s foolish part.”2Why? Because the activity of poetics (poiêsis) is by definition the “imitation” (mimêsis) of truth, making it able to grasp only the world’s changing visible appearances and not its eternal invisible depths. “The imitator, we say, understands nothing of whatisbut rather of what looks like itis.”3The very establishment of philosophy as the pursuit of truth and goodness, in fact, depends to a significant degree for Plato on overturning the mere poetic “making” of “images” (eikones) of truth and beginning to uncover truth as it actually “is,” Truth as invisible and unchanging Being.<br>

Abstract: The practical and normative ethics of our profession will undoubtedly be accompanied by emotive and affective reactions. After all, human action is motivated by emotion, cognition, reason, and other things. The profession’s desire to identify core values is a product of these multiple motivations. Just as identification of a core value requires an explication of what qualities are attached to a thing that is valued and for whom the thing is valuable and why, so too does discourse ethics in general require such full argumentation. More than just formal argument, though, discourse ethics entails participation broadly; it invites those concerned to have a voice within the communicative endeavor. The voicing, however, follows some norms that are aimed at the outcome of the deliberation—workable and agreed‐upon practices. Habermas says that “discourse ethics, then, stands or falls with two assumptions: (
         a) that normative claims to validity have cognitive meaning and can be treated like claims to truth and (b) that the justification of norms and commands requires that a real discourse be carried out and thus cannot occur in a strictly monological form” [35, p. 68]. Habermas presents an ideal that can suggest a beginning for the furtherance of a practical and normative ethics for librarianship.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: How does Derrida respond to this conception of responsibility, a conception that is entirely heterogeneous to the Greek one and to the tradition to which it gave rise, one that he has characterized as “the most convincing and convinced
      doxa”? In seeking to answer this question, let us bear in mind that the Platonic idea of responsibility is the beginning of the genealogy of responsibility in Europe, of the European tradition of thinking about responsibility, although it is, according to Patočka, to be entirely replaced by the Christian model. But the Christian version of responsibility is also part of European memory, which thus consists of at least two different memories regarding what constitutes responsibility, despite Patočka’s description of Christian responsibility as thoroughly heterogeneous to its Greek antecedent. Further, since the lingering presence of Platonism in Christianity has prevented a full rupture with the Greek model of responsibility that Christianity is to accomplish, the break with this tradition must be completed if the very essence or future of Europe is ever to be realized. Yet, as we saw at the beginning of this essay, for Derrida the concept of responsibility makes no sense whatsoever without an experience of inheritance. Consequently, responsibility is first and foremost a responsibility for and to the specific traditions of responsibility that have been bequeathed to us. It is, first and foremost, a responsibility before any particular responsibilities to oneself, the other, God, the animal, the world, and so forth. Such responsibility does not exclude selection and critique. But would not any attempt to ignore, reject, or break with one of those legacies be tantamount to irresponsibility? Indeed, if responsibility is first of all a responsibility for and to an inheritance, to abandon or to deliberately renounce a part of the tradition in its entirety would be the gravest irresponsibility, all the more so in the case of a part of~<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: I am proposing then a conception of the future that is simply unknowable in advance. The future that we have long understood and embraced is not the ineluctable result of a given historical evolution, the necessary and foreseeable product of “natural” laws of social transformation, the inevitable fruit of economic, scientific, technological progress—or, worse still, the prolongation, under more and more perfected forms, of the same, of what already exists, of an actually existing modernity and its realized economic and social structures. In this model, experience turns back to a historical present, which now remains open to a history made in the present founded on the fashioning of expectations based on an unforeseen future. Here, the present moment signifies a form of expectation that can only know possibilities supplied by the past, inasmuch as the “actual‐now,” which can never be for itself alone, remains the focal point of “retentions,” even as it retains its “point‐like” status.
         18In this view, the historical present comes close to resembling what Hannah Arendt once identified as an “odd in‐between period which sometimes inserts itself into historical time when not only the later historians but the actors and witnesses, the living themselves, become aware of an interval in time which is altogether determined by things that are no longer and by things that are not yet.”19Arendt was echoing Chateaubriand’s plaint that had called attention to the dilemma, as phrased by François Hartog, of living between the “impossibility of the past” and the “impossibility of the future” (RH,p. 118). Marxists, on their part, saw in these “intervals” the figure of a transition between what once had been and what was about to be born, a form of temporality rather than simply Arendt’s indeterminate dead zone of no time. But Arendt managed to acknowledge the mingling of “waves of the future” and the “forces of the past,” the former driving the present back into the past and ~<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: The building of Zion remains the “future project” of the LDS Church and is “intimately related to the ways in which it remembers itself.”
         93The promise of Zion still orders the experience of Smith’s faithful readers, providing them a beginning and an end between which they, as his readers—by means of their own heuristic powers of imagination—get their bearings to act. Their local ecclesiastical units are called “stakes,” symbolic of the stakes that anchor the tent of Zion, and are collectively referred to as “the stakes of Zion.” Thus, as with other myths that have founded a sense of peoplehood, Smith’s narrative history of human and divine interaction was ultimately oriented to a future time that served as a basis for acting in the present. It provided a world of meaning by which his believing readers understood themselves existentially, including their future and not merely their past. Most fundamentally, Smith’s writings give his believing readers a different sense of what was and what will be and, as a consequence, give significance to and a sense of what is real in the present. Just as the story of a realized messiah and the coming kingdom profoundly reoriented the Jews called “Christian,” Smith’s writings of the “fulness of times” provided a unique means by which the Latter‐day Saints’ alterity has been maintained, even as they integrated with contemporary society.<br>

Abstract: “I chose this story above all others because it’s a story I’m struggling to end. … That’s why I write fiction—so that I can keep telling the story. … Always a new beginning, a different end,” Winterson writes toward the close of her narrative (
         2005, 137). Linking the desire for retelling with the inability to formulate a conclusion and the necessity for an open ending, Winterson has Atlas walk away, yet presents this “very particular end not found elsewhere” (xiv) as but one possibility among several, the choice of which is ultimately left to the individual reader’s personal preference: “no one knows its composition,” Winterson observes. “Dark matter could be conventional matter, … or it could even be black holes. Or it could be Atlas holding up the universe. But I think it is Atlas and Laïka walking away” (2005, 151).Weight’s multiperspectival ending underscores its status as inaugural retelling of myth for a twenty‐first century that can only assimilate more pasts into its ever broadening present. In this sense, the Myths seems typical for the contemporary take on re‐vision. Whereas the names of the authors hold the promise of retellings with a critical edge—Achebe having given usThings Fall Apartas a reply to and a thorough undermining of Joseph Conrad’sHeart of Darkness(see Moyers1989; Achebe1990), and neither Atwood nor Winterson is a stranger to rewriting as cultural critique—Winterson’s phrase and its appropriation by the series’ editor make us suspect differently. “We want to tell the story again,” as the series’ editor Jamie Byng puts it on Canongate’s Web site, speaks of the storyteller’s desire for and delight in language; of the pleasure of telling stories, of keeping the stories alive by retelling them. Inevitably also meaning “we want tosellthe story again,” retelling becomes a retailing strategy, promising ever new and improved reading experiences that are as ephemeral as any other consumer experience.

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters.

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede-~<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: In all such derivatives from the linguistic turn, segmentation is at the core of the enterprise; the lump presumptions of beginning, middle, and end are refined into smaller and smaller units of narrative ingredient. Granted, this morphological tendency leads, in Barthes, to so furious a subdivision of the text that the linguistic model seems almost to turn back to the linguistic effect itself, segmentation pulverized almost to the very granules of lexical succession. Almost but not quite; the “lexias” are never caught back up for Barthes in the syllabic and lexical tread of the narrative sentence itself. Barthes's scintillating precisions may not murder what they dissect, but neither do they rejoin the textual advance after tabulating its codes. The opposite of taxonomy does not guarantee a closer approach to narratography either. In a recent attempt, for instance, to outplay the psychotemporal dynamics familiar from Freud and Brooks with a yet more transgressive “energetics” out of Nietzsche, Lyotard, and Deleuze, Andrew Gibson has advocated a “postmodern narratology” of flow rather than structure, force rather than form.
         11But his postmodern valorization of fluid impulse rather than architectonics in both cinematic and literary apprehension—once it is associated with a deterritorialized channeling rather than enchainment of words and images alike—isn't considered as a potential inherent to each medium, where it might have shed light on texts other than those brandishing their avant-garde provocations. While traditional narratology strives to universalize, this postmodern variant sets a premium on certain defiant reaches of experimentation. Issues of narrative closure and semiotic enclosure are nonetheless centrally at stake. So that yet again, as much with the description now of force as of morphological form before, we are offered a loaded account of narrative telos (or here, in many cases, its refusal) rather than a way of reading its maneuvers.<br>

Abstract: Recall that the great insight of the Hellenistic and early Christian humanists, as Werner Jaeger recounted it, was to think through the opposition. As he noted, “Theology was intended from the very beginning to transcend humanism but at the same time it was the true fulfillment of the task which humanism had formulated.”
         38A “theology” implied apaideiaor a form of education that provided orientation to individuals and societies. Further, the biblical religions and the modern critics of religion advanced the insight that life, the flourishing of existence, and not death can and must orient human action. The task is to overcome the alienation of life from itself. More provocatively, I contend that the call of conscience to that task arises through the tensions among remembrance and love and is itself testimony to the life of our life, a vitality construed theologically as the “God” who communicates life and invigorates freedom and responsibility for new life. The remembrance of death is indeed at the origins of the sense of responsibility. I am bound to orient my power responsibly rooted in the vulnerability of mortal being—my own and that of others—to violence. Yet when one interrogates the complexity of religious symbols and practices along with the dynamics of mortal experience inscribed in the love of life, one can come to see, I submit, that the purpose of responsibility is to respect and enhance the integrity of life. Power ought to serve the integrity of life; responsibility is power so oriented and exercised.<br>

Abstract: But how shall all these shards of information be catalogued, organized, and merged into a larger enterprise? How shall information become knowledge and inquiry be disciplined? If the internet decenters research, the university remains staunchly hierarchical, committed at some level to selection, procedure, and evaluation. After all, its academic programs are built on what we call the course that from some motivated beginning promises to reach a plateau of understanding ten or fifteen weeks later. Student plans of study put courses in relation to one another, and we call the sum of courses, including their progression and interrelation, a curriculum. Of all American film scholars, Bordwell has been most dedicated to the film curriculum. His textbooks establish the bedrock information, concepts, and skills that enable more sophisticated inquiry into what he calls the historical poetics of the medium. He argues for and from first principles and believes students should progress to higher‐level courses (and presumably can succeed in them) only after having mastered foundational material (a modicum of film history) and skills (close analysis, archive research, and so on). But rare is the department in the U.S. that has implemented such a program, at least at the undergraduate level. Few film professors would refuse—for lack of prerequisites—smart, eager neophytes (English majors, say) who ask to join a senior seminar in feminist film theory or in the globalization of film distribution. Except in its production track, film studies does not take itself to be analogous to chemistry or economics in this regard. Still, at the minimum film studies programs should arrange things so that students can grow term by term in the depth, breadth, and subtlety of their film analyses and historical inquiries.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: There is one further element crucial to an exposition of Coleridge’s philosophy of prayer, and that is efficacy. In the wake of the first edition of
         Aids to Reflection, whether prayer actually led to anything other than “some supposed beneficial reaction of Praying on the Prayer’s own Mind” exercised him greatly.15As he suggested in marginalia to Martin Luther, “If A − Prayer = 3, and A + Prayer = 3, Prayer = 0.”16The problem is theologically perennial, invoked at the beginning of classic treatments of prayer, such as Augustine’sCommentary on the Lord’s Sermon on the Mountand chapter 20 of John Calvin’sInstitutes of the Christian Religion. Petitioning to affect a being with omniscient foreknowledge and absolute rationality is by definition ludicrous: as Karl Barth puts it, “The mere concept of God is enough to establish an objection against prayer in so far as it seeks to be more than a devotional exercise … and tries to be a request uttered to God.”17Barth, of course, has his own answers as to why God does answer prayer and is not an “immoveable idol.”18Somewhat like Barth, Coleridge’s eventual answers to the potential nullity of prayer are rooted in the idea of the human “I” as a being‐for‐God.<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: William Franke elucidates the theological nature of poetry and the poetic nature of theology. The range of reference is impressive and a challenge to any reviewer. Franke engages the tradition of Christian epic poetry—beginning with scripture, developing through Dante Alighieri, John Milton, and William Blake, and culminating with James Joyce—as well as the modernist poetry of Paul Celan, Wallace Stevens, and T. S. Eliot, and he does so in conversation with negative theology, philosophical hermeneutics, critical theory, and postmodernism. The book’s stated objective is “a postmodern negative theology of poetic language” (ix) that is both theoretical and practical, contributing to both literary theory and theology and promoting peace through radical openness to dialogue, and it is to Franke’s credit that the result is both challenging and accessible.<br>

Abstract: According to David Cook, this is unlikely to be the beginning of the document, which, being of high religious tenor, would be expected to begin with the
            basmallah(in the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate).15The document’s religious tenor is unmistakable because of its repeated references to holy conventions and ancient models and by the fact that it lacks a political rationale for the bombing, aside from an oblique reference to the West and those enamored with it as having drunk of Hell.16Despite the missingbasmallah, the introductory section is effective in establishing religious tone. Three references help to accomplish this: the raid, the recitation, and the rather complex model of the Prophet’s life.<br>

Author(s): Pranger Burcht<br>
Abstract: Appearances notwithstanding, my argument is still concerned with the nature of
      confessioas it comprises time and eternity, memory and oblivion, gift and refusal. By using “comprises,” I mean in fact to raise the question of the seductive sonority ofConfessions. In order to honor that sonority, we should start out by taking literally Augustine's ways of addressing himself to his Confessee throughoutConfessions—from the “You are great, Lord, and highly to be praised” of the beginning to the “knocking on the door, thepulsare, accipereandinvenire” of the end.
            At this point, my criticism of Ricoeur for opening up an independent past and future in the face of eternity may help to specify the temporal nature of16
         confessio. Whereas we—all of us as shaped byConfessions’ afterlife—may be inclined to take the work in its historical sense and look at its author as confessing and reflecting in hindsight on the vicissitudes of his sinful life, his conversion, his subsequent failure to live up to the integrity of the conversional moment, and his meditations on memory, time, and creation,confessio’s razor forces us to be more precise. The fact that the confessor's linguistic hands are tied to the permanent focus/attentio perduratof thepraesens praesentiswould seem to wipe out the notion of hindsight and foresight—or, to put it more accurately—to confine it to the limited scope of thedistentio animi. Instead, what we observe is a confessor whose mind, distending for all it is worth, is at no time allowed to detach his memories and hopes from eternity's pressure on the here and now.<br>

Author(s): Thistleton Anthony C.<br>
Abstract: The first two chapters of the book are introductory in nature. In the first chapter, Thistleton sets out to justify the enterprise of hermeneutics by delineating its aim and scope and by distinguishing it from the enterprise of philosophy in general. In the second chapter, he contextualizes and integrates contemporary hermeneutics, through the most recent insights and developments, within biblical studies and literary theory. He concludes this chapter by arguing that a proper understanding of hermeneutics requires a multi- and interdisciplinary approach; such an approach is the impetus for chapter 3, which employs the parables of Jesus as a case study in how a multi-perspectival approach casts different shades and light on a given text. With this more general understanding of hermeneutics in hand, it is to the history and development of hermeneutics that he next turns. In the remaining fourteen chapters, he outlines that history beginning with classical Jewish and ancient Greek thought, tracing it through developments in early, medieval, and modern Christianity and following it on up to contemporary continental philosophy. He concludes this narrative arc by looking at some current approaches to hermeneutics, notably liberation and postcolonialist, feminist and womanist, and postmodernist. Clearly, the scope of the work is vast and the breadth of Thistleton's knowledge is encyclopedic, for it not only spans the history of hermeneutics as such but also engages interdisciplinary approaches in contemporary hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: The flowers sequence covers a period of exactly a week (the seven days of creation, perhaps?), beginning and ending in the middle of a day. As we move through the week, the rate of change increases exponentially: it takes eighteen seconds until night falls on day one, five and a half on day two, two on day three. The relative length of the last five days—5, 3, 2, 1, 1—forms a reverse Fibonacci series. (That series controls all kinds of botanical phemomena; if you count the petals on a daisy, for example, you will almost always find yourself with a Fibonacci number.) After that, the last day slows to what feels like a luxurious 2.7 seconds of almost steady flowers as the song's final, wordless harmony is heard. Then we fade to black.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: By characterizing Faustus's magic as efficacious only because his interest in it signified that he was inclined to be damned, Marlowe turned the aesthetic strategies of dramatic forms into instruments that produced effects that seemed to have soteriological consequences. Yet he dramatized the reformers' arguments not because he wrote his play to disciplinary ends (it is hard to imagine Marlowe having an interest in reforming his audience's faith). Rather, Marlowe made the aesthetics of
      Doctor Faustusinstrumental to increase the cultural and material power of his art. He knew full well that immediate, popular, and even naive theatrical experiences motivate the distribution of such power; from an ambitious and brilliantly cunning playwright's point of view, they are the means to that very end. And in writingDoctor Faustus, Marlowe was not just cunning, but fearless. If he argued, as Richard Baines claimed, that “the first beginning of Religion was only to keep men in awe,” it still could not have been an easy thing, when atheism was a felony and religious discourse saturated all of English life, to maintain such a demystifying view of the ideological function of the sacred.40Yet Marlowe used belief in the devil and in God himself as his dramatic instrument to wrench the psychic and social force of religious experience away from its dominant institutional contexts and to place it in the peripheral space of the theater, which he, above all his immediate contemporaries, was creating as a charged, extraordinary, and charismatic social space.<br>

Abstract: In comparison, the treatment of the concept of pollution indicates that it was ultimately distinguished from the notion of infection. In particular, H’s redaction of the priestly instructions depicts these types of pollution as severe forms of
      uncleannesswhich were antithetical to the divine presence. If these genital discharges, leprosy and corpse pollution had originally evoked a fear of infection, the threat associated with them was now limited to the sacred camp (Leviticus 15:31; Numbers 5:3; 19:13, 20). Though the profound ramifications of this reinterpretationof ṭumʾtahare beyond the scope of this article, suffice it to say that although the physiological danger associated with this concept had been neutralized, its powerful socio-religious influence—as reflected in subsequent Jewish and Christian traditions—was only beginning to be manifested.<br>

Abstract: Beyond this sampling of monographic treatments of witchcraft, I can only briefly allude to the tenor in relation to evil in a limited selection of edited collections. The volume edited by Kapferer (
         2002) stands firmly on the shoulders of Evans-Pritchard in beginning with and moving beyond the problem of rationality. One direction of this movement is emphasis on the “human-centric, person-centered and social nature of witchcraft’s practical reason that gives prime force to human agency” (7), and the assertion that “Sorcery fetishizes human agency, often one which it magically enhances, as the key mediating factor affecting the course or direction of human life-chances” (105).
               Another is the conjunction of witchcraft and sorcery with the conditions of modernism, postmodernism, the state, and postcoloniality, pushing analysis toward mythopoesis, metacosmology, and the imaginary rather than toward morality, while yet acknowledging their inherent violence and the monstrosity of their symbolism and practice. In contrast to this approach, the volume edited by Whitehead and Wright (13
            2004) on witchcraft and sorcery practiced by “dark shamans” in Amazonia directly confronts both the lethal violence and socio-cosmological centrality of these practices. This strategy avoids playing into either a renewal of irrationalizing colonial demonization in the name of suppression or romanticizing contemporary rehabilitation in the name of cultural diversity. Thus, Amazonian shamanism is a “predatory animism,” and in this sense its key symbol of the jaguar should be understood not as an endangered species but as a dangerous predator (Fausto2004:171). The witch or dark shaman is “the embodiment of evil in the world” because they “lack empathy for other humans and act for purely personal motives” (Heckenberger2004:179). For the Arara people there are explicit connections among morality, sorcery, and banishment with respect to people who forgo generosit~<br>

Author(s): Lehnhof Kent R.<br>
Abstract: When Margreta de Grazia looks upon this scene, she sees a man whose misfortunes have stripped him of selfhood. In his “
      nothaving,” de Grazia writes, Lear is reduced to “non-being.”
            Levinas, however, would see things differently. For Levinas, the king who kneels before Cordelia has not been plunged into “non-being” but has been moved “beyond being.” He has not ceased to be so much as he has begun to “be-otherwise.” This state of self-surrender is what Lear—and his play—has been groping toward from the very beginning. It is more than empathy, more than self-sacrifice, more than loving reciprocity. Edgar refers to it as “ripeness” (5.2.11), but Levinas calls it “passivity”—by which he does not mean inertia or apathy but rather a readiness to be moved by the other, to be called by him without anticipating or presuming to know what is required.41
         
            This passivity, Adriaan Peperzak writes, “is lived in the humility of a devotion that is not planned but undergone.” It is the way of transcendence, but it is also the way of suffering. “To live for others is to suffer, and even to suffer gratuitously, without meaning, for nothing, because only such a passion unquestioningly realizes the unchosen, entirely disinterested character of transcendent passivity.”42

Abstract: About eighty years later, the Tiberian writer Valerius Maximus followed Varro by dedicating a full book to religion within his collection of famous deeds and sayings. Clearly, Valerius Maximus’s
         Facta et dictais a not continuous historiography. The arrangement of the short narratives is not chronological, but topical. But we cannot stop at Friedrich Mueller’s apodictic “Valerius did not write history.”
               Historical accounts could include systematic treatment. Velleius Paterculus’ short universal history of the very early 30s also frequently interrupted chronological sequence by topical arrangement.67
            
               Valerius Maximus used past tense for his examples and wrote against the background and openly used a rich tradition of historiography. Presupposing a chronological framework consisting of famous wars and magistrates, Valerius frequently locates his less well known protagonists in the very beginning of such a narrative as elegantly as contemporaries, colleagues, and participants in an expedition and the like. Sometimes, the hint is given only at the end, even more clearly indicating his interest in the date.68
            
               The range of topics, including priesthoods, rituals, the building of and behavior in temples, and the veneration of different deities, betrays his notion of religion.69<br>

Journal Title: Modern Philology<br>
Article Title: Milton’s “Unoriginal” Voice: Quotation Marks in<br>

Abstract: Adam consoles Eve by telling her that we can safely entertain evil in mental space, so long as we do not approve it. While externalist readers of the dream scene almost unanimously claim that Adam is right, others remain dissatisfied with his answer.
         
               But I would argue that it is not his answer so much as the question it presupposes that we should be dissatisfied with. We might wonder why Adam does not pose a more pertinent question, namely, can evil come into the ear and go out of the mouth without leaving spot or blame behind? Can one relate dangerous and seductive words safely, without becoming in any sense their speaker and source? Can quotation marks insulate us from sin, allowing us to communicate dangerous ideas without getting entangled in them? What is at stake in speaking unoriginal words? That the question is not often asked is due partly to Adam’s success in framing “unde malum” as a question about what the mind, rather than the mouth, does. But Adam has an impressive theological tradition behind him. Augustine perhaps best exemplifies the desire to locate a mental fall as causal precursor to the physical act of eating the fruit. As William Poole describes it, “Augustine replaced one human fall with at least two, one happening in the mind, one in public.”30
            
               The other possibility, of a verbal rather than a mental transgression as the beginning of sin, has provoked much less theological speculation. But it does occasionally find a voice, as it did in Milton’s contemporary Richard Allestree, who argues in his wonderfully titled31
            Government of the Tongue(1675): “Original sin came first out of the mouth by speaking, before it entred in by eating. So lyable alas! is speech to be deprav’d, that the Scripture describes it as the source of all our other depravation.”

Abstract: One needs to look no further than the best-known cosmogonic text, the
               Enuma Elish. For not only does this, like the “Heptameron,” begin with an instance of the phonic alliteration habitual in incipits everywhere (EnumaElish, Bereishitbara, Ying-yangNone, Big-bang: as though it were intuitively felt that every beginning was itself a repetition), but the Akkadian text also begins with a series of parallel verses that synthesize a conception of the real as separation into relative parts:
                     
                  When the sky above was not named,
                     And the earth beneath did not yet bear a name,
                  
                     
                  And the first-born Apsû, who begat them,
                     And Mummu-Tiamat, the mother of all,
                  
                     
                  Their waters were mingled together:
                     The fields were not yet formed; no reeds were to be seen.
                  
                     
                  When the gods had none of them been called into being,
                     Did not yet bear a name, or have a destiny assigned.
                  
                     
               Among them, the gods were created:
                     Lahmu and Lahamu were brought forth, called by name.
                     —
                  Enuma Elish, 1–10<br>

Abstract: See Harold Van Buren Magonigle, "The Preparation of Working Drawings,"
               Architectural Review(Boston) 26 (Dec. 1909). Magonigle, another former employee of McKim, Mead and White, became in the beginning of the twentieth century an architect of notice as a designer of large number of upscale houses and the author of entries to numerous national competitions. He was another major contributor to various architectural periodicals, and, around the 1930, an editor of thePencil Pointsmagazine. He wrote extensively on various aspects of architectural practice—ranging from the questions of style to various rendering techniques to reminiscences of his work in the office of McKim, Mead and White—but gave special to the subject of working drawings.<br>

Abstract: 3. A brief account of the crucial role of the 1790s in these developments, focusing on the complementary achievements of Haydn and Beethoven. For Beethoven, Haydn's and Mozart's music was, precisely, modern. Together, he and Haydn dominated the Viennese scene, producing ever-more-imposing masterworks in every genre except opera. This explicitly modernist orientation was fostered, if not indeed in part created, by their patrons. After 1800 Beethoven maintained and further developed this same tradition. These years "between" Enlightenment and Romanticism were no mere transition; they constituted an equally weighty phase, on the same historical-structural "level," as those that preceded and followed it. Concomitantly, Romanticism as such did not become predominant in music until 1815, in Viennese music (except for the Lied) perhaps not even until 1828/30. For both reasons, it makes sense to regard the beginning of the music-historical nineteenth century as having been "delayed," until around 1815 or 1830.<br>

Abstract: Although narrative inquiry has a long intellectual history both in and out of education, it is increasingly used in studies of educational experience. One theory in educational research holds that humans are storytelling organisms who, individually and socially, lead storied lives. Thus, the study of narrative is the study of the ways humans experience the world. This general concept is refined into the view that education and educational research is the construction and reconstruction of personal and social stories; learners, teachers, and researchers are storytellers and characters in their own and other's stories. In this paper we briefly survey forms of narrative inquiry in educational studies and outline certain criteria, methods, and writing forms, which we describe in terms of beginning the story, living the story, and selecting stories to construct and reconstruct narrative plots. Certain risks, dangers, and abuses possible in narrative studies are discussed. We conclude by describing a two-part research agenda for curriculum and teacher studies flowing from stories of experience and narrative inquiry.<br>

Publisher: Carfax Publishing Co.<br>
Issue: i260459<br>
Date: 3 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Willis Kevin J.<br>
Abstract: This article draws upon theories from a wide range of disciplines, including cultural studies and literary theory, to analyse representations of schooling in rock and pop songs. The songs selected cover a period from the beginning of rock 'n' roll in the 1950s, to Britpop and the present. It is argued that schooling is overwhelmingly represented as the antithesis of leisure and that in the 1960s conjuncture the representations of schooling became more and more critical. Even so, the resolution to the perceived oppression of schooling takes place at an imaginary level of fantasy. Other features of these representations are discussed, including the challenge provided in pop and rock songs to the notion of schools as spaces where relationships, romantic and/ or sexual, do not take place. The way in which temporal aspects of schooling are represented and the division between clock time and time as experienced is discussed. The formal analysis is located within a larger project of ideology critique and its strengths and weaknesses are signalled.<br>

Abstract: Recent study of the nature of textuality as such opens new insights for the study of the Bible. Although individual parts of the Bible have oral antecedents, the Bible as a whole has existed only as a text, and a unique kind of text, folded back on itself out of communal memory as no other book has been. A text is a monument. Textuality establishes a special relationship between discourse and death. Spoken words are exchanges between living persons. The text presents its message as well if its author is dead as it does if he or she is alive. Print is even more bound to death than writing is. In comparison with oral performance-delivery of an oration, song-a text physically has certain special alliances with past time. All texts come out of the past. Literature as text is psychologically retrospective: its effects typically include an element of nostalgia. Because of its future orientation, culminating in the closing words of Revelation, "Come, Lord Jesus" (as against typical narrative closes such as "They lived happily ever after"), the Bible has an unusual relationship to textuality: it is not literature in the way other texts are. Typical narrative plot structures existence retrospectively: the story is organized back from the conclusion. This retrospective organization is maximized by writing, which tightens plot and makes more of re-cognition, a kind of return to the beginning (the past) and hence a cyclic pattern. In addition to being related intimately to death, writing and print are also limitlessly fecund, the central forces in the evolution of consciousness, once they appear. The fecundity of writing and print, like other fecundity in human existence, is achieved by passage through death. "Unless the grain of wheat dies." The Word of God in the Person of Jesus Christ is conceived of by analogy with the spoken word. The Father speaks the Word, the Son (eo verbum quo filius); he does not write the Word, who would then by biblical attestation be not life but d~<br>

Abstract: Garber: "It might be supposed that the word symptom itself began as a medical term
and became more broadly and metaphorically applied, over time, to other realms of inquiry, but
in fact this is not the case. Symptoms were from the beginning broadly defined cultural indica-
tors; it is symptomatic of our own desire to classify, categorize, and limit, that we should think of
them in a more restricted pathological sense" [3].

Abstract: Kenneth Burke, like a number of contemporary theorists, believes that we inhabit structures of words and that they inhabit us. But Burke goes on to stress that we constantly shuttle between two very different linguistic modes: logic and narrative. We can translate any set of logical ideas into a corresponding story, replete with plot, characters, and images and framed in time. By such a move we gain the direction of a beginning, the momentum of a crossing, and the goal of an ending-and thus augment the power of our rhetoric. But our narratives may become too rhetorically powerful, as with those scapegoat narratives that lead to the sacrifice of innocent victims. So occasionally, for our own safety and the safety of others, we must translate the drama of a narrative back into its atemporal principles, where contradictions may become more apparent and the rush toward victimage may be checked. Burke illustrates all these doctrines using the first three chapters of Genesis and other classic texts.<br>

Issue: i20010363<br>

Author(s): Peters Gary<br>
Abstract: This essay is concerned with an initial mapping out of a model of intersubjectivity that, viewed within the context of education, breaks with the hegemonic dialogics of current pedagogies. Intent on rethinking the (so-called) "problem" of solipsism for phenomenology in terms of a pedagogy that situates itself within solitude and the alterity of self and other, Maurice Blanchot and Emmanuel Levinas will here speak as the voices of this other mode of teaching. Beginning with the problematization of intersubjectivity in romantic aesthetics and hermeneutics, I introduce the concept of irony as a crucial element in the conceptualization of this other pedagogical model, one that requires, initially, a discussion of Husserl's response to the charge of solipsism in the 5th Cartesian Meditation. As a starting point I introduce his symmetrical notion of bodily "pairing" into a consideration of rhetoric, understood here as an integral part of teaching, thus forging links with phenomenology via the work of Merleau-Ponty. The above provides a context for an extended discussion of pedagogy as it appears in the work of Blanchot and Levinas. Although similar in many respects, on closer inspection it will emerge that important differences are evident in the dissymmetrical and asymmetrical models suggested by the two thinkers respectively. These differences, I will argue, begin to open up a critical perspective on Levinas' "height" model of teaching in the name of the more radical configuration of phenomenology and rhetoric to be found in Blanchot.<br>

Abstract: Academia's mathematical metaphysics are briefly explored en route to an elaboration of the qualitatively rigorous requirements underpinning the calibration and unambiguous interpretation of quantitative instrumentation in any science. Of particular interest are Gadamer's emphases on number as the paradigm of the noetic, on the role of play in interpretation, and on Hegel's sense of method as the activity of the thing itself that thought experiences. These point toward and overlap with (1) Latour's study of the metrological social networks through which technological phenomena are brought into language as modes of being that can be understood, and (2) the way that Rasch's models for measurement comprise a potential beginning for metaphysically astute, qualitatively and quantitatively integrated, mathematical methods in the social sciences. The paper closes with observations on the general problem that is philosophy, the need to remain open to multiplicities of meaning even as clear understandings are sought and obtained.<br>

Abstract: This article reviews some new international releases in the field of discourse analysis in the tradition of Michel FOUCAULT. This kind of Foucauldian discourse analysis is related to other forms in the wider interdisciplinary field of discourse analysis. Nonetheless, it can be demonstrated that the Foucauldian form of discourse analysis is the most relevant one for contemporary analysis in the social sciences. It is argued that in the German social sciences the term "discourse analysis" is primarily used for theoretical social research or is used for empirical social research, without disclosing discourse-analytic methodology. Since the 1990s, the development of empirical methodologies for social discourse analysis in Germany has intensified. From it's beginning in the late 1960s, French methodology of discourse analysis has been empirically orientated. Here, the work of Michel PÊCHEUX is the central influence in which the epistemology of discourse analysis is thoroughly discussed and theorized. In France, PÊCHEUX continued the work of Michel FOUCAULT and, since then, one can speak of a Foucauldian tradition of discourse analysis, namely "French Discourse Analysis" (FDA). This review outlines the state-of- the-art of the transformation of Foucauldian discourse theory into a discourse-analytic methodology as a new kind of qualitative social research. For this reason, the influence and the analytic tools of linguistics are critically reviewed and a comparison of FDA in France and Foucauldian discourse analysis in Germany is undertaken. The first book reviewed is a British monograph from Glyn WILLIAMS that describes the development of French discourse analysis in the context of structuralism and post-structuralism. The book contains a thorough update of French discourse analysis and is path breaking for German readers of the discourse-analytic work of Michel PÊCHEUX. The volume comes on the heels of a new German handbook of social discourse analysis (edited by KELLER; ~<br>

Abstract: Une des thèses les plus importantes de l'historien français Alphonse Dupront affirme que la mort de la Chrétienté est un élément crucial de la modernité européenne. Le présent article, fondé sur une interprétation de la correspondance diplomatique de Philippe Canaye de Fresnes, ambassadeur de France à Venise durant l'Interdit vénitien (1606-1607), étudie la survie de l'idée de Chré tienté au début du XVIIe siècle. À travers les lettres de Canaye de Fresnes, on peut voir qu'un usage catholique mais antiromain du concept de Chrétienté semble possible. A favourite assumption of the french historian Alphonse Dupront is the idea that the death of Christendom is a crucial element of european modernity. The present work, based on an interpretation of the diplomatic dispatches of Philippe Canaye de Fresnes, the french ambassador in Venice during the Venetian Interdict (1606-1607), deals with the survival of the idea of Christendom at the beginning of the 17th century. Through the letters of Canaye de Fresnes, one can see that a catholic but antiromanist use of the conceipt of Christendom seems possible.<br>

Abstract: Two visions of homicide, murderers and victims are contrasted. One, conventional in criminology, has it that murders are the culmination of drawn-out, acrimonious transactions occurring within demographically homogeneous sectors of the population. It leads to a blurring of moral identities and causal relations. The other is championed by homicide 'survivors' organizations, and it claims an existentially validated authority. Homicide is experienced by 'survivors' as a chaotic episode which gives way to strong, antagonistic archetypes of victim and offender. The two visions are examined, in part, to promote an appreciation of the analytic complexities of the phenomenon of murder; in part, to point to the fraught politics that are beginning to emerge around resolving the character of murder.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses the combination of theology and humanism by reflecting on Christian identity. Beginning with Paul Ricoeur's theory of fiction as a laboratory of 'imaginative variations' on the possibilities of ethical selfhood, I ask: if the world projected by the Christian scriptures overturns human possibilities, what happens to the Christian self's ethical responsibility? I analyse the motion pictures Fight Club, Memento, and The Matrix to interpret extreme cases or 'unimaginable variations' on the theme of conversion among broken, fragmented, and manipulated selves. I argue that The Matrix presents a form of conversion most conducive to fulfilling ethical responsibility.<br>

Abstract: The christology of the French Jesuit Joseph Moingt, L'homme qui venait de Dieu (published in 1993), is part of the younger history of narrative theology. Referring to the christology of Rahner and Balthasar, Jüngel and Pannenberg, Moingt is "reconstructing" the history of faith in the horizon of the narrative time of the Gospel. The criterion for this "reconstruction" is the history – of God and men – which follows the path of the Gospel's texts and which has been orientated from the beginning to future. Jesus Christ is "announced as the man who has to come and whom the whole world attended", the man "coming from the future and who is the future of men, because of illuminating for all men the way to the future". Joseph Moingt's "théologie du récit" récit" to the discussion about the foundation of systematic christology. The following article presents the principal idea of Moingt's christology, it is governed by the question of the Christ's preexistence. This is the central point in the discussions about the importance of narrativity in actual dogmatics.<br>

Abstract: The new theology of revelation in dealing with the inspiration of the Scriptures has to face the problem of time. Such a theory should neither be based on the concept of a pure „inspiration at the beginning“ nor on the „inspiration of the reader“. Whilst the former alone is unsatisfactory the latter would abandon the normativity of Scriptures and Tradition. By drawing on some ideas of Paul Ricoeur, the article develops an understanding of inspiration that is guided by the concept of „pneumatological passivity“. This pneumatological perspective enables under the aspect of time a „narrative“ understanding of the identity of the church.<br>

Author(s): Shechterman Deborah<br>
Abstract: Original Sin is considered to be a uniquely Christian doctrine. Nevertheless, an analysis of apparently forgotten Jewish treatises — most of which are to be found only in manuscript form — reveals that an extraordinary philosophical theory of Original Sin is present in late medieval Jewish thought. It implies, therefore, a new dimension in characterising this doctrine and has implications for the understanding of the process of inter-communicating of Jewish and Christian thought. This study focuses on fundamental Jewish passages, beginning with Apocalyptic literature and ending with medieval philosophical texts. Yet, the examination of those Hebrew texts is carried out in the light of the writing of Christian scholars. This means that the attempt to clarify this Jewish doctrine is made, from a methodological viewpoint, both by looking at the development of this doctrine trough the history of the Jewish thought, and by a close examination of the parallel general sources. It is only then that one can see that rudiments of the Christian doctrine of Original Sin were inserted into the Aristotelian theory of Nature, and combined with elements from Maimonides' Biblical-allegoric exegesis.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo está orientado a precisar las relaciones entre experiencia corporal de las mujeres y testimonio. Un largo hábito de subalternidad ha expropiado a las mujeres de la posibilidad de tomar la palabra sobre sus experiencias corporales. Es por ello la importancia que tiene la singularidad de sus testimonios, que implica tomar la palabra en una situación de imposibilidad del lenguaje; es siempre el relato de un acontecimiento traumático del que se habla, pero del que también podría no hablarse. El sujeto/a que toma la palabra da cuenta de un conocimiento que - si bien es precario - constituye un saber del que antes no se tenía registro. Es que el testimonio pone en juego la relación entre la lengua y el archivo. Exige una subjetividad que atestigüe sobre la posibilidad misma de hablar, un/a sujeto capaz de pronunciar lo "inaudito", produciendo con su palabra una intervención ética. La autoridad del testimonio depende de una relación inmemorial entre lo indecible y lo decible, produce una palabra que nombra una experiencia singular. Las palabras de las mujeres que relatan experiencias corporales nombran una dimensión fundamental de nuestra experiencia, la de la diferencia sexual produciendo un dislocamiento en la presunta neutralidad de la lengua. Se trata de una reflexión que abre la posibilidad de poner palabras a lo innombrable. The aim of this article is to specify the relationships between corporal experiences of women and testimony. A long habit of subordination has expropriated the women of the possibility of speaking of their bodily experiences. Thus, the importance of the singularity of their testimonies, which implies beginning to speak in a situation of impossibility of the language. This is always the account of a traumatic event, but which could also not be spoken about. The individual who speaks shows an awareness that, even though insufficient, constitutes a knowledge that has not been registered before. The testimony brings into play the link b~<br>

Abstract: Why is the problem of beginning – much discussed in literary scholarship – not dealt with in similar depth by historians? This article attempts an answer to this question, and does so in three ways. First, it examines literary scholarship on textual openings, showing the various ways in which the beginning is given significance. Then, it examines and challenges the common presentation of historical discourse as distinct from fiction. Finally, it examines two sets of data: the openings of 100 historical monographs are analysed for their 'fictionality', and the openings of 200 research articles are analysed for their rhetorical structures.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I take issue with Heidegger's use of the concept of death as a means of disclosing human finitude. I argue that Being-towards-death is inadequate to the disclosure of Dasein's thrownness which is necessary for the kind of authentic historizing that Heidegger describes and furthermore leads to a reading of authenticity which is preclusive of Being-with-Others. I suggest that this difficulty may be alleviated through increased attention to the opposite boundary of Dasein's existence, namely its birth. Although I do not pursue the project here of conducting a phenomenology of birth, I suggest some directions for proceeding with that task, and I illustrate that a greater emphasis on Dasein's beginning will increase the richness of our understanding of our Being-with-Others.<br>

Abstract: This article offers an examination of Lee Hirsch's Amandla!: A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony. Beginning with the liberation songs that gained salience during the National Party's implementation of apartheid policy in 1948 and ending with the struggle songs of a post-1994 democratic South Africa, the documentary's aim is to retrieve and recount the role of freedom songs in antiapartheid struggle. Using the writings of Ernesto Laclau, John Mbiti, Paul Ricoeur, and Alfred Schutz, this essay will argue that liberation songs are ancestral text that were partly used by antiapartheid activists to create their collective identities. This essay will further argue that Amandla! set itself the task of retrieving South Africa's liberation songs and liberation's praise singers from the ancestral region John Mbiti calls Zamani to a region he calls Sasa. However, this essay will assert that the ancestral retrieval task of this documentary is compromised by the documentary's privileging of the hegemonic groups within the African National Congress (ANC), the documentary's presentation of the ANC as a monolithic and univocal organization, and the producer's snowball sampling method. Arguing that this documentary relegates some of the South African struggle experiences into Zamani, this essay will attempt to correct these omissions and broaden the context of liberation songs.<br>

a human does; it is about the doing which a human is" (op.cit., p. 8). And even Daniel Stern
seems to see "the self" as a human construction, even though his theory, in my view, is only
plausible when the existence of personal agency (not only its potential) is assumed from the
beginning.<br>

Abstract: TM, XXIX, XXXII. Steen says "it appears that Dooyeweerd is saying that the human race
as a totality represented in Adam and Eve (stamvader en stammoeder) was created by God in
the beginning. All that will unfold and be subject to the temporal process of becoming is
present here as finished creation. There would seem to be a root community of hearts
represented in the heart of the first representative root, Adam." (Structure, p. 65)<br>

Abstract: Speaking about GB Desmond pointed out to me: "I would say the texts are hugely in
favor of an archeology that makes us porous again to the (divine) at work in the most intimate
and forgotten recesses of "selving" — that is one reason I am unhappy with teleologies that
somehow want to construct the good out of a movement to the end — while the beginning is a
merely indeterminate lack."<br>

Abstract: This addition is important, because meanwhile we know how greatly the regulation of
breathing, heartbeat and transpiration is influenced by learning processes, emotions and
concentrated attention. Research in the 1960s indicated that directing attention inwards
increases the heartbeat, while directing the attention outside oneself results in a lower pulse.
Very well known is Pavlov's experiment at the beginning of the previous century, in which he
succeeded to stimulate salivating in dogs by association of stimuli; after a number of successive
food offerings in combination with an auditory stimulus (a bell), it proved sufficient that the
bell sounded for the dog to salivate. The interlacement of the biotic (salivating) and the
psychical (learning processes) substructures, then, is very strong.<br>

Abstract: Dieser Aufsatz greift auf die Forschungen des Altgermanisten Friedrich Ohly zurück, der die Geisteswissenschaften durch eine metaphern-orientierte Forschung neu stimulieren wollte: Metaphern, so Friedrich Ohly, seien nicht Restbestände, sondern Grundbestände menschlichen Lebens. Besonders die religiöse Sprache komme nicht ohne Metaphern aus. So sei die Beziehung zwischen Gott und den Menschen allein metaphorisch zu versprachlichen. Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird der metaphern-orientierte Zugang von Friedrich Ohly auf die Metapher „Gotteskind“ bzw. „Gotteskindschaft“ angewendet. Näherhin analysiert der Beitrag die Prägekraft der Metapher „Gotteskind“ bzw. „Gotteskindschaft“ mit Blick auf die Taufliturgie und die Tauftheologie der Alten Kirche. Unabhängig von seinem biologischen Alter – so geben sich die Jesus-Anhänger von Anfang an überzeugt – wird der Christ jung in der Taufe und bleibt jung, wenn er seine Taufberufung in Treue bewahrt. So seien als Schlüsselgedanken des vorliegenden Aufsatzes hervorgehoben: erstens die Taufe als geistliche Geburt und Anfang der Kindwerdung; zweitens die metaphorische Rede von der Taufeucharistie als Milch, welche als lebenslängliche geistliche Speise für die Gotteskinder gilt (1 Petr 2,2). This article examines the research of Friedrich Ohly, a medievalist who sought to stimulate spiritual understanding through thought which explored the significance of metaphor. For him, metaphors were not merely the remains, but parts of the active inventory of human life. Religious language, in particular, could not do without them. The relationship between God and man could be articulated only by metaphoric means. In this article Ohly's approach is applied to the metaphor of 'God's Child', or 'Divine Filiation'. The article seeks to analyse the power of the impression of the metaphor itself with a view to the baptismal liturgy and baptismal theology of the ancient Church. From the very beginning Christians had been convinced that new believers be~<br>

Abstract: The Earth’s Children series of prehistoric novels by Jean M. Auel, beginning with
         The Clan of the Cave Bear(1980) and culminating inThe Land of Painted Caves(2010), contains a compelling vision of two species of human practising two utterly different kinds of religion. On the one hand there are the Neanderthals, who practice a pure totemism, while on the other there are the anatomically modern humans, whose religion centres on the worship of an Earth Goddess. Auel’s heroine, Ayla, straddles both religious spheres, but she herself initiates a crisis within the anatomically modern human religious world. This article examines the different fictional religions in these popular and influential books, considers the sources Auel drew on in creating them and considers the influence these books may exert on public understanding of religion, including among future cohorts of students of religion.<br>

Abstract: Fieldwork is sometimes marked by experiences of frictions and frustration. Fieldwork with mobile street vendors in an African city may confront the fieldworker with the problem of locating the 'field' and attaining access to it, both spatially and temporally. As I will show by reference to my fieldwork with a group of shoe vendors on the streets of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the frictions that occurred at the beginning of my fieldwork nevertheless ignited a process of ethnographic knowledge-gaining that led me to understand the importance of temporality and rhythmicity for the shoe vendors' practices. In their active engagement with the spatio-temporal landscape of the city, the street vendors organised their practices as an experiential rhythm that unfolded as sequences of rising and subsequently declining cognitive and corporeal tensions. These rhythms did not flow smoothly, but were necessarily interspersed with disturbances and frictions by the rhythms of other pedestrians in the streets, whose attention the street vendors tried to attain.<br>

Abstract: French politics in the 1970s is notoriously hard to decipher. The increasingly violent attacks on Gaullism and Communism, the decline in French geopolitical power, and the end of postwar economic growth led to unprecedented unease about the nation's collective future. But rather than treat the 1970s as an endpoint, I argue in this article that the 1970s represented a new beginning. I explore how more modest conceptions of political action, the emergence of a new kind of liberalism, and the development of identity politics led to a profound transformation of French political culture – one that tried to reconcile France's long statist tradition with the realities of an ever-more fragmented polity.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: i25010989<br>
Date: 10 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Louden Bruce<br>
Abstract: Some sixty times in the Iliad and Odyssey, the narrator describes a sequence of events with the climactic phrase, "And now X would have happened, had not Y intervened." Though some recent studies have begun to focus on this narrative technique, a fuller accounting of its properties remains desirable, as many of the passages where it is employed are quite significant to the overall construction of the plots. I have termed the phenomenon pivotal contrafactuals. The present study argues that the composer achieves three general narrative benefits by employing this device. First, it is a method for emphatically changing the direction of the plot (hence the adjective "pivotal"). Second, it allows the narrator to confer added emphases of various kinds upon the events he describes. Third, the narrator often uses the construction to make an editorial comment upon the character on whose behalf the intervention occurs. Intriguingly, Homer appears to link some pivotal contrafactuals together through various means. Some occur as equivalent elements in different multiforms of a common type scene. Some occur in different narratives describing the same event. These latter raise the possibility that divine intervention of which he is unaware occurs in Odysseus's narrative of his wanderings. Finally, I suggest that a passage at the beginning of the Catalogue of Ships, which has attracted various interpretations, is a modified pivotal contrafactual.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342993<br>
Date: 5 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Sternberg Nancy<br>
Abstract: Hayden White's perhaps richest and most profoundly argued book, The Content of the Form, touches many nerves in the American historical profession. The entirety of the book, from its premises through its most thoughtful exegeses of historical writing, insists that linguistic form is the primary carrier of content in historical writing, indeed, in historical knowledge. This insistence on a respectful and careful attention to the formal usages of nonfiction prose, truth-claiming language, goes well against the grain of American tastes. As de Tocqueville presciently and correctly predicted, when Americans take to literature in a serious way, they won't have much patience with precise matters of form. Hayden White's narrative theory has had uphill work to penetrate this pervasive indifference, especially among historians. He has been joined in recent decades by Paul Ricoeur, whose Time and Narrative, beginning from different premises and a slightly different question, arrives at a sympathetic and complementary analysis of historical narrative. In spite of White's published hesitations about the political/philosophical tendencies of Ricoeur's work, I am convinced that their books are mutually supporting and, in an important cultural sense, belong together. Altogether, however, I do feel that the main import and justification of this present essay must rest on my quite serious reading of Hayden White's best joke, a profound shaggy dog story about the historian monk of St. Gall.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342993<br>
Date: 5 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Carr Steven G.<br>
Abstract: If, as many historians and theorists now believe, narrative is the form proper to historical explanation, this raises the problem of the terms in which such narratives are to be evaluated. Without a clear account of evaluation, the status of historical knowledge (both in itself and in all those social, political, and other contexts in which appeal to historical explanation is made) remains obscure. Beginning with the view, found in Hayden White and others, that historical narrative constitutes a meaning not reducible to the factual content it engages, this essay argues that such meaning can arise only through a synthesis of cognitive and normative discourses. Narrative combines "heterogeneous" language games in such a way that neither appeal to "truth content" nor to "justice" suffices to decide the question of which of two competing historical explanations is, as a whole, superior. Examining in critical detail the opposed positions on this issue articulated by two recent theorists-Frank Ankersmit ("narrative idealism") and David Carr ("narrative realism")-the paper concludes that the debate between those who hold that historical narratives should be judged in essentially cognitive terms and those who hold that they should be judged in essentially political terms cannot be resolved and that a philosophical view of historical narrative that is neither realist nor idealist needs to be developed.<br>

Abstract: From the beginning of his career, sixteenth-century playwright Angelo Beolco (also known as Ruzante, the name of the peasant character he created and played) declared his anguish at the worsening of the peasants' economic and political position. Illegitimate child of the authoritarian patriarch of a minor noble family beginning its decline and (probably) a household servant likely of peasant origin, he appears to have identified with the peasants' exclusion from governing institutions and the blocking of their access to wealth. At first, the Evangelical reform movement, with its emphasis on justice for the poor, appealed to him as an effective instrument for persuading the powerful to correct the situation. That hope having proved illusory, Beolco passed through a rapid evolution of beliefs that calls into question Lucien Febvre's theory of the parameters of religious experience in the Renaissance. The present article explores this evolution.<br>

Publisher: University of North Carolina Press<br>
Issue: i344318<br>
Date: 6 1, 1973<br>
Author(s): Williame Herman<br>
Abstract: The opposition between phenomenological sociology and Durkeimian sociology is not as absolute as it is often presented. The various ways in which Durkheim's work has been read by phenomenological authors throughout the last fifty years testify to a development toward greater proximity, implying changes in phenomenologists' interpretation of Durkheim as well as in their own starting points. Beginning with an exposition of one of the most antithetical stands towards Durkheim, the article points out different phases of the aforementioned development: (1) A more or less total opposition; (2) A positive view of the challenged that phenomenologists can find a Durkheim's work and an attempt to incorporate it into their own viewpoints without really changing the latter; (3) A simultaneous reinterpretation of Durkheim's sociologism and the pehnomenological notions of subjectivity and intentionality, on the common basis of a renewed insight into the corporeal character of human social phenomena.<br>

Author(s): Noiriel Gérard<br>
Abstract: L'œuvre de Max Weber commence à être mieux connue du public français grâce à la traduction d'un nombre croissant de ses écrits et à la parution d'un grand nombre d'ouvrages le concernant. L'examen de ces publications récentes montre que les polémiques opposant sociologues et philosophes à propos du «vrai» Weber, polémiques qui se sont intensifiées au cours des années 1960, polarisent aujourd'hui encore le débat sur cet auteur. Néanmoins, les nouveaux éclairages concernant «l'épistémologie» wébérienne permettent de mieux cerner le dilemme auquel Weber a été confronté, dilemme qui reste le nôtre: comment un chercheur en sciences sociales peut-il justifier et défendre sa pratique empirique, sans abandonner le terrain des sciences sociales au profit d'une argumentation sur les fondements de la connaissance empruntée aux philosophes néokantiens? Max Weber's work is beginning to enjoy a wider audience in France due to the translation of a growing number of his writings and the publication of many works devoted to him. An examination of these recent publications shows that the polemics opposing sociologists and philosophers with regard to the "real" Weber – arguments that intensified during the 1960s – are still alive today. Nevertheless, the new perspectives on Weberian "epistemology" allow us gain a sharper view of the dilemma that once confronted Weber and continues to confront us: how can a researcher in the social sciences justify and defend his or her empirical practice without abandoning the terrain of the social sciences and shifting to an argument on the foundations of knowledge borrowed from neo-Kantian philosophy?<br>

Abstract: The appearance of diverse strands of post-processual archaeology resonates with the transformation of university structures, beginning in the 1970s, and gives voice to concerns that have been variously labelled post-structuralist, deconstructionist or critical theory. This article examines the resonance of the post-processual archaeologies with wider social and intellectual currents in the context of the ongoing confrontation with processual archaeology, attempts at a critical engagement with structuralism and symbolic anthropology, and rapprochement with history. It considers the implications of these perspectives.<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i371935<br>
Date: 12 1, 1899<br>
Author(s): Zeilinski R. Drew<br>
Abstract: This paper considers the temporal relationship between account and story in the narrative passages of Pindar's odes. Highly selective, each narrative covers a vast extent of story-time, creating rapidly juxtaposed tableaux. The account typically begins near the end of the story, proceeding backwards by stages until it reaches the beginning. Thence it returns through all, some, or none of the intermediary stages until it has reached its starting point, beyond which it may then continue forward in time. Prophecy and foreshadowing provide a counterpoint to this basically analeptic structure. Different story lines, simultaneous events, and alternative possibilities all find their place in the narrative. The length of account-time is generally less than that of story-time and diminishes as the narrative proceeds. Repetition is necessitated by the backward and then forward order of combination as well as serving other purposes. Elaboration, when it occurs, serves to explain events that are improbable or inconsistent with the maxims contained in the non-narrative passages.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i369550<br>

Author(s): Rüsen Jörn<br>
Abstract: Much international and intercultural discourse about historiography is influenced by a way of historical thinking deeply rooted in human historical consciousness and that works throughout all cultures and in all times: ethnocentrism. Ethnocentric history conceives of identity in terms of "master-narratives" that define togetherness and difference as essential for identity in a way that causes tension and struggle. These narratives conceive of history in terms of "clashes of civilizations," and they reinforce the idea that international and intercultural relations are merely struggles for power. The main elements of ethnocentrism are: asymmetrical evaluation, teleological continuity, and centralized perspective. This essay articulates possibilities for overcoming these three elements by replacing asymmetrical evaluation with normative equality; teleological continuity with reconstructive concepts of development that emphasize contingency and discontinuity; and centralized perspectives with multi-perspectivity and polycentric approaches to historical experience. Adopting these possibilities would lead to a new mode of universal history rooted in a concept of humankind that can help solve the problem of ethnocentrism. This idea of humankind conceptualizes the unity of the human species as being manifest in a variety of cultures and historical developments. This is in fact the traditional concept of historicism, which can be further developed towards a historiography that responds to the challenges of globalization and cultural differences. The essay outlines theoretical and methodological means in historical studies that bring this idea of humankind into the work of historians, thus enabling them to contribute to a new culture of recognition. The article is based on the assumption that the creation of such a culture is the most important task of scholarly work in the humanities in general, and historical studies in particular, at the beginning of the twenty-first centu~<br>

Author(s): Schreiner Sabine<br>
Abstract: En analysant l'épisode de la lettre à Johnson publiée en avril 1966 par "Témoignage chrétien" et "Cité nouvelle," Sabine Rousseau décrit les mécanismes d'une mobilisation, alors pionnière, contre la guerre du Vietnam. Au lendemain de Vatican II, l'enracinement chrétien confère à cet engagement une forme originale, caractéristique d'un tiers-mondisme fondé moins sur les théories de l'impérialisme que sur le sentiment de la responsabilité chrétienne dans le drame vietnamien. /// The publication in "Cité nouvelle" and "Témoignage chrétien," on 21 April 1966, of an appeal to President Johnson marked the French Protestant and Catholic left's entry in the fight against the Vietnam war. Although somewhat late in their mobilization with respect to the Peace Movement, the commitment was early enough considering the dominant silence outside communist and communist sympathizer circles. As a sequel to the struggle for decolonization, this commitment took the original form of a letter to the president of the US. The feeling of Christian responsibility for the history of imperialism overtook the political analysis of the war. After a difficult beginning, the public opinion campaign grew during the summer, favored by the escalation of violence in Vietnam. But to the most committed left Christian militants, the campaign seemed already insufficient. Their radicalization in the fall of 1966 prepared for a mobilization in which the specific Christian commitment gave way to common action with the anti-imperialist movements.<br>

Abstract: L'étude de l'engagement de "Frères du Monde" contre la guerre du Vietnam (1965-1973) permet de mettre en évidence les tensions existant entre la sphère du religieux et celle du politique, au sein d'un groupe de catholiques engagés, au cours de la décennie marquée par mai 68. Au début de la guerre du Vietnam, en février 1965, cette revue catholique, dirigée par des Franciscains bordelais, prend une position originale dans les milieux chrétiens: elle condamne très rapidement et très fermement l'intervention américaine. Ses rédacteurs "témoignent" en faveur du peuple vietnamien et dénoncent, en termes marxistes-léninistes, l'impérialisme américain. A travers les analyses, les prises de positions et les actions de "Frères du Monde" à propos du Vietnam, c'est le glissement vers le gauchisme d'une fraction minoritaire de la gauche chrétienne que l'on peut observer. Après 1968, le discours de la revue sur la guerre du Vietnam perd toute référence religieuse pour devenir, apparemment, exclusivement politique. Il reflète cependant une évolution théologique qui conduit des Franciscains, destinés à l'origine à la Mission, vers une théologie de la Libération, en gestation, à la même époque, en Amérique latine. L'engagement de "Frères du Monde" contre la guerre du Vietnam prend fin prématurément en septembre 1971. Alors que les combats redoublent de violence, la rédaction de la revue ne s'exprime plus sur cette guerre. En proie à des divisions internes, la revue disparaît au cours de l'année 1973. /// The study of "Frères du Monde's" commitment against the Vietnam War brings to the fore the tensions existing between the religious field and the political one, within a group of politically involved Catholics during the decade around May 1968. At the beginning of the Vietnam War, in February 1965, this Catholic review, published by a Franciscan friary from Bordeaux, takes an original stand among Christian circles: it quickly and firmly comdemns the American military intervention.

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i40008393<br>
Date: 1 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Browne M. Neil<br>
Abstract: The doctrine of comparable worth is frequently denounced by economists as inefficient, unnecessary, unworkable, incredibly costly, and replete with unfortunate consequences for the same low-wage workers it alleges to be helping. This paper attempts to identify an explanation for both the vigor and content of economists' common antipathy toward comparable worth. The methodology of the paper is taken from Donald McCloskey's recent The Rhetoric of Economics and Feyerabend's epistemology of conversation. A content analysis of economists' criticisms of comparable worth reveals a much different methodology from that deified in the beginning chapters of Principles of Economics texts. Facts and empirical validation are not the primary bases responsible for their conclusions. The theoretical and empirical support for current relative wages is not solid enough to explain either the nearunanimity of economists' arguments or their vitriolic tone. This paper analyzes the fundamental role played by metaphor in guiding economists' analysis of comparable worth. Metaphor is treated in this paper as a pre-rational image that, much like Kuhn's paradigms, provides insight and establishes blind spots.<br>

Author(s): SCHUBERT WILLIAM H.<br>
Abstract: In honor of the 40 th volume of Curriculum Inquiry, I begin by claiming that pursuit of questions about what is worthwhile, why, and for whose benefit is a (perhaps the) central consideration of curriculum inquiry. Drawing autobiographically from my experience as an educator during the past 40 years, I sketch reflections on curriculum books published during that time span. I situate my comments within both the historical backdrop that preceded the beginning of Curriculum Inquiry and the emergence of new curricular languages or paradigms during the late 1960s and early 1970s. I suggest that two orientations of curriculum books have provided a lively tension in curriculum literature—one expansive and the other synoptic—while cautiously wondering if both may have evolved from different dimensions of John Dewey's work. I speculate about the place of expansion and synopsis in several categories of curriculum literature: historical and philosophical; policy, professional, and popular; aesthetic and artistic; practical and narrative; critical; inner and contextual; and indigenous and global. Finally, I reconsider expansive and synoptic tendencies in light of compendia, heuristics, and venues that portray evolving curriculum understandings without losing the purport of myriad expansions of the literature.<br>

Date: 4 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Klein Michael L.<br>
Abstract: This article discusses irony both as a narrative archetype in tonal music and as an interpretative strategy on the part of the listener. Beginning with a discussion of Northrop Frye's four narrative archetypes (romance, comedy, tragedy, irony), the article turns to a semiotic interpretation of the archetypes by James Liszka and an application of that work for music analysis by Byron Almén. Arguing that ironic narratives in tonal music often take as their premise a topical field associated with romance or comedy that leads to an unexpected failure, the article also claims that our interpretation of musical narratives must be invested in the semantic level (topics, codes, conventions, genres) as well as the syntactic one (harmony, voice leading). The four archetypes function as structures of the musical text and as master signifiers that the listener uses to organize an interpretation. As such, the archetypes function as ideologies of the musical text and as ideologies of the reader. The article illustrates these ideas with analyses of Chopin's Nocturne in B, op. 32/1, Chopin's Second Ballade, and Brahms's Rhapsody in Ek op. 119/4.<br>

Abstract: My article contends that Dostoevsky's short novel, The Gambler, is marked by a fundamental conflict of temporalities. While the novel seems to embrace bourgeois optimism and the hopeful narrative temporality that serves as its most resourceful literary embodiment, it also seems to adhere to a strikingly anti-teleological and circular narrative structure. This affirmation and denial of temporality as linear, purposive movement is the appropriate narrative emblem of the peculiar world of Roulettenburg and its inhabitants, a world where beginning and end continually risk equivalence and where the parameters of structure have therefore begun to dissolve. What emerges is an acceptance of inevitable boredom, of permanent failure to resolve conflict, that is both constricting and liberating. As an artistic principle of form, this failure declares a "poetics" of hesitation whose temporal dimensions brilliantly reflect the fundamentally ambivalent eros of the gambler, the latter's inability to accept or escape from a debilitating presentness. In creating this kind of narrative conflict, Dostoevsky reverses the characteristic romantic obsession with the allure of pregnant immediacy that is an illusion of god-like vision to which only a most ungod-like being could succumb.<br>

It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: Au cours des années 1950, la Fédération protestante de l'enseignement tente de renouveler le débat entre laïques et cléricaux à propos de l'école. Ce qui la conduit à définir une « laïcité de confrontation » , qui devrait permettre de mettre fin à la querelle scolaire. Au début de l'année 1959, elle essaie donc de promouvoir cette solution. Mais elle doit vite y renoncer devant les réactions de ses adhérents et celles de la plupart des protestants, qui entendent au contraire s'opposer aux subventions publiques en faveur des écoles catholiques aux côtés de la gauche politique. Si bien que le vote de la « loi Debré » est très mal accueilli par les protestants. During the 1950s, the Fédération protestante de l'enseignement (FPE) attempted to revive the debate between secularists and clericalists concerning education. This led the FPE to define a "confrontational secularism" which was supposed to bring the school quarrel to a conclusion. At the beginning of 1959, the FPE tried therefore to promote this solution. However, the FPE was rapidly forced to abandon this position given the reactions of its members and most Protestants who, on the contrary, alongside the political left, intended to oppose public subsidies for Catholic schools. Thus the adoption of the "loi Debré" was very badly received by Protestants. In den Fünfziger Jahren versuchte der evangelische Lehrerverein, den Austausch zwischen den Anhängern von öffentlichem und Konfessionsschulwesen wieder anzukurbeln. Sie legte dabei das Konzept einer "Laizität der Konfrontation" vor, die dem Schulstreit ein Ende setzen sollte. Zu Beginn des Jahres 1959 versuchte er diese Lösung durchzusetzen, muss te davon freilich schnell Abstand nehmen angesichts der negativen Reaktionen seiner Mitglieder und der Mehrheit der Protestanten, die sich im Gegenteil zusammen mit der politischen Linken gegen öffentliche Subventionen für katholische Schulen wehren wollten. So stieβ die Verabschiedung des Gesetzes von Debré bei den Prote~<br>

Abstract: La tentative de rapprochement entre littérature et éducation est en train de trouver — et pas seulement en France — de nouveaux adhérents. Cela semble signaler l'émergence d'un nouveau logos pédagogique qui essaye, peut-être, de dépasser les frontières de réflexion imposés par les sciences de l'éducation. Quelques-unes de ces tentatives, cependant, non seulement présentent certaines (et compréhensibles) limites, comme l'absence d'une « théorie de la réception » des textes fictionnels, mals elles ont aussi, dans d'autres cas, l'ambition de révolutionner le discours pédagogique à travers la littérature, où la pédagogie elle-même se transforme en projet d' « esthétisation de l'existence » . En prenant Philippe Meirieu et Jorge Larrosa comme illustrations des « limites » et de l' « ambition révolutionnaire » , respectivement, l'article cherche à montrer comment romantisme et nietzscheisme essayent de constituer un nouveau discours qui prétend, encore une fois, nous sauver de la « société administrée » . The attempt to approximate literature and education is beginning to find, not only in France, numerous supporters. This may indicate the emergence of a new pedagogical logos, which tries, little by little, to overcome the limits of thought set up by the Educational Sciences. Some of these attempts, however, not only show some (understandable) insufficiencies (such as the absence of a "reception theory" for fictional texts), but also, in other cases, the ambition of a complete revolution of the pedagogical discourse through literature (where pedagogy itself becomes a "self-stylistics" or aims at the "aesthetization of existence"). Taking Philippe Meirieu and Jorge Larrosa as respective examples of "insufficiencies" and "revolutionary ambition", the article tries to show how romanticism and Nietzscheanism can constitute a new pedagogical discourse that pretends, once again, to save us from "administerea society".<br>

Abstract: Inquiry-based teacher education promotes an exploration of concrete particulars as the route to wise practice. The case study presented illustrates one teacher candidate's struggle to let go of a conception of knowledge as generalizable formulae that can be readily applied in practice and to become more open to practice itself as a site of learning. Teacher educators can nurture such openness by helping aspiring teachers to appreciate the fragility of knowledge, the epistemological value of feeling, and the priority of the particular, in teaching. In so doing, educators recover practical wisdom as the beginning and end-in-view of teacher education. /// La formation à l'enseignement axée sur la recherche favorise la prise en compte des conditions particulières et, de ce fait, une pratique éclairée. L'étude de cas présentée dans cet article illustre les efforts d'une candidate à l'enseignement en vue de se départir d'une conception de la connaissance définie comme une formule généralisable, facilement applicable dans la pratique, et de mieux accueillir la pratique elle-même comme un lieu d'apprentissage. Les responsables de la formation à l'enseignement peuvent contribuer à cette ouverture en aidant les futurs enseignants à saisir la fragilité de la connaissance, la valeur épistémologique des sentiments et l'importance des conditions particulières dans l'enseignement. Ce faisant, les éducateurs redécouvrent la sagesse comme le début et l'objectif à atteindre dans la formation à l'enseignement.<br>

Abstract: The gaps, fissures, and lapses of attention in a life—what I call "ordinary oblivions"—are fertile fragilities that present a compelling source for ethics. Plato, not Aristotle, is the ancient philosopher specially poised to speak to this feature of human life. Drawing upon poet C. K. Williams's idea that forgetting is a "looking away" that makes possible "beginning again," I present a Platonic approach to ethics as an alternative to Aristotelian or virtue ethics. Plato's Phaedrus is a key source text for this alternate picture; from it I suggest how we might construe Iris Murdoch's "task of seeing" in terms of the engagement with written form. Poetry is a central locale for such engagement, and thus suggests a kind of ethical praxis that arises from the theoretical emphases of my examination of forgetting, the unmoored self, remade other-regard, and sacred sources.<br>

Abstract: Can the act of creation itself be considered like an infinite forgiveness that God turns to the earth and to those who live there after having preferred the waters as his place of first existence? The conference "In the beginning it was the forgiveness" held in L'Aquila in the occasion of a pluriconfessional meeting, suggests some hypothesis starting even from some biblical episodes like: the universal deluge, the Amalek's remembering, Giuseppe and his brothers, Isaac's sacrifice, and furthermore with Moses' death, to end with the forgiveness from the original sin through the entrance in the promise land. A suggestive analysis of the forgiveness in the Hebraism, seen too often as a pure religion of the contraposition law to the forgiveness given from the religion of love. The forgiveness in this way is dealt with the inter-religious point of view, and also with the human one that in the relationship between God and man has its top and beginning in the solemnity of Kippur.<br>

Abstract: La época que nos ha tocado vivir, que, a falta de mejores términos, denominamos tentativamente "globalización," provoca el entretejido de una malla virtual que aglutina privilegiadas zonas de contacto e ignorados ghettos de exclusión, así como irreconciliables identidades monolíticas y múltiples (individuales, locales, étnicas, religiosas, de género, de preferencias sexuales, nacionales, mundiales... et al.); fragmentaciones, opacidades, pro-, proto-, pos-, antinaciones, transnaciones, translenguas, transculturas... La novela Rojo, amarillo y verde, del autor boliviano-quebequés-canadiense-planetario Alejandro Saravia, es representativa del titubeante imaginario planetario que comienza a perfilarse. Lejos de ser una apología celebratoria de la "aldea global," este multifacético imaginario propone un contrapeso dialógico al monólogo del pensamiento único que pretende imponernos el capitalismo globalizante. La période que nous vivons, que nous nommons provisoirement la "mondialisation" à défaut de meilleurs termes, provoque l'entre-tissage d'un réseau virtuel agglutinant des zones de contact privilégiées et des ghettos d'exclusion ignorés; des identités monolithiques et multiples irréconciliables (individuelles, locales, ethniques, religieuses, de genre, d'orientations sexuelles, nationales, mondiales... et al.); des fragmentations, des opacités, des pro-, proto-, post-, anti-nations, des trans-nations, des trans-langues, des trans-cultures... Le roman Rojo, amarillo y verde, de l'auteur bolivien-québécois-canadien-planétaire Alejandro Saravia, est représentatif du chancelant imaginaire planétaire qui commence à se profiler. Loin d'être une apologie célébratoire du "Village global," cet imaginaire aux mille visages propose un contrepoids dialogique au monologue de la pensée unique, celle que le capitalisme mondialisant essaie de nous imposer. The age we find ourselves living in which, for lack of a better term, we tentatively call "globalization" provokes the interwea~<br>

Abstract: Cette étude s'interroge sur la question du mal dans la philosophie de Paul Ricœur. En prenant pour objet le développement de sa réflexion sur cette question depuis le début de son œuvre philosophique jusqu'à sa dernière période, l'auteur tente de comprendre la manière dont Ricœur rend compte de ce phénomène en examinant trois axes majeurs dans la confrontation au mal : la compréhension pratique du mal (phronesis-mimesis-praxis), l'élaboration d'une réponse au problème (catharsis-Durcharbeitung), le pardon. This study examines the question of evil in the philosophy of Paul Ricœur. In interpreting the development of his reflection on this question from the beginning of his philosophical production until his final period, the author attempts to comprehend the way in which Ricœur accounts for this phenomenon in analyzing three major ways of approach to evil: a) practical understanding (phronesis-mimesis-praxis), b) working-through (catharsis-Durcharbeitung), and c) pardon.<br>

Abstract: This article explores the influences of developments in philosophy on psychotherapy beginning with philosophers of the ancient Greek world. Psychotherapy owes much to ways of thinking employed by Greek philosophers attempting to understand the nature of the world and the relationships between humans, each other, and the world. The questions these philosophers asked, the answers they provided, and the methods they devised to address their questions remain pertinent to psychotherapists today. Greek philosophers engaged in dialectics and used reason to overcome the unreliability of the senses. Reason was deemed able to determine truth until philosophers, Nietzsche prominent among them, unseated reason from its throne. The article concludes with a discussion of themes and observations important to Nietzsche and postmodern philosophy, toward which Nietzsche's work pointed, and discusses their relevance to group psychotherapy.<br>

Abstract: Godefroid Kurth, historien méthodique rigoureux du début du XXe siècle, et Jean d'Outremeuse, chroniqueur prolixe mais brouillon du XIVe siècle, partagent a priori le même « métier », celui d'historien. Pourtant, entre ces deux personnages se dresse un gouffre abyssal, celui de deux visions de l'histoire entièrement opposées. Pour l'un, l'histoire est constituée d'événements assurés, reconstruits par une minutieuse étude des sources. Pour l'autre, l'histoire est un puits d'anecdotes propres à intéresser un public, elle est construite à coups de légendes, d'inventions personnelles qui visent à la vraisemblance aussi bien qu'à créer un véritable récit historique. Lorsque Godefroid Kurth a publié en 1910 son étude critique sur Jean d'Outremeuse, celui-ci n'était plus à même de se défendre. Il fut en conséquence lentement oublié, et sa vision de l'histoire vouée aux gémonies. Quel regard l'historien actuel doit-il porter à cette querelle? L'évolution de l'historiographie moderne, en particulier le linguistic turn, qui a insisté sur l'aspect narratif de toute histoire, doit-il le porter à réhabiliter le chroniqueur? Ne faudrait-il pas tout autant comprendre la démarche de l'un et de l'autre des protagonistes pour les voir tous deux, malgré leur statut d'écrivains de l'histoire, comme des sujets, des témoins de l'histoire et de leur époque? Godefroid Kurth, a methodological and rigorous historian from the beginning of the twentieth century, and Jean d'Outremeuse, prolix but disorganized chronicler from the fourteenth century, seem to share the same « profession », that of historian. Between the two, however, stands a gaping abyss due to two visions of history totally opposed. For the first one, history is made of positive events, rebuilt by a meticulous study of the sources. For the second one, history is a well of anecdotes useful to interest an audience : it is built with legends, personal inventions, whose aim is to create plausibility as well as a true historical narr~<br>

Abstract: Au début des années 70 P. Ricœur travaillait à un rapprochement entre sémantique et herméneutique, projet qu'il n'a pas, semble-t-il, repris ultérieurement. Dans sa défense de la référence au monde contre les attaques des sémioticiens français, il était conduit à généraliser le rapport de référence à tout discours, y compris la poésie. Refusant autant le relativisme que le positivisme, il tentait d'unifier en une conception tensionnelle les termes des distinctions tranchées de la théorie classique. Dans cette perspective la logique du jugement accueille la créatitivé de la métaphore ; l'épistémologie des sciences reconnaît la valeur des modèles heuristiques ; et l'ontologie du discours s'adapte au pluralisme de notre rapport au monde à travers les œuvres littéraires. Tous ces déplacements d'accent devaient assurer une transition continue de la sémantique à l'herméneutique sans quitter le terrain du monde pour les abîmes de l'interprétation infinie. At the beginning of the seventies P. Ricœur was working upon the possibility of bringing together semantics and hermeneutics, although he did not, apparently, follow this line of concern thereafter. In his defense of the reference to the world against the French semiotician's attacks, he was driven to generalize the relation of reference to all kinds of discourse, poetry included. Rejecting relativism as much as positivism, he tried to unify in a tensional view the terms of the clear-cut distinctions of classical theory. From this point of view, the logic of judgement turns out to welcome the creativity of metaphor ; the epistemology of the sciences recognizes the worth of heuristic models ; and the ontology of discourse fits the pluralism of the relation to the world opened up to us by the literary works. All these shifts of emphasis were intended as securing a smooth transition from semantics to hermeneutics, without leaving the firm ground of the world for the depths of infinite interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Cet article offre une vision globale de l'œuvre de Ricœur, l'auteur proposant d'y lire une logique de développement en spirale, parce que dans les ouvrages les plus tardifs du philosophe nous trouvons un retour de la recherche sur la volonté — inscrite dans le cadre d'une anthropologie philosophique — qui avait inspiré son projet de jeunesse. Mouvement en spirale, et non retour circulaire aux origines, car entre le début et la fin il n'y a pas coïncidence mais enrichissement après un long détour à travers l'univers du langage. Ce détour — selon l'hypothèse de travail de l'auteur — progresse à travers trois paradigmes: symbole, texte et traduction. Dans la traduction travaillent le propre et l'étranger, le soi et l'autre, l'autre que nous retrouvons en nous et qui ne se réduit pas à l'altérité de l'autre homme. Un concept pluriel d'humanité — qui est pourtant une — y est à l'oeuvre. Le travail jamais accompli de la traduction suggère enfin l'idée d'une herméneutique de l'inachèvement. This article offers a global vision of Ricœur's work, in which the author suggests the existence of a spiral development, insofar as in the most recent works we find a return to the same research on the will — within the context of a philosophical anthropology — that inspired the project of Ricœur's youthful years. Spiral movement and not circular return to the origin, because the beginning and the end do not coincide but rather enrich one another, after a long detour of many decades through the universe of language. This detour — according to author's working hypothesis — has progressively developed through three paradigms: symbol, text and translation. In translation, what is at work is the familiar and the foreign, the self and the other, the other that we find in ourselves and that cannot be reduced to the otherness of the other man. In translation we find a plural concept of humanity, which is nevertheless one. The never complete work of translation suggests ultimately the idea of ~<br>

Abstract: This study, based largely on unpublished material, is an attempt to describe and evaluate how French Protestantism dealt with the German question in the postwar period. A short description of the perception of Germany by French Protestants towards the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century underlines the new approach which characterized the relations between French and German Protestants after the Second World War. In spite of the shattering defeat of the Third Reich, Germany remained in the eyes of many French Protestants a dreadful danger. However, already shortly after the war, some clergymen and laymen, many of whom had been involved in the resistance against the nazi regime, believed that their mission was to act as mediators and peacemakers despite the official hard-line diplomacy of their country. This article provides a selection of quotations of French Protestants' intentions and conceptions regarding the German question, as well as examining the ways and means they thought best to prevent Germany from becoming a new danger to France and Europe. It shows how seriously they debated all aspects of a common future with yesterday's enemy in a Europe of tomorrow, and affords an insight into how some Protestant personalities on both sides of the Rhine played an important role in the process of Franco-German reconciliation during the postwar period.<br>

Abstract: This article analyses the difficult relation between anthropology and history. The point, therefore, is to show how anthropology conceptualises the past differently from history as a discipline. Beginning with the differences between anthropology and history in terms of the concept of time, the article highlights that while for history time is concrete, objective and exogenous to human beings, for anthropology it is characterised by its being condensed, collectively subjective and endogenous. By analyzing actual examples, the article shows that the anthropologist is not interested in the past per se, but rather in the past as a dimension of the present. Accordingly, actualised, revised and manipulated history as well as the role of the past in the present need to be taken into account. Consequently, history and the past have their own specific efficiency because they are also a form of knowledge and social resource mobilised by single individuals or groups to find their bearings and act accordingly in the present and likewise to plan the future.<br>

Abstract: From the very beginning of his career as a writer, Nikolay Ostrovsky (1904-36) received hostile criticisms of his style, which was described as 'coarse,' and which led some observers to conclude that his success was due more to his prowess as a soldier than to his talents as a writer. But his success was incontrovertible. Readers rushed to buy his book How the Steel Was Tempered, despite the absence of publicity when it appeared. What accounts for the extraordinary success? Readers' letters contained in the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art (RGALI) can help us answer this question. Over the past ten years there have been many studies in which scholars have sought the organizational basis of socialist realism as an esthetic, putting the literariness of the work before its political character. It certainly seems logical, since esthetics is not just a question of production but also of consumption (Jauss, Iser, Lotman), that this program of research should also include the acceptance of the texts, their reception by the readers. Сначала своей писательской карьеры, Николай Островский (1904-1936) получил строгие критики за свой стиль, который был описан как «груб» и некоторые наблюдатели считали, что успех его был обязан больше его подвигам в качестве солдата чем его талантам писателя. Но успех был бесспорен. Читатели устремлялись чтобы покупать книгу, Как закалялась сталь, несмотря на отсутствие рекламной шумихи во время ее публикации. Что может объяснить этот чрезвычайный успех? Письма читателей, содержавшиеся в Государственных архивах искусства и литературы Федерации России (RGALI) могут нам помочь отвечать на этот вопрос. В течение последних десяти лет, многочисленные публикации показали структуру социалистического реализма, как эстетика, помещающая литературность произведения перед его политическим характером. Потому что эстетика не только вопрос продукции а также потребления (Jauss, Iser, Lotman), кажется логическим, чтобы эта исследовательская программа ~<br>

Abstract: A l'intérieur du corpus des Vies parallèles de Plutarque, la Vie de Sertorius offretrois singularités : elle est la seule qui se déroule presque en totalité en Occident ; elle appartient au seul couple - Sertorius-Eumène — où le Romain est placé en premier ; le récit ne couvre pas la durée d'une vie, mais isole dix années (83/2 à 73 av. J.-C). Comment rendre compte ensemble de ces trois données situées sur des plans différents ? Les Vies parallèles délimitent un espace qui, à la fin du Ier siècle et au début du IIe, correspond au monde dominé par Rome, devenue garante et protectrice d'une histoire commune. Or autant l'Orient a reçu l'empreinte dts Grecs et des Romains, autant l'Occident est resté à l'écart. Ainsi formulera-t-on l'hypothèse que le sujet principal de cette Vie, tout autant que le personnage même de Sertorius, est l'Espagne, ou plus exactement l'extrême Occident, qui fait écho à l'extrême Orient, aussi bien à l'intérieur du récit (avec l'épisode de la troisième guerre de Mithridate) qu'au sein de l'ensemble des Vies. L'objet de cette étude est donc d'étudier en quoi une source grecque, postérieure de deux siècles aux événements qu'elle rapporte, témoigne de la place et de la fonction de l'extrême Occident dans la Méditerranée gréco-romaine, et, en cela, de mettre au jour quelques-unes des contraintes que pose, en tant que source, la Vie de Sertorius pour l'étude de l'Hispanie de la fin de la République. Within the corpus of Plutarch's Parallel Lives, the Life of Sertorius presents three peculiarities: it is the only one to take place almost entirely in the West; it belongs to the only couple -Sertorius-Eumenes- in which the Roman is given precedence; the narrative does not cover a whole lifetime but isolates ten years (83/2 to 73 BC). How then take together and account for those three facts situated at different levels ? The Parallel Lives delimits a space which, by the end of the 1st century and the beginning of the second, corresponds to a world unde~<br>

Abstract: Dans la Vie d'Apollonios de Tyane, Philostrate construit, au moment de la rencontre entre son protagoniste et Iarchas, le chef des brahmanes, un dialogue dans lequel autorité et charisme sont essentiels. Cette mise en scène l'autorise ensuite à produire un discours concernant la domination romaine et ses représentants, à destination des Grecs comme des Romains. La question du destinataire permet de mettre en lumière certains des enjeux les plus fondamentaux de l'œuvre du sophiste. Elle montre de quelle manière Philostrate interroge les Hellènes sur leurs choix de vie et leur identité dans le monde gréco-romain du début du IIIe siècle. In the Life of Appolonios of Tyana, Philostratos builds up, when his protagonist meets larchas, the chief of the Brahmins, a dialogue in which authority and charisma are essential. That staging allows him to produce a speech concerning Roman sway an dits representatives, addressing Greeks and Romans alike. The question of addressee enables him to highlight some of the more fundamental point at stake in the sophist's work. It shows in what way Philostratos questions the Greeks about their life choices and their identity in the Greco-Roman worlf at the beginning of the IIIrd century.<br>

Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers<br>

Author(s): Mickey Sam<br>
Abstract: This essay is an articulation of various contributions to anthropocosmic environmental ethics—an approach to environmental ethics emerging within the study of religion and ecology. In an anthropocosmic approach to environmental ethics, humans are intimately intertwined with the environment. Rather than placing value on a particular center (e.g., anthropocentric, biocentric, ecocentric) and thus excluding and marginalizing something of peripheral value, an anthropocosmic approach to ethics seeks to facilitate the mutual implication of humanity and the natural world, thereby affirming the interconnectedness and mutual constitution of central and peripheral value. Although the adjective "anthropocosmic" may seem obscure or vague, an examination of the genealogy of the term, beginning with its appearance in the works of Mircea Eliade, discloses numerous resources that have important contributions to make to the development of viable environmental ethics.<br>

Abstract: The idea/metaphor of the world as a text, essential to the so called linguistic turn of human and social sciences, has a long intellectual history which originates, from the very beginning of Christianity, in Saint Paul's assertion of the presence of a double sense (literal and spiritual) in the Old Testament. Starting from this point, the present paper sets out to describe the development and consolidation of the tradition of Biblical exegesis and hermeneutics which in the 20th century gave rise to a variety of schools and trends that in one way or another maintain the fundamental thesis that reality is a text that is to be deciphered. The article also highlights that the original Christian sources did generate two other lines of intellectual tradition: a more temperate exegetical tradition prevailing in the Catholic world, and furthermore the current Western cultural belief that world is like a book (a belief which kept the terms of the comparison separated and did not confuse them).<br>

Publisher: Sameeksha Trust<br>
Issue: i397690<br>

Author(s): WittgensteinAbstract: At the beginning of this decade, newspapers the world over reported the UN general assembly's declaration of the last segment of the 20th century as the International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR), beginning January 1, 1990. There are, broadly speaking, two categories of disaster - the natural (floods, fires, earthquakes) and the manmade (riots, wars, industrial accidents). Both types result in considerable violence against 'the people', especially in an environment that is impoverished, post-colonial, and served by an entrenched bureaucracy. This paper, which partly addresses the subalternist historiographer's problematic of how 'the moment' of people's suffering is to be captured in the writing of history, explores connections between these seemingly independent classes of calamity - the natural and the denatured. It does so by examining three sorts of disaster narrative - the official, the popular and the academic - each of which interprets an underlying nominal/natural kind divide differently. More specifically, the paper uses the philosophical concepts 'nominal and natural kind' to analyse narrative strategies in women's accounts of disaster so that the beginnings of a 'feminist critique of bureaucracy' might emerge, not merely out of academic theorising, but from within the discourse of those who have survived incredible assaults and yet lived to 'tell the tale'.<br>

Abstract: While the Good Friday Agreement heralded a new beginning in Northern Ireland, its promotion of amnesty and amnesia, and its "rhetorical dismemberment of the past," effectively occluded the experiences of victims. Rather than engage in the seductive embrace of cultural amnesia, much Northern Irish art focuses upon the dangers of forgetting the past. For visual artists and writers alike, a wilful neglect of history may result in the return of the repressed and in psychic breakdown on both the communal and individual levels. Works by Jack Pakenham, Ciaran Carson, Colin Davidson, Frank McGuinness, and Willie Doherty use the trope of "haunting" to allow readers/viewers to bear witness to the plight of those left behind by the Agreement's rhetoric and to understand their post-conflict trauma. Bien que l'Accord du Vendredi saint annonçât un nouveau début pour l'Irlande du Nord, il eut comme résultat, de par sa promotion d'une amnistie combinée à une amnésie forcée, ainsi que son démembrement rhétorique du passé, de nier le vécu des victimes. Plutôt que de se laisser subjuguer par la séduction de l'amnésie culturelle, une grande partie de l'expression artistique de l'Irlande du Nord se concentre sur le danger d'oublier le passé. Pour les plasticiens aussi bien que les écrivains, une négligence délibérée de l'histoire pourrait ramener la répression et occasionner des blessures psychiques aussi bien au niveau communautaire que de l'individu. Les œuvres de Jack Pakenham, Ciaran Carson, Colin Davidson, Frank McGuinness, et Willie Doherty déploient le trope de la « hantise » pour permettre aux lecteurs et au public de témoigner de la souffrance de ceux qui ont été laissés pour compte par la rhétorique de l'Accord, et de mieux comprendre leur traumatisme post-conflit<br>

Abstract: En partant de l'histoire intellectuelle dont nous provenons, puis en retraçant en elle les tensions majeures de l'expérience et du sens, on soutient d'abord ici que le christianisme peut et doit être pour nous un lieu décisif de réflexion philosophique. Cette conviction se confirme à travers le parcours de trois pensées phénoménologiques d'importance – celles de M. Henry, de J. L. Marion et de P. Ricœur – qui abordent selon leur style propre la question du rapport à la « révélation » biblique et évangélique. On débouche ainsi finalement sur un espace à la fois commun et hétérogène : celui de notre monde, soulerrainemenl et diversement travaillé par l'inscription en lui d'une « kénose » d'origine chrétienne qui n'interroge pas moins les constructions philosophiques que théologiques. Beginning with the intellectual history from which we come, then in retracing in it the major tensions of experience and sense, this paper first maintains that Christianity can and must he for us a decisive place for philosophical reflection. This conviction is confirmed through the overview of three important phenomenological lines of thought, those of M. Henry, J. L. Marion and P. Ricœur – who take up, each according to his own style, the question of biblical and evangelical « revelation ». One is thus finally led into a space at once common and heterogeneous: that of our world, clandestinely and variously crafted by the inscription into it of a « kenosis » of Christian origin that questions philosophical constructions no less than theological ones.<br>

Abstract: Alors que le Quatrième Évangile rapportait dialogues et symboles à la communication de la Révélation, la théologie contemporaine les renvoie souvent à une altérité constitutive de toute éthique. Partant de cet écart, irréductible à un simple renversement, l'article cherche à montrer comment le dialogisme et le symbolisme, grâce à leur dissemblance, demeurent aussi essentiels l'un que l'autre à l'accueil de l'Évangile, de la Révélation, du Salut. L'identification du croyant passe aussi bien par un dialogue né d'une séparation que par un symbole ordonné à un rassemblement. Pour parvenir à cette conclusion, l'article doit d'abord définir les conditions requises pour que chacune des deux formations signifiantes ouvre à la fois à un monde et à une communauté : un être et un agir nouveaux. While the Fourth Gospel draws upon dialogues and symbols for the communication of revelation, contemporary theology often relegates them to an otherness constitutive of any ethic. Beginning with this rupture, irreducible to a simple reversal, this paper seeks to show how dialogue and symbolism, thanks to their dissimilarity, remain so essential to each other for the reception of the Gospel, of revelation, of salvation. The identification of the believer passes just as well through a dialogue born of a separation as by a symbol ordered to a gathering. In order to arrive at this conclusion, this paper assumes the task of defining the conditions necessary for each of the two significant formations to open upon a world and a community: a new being and act.<br>

Abstract: En vue de se laisser enseigner par les lettres philosophiques, l'auteur s'applique à reconnaître, depuis Platon jusqu'à Nietzsche, l'insistance et l'existence des questions relatives au mal. La nature (quid), l'origine (unde) et la justification (cur) sollicitent toujours et autrement la pensée du mal. Au commencement, de Plotin à Leibniz, le moment ontologique retravaille la question de la nature à partir de la question de l'origine, mais pour résoudre le mal de la volonté dans le non-être du mal. Il faut que s'affirme avec Kant la préséance du vouloir sur l'être, l'auto-position de la volonté libre, pour que le moment éthique associe l'essence positive du mal à la recherche de son origine. Lorsqu'enfin dans la perspective de Nietzsche s'impose le moment généalogique, la question de la théodicée se transforme en question du langage. Là où se dit la justification de la volonté, c'est une volonté de justification qui parle. L'article se conclut en préparant une pensée du mal qui réunirait l'horizon de l'attente à celui de la genèse. The author, with the aim of being taught by philosophical letters, applies himself to acknowledge from Plato to Nietzsche the persistence and existence of the questions relating to evil. The nature (quid), the origin (unde) and the justification (cur) always and in different ways urge the thought of evil. In the beginning, from Plotin to Leibniz, the metaphysical instance works again at the question of nature starting from the question of origin, but in order to solve the evil of the will power in the non existing of evil. It will need Kant's assertion of the precedency of the will over the being, the auto-position of the free will in order that the ethical moment may associats the positive essence of evil to the search for its origin. When "in fine" the genealogical moment forces itself upon Nietzsche's prospect, the question of theodicy is transformed into one of language. Where the question is a justification of the will, it is the wil~<br>

Abstract: In this article, I explore the question, “What is the relationship between appropriation of Indigenous thought and what might be called ‘deep learning’ based in years of education in Indigenous contexts.” Beginning with an examination of meanings ascribed to cultural appropriation, I bring texts from Gee on secondary discourses, Foucault on the production of discourse, and Wertsch on the deep structures underpinning discourse into conversation with critical fieldwork experiences extracted from years of research and teaching. Ultimately hopeful, I conclude the article with direction from Indigenous scholars on appropriate cultural protocol in the use of Indigenous knowledges by non-Aboriginal people in educational contexts.<br>

Abstract: Abstract. This paper demonstrates the sorts of questions that arise for sociologically informed disability studies scholarship in the midst of the interactional scenes of access struggles in an educational workplace environment. From my experiences in the third largest building of a large Canadian university, I have recollected ordinary talk that justifies the exclusion of disabled people and have pieced together narratives representing things-possible-to-say-today about accessibility struggles. By using an interpretive sociological approach, this paper explores how meanings of disability are generated through talk that justifies the exclusive shape and inaccessible structures of university life. I demonstrate that access is not a synonym for justice but is a beginning place for critical questioning where social relations between body and space can be thought anew. This paper adds to sociologically informed disability studies scholarship by analyzing how the ordinary everyday narration of disability acts as a social power reproducing the status-quo even as the material environment changes.<br>

In answer to the question “Does Russia have enemies?” 47% (the largest group) chose “Why look for enemies if all our troubles are internal?” See:

Abstract: In his essay “The Style of Autobiography”, Jean Starobinski remarks, “One would hardly have sufficient motive to write an autobiography had not some radical change occurred […] conversion, entry into a new life, the operations of Grace”. From the beginning, the traumatic events of Keller's childhood — her loss of sight and hearing around age two — marked her not only as “outsider” and “other” but also as “autobiographer” even before she acquired language. “I can show so little visible proof of living”, Keller confessed. Perhaps for this reason she filled the “white darkness” she lived in with writing — first with finger spelling traced in the hand, then with Braille, and finally with type. While each medium seemed to bring her closer to the dream — her own and her century's — of transparent communication, so each text she produced threatened to turn into a “black box”, an instrument designed to collect and preserve data for analysis following a catastrophic event, but one that inevitably fails to illumine the inner world of Keller's deaf-blindness. This essay explores Keller's dreaming within the black box of writing, following her impossible desire for an “instrument which will show what takes place in the mind when we think”.<br>

Abstract: According to the arguments put forward by Perloff, Dworkin, Goldsmith, and Reed, the recontextualization of language is a marker of “taste” or aesthetic judgment, and therefore a sign of genius. Perloff writes, “
      According to taste: it is important to remember that the citational or appropriative text, however unoriginal its actual words and phrases, is always the product of choice—and hence of individual taste.”
            In this interpretation, the appropriation of language becomes the reassertion of individuality and authority. Goldsmith terms this “self-expression,” “emotion,” and “authorship” in24
         Uncreative Writing. Perloff argues, “If the new ‘conceptual’ poetry makes no claim to originality—at least not originality in the usual sense—this is not to say thatgeniusisn't in play. It just takes different forms.”
            The rhetoric of Perloff and Goldsmith's claims is fascinating. Viewing the recontextualization of language as a marker of “taste” or aesthetic judgment is a hoary basis for authority. Attributing the act of recontextualizing to “genius” reinforces the fetish of authenticity that reigns in late capitalist society25
         
            and is a clear manifestation of the metaphysics of origin.26
         
            By “metaphysics of origin,” I refer to the central epistemic issue that creates a theology of “the new, the creative, the true” in the West, following Françoise Meltzer's analysis in27
         Hot Property: The Stakes and Claims of Literary Originality. Meltzer shows that the idea of literary originality functions within an economy of displacement: that is, the idea of “origin” itself is continually displaced so as “to clothe its status as invention, or myth.”
            Said has identified a similar phenomenon that he calls the “imperative connection” between the idea of a beginning and the “aboriginal human need to point to or locate a beginning.”28

Abstract: The inherent distance, boredom, and looming tragedy climax at Gatsby's last party. Nick depicts his feelings toward this party with sober sadness: “There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn't been there before” (104). As usual, Nick's emotions are suggested by the language. Words such as “harshness,” “desolate” and “crushed,” which phonetically sound unattractive, are not found in the first part of
         Gatsby. These words not only communicate emptiness and regret for the passing summer, but also convey a more symbolic meaning, the tragedy of life: today is tomorrow's past. The potent boats that “slit” the water in the beginning are replaced by “one small sail [that] crawled slowly toward the fresher sea” (118). And if the first parties revealed that those in attendance were exactly where they wanted to be, they seem restless now. Inspired by the pioneer spirit and “the moon … in the western sky,” they want to go west just like Wilson, who wants to take Myrtle with him (120).<br>

Abstract: The title of Jabbeh Wesley's fourth collection of poetry,
         Where the Road Turns, is a subtle allusion to Wole Soyinka's1965play,The Road, and Ben Okri's1991Booker Prize–winning novel,The Famished Road. These two books explore the riches of Yoruba mythology in order to shed light on the African condition. The characters in Soyinka's play live on the road and make their living from what the road has to offer. Critics have pointed out the absurdist elements in Soyinka's conception of the road as a metaphor for Africa's instability, especially in the play's parallel with Samuel Beckett'sWaiting for Godot. What is said ofThe Roadapplies to Jabbeh Wesley'sWhere the Road Turns. Aided by the picture of the winding dirt road on the cover and at the beginning of each of the book's four sections, Jabbeh Wesley reminds us of the twisting road of Africa's existential journeys. The eponymous poem itself is representative of the poetry of attention:
               The detailed description of the place where a lonely speaker waits enables us to see what the speaker sees: a crumbling world. We are even more troubled by the fact that the speaker sees a parallel between him or her and the road: “Potholes have taken over my life” just as they have taken over the road. This self-identification with the road is to be understood as a lamentation for the conditions of the speaker's life and not as romanticizing the rural life of Africa. But little romanticizing is possible given that the speaker waits in the manner that reminds one of Samuel Beckett's remarkable characters, Pozzo and Lucky, inI'm right here on the road, in the open

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: Yet I think I speak for most of the witnesses when I retell this little episode with some affection and amusement, in remembrance of a man who had much more important things to give us than a proper label for what we were trying to do. Moreover—and this is the point I want to stress here—except maybe for William Earle, Gurwitsch's objection was not treated as ideological or as calling upon us to chose then and there between pure and adulterated phenomenology. Nor did anyone with a primary interest in neo-Marxism, critical social theory, classical pragmatism, or existentialized Thomism see themselves as excluded by either proposed label. And this, I want to say, was typical of SPEP meetings from the very beginning. The stress was on the things themselves—especially those things that the larger philosophical world ignored, distorted, or explained away—and not on their One True Articulation.<br>

Abstract: Marx led me to critical theory. If one were to reconstruct the beginning from my perspective, exhibit number one would be the special issue on hermeneutics and critical theory published as volume 2, number 4, of the journal
            Cultural Hermeneutics(February 1975), which I founded in 1973. I organized a conference featuring the old Hans-Georg Gadamer (my new colleague) and the young Rüdiger Bubner, which attempted to construct a dialogue between the two philosophical disciplines, hermeneutics and critical theory. Gadamer's essay “Hermeneutics and Social Sciences,” given as a talk without a written text (later it was the target of a summer's work by me and some of my graduate students, who made it into a text), was, I am told, one of the first things by Gadamer to appear in English. Looking back, Gadamer was eloquent in his characterization of the critique that critical theory made of his hermeneutic position. He, of course, although we didn't give him credit for it at the time, knew well what defined the difference between critical theory and hermeneutics, having hired Habermas just at the timeWarheit und Methodewas published. Habermas's review began the debate. Gadamer attacked the notion of “emancipatory reflection,” which he defined as “a critique of the process of self-illumination which is supposed to bring about a social discourse free from force.” According to Gadamer, such a claim is impossible because there can be “no reflection at all without a prior basis of common agreement.” The weakness of critical theory is that it takes over the program of “critique of ideology,” which falsely presumes that it can “enthrone its own norms and ideals as self-evident and absolute.” Hermeneutics, on the contrary, offers us the possibility of a return to “practical reason,” freeing us from the “domination of technology.”
                  Gadamer received a kind of standard criticism from Bubner and others, who claimed that going back to the tradition of practical~<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: More recently a series of atheistic and materialist interpretations of Saint Paul have arisen, beginning with Alain Badiou's
         The Universalism of St. Paul, according to which Paul is an exemplar of the galvanized subjectivity that is required by a truth process. Paul's letters are a journal of the transformation of the subject under the impact of the event, which produces an apostolic mission to establish the universality of the truth. The universality of the truth event is achieved in a process of the subtraction of ethnic particularity, resulting in a reign of truth where there is neither Greek nor Jew, male nor female, master nor slave. Of course, the content of Paul's letters, the resurrection of Jesus, is not the truth but a fable, but it is in the form of the truth. Slavoj Žižek contributes to this debate by way of an unorthodox version of Hegel read through Lacan, the watchword of which is Lacan's saying that the therapy is over when the patient realizes that there is no Big Other. The final words of Jesus on the cross, “My God, why have you forsaken me?” bear witness to the final atheistic conversion of Jesus, when God himself ceases to believe in God, leaving behind the community of those who, having assumed responsibility for themselves, set out to produce a radical egalitarian socialist order.

Abstract: The final section, “The Gift and the Animal: Rethinking Politics and Critical Theory,” brings together two articles in social and political theory. Alan Schrift's article, “Should Philosophers Still Read Mauss? Thoughts on Contemporary American Politics,” revisits Marcel Mauss's 1925
      Essay on the Giftand argues that its significance for thinking about contemporary politics has yet to be fully appreciated. Schrift finds in Mauss's work an approach to left-wing politics that avoids the binary opposition between Marxism and liberal individualism; as a result, Schrift argues, Mauss's political theory offers important resources for defending social democracy in the context of contemporary American politics. Eduardo Mendieta's article, “The Silence of the Sirens: RereadingDialectic of Enlightenmentwith Kafka and Borges,” returns to the ur-text of Critical Theory and rereads it in light of what Mendieta calls “the animal question.” Weaving a trace among Homer'sOdysseus, Plato's allegory of the cave, and Horkheimer and Adorno'sDialectic of Enlightenment, Mendieta argues that the animal question has haunted Western philosophy from the beginning and thus that a critical philosophy must also become an animal philosophy.<br>

Abstract: First, hermeneutics rejects the scientific ideal of phenomenology. Husserl conceives phenomenology in foundational terms as a first philosophy whose role is to provide a metaphysical grounding or an Archimedean point for scientific knowledge. But hermeneutics challenges the foundational enterprise altogether.
         
               The search for foundations, on this view, is forgetful of its own origins within a more encompassing context of relations. Thought can never establish itself at the beginning or end point; instead it is always situated in medias res, that is, in the midst of a conversation or dialogue that has already begun.12<br>

Abstract: Second, Ricoeur's theory appreciates narrative's capacity to evoke new visions of the world but does not recognize the role that rhetoric might also play in producing new action. In some places, Ricoeur describes rhetoric as an art defined and constrained by beliefs already held by the audience. For example, when delineating the distinctions among rhetoric, poetics, and hermeneutics, Ricoeur explains that a speaker “begins with the conventional ideas that he shares with [the audience].” “In this,” he continues, “argumentation has little creative function: it transfers the agreement granted to premises onto conclusions” (1997, 62). Such an approach to rhetoric short-circuits Ricoeur's own theories about how texts produce agency, because it removes an important means for encouraging public action. The circularity of threefold mimesis does not just suggest merely repetition; it also implies that each agent's repetition can imaginatively improve on the previous iteration.
         
               The concept of the spiral uses rhetorical terminology to highlight how memories can encourage action that is both imitative and innovative, action that emerges from the past and projects into the future. As Bradford Vivian explains, citing Hannah Arendt, “Cultivating natality, or beginning again through collective speech and action, is a vital aim of communal recollection rather than mere repetition of the same” (2010, 55). It is this public “beginning again” that Ricoeur's work forgets.6<br>

Abstract: In an 1896 review, for instance, he explicitly parallels doctors and actors in their professional practice, beginning by characterizing the former in his usual terms: “The average doctor is a walking compound of natural ignorance and acquired witchcraft, who kills your favorite child, wrecks your wife's health, and orders you into habits of nervous dram-drinking before you have the courage to send him about his business.”
      
            After similarly chastising attorneys, boot makers, and tailors, Shaw asserts that, while we “imagine that these people have professions,” we discover that “what they have is only, in the correct old word, their ‘mystery’—a humbug, like all mysteries. And yet, how we help to keep up the humbug! … Men believe in the professions as they believe in ghosts, because they want to believe in them” (423–24, 425). For Shaw, human beings had redirected their desire for faith in idols and priests toward doctors and marketing men. The commercial theater had also fed upon this need, and even the critic himself is susceptible to their hypnotic prowess. Calling himself the “most ridiculous of all dupes,” Shaw confesses in the review his mistaking of the actor as a skilled craftsman, a “civilizing agent [and] spiritual doctor,” when in fact “it is all a delusion: there is no profession, no art, no skill about the business at all” (425). Just as those who are exploited by the medical industry, Shaw's “desire and hope got the better of [his] observation[, his] imagination of [his] experience” (428). The fraud perpetuated by doctors is akin to the “mystery” of theater; if doctors are ghosts, actors and managers are similar spirits who have offended. For Shaw, then, the critic's job is to “sift the gold of fact and efficiency out of the huge rubbish-heap of professionalism” (425).6<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: An obvious criticism of Burke's idea of rhetorical transcendence is that it is utopian in the unrealistic sense. It seems so abstract in its focus on generalized terminology and images that it may have no possible concrete object. Burke realized this utopian quality reminiscent of the lack of actualized topos in More's utopian “no-place.” As rhetorician James Zappen explains, “These acts of pure persuasion are devoid of partisan advantage-seeking but also devoid of persuasive purpose. As such, they might not even exist.”
      
               The important thing to take away from Burke's ramblings, though, is the humanistic sense that the search for perfection is inherent in human nature and that understanding this utopian impulse can only help us to live and to seek happiness in a world of competing power and advantage: “Let us observe, all about us, forever goading us, though it be in fragments, the motive that attains its ultimate identification in the thought, not of the universal holocaust, but of the universal order…. [E]ach kind strives toward the perfection of its kind, and so toward the kind next above it, while the strivings of the entire series head in God as the beloved cynosure and ninecure, the end of all desire.”35
            
               By36
            GodBurke means an ultimate ideal transcending all other symbols and fulfilling all desire—the kind of nirvana that would eliminate the need for further utopia-making altogether. This, of course, is not achievable in the course of history, but the mythic experience of it would activate a downward movement in the process, bringing the transcendent ideals back into the pragmatic world of discourse and human affairs. This would be the function of utopia in Burkean terms, and it would result in a habit of mind that would amount to a large-scale educational scheme—dare I say, the education of desires. If the young were informed of the dialectical-rhetorical process of transcendence from the beginning, ~<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>

Abstract: To what extent, then, is this ironization—this celebration and cerebration of indeterminacy—consistent with a progressive and dynamic mode of Utopian thought? Or might it indeed be supposed that this inscription of a plurality of perspectives is not only consistent with but essential to a mode of Utopianism as an expression of the manifestation of imagination in a moment at which art and theory converge—insofar as such contradictions allow for the fact that, as Walt Whitman suggested, we are “large” and “contain multitudes”
         
               —and inasmuch as (in Karl Popper's words) “irrefutability is not a virtue of theory … but a vice,” in that “every genuine test of a theory is an attempt to falsify it”?105
            
               Could the imaginary testing of theory advanced by art offer the beginning of a grounding of theory in historical materiality? Could art build its Utopian foundations precisely by deconstructing them?106<br>
