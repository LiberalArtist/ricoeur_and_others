  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5s7">The Genesis of Desire</a><br>
  Abstract: I would like to propose the hypothesis that the text of Genesis and the idea of “original sin” interpret through metaphor the birth of psychological man, that is, of humanity, of the couple, and of desire. In connection with this, I also propose to show that this birth of psychological man, like that of social man, is brought about by purely mimetic mechanisms.<br>

  Abstract: After birth, a mythic system (and both Revisionism and Labor Zionist were myth-based systems) may develop in one of four ways. The system may decline if it fails to meet the needs of the people in presenting a solution to the crisis that called it into existence or if it fails to respond to a shifting scene.

  Abstract: The ʺPrinciples of New Science of Giambattista Vico concerning the Common Nature of the Nationsʺ (first edition:1725) is a model work (comparative, evolutionary) for later history and anthropology: a view of the history of all societies as the account of their birth and development.

  Abstract: In a 1924 article Russian Soviet musicologist Leonid Sabaneyev (1881–1968) announced that through the work of a group of Jewish composers Jewish music was approaching the phase Sabaneyev called “its artistic expansion.”¹ Sabaneyev’s account of the birth of Jewish art music reflected art publicist Vladimir Stasov’s version of the development of Russian musical nationalism. Lest there be any doubt about this connection, the prophecy with which Sabaneyev closed his article demonstrated the strong effect of Russian national music on Jewish aspirations. Stasov shaped and propagated most effectively the Russian national ideals as the ideological basis for the

  Book Title: Homer the Theologian-Neoplatonist Allegorical Reading and the Growth of the Epic Tradition<br>

  Author(s): LAMBERTON ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: Here is the first survey of the surviving evidence for the growth, development, and influence of the Neoplatonist allegorical reading of the
      IliadandOdyssey.Professor Lamberton argues that this tradition of reading was to create new demands on subsequent epic and thereby alter permanently the nature of European epic. The Neoplatonist reading was to be decisive in the birth of allegorical epic in late antiquity and forms the background for the next major extension of the epic tradition found in Dante.<br>

  Abstract: The tradition of mystical allegorical commentary on Homer has survived in substantial form only in the writings of the Neoplatonists, but evidence from the first two and a half centuries of the Christian era—before the great synthesis of Plotinus, which marks the beginning of Neoplatonism proper—indicates that this period was a crucial one in the development of that tradition. Félix Buffière’s insistence on the second century as the time of the birth of mystical allegory needs qualification, as the discussion of the role of the Pythagoreans has suggested, but this does not alter the fact that Numenius and<br>

It first appeared in his 1933 speech “Mentjapai Indonesia Merdeka” (Achieving an Independent Indonesia), quoted in the epigraph above, but nowhere was it more significant than in his famous “Birth of the Pancasila” speech, of June 1, 1945.¹ Speaking to a committee of Japanese officials, Javanese aristocrats, and elite nationalist politicians who had been convened to explore the possibility of Indonesian national independence, he argued that political independence must precede rather than follow from the resolution of such “petty issues”<br>

  Book Title: The Fate of Place-A Philosophical History<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Casey Edward S.<br>
  Abstract: In this imaginative and comprehensive study, Edward Casey, one of the most incisive interpreters of the Continental philosophical tradition, offers a philosophical history of the evolving conceptualizations of place and space in Western thought. Not merely a presentation of the ideas of other philosophers,
      The Fate of Placeis acutely sensitive to silences, absences, and missed opportunities in the complex history of philosophical approaches to space and place. A central theme is the increasing neglect of place in favor of space from the seventh century A.D. onward, amounting to the virtual exclusion of place by the end of the eighteenth century. Casey begins with mythological and religious creation stories and the theories of Plato and Aristotle and then explores the heritage of Neoplatonic, medieval, and Renaissance speculations about space. He presents an impressive history of the birth of modern spatial conceptions in the writings of Newton, Descartes, Leibniz, and Kant and delineates the evolution of twentieth-century phenomenological approaches in the work of Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Bachelard, and Heidegger. In the book's final section, Casey explores the postmodern theories of Foucault, Derrida, Tschumi, Deleuze and Guattari, and Irigaray.<br>

  Author(s) Segal Robert A.<br>
  Abstract: The study of hero myths goes back at least to 1871, when the Victorian anthropologist E. B. Tylor argued that many of them follow a uniform plot: the hero is exposed at birth, is saved by other humans or animals, and grows up to become a national hero (see Tylor 1871, 1:254–55).¹ In 1876 the Austrian scholar Johann Georg von Hahn used fourteen cases to argue that all “Aryan” hero tales follow an “exposure and return” formula more comprehensive than Tylor’s (see von Hahn 1876, 340). In each case the hero is born illegitimately, out of the fear of<br>

  Book Title: Technologies of Life and Death: From Cloning to Capital Punishment-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oliver Kelly<br>
  Abstract: The central aim of this book is to approach contemporary problems raised by technologies of life and death as ethical issues that call for a more nuanced approach than mainstream philosophy can provide. To do so, it draws on the recently published seminars of Jacques Derrida to analyze the extremes of birth and dying insofar as they are mediated by technologies of life and death. With an eye to reproductive technologies, it shows how a deconstructive approach can change the very terms of contemporary debates over technologies of life and death, from cloning to surrogate motherhood to capital punishment, particularly insofar as most current discussions assume some notion of a liberal individual. The ethical stakes in these debates are never far from political concerns such as enfranchisement, citizenship, oppression, racism, sexism, and the public policies that normalize them. Technologies of Life and Death thus provides pointers for rethinking dominant philosophical and popular assumptions about nature and nurture, chance and necessity, masculine and feminine, human and animal, and what it means to be a mother or a father. In part, the book seeks to disarticulate a tension between ethics and politics that runs through these issues in order to suggest a more ethical politics by turning the force of sovereign violence back against itself. In the end, it proposes that deconstructive ethics with a psychoanalytic supplement can provide a corrective for moral codes and political cliches that turn us into mere answering machines.<br>

  Abstract: Novels continue to be new because no one yet knows what they are. The novel has not died but many conceptions of it have. Its birth was marked by painful attempts at self-definition, a struggle that continues to define the genre’s vitality. Of the many critics who have come forward to say what the novel is, few have had their prescriptions pass into use. Two formulations, however, have recently been particularly influential: Georg Lukacs’

My father, an Ulster Presbyterian, had met my mother, a Leinster Catholic, when she nursed in Belfast in the early 1950s.

He did not want to separate the stable things which we see and the shifting way in which they appear; he wanted to depict matter as it takes on form, the birth of order through spontaneous organization” (Merleau-Ponty 1964 [1945]: 13).<br>

Moreover, since that work introduces us to the figure of Dionysus, who plays an increasingly definitive role for Nietzsche’s entire philosophy as it unfolds in the later writings, we can add more emphatically that Raphael’sTransfiguration, as ironic as it may seem, is the monogram of the philosophy of the death of God.

  Abstract: In 1983, Susie Phipps’ five-year, $49,000 legal battle to have her birth certificate’s “erroneous” racial classification changed ended with the court denying her petition.¹ Six years later, Mary Walker’s fight to have her racial classification changed on her birth certificate ended with the court granting the change she sought.² Why did these two cases, seemingly very similar, have totally opposite outcomes? First, Susie Phipps sought to have her racial classification changed from “black” to “white,” while Mary Walker sought a change from “white” to “black.”³ Second, Susie Phipps’ home state, Louisiana, was the only one with a statute legally defining<br>

  Author(s) Carlson Thomas A.<br>
  Abstract: The question of “religion” today often seems most urgent wherever the “human” in its “life” or “nature” appears to grow unstable conceptually and/or to fall under threat existentially. Such instability and threat come into play very notably in the context of recent scientific and technological developments where any number of categories long operative in conceptions of the human—intelligence and agency, birth and death, natural life, and so on—prove increasingly difficult to delimit because open to various forms of manipulation, simulation, or transformation.

But this “memory travel” turns out to be doomed from the start. Only by killing himself at birth, Evan discovers, can he change the past and save the girl he loves.

  Abstract: Henry david thoreau cuts a most unusual figure in the fabric of American life, for he died largely unknown and unrecognized by his peers, perceived as a satellite orbiting an Emersonian center of gravity.¹ Today Thoreau’s reputation has largely eclipsed Emerson’s. The older transcendentalist is viewed more as a popularizer of European ideas than as a progenitor of a unique philosophy. Although Emersonian transcendentalism is moribund, Thoreau’s ideas yet animate reflection on the human condition and are recognized as crucial to the birth of a distinctively American idea of wilderness.

  Abstract: Monsters loom large in the cultural imaginary. From folktales to splatter movies, from the Bible to computer games, from birth to death, monsters such as devils, werewolves, dragons, ghosts, cyborgs, zombies, and vampires inundate our imagination. Monsters, which can be understood as symbols of human vulnerability, can, however, also help us to imagine triumphing over danger. As Stephen T. Asma points out, they are “beneficial foes” that are “imaginative foils for thinking about our own responses to menace” (2009, online).<br>

In contemporary France, these questions resonate in light of the large number of non-French and non-European immigrants, many from former French colonies, who have made France home in recent decades. Historically, French identity has long been understood as the product of a centralized state and culture emanating from Paris that was itself central to European history and civilization. Likewise, French identity in terms of class, gender, nationality, and religion mainly has been explained as a strong, indivisible core, against which marginal actors have been defined.<br>

  Author(s): BURTON NADYA<br>
  Abstract: Natal Signs: Cultural Representations of Pregnancy, Birth and Parenting explores some of the ways in which reproductive experiences are taken up in the rich arena of cultural production. The chapters in this collection pose questions, unsettle assumptions, and generate broad imaginative spaces for thinking about representation of pregnancy, birth, and parenting. They demonstrate the ways in which practices of consuming and using representations carry within them the productive forces of creation. Bringing together an eclectic and vibrant range of perspectives, this collection offers readers the possibility to rethink and reimagine the diverse meanings and practices of representations of these significant life events. Engaging theoretical reflection and creative image making, the contributors explore a broad range of cultural signs with a focus on challenging authoritative representations in a manner that seeks to reveal rather than conceal the insistently problematic and contestable nature of image culture. Natal Signs gathers an exciting set of critically engaged voices to reflect on some of life’s most meaningful moments in ways that affirm natality as the renewed promise of possibility.Natal Signs: Cultural Representations of Pregnancy, Birth and Parenting explores some of the ways in which reproductive experiences are taken up in the rich arena of cultural production. The chapters in this collection pose questions, unsettle assumptions, and generate broad imaginative spaces for thinking about representation of pregnancy, birth, and parenting. They demonstrate the ways in which practices of consuming and using representations carry within them the productive forces of creation. Bringing together an eclectic and vibrant range of perspectives, this collection offers readers the possibility to rethink and reimagine the diverse meanings and practices of representations of these significant life events.

  Author(s) MARTIN BETTY ANN<br>
  Abstract: Sensitive language, remembrance photography, and mementos have become integrated into stillbirth care practices in North American health care institutions for parents and families who have experienced the death of an infant. While representations reflect how families, caregivers, and society understand stillbirth, they also help shape our relationship with birth, death, and both as they occur together. From both subjective and objective points of view, this chapter will explore how words, images, and artifacts come to represent multiple meanings of stillbirth in a way that can both challenge and contribute to the silence, stigma, and emancipation of bereaved parents from ambiguity<br>

  Abstract: In the Chinese-American writer Yiyun Li’s prizing-winning short story “Immortality” (2003), a carpenter’s wife conceives a child on the day Mao Zedong declares the founding of the People’s Republic of China.¹ During her pregnancy, she is inundated with Cultural Revolution–style cult-of-Mao propaganda, and as a result of her constant gazing at Mao’s portrait, she gives birth to a son who is the spitting image of Mao. Years later, soon after Mao’s death, the now grown-up son is whisked to the capital to be trained as Mao’s impersonator. As such, he becomes his hometown’s pride and joy. But when the<br>

Instead, it assumes that there is a public reality where public theology emerges. In an important study of Latin American liberation theology, Brazilian-French scholar Michael Lowy distinguished between liberation theology as a body of literature and the milieu in which it was formed, i.e., the broad network of social movements whose praxis gave birth to liberation theology. He called that broader movement “liberationist Christianity.”¹ According to him, liberationist Christianity preexists liberation theology. The latter is the<br>

  Author(s) Nyers Peter<br>
  Abstract: Both as a moral and political project, cosmopolitanism is invested in a universalism that promotes the impartial treatment of all human beings, irrespective of one’s place of birth, ethnicity, race, gender/sexuality, or religion. Cosmopolitanism, then, is committed to a process of internationalization in which human beings everywhere are world citizens with basic rights grounded in natural law, that is, with rights which cannot be denied by any person(s), group(s), institution(s), or constituted authority, including the nation-state. Stressing the rights of the individual rather than those of the sovereign state, cosmopolitanism thus favours what Brown and Held call a “non-national sense<br>

  The System of Rhetoric from:

  Abstract: Antiquity typically had recourse to the idea of “first inventor” 
                     (prōtos heuretēs) to describe the birth of different activities, arts, and techniques, in order to rationalize in some way their emergence, by attributing them to one individual’s decisive action, whether a mortal’s, a god’s, or a hero’s. Thus the invention of rhetoric was attributed either to Hermes—the god of crossroads and highways, of movement, passage, of communication in all senses of the term—or, as we have seen, to Homer, and finally to three men of the fifth century b.c., Empedokles, Korax, and Tisias.<br>

The protagonists often allude to a legend that gave the mountain its sad name, but their accounts make little sense. (Lane has the jinn happily giving birth to ‘hundreds of children’ – and it is their crying that passing sailors hear. But that would hardly add ‘Grief-Stricken Mother’ to the mountain’s name.)

The Sassanid empire (224–651), extending from central Asia to the Mediterranean, was vastly urbanized and sedentary; the Islamic triumphalism that invaded and conquered it was lightweight, agile, and initially divided along patrimonial communalism.

                  Cosmos and History, with its heartfelt chapter on “The Terror of History.”¹ It seems almost trite to observe, at century’s end, that the History of Religions was born in a time of crisis. Still, at the risk of this banality, it is perhaps worthwhile to recall that that birth didnottake place during the height of wartime crises, from 1914 to 1945.

  Abstract: Proclus was born in Constantinople, where his family was located temporarily on business, on February 8, in 410 or 412 c.e., two years after Alaric sacked Rome.¹ We know the day and month of his birth with relative precision because of his interests in the astrological arts. He received a thorough classical training in Lycia, Alexandria, and Constantinople before assuming the mantle of “successor” to the Platonic Academy in Athens.² He took his place in a two-centuries-old tradition of Neoplatonic thinkers, including Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, Syrianus, and others, who styled themselves as Plato’s true heirs.<br>

  Abstract: From Augustine to our own era, introspection is inextricable from “self-consciousness,” which in turn is integral to and, in some sense, coincident with various understandings of selfhood. Simply, self-consciousness is enacted through self-reflexivity, and in this process of self-awareness, identity emerges. But the word “reflexivity” has a more circumscribed history. Reflexivity appears as a paradigm of understanding the self during the early modern period, coincident with the preoccupation with optics and the birth of a new physics of light. “Reflexivity” was first applied to cognitive introspection, in referring to “thought as bending back upon itself,” in the 1640s, when theologians,<br>

By 1886 the significance of the question had changed for him, yet it continued to occupy his reflections on affirmation. The new preface recalls how he had tried to pose the problem of the value of existence by contrasting the “pessimism” of Greek tragedy and the “optimism” of Socratic philosophy.

  Book Title: Charred Lullabies-Chapters in an Anthropography of Violence<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Daniel E. Valentine<br>
  Abstract: How does an ethnographer write about violence? How can he make sense of violent acts, for himself and for his readers, without compromising its sheer excess and its meaning-defying core? How can he remain a scholarly observer when the country of his birth is engulfed by terror? These are some of the questions that engage Valentine Daniel in this exploration of life and death in contemporary Sri Lanka. In 1983 Daniel "walked into the ashes and mortal residue" of the violence that had occurred in his homeland. His planned project--the study of women's folk songs as ethnohistory--was immediately displaced by the responsibility that he felt had been given to him, by surviving family members and friends of victims, to recount beyond Sri Lanka what he had seen and heard there. Trained to do fieldwork by staying in one place and educated to look for coherence and meaning in human behavior, what does an anthropologist do when he is forced by circumstances to keep moving, searching for reasons he never finds? How does he write an ethnography (or an anthropography, to use the author's term) without transforming it into a pornography of violence? In avoiding fattening the anthropography into prurience, how does he avoid flattening it with theory? The ways in which Daniel grapples with these questions, and their answers, instill this groundbreaking book with a rare sense of passion, purpose, and intellect.<br>

  Abstract: The birth of PTSD followed a historical transformation in psychiatric knowledge making. Out of these changes emerged an invigorated psychiatric science that identified progress with the accumulation of facts by means of testable hypotheses: “Hypotheses prove themselves superior … by surviving strenuous attempts at disconfirmation. Science advances by the replacement of falsified theories by yet to be falsified ones” (Wallace 1988:140). Psychiatric writers associate “testability” with Karl Popper’s epistemology of falsificationism (Faust and Miner 1986). There are important differences between Popperian falsificationism and knowledge making in psychiatric science, though, and I will use the term “fallibilism” when I refer to<br>

Only those which have the desired genetic profile are transferred to the uterus, using standard IVF procedures (Sermon 2002). During the years since its introduction in the 1990s, PGD has been used predominantly to avoid the birth of children affected by identified incurable genetic diseases, such as monogenic disorders¹ (i.e.: cystic fibrosis, hemophilia), or chromosomal aberrations² (Geraedts et al. 1999; Harper et al. 2006).

  Book Title: Microdramas-Crucibles for Theater and Time<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Muse John H.<br>
  Abstract: In
      Microdramas, John H. Muse argues that plays shorter than twenty minutes deserve sustained attention, and that brevity should be considered a distinct mode of theatrical practice. Focusing on artists for whom brevity became both a structural principle and a tool to investigate theater itself (August Strindberg, Maurice Maeterlinck, F. T. Marinetti, Samuel Beckett, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Caryl Churchill), the book explores four episodes in the history of very short theater, all characterized by the self-conscious embrace of brevity. The story moves from the birth of the modernist microdrama in French little theaters in the 1880s, to the explicit worship of speed in Italian Futurist synthetic theater, to Samuel Beckett's often-misunderstood short plays, and finally to a range of contemporary playwrights whose long compilations of shorts offer a new take on momentary theater.Subjecting short plays to extended scrutiny upends assumptions about brief or minimal art, and about theatrical experience. The book shows that short performances often demand greater attention from audiences than plays that unfold more predictably. Microdramas put pressure on preconceptions about which aspects of theater might be fundamental and about what might qualify as an event. In the process, they suggest answers to crucial questions about time, spectatorship, and significance.<br>

Abstract: Outside strictly theological discourse, however, naturalistic arguments were prominent. Used since Athenagoras in the second century to respond to the food chain objection, they are the core of alchemical reasoning. Alchemists found that the ashes of certain plants become the germs of new plants; resurrection thus became an instance of “palingenesis,” the new birth or resuscitation of a disintegrated mineral, vegetal, or animal body.
         68In such a context, explanations of Paracelsian inspiration mingled with the soteriological sense of alchemical symbolism.69Mercury, for example, after its reduction to dust or mixture with other substances, can recover its initial integrity and purity thanks to mechanical actions or by being heated in a special vase. Emblems of the resurrection evoke these operations when they depict a vase accompanied by the legendRedivivus a pulvereorRedivivus ab urna.70In a universe organized by correspondences of microcosm and macrocosm and filled with “signatures,” emblems such as those related to mercury exhibited the natural mechanisms whereby resurrection could take place.71Both literally and figuratively, alchemical manipulations for reconstituting substances were physical models for the resurrection. That, precisely, is what motivated a seventeenth‐century Jesuit’s bitter reproach that, for alchemists, the resurrection was as natural as the birth of a chicken in the furnaces of Egypt.72<br>

It is sufficient to read Murrays (1998) discussion of what he calls (in the title but not throughout his book) American sociolinguistics to find a historical account based on some of the same sources I evoke that is somewhat different from mine. At the same time, I believe that there is sufficient evidence that something quite dramatic happened in the 1960s with the birth of sociolinguistics and the ethnography of communication and something equally dramatic happened in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the influx of new conceptual tools and the wider availability and adoption of new recording technologies.<br>

Abstract: Without lingering over other processes of objectification (psychiatry, biology, etc.), let us consider directly the definition of the human being not only as social animal (social living being), but as political object, such as it ratifies and perfects the “mobilization” without remainder of the humanity of man.
         21The political determination of man is not summed up by his sociability, but, at the very least, politics imposes upon that sociability a technological treatment. In particular, through the determination of one's identity (of his name, I.D., passport) according to number: dates (from birth to death), places (residence, work, trips, etc.), health, commercial operations (bank account numbers, credit cards, etc.), local as well as long‐distance communications (sound and visual recordings, electronic addresses, cell phones, etc.), all become numbers, such that the identity thus “digitized” according to limitless parameters erects a comprehensive definition of the citizen. And inevitably this comprehensive definition ends up by authorizing, indeed demanding, the separation of men according to those who satisfy the political conditions of this citizenship and those who are excluded or ought to be (“exclusion,” beginning with the jobless, the homeless, the maladjusted, delinquents, and illegal immigrants, and ending with the mentally ill, or embryos reputedly not yet humanized, or supernumerary, etc.). From the identity card to the list of interdiction, the outcome, while not good, is nonetheless possible, easy, and rapid. Political wisdom consists first in resisting such an outcome. Failing such resistance, there will be no end of ideologies or racisms that produce definitions of man and, through an inverted outcome, proscribe those who do not fit in, before moving on to the arrest, or indeed to the extermination of the submen or nonmen thus identified.22<br>

         Mediterranean,no matter how much of the book they actually have read, continue to be struck by the energy, engagement, and dedication of a fervent lover and committed convert. “I have passionately loved the Mediterranean, no doubt because I am a northerner like so many others in whose footsteps I have followed.”74This famous opening sentence in the preface to the first edition, dated May 1946, one year after VE Day and Braudel’s release from a German prisoner‐of‐war camp, resonates in Braudel’s remarks during a 1981 interview thirty‐five years later on his initial excitement at seeing the Mediterranean for the first time in October 1923 at the age of twenty‐one:
               North Africa freed Braudel, like so many earlier enchanted and enthralled romantic travelers, from his provincial complaisance. One can almost hear him chanting Goethe’s 1787 credo on finding one’s true self in the liberating southern sun: “I hardly recognize myself. I feel like a completely different person. Yesterday I thought: ‘Either you used to be mad, or you are now.’”It was for me such a surprise! I did not know the sea, I saw the Mediterranean, avowing that it is a present of the gods! Imagine someone like me who went down the Rhone Valley for the first time, who stopped at Marseille, who embarked on a boat and learned with pleasure that he had sea legs—it was just like that—and abruptly saw the arrival of Algiers on the horizon.… Algiers was the most beautiful city in France, after Paris, and a city itself very different, with, I would say, the beauty of its streets, the extraordinary beauty of its women.… It was hot, there was wine, fish, everything that one wants. For me, I began to live.

Abstract: Holistic politics depend on metaphors of birth and invariably call on the resources of reproductive sex. I would suggest that cyborgs have more to do with regeneration. … We require regeneration, not rebirth, and the possibility for our reconstitution includes the utopian dream of the hope for a monstrous world without gender.

Abstract: Whether or not the picture of liberalism and pluralism that these critics paint is entirely fair and accurate, it must be admitted that their emphasis on the nature of religions as radically different communal‐social practices is certainly a welcome reality check for any overenthusiastic and premature envisioning of the harmony of all religions and even their convergence.
         9Furthermore, their—especially the neotraditionalists'—exposure of the political concerns of the modern West underlying the pluralist discourse is perhaps their most significant contribution to the subject of interreligious dialogue. Yet if their untiring emphasis on the particularity of each religious community does not make them reject interreligious dialogue altogether, it leads them to regard the latter at best either as ad hoc apologetics necessitated by the merely occasional and tangential encounters of the largely isolated cultural‐linguistic enclaves that are religions or as the work of evangelization and conversion in another garb that follows the innate logic of the universalizing horizon of Christianity.10As analyses of and positive proposals for interreligious relationships rather than interreligious differences, however, these positions overall fail to take adequately into account the postcolonial or neocolonial character of the concrete economic, political, and cultural context of today’s religious plurality. The so‐called global village and the culturally and religiously plural nation‐states of today are largely products of a colonial and postcolonial history in which the centuries‐long imposition of relations of economic, political, and cultural dominance and subservience has closely interwoven the fate of different communities and brought them into a common space of living. The birth of new ethnically and religiously plural nation‐states along the arbitrarily drawn boundaries of the colonial governing units, the forces of neocolonial global economy and the increasing econo~<br>

Abstract: The relics of St. Maurice were brought to rest next to the shroud in the Turinese cathedral by a complex “sympathetic” movement. First of all, Tesauro contends that the “Theban Legion” is the real “militia of the shroud,” in the sense that it closely recalls the Word’s human experience.
      103Given that it originated in Egypt, the Legion of St. Maurice was meant to echo the exile of the baby Jesus from his fatherland.104St. Maurice as symbol of an entire legion followed the incarnate Word and “copied” his human vicissitudes. According to Tesauro, Maurice recalls both the incarnate Word and the angel Gabriel who witnessed the crucial events of the Word’s human biography. Tesauro underscores that, in hisPassioof St. Maurice, St. Eucherius calls the Theban martyrs “the angelic legion.”105Since in Greek “angelicus martyr” equals “angelicus testis” (witness), it is easy to identify Maurice as the human reflection of the angelic Gabriel, who was both “custodian and minister of the Savior.”106Tesauro contends that Gabriel, the angel who announced the Savior’s birth to Mary, was also the “Angelus Domini,” who sat alone at the Word’s sepulcher, suggested that the holy family leave for Egypt, and finally comforted Jesus in Gethsemane.107According to Tesauro, as in the sepulcher Gabriel functioned as “martyr” (in the sense of “witness”), so does now the martyr Maurice serve as the angel custodian of the shroud.<br>

Abstract: For Halbwachs, the lived experience of history forms social frameworks (
         cadres sociaux) or resonances that enliven religious collective memory, forming the threads between past and present, however frayed. Thus, in his example, the sites central to Jewish history before the birth of Jesus became the very sites onto which the Christian collective memory of Jesus’ life was overlaid. In a move to proclaim both the eternality of the Church and the dominance of its doctrine, early Christians transplanted the likely locales of Jesus’ path, grafting them onto significant sites of Jewish history. The religious collective memory reified in Mrs. Barrett’s room was less selective about the locales subsumed into its overarching narrative; by virtue of being fundamentalist religious collective memory, its colonizing impulse extended to all events in history, not only to ones with particular historical significance.<br>

Abstract: The crux of the equality clause is a prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination on grounds of race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, color, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language, and birth. Indirect discrimination is discrimination that is neither conscious nor intended and may not even be discernible on the surface, for instance, when something is taken for granted but still has a discriminatory impact and leads to discriminatory effects. Significantly, those who discriminate have what is known as the “onus of proof”: they have to show that they are not discriminating, instead of those who feel discriminated against having to prove their case. This is what makes the equality clause so important: it articulates the principle that all people have equal worth on the basis of their human dignity.<br>

Author(s): Wall John<br>
Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Abstract: Like the Book of Mormon, the JST places the knowledge of Christ and the offer of salvation prior to Jesus’s birth. Explicitly, salvation is the plan from the beginning and atonement is God’s anticipatory response to human defection. Hence, a BCE figure in the Book of Mormon will explain: “if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end. And they would have … remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin. But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.”
         64What Adam and Eve originate for their progeny is not evil, but death: “by reason of transgression cometh the fall, which fall bringeth death.”65In the JST narrative, humans are by nature separate, not evil. “The Fall” is not a fall into evil, but into alienation. Adam and Eve’s legacy is not to change human nature but, rather, to change the conditions under which that nature will be developed, that is, out of God’s presence and in a world where “God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other,” according to the Book of Mormon.66<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: By contrast with its culminating evasions, Dickens's novel has begun on the level playing field of the genre. Ethics and epistemology are closely correlated at first in the hero's most pressing question: who has been wronged by my family, what guilt induced by my class station and inheritance? The question, however, does not survive the suppression of its eventual answer. It is gagged once and for all—and bound back into marital closure. For most of Dickens's story, the hero has been searching in the dank basement of his estranged domesticity for an incriminating family secret. As it turns out, that secret is the hero himself, his denied status as stepson the site of the crime. Clennam always felt guilty for not loving his mother and especially for not being loved by her. Now he needn't, because she isn't. But the secret of his birth, mitigating his ingrained sense of worthlessness in the eyes of the false mother, is leaked by narration only to be reabsorbed by characterization within the situational ethics of special pleading, spared shame, and the heroine's own perhaps incompletely examined motives.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 598771<br>
Date: 8 2009<br>
Author(s): Andrew Dudley<br>
Abstract: Yet film studies persists, proving for some that theory is but one of its aspects, on par with the rest. If we still insist on its depth, theory today no longer stands in the middle of the field like a tentpole but rather spreads itself into every inquiry across the field that submits itself to sustained and coherent reflection (as historiography is the theory of historical practice, for example). This change may be most apparent in the shift from the apparatus theory of the 1970s to today's media archeology. The former was itself an apparatus, an instrument to explain the development of cinema's technologies, including their basic ideological effects. Dependent on a few historical postulates (most centrally, that the camera lens reproduces the conditions of vision established at the birth of capitalism with Renaissance perspective), it was built out of passages from Plato, Freud, Lacan, and Marx. Media archeology inverts this research agenda; in each of its many excavations, historians probe aspects of film or other audiovisual phenomena on the irregular rock face of cultural history. The theories of historians of art and science (Jonathan Crary and Friedrich Kittler have been crucial to those who dig into the nineteenth century) guide or fill out such research. This dramatic shift is visible in the near disappearance of Althusser from the works‐cited lists of film scholars after 1985 and the nearly obligatory presence there of Walter Benjamin, whose fragmentary style is itself an amalgam of archival digging and philosophical speculation.<br>

Abstract: What distinguishes Sutcliffe's account from other studies is his emphasis on the effects of seventeenth-century religious debates in defining the relationship between Judaism and the Enlightenment.
         35For instance, he begins his narrative by charting the rise and fall of Christian Hebraism as indicative of the shifting status of biblical criticism on the eve of the Enlightenment. Medieval scholars had been concerned largely with uncovering predictions of Christ's birth in the Old Testament and, thus, with exposing the errors of first-century Jews. By the early seventeenth century, Protestant theologians—particularly Calvinists such as Johannes Buxtorf and Jacques Basnage—had adopted far more nuanced and erudite approaches to Jewish Scripture that at least intermittently engaged with Talmudic tradition. Equally instructive is Sutcliffe's attention to broader contexts surrounding the shifting fortunes of Hebraism. To cite but one example, he carefully situates the Huguenot Basnage's position in the intellectual and political fallout of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes and the polemics that broke out among Protestant émigrés to the Dutch Republic (Sutcliffe, 26–30, 79–89, 103–17).<br>

Abstract: Already in 1939 Lévinas had written that Jews “have the obscure feeling that Hitlerism is like a call to their vocation and to their destiny,” a destiny defined not by monotheism but by a “resistance to the cult of power and earthly greatness.”
         8Against what Lévinas identified as a Nietzschean valorization of nobility and strength, “the message of Judaism is a paradox and an insanity.”9Conversely, however, if Judaism appeared as weakness and passivity before the “morality of the masters,” then the morality of the masters could be exposed as brutish and bullying in the light cast by Judaism. Lévinas proclaims this light as necessary in the thirties when he fears that Christianity had failed to protect Europe from the return of a “primitive mentality” and in the 1960s in response to the cold war and the postcolonial birth of new nations. “At the dawning of the new world,” Lévinas wrote in 1961, “Judaism has the consciousness to possess, through its own permanence, a function in the general economy of Being. No one can replace it. Someone has to exist in the world who is as old as the world.”10<br>

Abstract: In the societies with which I am (more or less) intimately acquainted (Europe, U.S.A., India, and China), people make distinctions between good and bad, just as they make distinctions between beautiful and ugly, powerful and powerless, or, even more broadly, between day and night, young and old, et cetera. For the comparative study of society the importance of these distinctions is that, while they are universal, they are applied in very different ways. So, while the distinction between hot and cold is universal, it is applied in India, for example, to eating meat versus eating vegetables that have consequences for one’s entire quality of being. Such are the moral consequences of certain food habits, but inversely there is also an understanding in India that one’s birth in a particular social group determines who one is and what one eats. This explains why the warrior has to kill and why the Brahman refrains from killing. Killing is not reprehensible, as it belongs to the nature of the warrior. Certainly, not killing is superior to killing, but in order for some to be able not to kill, others have to. India offers us a case of moral relativism, related to a hierarchical social system. However, since the nineteenth century, reformers in India have wanted to reform this way of thinking, because, as they argue, it implies a system of social discrimination against untouchables who do impure work; it goes against one of the basic tenets of a modern society, the moral value of social equality. What we have in the anthropology of India is research on uneasy combinations of caste and class, of hierarchy and equality, of social impurity and hygiene. Indian society emphasizes right behavior in terms of family, sexuality, gender, and food; it is, at the same time, a society with extreme inequality, extreme infant mortality, and extreme poverty. It is highly moral and highly immoral at the same time, depending on one’s viewpoint.<br>

               It should not be forgotten that Roman citizenship was extended to most of Italy by the time of Varro’s writing. He does not only acknowledge the introduction of Italian deities to Rome by the early kings, but deals with a wealth of middle Italian local deities, belittled (and preserved) by Tertullian as55
            deos decuriones cuiusque municipii, “town council deities” (frag. 33b):

               Despite Tertullian’s derision, Varro should be taken here as serious as he was in naming Nona and Decima as goddesses of timely birth.[The Delventinus of the Casinienses, the Visidanus of the Narnienses, the Ancharia of the Asculani, the Nortia of the Volsinienses, the Valentia of the Ocriculani, the Hostia of the Sutrini, the Juno of the Falisci accepted a surname (Curritis) in honor of pater Curres.]

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Badiou also emphasizes that the subjects to the truth of the resurrection, by the very fidelity toward that truth, are enabled to “refuse to submit to the order of the world as it has existed and instead struggle for a new one.”
         
               The community of the believers is constituted by their faithfulness toward the event that, in turn, allows them—and only them—to see the truth that it communicates. While the State’s interest is always in reforming the world, the believers are not interested in reforming the existing reality but in the birth of a new one. Therefore, those who feed on the truth-event adopt “a necessary distance from the State and from what corresponds to the State in people’s consciousness: the apparatus of opinion.”168
            
               Following Paul, Badiou admonishes that “a truth is a serious and concentrated procedure, which must never enter into competition with established opinions.”169
            
               This distinction between the opinions and the truth may suggest the same anti-idolatrous tendency that underlies Bonhoeffer’s reflection on the arcane discipline: the church must not allow the truth of the resurrection to be “sold” to the world as one of many products, since that would cause the specifically Christian discourse of the evental grace to degenerate into something we might call the “market-discourse” or, somewhat ironically, the “American discourse.”170<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Abstract: At a time when immanent abandonment of plural marriage was sorely testing the faithful's confidence, rituals commemorating Joseph Smith's birth established three aspects of his legacy as the core of L.D.S self-conception: restored church order, divine authority, and continuing revelation. These three claims, inscribed on the Vermont monument, were given particular force by the church's new Progressive-Era uses of the autobiographical narrative of Joseph Smith's early life. Specifically, during this period the narrative of Smith's original theophany achieved the primacy once accorded plural marriage, allowing the Latter-day Saints to forget as a practical matter, the once-definitive marriage practice. This essay uses theories of narrative and myths of origin to show how uses of Smith's theophany allowed the Latter-day Saints to jettison plural marriage without destroying their identity, much less their confidence in Joseph Smith as church founder.<br>

Article Title: 'Getting out and Getting Away': Women's Narratives of Class Mobility<br>
Publisher: Taylor & Francis Group<br>
Issue: i260667<br>
Date: 10 1, 1931<br>
Author(s): Woolf Steph<br>
Abstract: This article is concerned with the ways in which women narrate a move from a 'working-class' position to a position marked (in however fragmentary and complex a way) as 'middle class'. While such a move might be seen in terms of a straightforward escape from a disadvantaged social position, I argue here that what has to be analysed is the pain and the sense of estrangement associated with this class movement. Drawing on the class narratives of a group of seven white British women, the article uses Bourdieu's concepts of symbolic capital and habitus to explore the cultural and symbolic configurations of class. These configurations may be inscribed into the self, so that the self, itself, is class marked. Since working-class selves are frequently marked in pathological terms, this raises particular difficulties for the idea of an 'escape' from such a position. Class in this sense is embedded in people's history and so cannot be so easily 'escaped'. The usual conventions of life-narratives - in which the self remains the same entity from birth to death and later events are a culmination of earlier ones - are also disrupted in this case. But if a working-class position is marked as pathological, so too is taking on the markers of middle-class existence. to do so is not only to risk 'getting it wrong', but it is also to risk the scorn attached to 'pretentiousness'. There is a particular jeopardy here for women, since it is women who have been especially associated with desires for artefacts associated with bourgeois existence. The article argues for a focus for classed desires and class envy, not in pathological terms, but in terms of a coherent response to political and social exclusions.<br>

Abstract: The last fifteen years have witnessed an explosion of interest in the history of the Cold War. Historical attention has focused not only on the diplomatic and military aspects of the conflict, but also, increasingly, on its cultural, intellectual, and technological dimensions. One of the fruits of this widening of scope in Cold War studies is a burgeoning literature on the development of the post-Second World War American human sciences. Studies of the Cold War career of the human sciences, however, have often been inflected by moralistic, and sometimes tendentious, claims about the relationship between the state and the academy. This article seeks to explain the chief characteristics of the historiography of the human sciences in Cold War America by describing its formation in the interstices of three distinct lines of inquiry: the history of science, the cultural turn in Cold War studies, and the history of the birth of the human science professions in the United States. It argues that historians of the post-war American human sciences have absorbed some features of these literatures, whilst neglecting others that offer more nuanced perspectives on the relationship between scientific research and its patrons during the Cold War era. Moreover, it suggests that the best prospects for the future maturation of the field lie in the recovery of 'middle-range contextualizations' that link post-war trends in the human sciences to interwar and turn-of-the-century developments, thereby making the Cold War context less all-encompassing than it has sometimes appeared.<br>

Abstract: En considérant la théâtralité moins comme l'essence du théâtre, lui-même haut lieu de la mimésis, que comme sa condition d'émergence, nous voulons mettre en évidence ce qui pourrait la révéler par-delà le texte et la scène: altérité, imprésentabilité, féminité. Bien que liée intimement au lieu et au jeu de la représentation, impliquant acteurs, spectateurs et décors, la théâtralité se présentera plus comme un lieu de créativité, un espace transitionnel où se joue (de) la vérité. On en en mesurera l'enjeu à travers une relecture intertextuelle de La naissance de la tragédie et de fragments posthumes de la même période, en interrogeant la légitimité d'un instinct théâtral qui serait l'une des formes essentielles du Kunsttrieb dont le destin est de procéder à une métaphorisation de « Dionysos agissant » et à une poétisation dévoilante de la vérité dont l'acteur deviendra finalement l'interprète en cela même qu'il en joue sur le mode de l'absence et qu'il ouvre un texte vers cet autre qui ne s'y présente jamais comme tel. Considering theatrality less as the essence of theatre, which is the high place for Mimesis, than the condition of its emergence, we would like to bring to force what could express it above text and performance: alterity, impresentability, feminity. Even if it seems closely related to place and acting of the representation, including the actors, the spectator and the setting, theatrality will prove to be a place for creativity, a transitional space in which truth can be performed. We will assess its stakes through a second intertextual reading of The Birth of Tragedy and of posthumous extracts from the same period; we can at the same time wonder over the legitimacy of a theatral instinct which would be one of the essential forms of the « Kunstriels »; its fate is to act as a metaphor of an « acting Dionysos » and to a revealing poetisation of truth for which the actor eventually turns out to be the interpret in so far as he plays on it on being absent ~<br>

Abstract: Schwartz argues for the later rabbinic development of practices related to death: "Indeed, if it
is the case that even strongly 'Jewish' Jews were often buried without the accompaniment of Jewish
iconography—that despite what we are accustomed to think about such liminal moments as birth,
death, marriage and so on, death was not yet generally an occasion among Palestinian Jews for
strong public affirmation of group identity—then Beth Shearim shows that the judaization of
Jewish burial practice was now (third-fourth century) underway in some circles" (2001: 154).<br>

Abstract: Controlling for insecurities depends on a capacity to make inferences on the basis of experiences about the past, yet the use of knowledge about the past for anticipating and predicting future threats is highly problematic. This article examines the problem of governing individuals on the basis of what is available about their past deeds and social networks in governmental and commercial archives. It highlights the tension between administrative and private narratives about individuals, the former being constructed on the basis of minute details collected and stored about individuals since birth, and the latter referring to the accounts individuals offer of themselves. By applying the notions of ipse and idem identity developed by Paul Ricoeur, the article examines the two-way flow between memory and identity and the consequent concern that administrative narratives are blind to the ethical renewal of individuals, to the capacity of Man to extricate himself from the shackles of his past. To prepare the ground, the article considers some inherent limitations of biopolitics, pointing out that although biopolitics was classically concerned to govern both individual bodies and the body politic, administrative and governmental limitations have led states to govern the "average citizen" rather than individuals in their "individuality."<br>

Author(s): MacAVOY LESLIE<br>
Abstract: In this paper I take issue with Heidegger's use of the concept of death as a means of disclosing human finitude. I argue that Being-towards-death is inadequate to the disclosure of Dasein's thrownness which is necessary for the kind of authentic historizing that Heidegger describes and furthermore leads to a reading of authenticity which is preclusive of Being-with-Others. I suggest that this difficulty may be alleviated through increased attention to the opposite boundary of Dasein's existence, namely its birth. Although I do not pursue the project here of conducting a phenomenology of birth, I suggest some directions for proceeding with that task, and I illustrate that a greater emphasis on Dasein's beginning will increase the richness of our understanding of our Being-with-Others.<br>

Abstract: This retardation theory, developed by the Dutch biologist Louis Bolk (1866-1930), is now
considered obsolete. Developmental psychologists and neurobiologists do not consider the
baby as passive recipient, but have found that the baby already at birth possesses a refined
motor repertoire and advanced sensory skills. By way of its specific bio-psychical equipment it
models and initiates the mother-child interaction from the start. See for instance Stern (1985).<br>

Abstract: Dieser Aufsatz greift auf die Forschungen des Altgermanisten Friedrich Ohly zurück, der die Geisteswissenschaften durch eine metaphern-orientierte Forschung neu stimulieren wollte: Metaphern, so Friedrich Ohly, seien nicht Restbestände, sondern Grundbestände menschlichen Lebens. Besonders die religiöse Sprache komme nicht ohne Metaphern aus. So sei die Beziehung zwischen Gott und den Menschen allein metaphorisch zu versprachlichen. Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird der metaphern-orientierte Zugang von Friedrich Ohly auf die Metapher „Gotteskind“ bzw. „Gotteskindschaft“ angewendet. Näherhin analysiert der Beitrag die Prägekraft der Metapher „Gotteskind“ bzw. „Gotteskindschaft“ mit Blick auf die Taufliturgie und die Tauftheologie der Alten Kirche. Unabhängig von seinem biologischen Alter – so geben sich die Jesus-Anhänger von Anfang an überzeugt – wird der Christ jung in der Taufe und bleibt jung, wenn er seine Taufberufung in Treue bewahrt. So seien als Schlüsselgedanken des vorliegenden Aufsatzes hervorgehoben: erstens die Taufe als geistliche Geburt und Anfang der Kindwerdung; zweitens die metaphorische Rede von der Taufeucharistie als Milch, welche als lebenslängliche geistliche Speise für die Gotteskinder gilt (1 Petr 2,2). This article examines the research of Friedrich Ohly, a medievalist who sought to stimulate spiritual understanding through thought which explored the significance of metaphor. For him, metaphors were not merely the remains, but parts of the active inventory of human life. Religious language, in particular, could not do without them. The relationship between God and man could be articulated only by metaphoric means. In this article Ohly's approach is applied to the metaphor of 'God's Child', or 'Divine Filiation'. The article seeks to analyse the power of the impression of the metaphor itself with a view to the baptismal liturgy and baptismal theology of the ancient Church. From the very beginning Christians had been convinced that new believers be~<br>

Abstract: Muslims, and other people whose religions are based in scripture, develop and transform stories from scripture to explain local practices in world-religious terms, yet anthropologists seldom study these processes. This article concerns elaborations on Islamic traditions by Gayo people in highland Sumatra, Indonesia. Gayo narrators draw on stories of Adam and Eve's children to account for processes of birth, hunting and agriculture. Special attention is given here to the functions played by ideas of sibling conflict, improper marriage, and gender in these narrative transformations.<br>

Abstract: En marge de la liturgie des saints anges et de la figure anonyme de l'ange gardien que le catholicisme affecte à la protection de chaque fidèle, existe aujourd'hui une angélologie postulant l'existence de soixante-douze anges gardiens nommés et spécialisés, assignés à l'humanité entière en fonction de la date de naissance de l'individu. À travers l'étude des ouvrages concernant ces anges et de quelques entretiens, cet article analyse la construction de cette figure de l'ange, différente de celle que reconnaît l'Église. Cette production syncrétique reprend certains éléments de la conception catholique moderne de l'ange tutélaire et du saint, mais s'inspire aussi des spéculations théologiques des premiers siècles sur les anges, des doctrines kabbalistiques de la Remaissance, de l'occultisme du XIXe siècle et de l'astrologie zodiacale moderne. /// At the frontiers of the liturgy of the Holy Angels and the nameless figure of the guardian angel that catholicism assigns to protect each of the faithful, an angelology has now emerged, proposing the existence of seventy-two guardian angels each with their own name and specialized role, assigned to all humanity according to each person's date of birth. Studying published works on these angels and in the course of a number of interviews, the present article analyses the construction of this figure of the angel, an image that differs from the one recognized by the Catholic Church. This syncretic production takes up certain elements of the modern catholic conception of the angel as guardian and of the saints, but bases itself also on the theoretical speculations on the angels during the first centuries, on the kabbalistic doctrines of the Renaissance, on 19th century occultism and the modern astrology of the zodiac. /// Al margen de la liturgia de los santos ángeles y de la figura anónima del ángel custodio que el catolicismo destina a la protección de cada fiel, existen hoy especulaciones postulando la existencia de setenta y d~<br>

Abstract: The place of narrative in organizing our experience in the world has been the topic of much discussion in recent years. This paper starts from the position developed by the psychologist Jerome Bruner, who argues that there are two distinct modes of thought, the paradigmatic (or logico-scientific) and the narrative, and that they are equally important in ordering experience and constructing meaning. Texts written in both of these modes were crucial in the establishment of Pure Land Buddhism in Japan during the Heian Period. The Ōjōyōshū, written by Genshin in 985, is perhaps the single most important text in the development of this form of Buddhism in Japan, but insofar as it presents a systematic and comprehensive outline of Pure Land cosmology, doctrine, and practice, it is an example of a text written in the paradigmatic mode. But another text from this period written in the narrative mode, the Nihon Ōjō Gokuraku-ki by Yoshishige no Yasutane, played an equally important role in the spread of Pure Land Buddhism. This text is a collection of forty-two brief biographies of people believed to have been born in the Pure Land. These biographies serve both to "prove" that the Pure Land really exists and provide us with models with which to fashion our lives so we can gain birth in the Pure Land.<br>

Article Title: The Anxiety of Inheritance: Reinhold Niebuhr and the Literal Truth of Original Sin<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000941<br>
Date: 4 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Rees Geoffrey<br>
Abstract: Widely regarded as the most influential proponent of the truth of original sin in the twentieth century, Reinhold Niebuhr worked hard to excise any "literalistic" element from his interpretation of the doctrine. In his attempt to "correct" the Augustinian tradition on original sin by purging it of all "literalistic errors," however, Niebuhr assumed as his starting point the most characteristically modern objection to the doctrine: that birth is a thoroughly natural, animal, and morally meaningless event. As a result, Niebuhr unnecessarily constrained his vision of the dimensions of human freedom, and hence his description of the dynamic of anxiety and freedom that energizes sin. Through a careful reading of Reinhold Niebuhr's writings on original sin, in light of the truth that the end of human life is inseparable from its origins, a reappraisal and recovery of the meaningfulness of the assertion of original sin as a literal inheritance is possible. The result of such a reappraisal and recovery is an amplified insight into the existential anxiety that Niebuhr otherwise described so convincingly.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo mostra até que ponto a transferência psicanalítica, produto de marca da aliança terapêutica, tem por vocação ser ultrapassada mediante a progressiva tomada de consciência que a pessoa analisada faz do caráeter instrumental da transferência. A transferência, com efeito, está destinada a dissolver-se no final da cura analítica. É verdade que a psicanálise, na sua técnica, contém sérios problemas; o artigo, porém, mostra como o seu "trabalho" essencial consiste em promover a transformação que o próprio sujeito opera mediante a sua palavra criativa, palavra esta que Ihe proporciona o seu próprio nascimento de si. /// This article tries to evince how the psychoanalytical transference, as a regular product of the therapeutic alliance, is meant to be overcome by a progressive consciousness that the patient acquires of its instrumental character. The transference is destined to be dissolved at the end of the analysis. It is true that psychoanalysis, in its technique, harbours serious problems; its essential « travail » , however, is to promote the transformation that a person realizes through his/her own creative word that pushes him/her to give birth to him/herself.<br>

Author(s): Triefenbach Kenneth S.<br>
Abstract: The rationalist fantasy of the Enlightenment is the myth of the nonviolent origins of virtue, typically represented through the image of rational birth. This myth falters when Odoardo Galotti, invoking the second birth of reason, kills his daughter. This article examines Lessing's Die Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts-essentially a treatise on the phylogeny/ontogeny distinction-in terms of a recuperative rationalist gesture that continues to inform Freud's oedipal theory as well as Claude Lévy-Strauss's understanding of the "cerebral savage." These theories are not treated as methodological frameworks for reading Lessing but rather as evidence of the tanacity of Enlightenment desires, which are already problematized by texts like Emilia Galotti.<br>

Abstract: When Nietzsche is called a radical philosopher, it is (among other reasons) because he questions (or at least claims to call into question) what other thinkers take for granted. In the article I concentrate on the way in which Nietzsche asks his questions, and how his questions (and the vocabulary which he uses to express his questions) develop through his writings. This development can be summarized with the help of a comparison between the orginal preface to the Birth of Tragedy (1872) and the new preface for the edition of 1886: it is a development from only a few and mainly rhetorical questions to a great number of intricate questions that often are selfreferential and call the questioner himself into question. The article points out how Nietzsche gradually discovers his proper question and how this search reaches it climax around 1886. This proper question turns out to be a practical or existential one: "To what extent can truth endure incorporation?" (Gay Science p. 110)<br>

Abstract: De 1997 à 2002, eurent lieu la naissance, l'élaboration puis la création par l'Ensemble Modem de Francfort d'un opéra vidéo du compositeur minimaliste américain Steve Reich et de la vidéaste Beryl Korot: Three Tales. Cet opéra était une commande de Klaus Peter Kehr, directeur musical des Wiener Festwochen (Vienne). Sa réalisation mobilisa un important réseau de collaborations aboutissant à un montage financier mené sur la base d'une coproduction de grande ampleur réunissant des festivals européens de création contemporaine de premier rang et deux festivals américains. L'auteur décrit sa démarche, à travers quelques « moteurs de recherche », ainsi que son implication personnelle dans le projet lui-même. The birth, preparation, and actual performance of Three Tales, a video opera signed by Steve Reich, the American minimalist composer, and Beryl Korot, the video-artist, took place between 1997 and 2002, under the aegis of the Frankfurt Modern Ensemble. The opera had been commissioned by Klaus Peter Kehr, musical director of the Wiener Festwochen in Vienna. The project was thus based on a vast collaborative network resulting in an coproduction agreement for funding. This agreement brought together a number of leading European festivals for contemporary creation and two American festivals. The author of the paper describes his research protocol, by way of a certain number of "search engines". He also refers to his own personal involved in the project. Zwischen 1997 und 2002 wurde die Idee zu der Videooper „Three Tales" des minimalistischen Komponisten Steve Reich und des Videokünstlers Beryl Korot vom Modernen Ensemble der Oper Frankfurt umgesetzt. Die Oper war eine Auftragsarbeit des Intendanten der Wiener Festwochen, Klaus Peter Kehr. Ihre Inszenierung konnte finanziell durch ein Netzwerk realisiert werden, einer Kooperation von hochrangigen europäischen und amerikanischen Festivals zeitgenössischer Kunst.

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i40059165<br>
Date: 11 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Larkin Craig<br>
Abstract: This article seeks to address how Lebanese youth are dealing with the legacy of civil war (1975-90), given the national backdrop of official silence, persisting injustice, and competing memory discourses. Drawing on Marianne Hirsch's concept of postmemory, it explores the memory of a generation of Lebanese who have grown up dominated not by traumatic events but by narrative accounts of events that preceded their birth. This residual form of memory carries and connects with the pain of others, suffusing temporal frames and liminal positions. The article examines how postmemory is mediated and transformed through the mnemonic lenses of visual landscapes and oral narratives. Consideration is given to the dynamic production of "memoryscapes"—memories of violence localized in particular sites—and to narrative constructions of the past implicated in the ongoing search for meaning, historical truth, and identity. This article seeks to challenge pervasive notions of Lebanese postwar amnesia and of a generational detachment from the residual effects and future implications of war recollections.<br>

Abstract: Tonality in literature is often mentioned but barely treated, except by Frye. Yet it is possible to trace the history of confrontation with literary tonality, realize its link with the birth of phenomenology — and see in Aristotle's Poetics, through its treatment of tonality, a phenomenological approach current structuralist doxa notwithstanding.<br>

Abstract: L'ontologie heideggérienne de l'être-pour-la-mort a souvent servi de référence négative à Paul Ricoeur. Il lui a très tôt opposé trois thèses qu'il n'aurait peut-être pas formulées s'il n'avait pas croisé la philosophie de Jaspers: a) « La naissance signifie plus que la mort » ; b) « la rencontre décisive avec la mort est la mort de l'être aimé » ; c) « la mortalité elle-même doit être pensée sub specie vitae et non sub specie mortis ». La première thèse conditionne les deux suivantes. Elle introduit une phénoménologie de l' « être-envie » qui en appelle de la vie reçue à la vie transmise. On objectera peut-être que la phénoménologie de l'être-en-vie suppose l'ontologie de l'être-pour-la-mort. Mais, même si c'était le cas, elle n'en transformerait pas moins profondément la signification. La compréhension de l'existence est affectée elle-même par les phénomènes de la vie reçue et transmise. C'est ce que veut dire cette expression: « exister vivant ». L'angoisse de la fin n'annule pas la joie des commencements. Peut-être même reçoit-elle de celle-ci son sens. Paul Ricoeur has often referred to Heidegger's ontology of being-towards-death to oppose it. He early set against it three thesis that he might have formulated differently had he not studied Jasper's philosophy : a) « birth means more than death » ; b) « the decisive encounter with death is the death of the loved one » ; c) « mortality itself must be thought sub specie vitae, not sub specie mortis ». From the first thesis, can be inferred the two others. It brings in a phenomenology of being-alive. One may raise the objection that the phenomenology of being-alive presupposes the ontology of being-towards-death. But even so it would be necessarily transform its meaning. The understanding of existence is itself affected by the phenomena of life as given and received. Such is the meaning of the phrase: « existing alive ». The distress of the end never cancels the joy of the beginnings. It may even get its sense from~<br>

Abstract: Certains travaux récents de Paul Ricœur montrent un déplacement d'accent : au lieu d'une interrogation sur la fragilité humaine comme dans la Philosophie de la volonté, Ricœur se préoccupe davantage aujourd'hui de la vie, de la natalité, du désir d'accomplissement. Cette dette aristotélicienne trahit-elle l'inspiration que le philosophe avait trouvée dans la tradition biblique ? Même si certains thèmes s'articulent de manière inédite, cet article souligne que la thèse reste inchangée : c'est bien le sujet qu'il faut parvenir à saisir, à la fois dans sa capacité et dans sa fragilité. La référence à Aristote invite alors à jeter un nouveau pont entre la philosophie et la théologie. Certain recent works of Paul Ricoeur show a transition: in the place of human frailty, as in the philosophy of will, Ricœur is more and more occupied today by life, birth, and the desire of accomplishment. Does this Aristotelian debt betray an inspiration that the philosopher had found in Biblical tradition? Even if certain themes are articulated in a new way, the article shows that the same thesis remains: it is still the subject which one must grasp, both in its capacity as in its frailty. So the reference to Aristotle is an invitation to see a new bridge between philosophy and theology.<br>

Abstract: P. Ricœur établit une relation méthodologique entre l'épistémologie et la phénoménologie herméneutique, en considérant l'épistémologie comme une médiation entre la phénoménologie et l'herméneutique. Cette considération de l'épistémologie en tant que médiation est profondément liée à la notion spécifique de « texte » chez P. Ricœur. Cet article montre que même si la philosophie de Ricœur ne traite pas de l'épistémologie des sciences de la nature, celle-ci peut être approfondie par une phénoménologie herméneutique : la phénoménologie éclaire la naissance du réseau conceptuel d'une théorie; l'épistémologie éclaire sa structure intérieure; l'herméneutique éclaire son interprétation et la liaison avec la réalité physique. P. Ricœur establishes a methodological relationship between epistemology and hermeneutical phenomenology, considering epistemology as mediation between phenomenology and hermeneutics. Ricœur's consideration of epistemology as mediation is profoundly related to his specific notion of text. This paper shows that even if Ricœur's philosophy does not refer to the epistemology of natural sciences, the latter can be deepened by hermeneutical phenomenology : phenomenology clarifies the birth of a conceptual network of a theory; epistemology clarifies its internal structure; hermeneutics clarifies its interpretation and its relation with physical reality.<br>

Abstract: Shikhat are female performers in Moroccan society whose singing and dancing are central to all festivity, including rites of passage like marriage ceremonies and birth and circumcision celebrations. Despite their centrality, however, shikhat are socially marginal due to the license that they exhibit both in performance and in their "off-stage" lives. This article examines the artistic and bodily competencies of the shikhat as they articulate some of the more powerful metaphors of Moroccan identity, extending ultimately from embodiments of shame to embodiments of the one heterogeneous nation.<br>

Author(s): Soto Ana María Riveros<br>
Abstract: This study presents an interpretation of the configuration of the poetic subject in the books of poems El Primer Libro (1985) and Albricia (1988) by Soledad Fariña (1943), which understand a self in a continuous process of gestation and birth. This process serves the purpose of recomposing a disarticulated subjectivity lost in the framework of the political and cultural conditions imposed by the military dictatorship that ruled Chile in the 1970s and 1980s. By using a metaphor of a journey and searching for a new language, the subject attempts to access a primitive stage andfind its maternal self in order to confront the dominant power, by codifying and configuring herself through an otherness in a feminine body-text. However, this process of maturation and discovery is intervened and left incomplete by the impulse of modernity, thereby creating a deformed, dissociated and off-centered self, which aims at growing opposed to logos. This conflict turns the upcoming of the new self into a painful event, like giving birth, that stems from the subject's wounded and fractured body, intending to re-establish de selffrom its fragments, traces and memories.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the formative role of the World War II experience in shaping politically relevant memories in postwar Italy. Rather than considering the past a legacy or a heritage—something abstract, malleable and susceptible to serving political interests—the focus here is on the meaning-giving power of memories and symbols in the historical evolution. The birth of Italian democracy after the war was preceded by disruptive events that could have divided the nation. This article illustrates how contested and fragmented interpretations of critical events were structured by and through the dimension of cultural memory, which sustained social and political imaginations, eventually shaping characters and outcomes of the Italian political transformation.<br>

Abstract: Yet the very title of the collection and its constituent poems,
      Sonnagrams, echoes the name of an obstetric ultrasound procedure that sends sound waves through the body, suggesting a sounding or reverberation that recurs to (imminent) birth as a trope for poetic making. In a sonogram, the length of time that an echo takes to return measures the depth of the body's tissue, which causes interference for the echo. In this vividly corporeal portrayal of poiesis, an alternative to the aggression of cannibalism, the poet turns an ear to his or her predecessors and their echoes filter through the poet's body, leaving the realm of sound to begin to form images.<br>

Abstract: Dekuah is a spirit child whose goal is to punish its birthing family, as it is bound to slip into the birthing mother's womb again, only to die again after birth. It is to be assumed that Dekuah is a gratuitously malignant spirit that delights in the pain of the persons who gave it life. Some children, according to this mythology, succeed in being born up to three times. There is an obvious influence of Wole Soyinka's poem “Abiku” on Jabbeh Wesley's uses of Dekuah in her poetry. In “Abiku,” the spirit child boasts in the first stanza that there is nothing his birthing family can do to keep him in the land of the living:
         
               
         In vain your bangles cast
               Charmed circles at my feet
               I am Abiku, calling for the first
               And repeated time<br>

Abstract: It is not surprising that the name given to the continent is not derivative from any indigenous language of the peoples of Africa. Given the fact that it was known by cultures outside of the continent, knowledge of Africa was for some time based upon those areas available primarily through the waters of the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. After the advent of Islam, more knowledge of the vast interior of Africa began to be made known to outsiders. It should be emphasized that the several cultures within this landscape did not identify themselves as Africans. Their identity was based upon local knowledge of their origins and the lands of their birth, as well as the modes and forms of exchanges they made with their neighbors. In other words, it is difficult to give specification and a generalized meaning to the peoples and cultures of this continent through recourse to the name “Africa.”<br>

Abstract: We find one of the major conditions for this diversification in the growth of SPEP's membership and the number of participants on the programs. In its early days, when thirty or fewer people attended meetings, most sessions could be plenary, and people could expect during the conference conversations on papers and commentaries that everyone had heard. But as the members and range of interest increased, the number of sessions also increased to accommodate the volume of submissions and to lessen conflict with those who felt that their interests had inadequate representation on the programs. Growth brought with it complex new political problems involving incompatible points of view as well as gender and generational differences. The consequences of this growth included diversification and restructuring of the programs, an increased suspicion of and attention to the Executive Committee, an intensified alertness to exclusions, and the formation of a dynamic organization that had less and less to do with its name. These conditions helped to give birth to a new organizational arrangement where centralized power became increasingly fragmented. There was no one mission. There were multiple missions that gave rise to conflict and needed negotiation to function collaboratively, if often with suspicion of each other. But the revolution was not over.<br>

Abstract: Yet D. W. Griffith's film raises the question of from whose perspective a text is defined as epic. Woodrow Wilson may have famously judged it “history written with lightning”
         
               —but would it also represent the truth of history to an African American audience—was it the birth of4
            theirnation? The valorization of discourse as “truth” is, as Foucault always reminds us, the province of power; and the notion of nationhood is similarly determined by ideology. Martin Luther King may have dreamed in August 1963 that one day his nation would “rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed”—but Malcolm X understood that there could be nations within nations.<br>
