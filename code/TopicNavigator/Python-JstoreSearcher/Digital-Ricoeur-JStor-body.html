  Author(s) MCARTHUR JO-ANNE<br>
  Abstract: When the gentle turkey called Dante began to flail and flap in the grip of a heart attack, VINE Sanctuary’s recently hired bird caregiver Danielle Salino flung herself over him, using her own body to buffer him and others from the frantic spasms of his powerful wings. She whispered to him until the spasms subsided then remained draped over his body.<br>

  Abstract: Traumatic violence has caught Oedipus in an ongoing repetition of mimetic rivalry, rooting him in an eternal present. Compellingly demonstrated not only in
                  Oedipus the Kingbut also inOedipus at Colonus, his trauma is visceral. For Oedipus’s suffering is written on his body: his unsightly face, expressed pain, and profound exhaustion offer graphic testimony.¹ Others reflect back to Oedipus their horror: Oedipusisa polluting presence.² Attentive to Oedipus’s distress, in this chapter I examine the representation of trauma as well as actions that promise to break open constraints on Oedipus, permitting the transformation of Oedipus’s memories.³ InOedipus<br>

  Abstract: This chapter argues that moving beyond realism—to post-realism—requires moving beyond the gender-blindness of conventional accounts.¹ My argument weaves together areas of inquiry that are usually treated in isolation. Intellectual developments associated with the rise of systematic inquiry in ancient Greece—marked by the shift from rhetoric to philosophy and its foundational dichotomies of reason over affect, mind over body—comprise one area of inquiry. Another is the study of historical-political developments—the shift to centralized authority and its dichotomies of public over private, civilized over “other”—within which Western science and political theory “emerged.” A third area of<br>

  Book Title: The Red Sea-In Search of Lost Space<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wick Alexis<br>
  Abstract: The Red Sea has, from time immemorial, been one of the world's most navigated spaces, in the pursuit of trade, pilgrimage and conquest. Yet this multidimensional history remains largely unrevealed by its successive protagonists. Intrigued by the absence of a holistic portrayal of this body of water and inspired by Fernand Braudel's famous work on the Mediterranean, this book brings alive a dynamic Red Sea world across time, revealing the particular features of a unique historical actor. In capturing this heretofore lost space, it also presents a critical, conceptual history of the sea, leading the reader into the heart of Eurocentrism. The Sea, it is shown, is a vital element of the modern philosophy of history.Alexis Wick is not satisfied with this inclusion of the Red Sea into history and attendant critique of Eurocentrism. Contrapuntally, he explores how the world and the sea were imagined differently before imperial European hegemony. Searching for the lost space of Ottoman visions of the sea,
      The Red Seamakes a deeper argument about the discipline of history and the historian's craft.<br>

  Abstract: Whatʹs ʺmissingʺ from Artaudʹs spontaneous take on Balinese theater (see above, p. 235) is the awareness of a self-conscious body of discourse, an indigenous and fully formulated Balinese poetics, behind the work observed. This poetics—following from what Stephen Lansing, on a Southeast Asian model, calls ʺthe aesthetics of the ʹsounding of the textʹ ʺ—illuminates not only Balinese performance per se but the nature of performance art in general. Such an ʺillumination in generalʺ is, of course, what weʹve always posited for forms of Western discourse—the assumption, for example, that Aristotleʹs equally localized, Athenian Poetics is the basis,<br>

  Abstract: Analytic statements about music inevitably have a hermetic quality. Even the simplest descriptions, say the labeling of an interval or a chord, call on an assumed body of technical knowledge that, at least initially, does not seem to point beyond itself. Those who love music but lack the technical knowledge tend to find analytic descriptions alienating, irrelevant, or intimidating. Those who have the knowledge do not always feel compelled to use it, or to use all of it. Music in the world survives handily without any help from analysis.

  Abstract: Subjectivity is a ″vanishing subject,″ writes Amélie Oksenberg Rorty in this book′s opening chapter. As she traces the history of some of the philosophical insights that have shaped current understandings of subjectivity and the subject, Rorty finds not a progression but various contested movements and fragmentary meanings. Self-awareness has a different philosophical trajectory than individuated perception does; scholars have emphasized a diachronically unified persona and, at times, posed it against a synchronically unified persona; the meanings of emotions, the body, social interactions, and suffering as subjectivity have all been areas of contestation. For example, according to Rorty, ″Where Aristotle finds<br>

  Book Title: Carnal Thoughts-Embodiment and Moving Image Culture<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Sobchack Vivian<br>
  Abstract: In these innovative essays, Vivian Sobchack considers the key role our bodies play in making sense of today's image-saturated culture. Emphasizing our corporeal rather than our intellectual engagements with film and other media,
      Carnal Thoughtsshows how our experience always emerges through our senses and how our bodies are not just visible objects but also sense-making, visual subjects. Sobchack draws on both phenomenological philosophy and a broad range of popular sources to explore bodily experience in contemporary, moving-image culture. She examines how, through the conflation of cinema and surgery, we've all "had our eyes done"; why we are "moved" by the movies; and the different ways in which we inhabit photographic, cinematic, and electronic space.Carnal Thoughtsprovides a lively and engaging challenge to the mind/body split by demonstrating that the process of "making sense" requires an irreducible collaboration between our thoughts and our senses.<br>

                  Physicsreanimates an ancient (and very recent) question: How are body and place related? A first answer, given by Aristotle himself, posits a rigid material body in place by virtue of its sheer contiguity with the inner surface of what immediately surrounds it—a strictly physical intimacy that works by close containment. This containment acts in effect to cap and control the vagrant and violent movements of elemental qualities and powers as depicted in Plato’sTimaeus,a cosmogonic tale in which the tumult ofchōragives way to the order of determinatetopoi.Whether this<br>

Philosophers have attempted to redeem evil by elaborate analyses designed to show that evil is somehow necessary, and theologians have produced a body of work on the “problem of evil.” Women have until recently been relatively silent on evil, in part because they have been silent on most matters, but largely because they have themselves been closely identified with evil in the traditional view.

  Abstract: Neglected by secular scholars because of its religious content, reshaped by people of faith because its protagonists are morally offensive, and avoided by individuals committed to nonviolence because of its brutality, the book of Judges deserves to be taken more seriously. No other book in the Hebrew Bible mirrors the entire span of Israel’s history as authentically as Judges. The main body of the book is a collection of premonarchic tales celebrating heroic champions, who competed for power in turbulent times. The book’s sixth-century version reflects the tension between the priestly Deuteronomic reformers and the Deuteronomistic defenders of royal power.¹<br>

  Book Title: Ostension-Word Learning and the Embodied Mind<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Engelland Chad<br>
  Abstract: Ostension is bodily movement that manifests our engagement with things, whether we wish it to or not. Gestures, glances, facial expressions: all betray our interest in something. Ostension enables our first word learning, providing infants with a prelinguistic way to grasp the meaning of words. Ostension is philosophically puzzling; it cuts across domains seemingly unbridgeable -- public--private, inner--outer, mind--body. In this book, Chad Engelland offers a philosophical investigation of ostension and its role in word learning by infants. Engelland discusses ostension (distinguishing it from ostensive definition) in contemporary philosophy, examining accounts by Quine, Davidson, and Gadamer, and he explores relevant empirical findings in psychology, evolutionary anthropology, and neuroscience. He offers original studies of four representative historical thinkers whose work enriches the understanding of ostension: Wittgenstein, Merleau-Ponty, Augustine, and Aristotle. And, building on these philosophical and empirical foundations, Engelland offers a meticulous analysis of the philosophical issues raised by ostension. He examines the phenomenological problem of whether embodied intentions are manifest or inferred; the problem of what concept of mind allows ostensive cues to be intersubjectively available; the epistemological problem of how ostensive cues, notoriously ambiguous, can be correctly understood; and the metaphysical problem of the ultimate status of the key terms in his argument: animate movement, language, and mind. Finally, he argues for the centrality of manifestation in philosophy. Taking ostension seriously, he proposes, has far-reaching implications for thinking about language and the practice of philosophy.<br>

  Book Title: Passage to the Center-Imagination and the Sacred in the Poetry of Seamus Heaney<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Tobin Daniel<br>
  Abstract: Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney, author of nine collections of poetry and three volumes of influential essays, is regarded by many as the greatest Irish poet since Yeats.
      Passage to the Centeris the most comprehensive critical treatment to date on Heaney's poetry and the first to study Heaney's body of work up toSeeing ThingsandThe Spirit Level. It is also the first to examine the poems from the perspective of religion, one of Heaney's guiding preoccupations. According to Tobin, the growth of Heaney's poetry may be charted through the recurrent figure of "the center," a key image in the relationship that evolved over time between the poet and his inherited place, an evolution that involved the continual re-evaluation and re-vision of imaginative boundaries. In a way that previous studies have not, Tobin's work examines Heaney's poetry in the context of modernist and postmodernist concerns about the desacralizing of civilization and provides a challenging engagement with the work of a living master.<br>

  Book Title: God--The World's Future-Systematic Theology for a New Era<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Peters Ted<br>
  Abstract: God—The World’s Future has been a proven and comprehensive textbook in systematic theology for over twenty years. Explicitly crafted to address our postmodern context, Peters explains the whole body of Christian historical doctrine from within a “proleptic” framework, “whereby the gospel is understood as announcing the pre-actualization of the future consummation of all things in Jesus Christ.” Peters skillfully deploys this concept not only to organize the various theological areas or loci but also to rethink doctrines in light of key postmodern challenges from ecumenism, critical historical thinking, contemporary science, and gender and sexuality issues. The Third Edition is thoroughly revised with updated chapters, additional chapters, updated annotations and bibliographies, and further elaborations in light of recent developments in method and theological reflection. This classic text opens up systematic theology in new dimensions, retrieving traditional categories and topics for a new generation of students and learners to give a fresh reading of Christian theology and articulation of the liberating message of the gospel of God’s grace for the future of the world.<br>

  Author(s) O’Donohue John<br>
  Abstract: Jean-Luc Marion’s body of work has already secured his place among the top rank of twentieth-century philosophers; it seems inconceivable that his reputation will not grow even further in the twenty-first century and beyond. Though equally renowned for his scholarly work on early modern philosophy and on Husserl and Heidegger, Marion is perhaps best known for his renewal of phenomenology, for his remarkable, ongoing inquiry into the question of God, and for work bridging all of these areas. The oeuvre resulting from this fertile constellation places Marion’s writings at the center of the “theological turn” in recent French phenomenology; as<br>

  Abstract: If anyone has suffered from typecasting, it is the cinematic nun. Enveloped in a religious veil and habit that show her only in part and are barriers to imagining her as a whole person, she has been vulnerable to stereotypes that complete the visual process of fragmenting her on-screen.¹ Whether these stereotypes trivialize, sentimentalize, or sanctify her, represent her seriously or sensationally, the result is the same.² She has seldom been seen as a totality of mind-body-heart-spirit, rarely been the subject of comprehensive inter-disciplinary analysis, and never been the subject of full-length study.

Irigaray goes on to warn that “a religion centered on speech, without the insistence on breathing and the silence that makes it possible, risks supporting a non-respect for life” (51).

  Abstract: Change in science involves a change in the way we understand materiality and the world around us. Since we ourselves are material as well as mind, what we

  Book Title: Language, Eros, Being: Kabbalistic Hermeneutics and Poetic Imagination-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): WOLFSON ELLIOT R.<br>
  Abstract: This long-awaited, magisterial study-an unparalleled blend of philosophy, poetry, and philology-draws on theories of sexuality, phenomenology, comparative religion, philological writings on Kabbalah, Russian formalism, Wittgenstein, Rosenzweig, William Blake, and the very physics of the time-space continuum to establish what will surely be a highwater mark in work on Kabbalah. Not only a study of texts, Language, Eros, Being is perhaps the fullest confrontation of the body in Jewish studies, if not in religious studies as a whole.Elliot R. Wolfson explores the complex gender symbolism that permeates Kabbalistic literature. Focusing on the nexus of asceticism and eroticism, he seeks to define the role of symbolic and poetically charged language in the erotically configured visionary imagination of the medieval Kabbalists. He demonstrates that the traditional Kabbalistic view of gender was a monolithic and androcentric one, in which the feminine was conceived as being derived from the masculine. He does not shrink from the negative implications of this doctrine, but seeks to make an honest acknowledgment of it as the first step toward the redemption of an ancient wisdom.Comparisons with other mystical traditions-including those in Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam-are a remarkable feature throughout the book. They will make it important well beyond Jewish studies, indeed, a must for historians of comparative religion, in particular of comparative mysticism.Praise for Elliot R. Wolfson:Through a Speculum That Shines is an important and provocative contribution to the study of Jewish mysticism by one of the major scholars now working in this field.-Speculum<br>

  Abstract: At first glance, it might appear that the title of this chapter brings together two mutually exclusive themes. Asceticism, conventionally understood, implies rigorous discipline of body and mind, the adoption of an austere lifestyle, which can lead to the abrogation of desire, expressed as denial and mortification. Eroticism, by contrast, entails the sense of ecstatic rapture that ensues from inspirited indulgence in bodily matters and the full embrace of the sensual. In the case of both, there is a confluence of life and death, albeit from opposite ends of the spectrum: Asceticism promotes the negation of life in the simulation<br>

  Book Title: Crossover Queries: Dwelling with Negatives, Embodying Philosophy's Others-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): WYSCHOGROD EDITH<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the risks, ambiguities, and unstable conceptual worlds of contemporary thought, Crossover Queries brings together the wide-ranging writings, across twenty years, of one of our most important philosophers.Ranging from twentieth-century European philosophy-the thought of Heidegger, Foucault, Derrida, Levinas, Janicaud, and others-to novels and artworks, music and dance, from traditional Jewish thought to Jain andBuddhist metaphysics, Wyschogrod's work opens radically new vistas while remaining mindful that the philosopher stands within and is responsible to a philosophical legacy conditioned by the negative.Rather than point to a Hegelian dialectic of overcoming negation or to a postmetaphysical exhaustion, Wyschogrod treats negative moments as opening novel spaces for thought. She probes both the desire for God and an ethics grounded in the interests of the other person, seeing these as moments both of crossing over and of negation. Alert to the catastrophes that have marked our times, she exposes the underlying logical structures of nihilatory forces that have been exerted to exterminate whole peoples. Analyzing the negationsof biological research and cultural images of mechanized and robotic bodies, she shows how they contest the body as lived in ordinary experience.Crossover Queries brings together important essays on a remarkable range of topics by one of our most insightful cultural critics. Commenting on philosophical and theological issues that have shaped the recent past as well as scientific and technological questions that will preoccupy us in the near future, Wyschogrod consistently alerts us to the urgency of problems whose importance few recognize. To avoid the challenge these essays pose is to avoid responsibility for a future that appears to be increasingly fragile.-Mark C. Taylor, Columbia University<br>

The yearning for soul has become far more complex in postmodernity, in that “soul” has been rendered moot in modernity’s various accounts of mind-body dualism. In its Cartesian version, mind as the ground of certainty came to occupy the void left by the evacuation of soul. With the demise of the modern subject, famously described as<br>

  Abstract: Bodies have always been the subjects of representation, sometimes written about in texts but more often carved in stone or painted on walls.

As postmodern theories constantly remind us, the order of the body is also the political, social, economic, religious, and sexual order of a society.

  Book Title: Sounding/Silence: Martin Heidegger at the Limits of Poetics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SMITH DAVID NOWELL<br>
  Abstract: Sounding/Silence charts Heidegger's deep engagement with poetry, situating it within the internal dynamics of his thought and within the domains of poetics and literary criticism. Heidegger viewed poetics and literary criticism with notorious disdain: he claimed that his Erlauterungen ("soundings") of Holderlin's poetry were not "contributions to aesthetics and literary history" but rather stemmed "from a necessity for thought." And yet, the questions he poses--the value of significance of prosody and trope, the concept of "poetic language", the relation between language and body, the "truth" of poetry--reach to the very heart of poetics as a discipline, and indeed situate Heidegger within a wider history of thinking on poetry and poetics. opening up points of contact between Heidegger's discussions of poetry and technical and critical analyses of these poems, Nowell Smith addresses a lacuna within Heidegger scholarship and sets off from Heidegger's thought to sketch a philosophical "poetics of limit".<br>

But a “field” suggests a body of knowledge that is at once diverse yet coherent: Diverse, in that there are multiple perspectives and applications; coherent, in that there are recognizable characteristics that make environmental hermeneutics identifiable as a particular way of engaging environmental philosophy. Hermeneutics itself is widely recognized and understood to have multiple applications across a wide variety of disciplines and themes. Indeed, “environmental hermeneutics” might be simply defined<br>

  Book Title: Divine Enticement: Theological Seductions-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): MACKENDRICK KARMEN<br>
  Abstract: Theology usually appears to us to be dogmatic, judgmental, condescending, maybe therapeutic, or perhaps downright fantastical-but seldom enticing. Divine Enticement takes as its starting point that the meanings of theological concepts are not so much logical, truth-valued propositions-affirmative or negative-as they are provocations and evocations. Thus it argues for the seductiveness of both theology and its subject-for, in fact, infinite seduction and enticement as the very sense of theological query. The divine name is one by which we are drawn toward the limits of thought, language, and flesh. The use of language in such conceptualization calls more than it designates. This is not a flaw or a result of vagueness or imprecision in theological language but rather marks the correspondence of such language to its subject: that which, outside of or at the limit of our thought, draws us as an enticement to desire, not least to intellectual desire. Central to the text is the strange semiotics of divine naming, as a call on that for which there cannot be a standard referent. The entanglement of sign and body, not least in interpretations of the Christian incarnation, both grounds and complicates the theological abstractions. A number of traditional notions in Christian theology are reconceived here as enticements, modes of drawing the desires of both body and mind: faith as "thinking with assent"; sacraments as "visible words" read in community; ethics as responsiveness to beauty; prayer as the language of address; scripture as the story of meaning-making. All of these culminate in a sense of a call to and from the purely possible, the open space into which we can be enticed, within which we can be divinely enticing.<br>

  Book Title: Cathedrals of Bone: The Role of the Body in Contemporary Catholic Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Waldmeir John C.<br>
  Abstract: The metaphor of the Church as a bodyhas shaped Catholic thinking since the Second Vatican Council. Its influence on theological inquiries into Catholic nature and practice is well-known; less obvious is the way it has shaped a generation of Catholic imaginative writers. Cathedrals of Bone is the first full-length study of a cohort of Catholic authors whose art takes seriously the themes of the Council: from novelists such as Mary Gordon, Ron Hansen, Louise Erdrich, and J. F. Powers, to poets such as Annie Dillard, Mary Karr, Lucia Perillo, and Anne Carson, to the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright John Patrick Shanley. Motivated by the inspirational yet thoroughly incarnational rhetoric of Vatican II, each of these writers encourages readers to think about the human body as a site-perhaps the most important site-of interaction between God and human beings. Although they represent the body in different ways, these late-twentieth-century Catholic artists share a sense of its inherent value. Moreover, they use ideas and terminology from the rich tradition of Catholic sacramentality, especially as it was articulated in the documents of Vatican II, to describe that value. In this way they challenge the Church to take its own tradition seriously and to reconsider its relationship to a relatively recent apologetics that has emphasized a narrow view of human reason and a rigid sense of orthodoxy.<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenologies of the Stranger: Between Hostility and Hospitality-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: What is strange? Or better, who is strange? When do we encounter the strange? We encounter strangers when we are not at home: when we are in a foreign land or a foreign part of our own land. From Freud to Lacan to Kristeva to Heidegger, the feeling of strangeness-das Unheimlichkeit-has marked our encounter with the other, even the other within our self. Most philosophical attempts to understand the role of the Stranger, human or transcendent, have been limited to standard epistemological problems of other minds, metaphysical substances, body/soul dualism and related issues of consciousness and cognition. This volume endeavors to take the question of hosting the stranger to the deeper level of embodied imagination and the senses (in the Greek sense of aisthesis). This volume plays host to a number of encounters with the strange. It asks such questions as: How does the embodied imagination relate to the Stranger in terms of hospitality or hostility (given the common root of hostis as both host and enemy)? How do we distinguish between projections of fear or fascination, leading to either violence or welcome? How do humans sensethe dimension of the strange and alien in different religions, arts, and cultures? How do the five physical senses relate to the spiritual senses, especially the famous sixthsense, as portals to an encounter with the Other? Is there a carnal perception of alterity, which would operate at an affective, prereflective, preconscious level? What exactly do embodied imaginariesof hospitality and hostility entail, and how do they operate in language, psychology, and social interrelations (including racism, xenophobia, and scapegoating)? And what, finally, are the topical implications of these questions for an ethics and practice of tolerance and peace?<br>

  Book Title: The Tears of Sovereignty: Perspectives of Power in Renaissance Drama-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): LORENZ PHILIP<br>
  Abstract: A comparative study of the representation of sovereignty in paradigmatic plays of early modernity, The Tears of Sovereignty argues that the great playwrights of the period--William Shakespeare, Lope de Vega, and Calderon de la Barca--reconstitute the metaphors through which contemporary theorists continue to conceive the problems of sovereignty. The book focuses in particular on the ways the logics of these metaphors inform sovereignty's conceptualization as a "body of power." Each chapter is organized around a key tropological operation performed on that "body," from the analogical relations invoked in Richard II, through the metaphorical transfers staged in Measure for Measure to the autoimmune resistances they produce in Lope's Fuenteovejuna, and, finally, the allegorical returns of Calderon's Life is a Dream and Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale. The "tears" of sovereignty are the exegetical tropes produced and performed on the English stages and Spanish corrales of the seventeenth century through which we continue to view sovereignty today.<br>

  Abstract: The representational shift, into the allegorical figures of the cipher and the image (
                  cifras y estampas) staged inLife Is a Dream, appears to provide us with one form of an ending. By the time we arrive at Calderón’s dream play, the effects of sovereignty’s rupture from the King’s body, staged in Shakespeare’sRichard II, could be said to be complete. Sovereignty, inLife Is a Dream, no longer speaks through—at least the human—body at all. Nor does it even seem to require the law, or that the bodies subject to its force signify its presence, as in<br>

  Abstract: In Shakespeare’s
                  Venus and Adonis, the switch from Venus as manhandler to Venus as the pathetic—some would say tragic—mourner over the body of dead Adonis has always been problematical. Although passion and grief are twinned conditions of want(ing), the shift in this poem from an aggressive, comic mode to a helpless, pathetic one proves larger than life and challenges credible mimesis and, otherwise put, human credibility. Or perhaps I should say balanced human credibility, since Venus’ behavior makes sense as an obsessive fixation transferred from hunger to loss. Yes, Venus is a goddess and a figure of myth<br>

  Book Title: Edgar Allen Poe: A Phenomenological View-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): HALLIBURTON DAVID<br>
  Abstract: The book begins with a methodological chapter that sets out the assumptions and procedures of the approach. This is followed by analyses of Poe's major works, exploring such special problems as Poe's treatment of the material world, including technology; the interrelation of body and consciousness; poetic voice; attitudes toward women; and the will to affirmation, plenitude, and unity. The center of interest is neither Poe's biography nor environment but always the meaning of Poe's words. Because these works are shaped by a single imagination and because they are experienced in time, as a process, each work has its own "way of going." The aim of the interpretation is to find this way and go along with it; to live each work dynamically, as it "happens," while tracing its interaction with other works.<br>

  Book Title: The Roots Of Thinking-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sheets-Johnstone Maxine<br>
  Abstract: "A significant contribution to the study of early humans, this book is a philosophical anthropology.... it makes genuinely novel, and highly persuasive, claims within the field itself." --David Depew In this ground-breaking interdisciplinary study about conceptual origins, Maxine Sheets-Johnstone shows that there is an indissoluble bond between hominid thinking and hominid evolution, a bond cemented by the living body. Her thesis is concretely illustrated in eight paleoanthropological case studies ranging from tool-using/tool-making to counting, sexuality, representation, language, death, and cave art. In each case, evidence is brought forward that shows how thinking is modeled on the body-specifically, how concepts are generated by animate form and the tactile-kinesthetic experience. Later chapters critically examine key theoretical and methodological issues posed by the thesis, Sheets-Johnstone demonstrates in detail how and why a corporeal turn in philosophy and the human sciences can yield insights no less extraordinary than those produced by the linguistic turn. In confronting the currently popular doctrine of cultural relativism and the classic Western metaphysical dualism of mind and body, she shows how pan-cultural invariants of human bodily life have been discounted and how the body itself has not been given its due. By a precise exposition of how a full-scale hermeneutics and a genetic phenomenology may be carried out with respect to conceptual origins, she shows how methodological issues are successfully resolved. "Ranging across the humanities and sciences, this thoroughly original book challenges both traditional metaphysics and contemporary cultural relativism. In their place, it persuasively develops a phenomenonological, tactile-kinesthetic account of the origins of thinking. This philosophical anthropology could not be more timely. It replaces the 'linguistic turn' with a promising new 'corporeal turn.'" --John J. Stuhr, University of Oregon "This w~<br>

The justification rests ultimately on the body. If present-day humans can approximate to the point of view of their hominid ancestors, then explicit corporeal grounds exist for affirming that approximation. Tactile–kinesthetic invariants obviously provide the strongest and most direct way of demonstrating those grounds.

  Abstract: Harnessing the energy of provocative theories generated by recent understandings of the human body, the natural world, and the material world, Material Feminisms presents an entirely new way for feminists to conceive of the question of materiality. In lively and timely essays, an international group of feminist thinkers challenges the assumptions and norms that have previously defined studies about the body. These wide-ranging essays grapple with topics such as the material reality of race, the significance of sexual difference, the impact of disability experience, and the complex interaction between nature and culture in traumatic events such as Hurricane Katrina. By insisting on the importance of materiality, this volume breaks new ground in philosophy, feminist theory, cultural studies, science studies, and other fields where the body and nature collide.<br>

  Book Title: The Renaissance of emotion-Understanding affect in Shakespeare and his contemporaries<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sullivan Erin<br>
  Abstract: This collection of essays offers a major reassessment of the meaning and significance of emotional experience in the work of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. Recent scholarship on early modern emotion has relied on a medical-historical approach, resulting in a picture of emotional experience that stresses the dominance of the material, humoral body. The Renaissance of emotion seeks to redress this balance by examining the ways in which early modern texts explore emotional experience from perspectives other than humoral medicine. The chapters in the book seek to demonstrate how open, creative and agency-ridden the experience and interpretation of emotion could be. Taken individually, the chapters offer much-needed investigations into previously overlooked areas of emotional experience and signification; taken together, they offer a thorough re-evaluation of the cultural priorities and phenomenological principles that shaped the understanding of the emotive self in the early modern period. The Renaissance of emotion will be of particular interest to students and scholars of Shakespeare and Renaissance literature, the history of emotion, theatre and cultural history, and the history of ideas.<br>

  Abstract: Emotions-based commentary on early modern literature, and Shakespeare in particular, may suffer from a reductiveness due to reluctance to reflect multiple emotional states present simultaneously, either within an individual as ‘mixed emotions’, or between different characters often listening ‘at cross purposes’, or between characters and the audience (‘dramatic irony’). This perceived deficiency arguably stems from three basic assumptions that can be challenged. First, there has been recently an emphasis on the physiological approach to emotions, which suggests that early modern theory analysed feelings as primarily stemming from the body.¹ In general terms this approach is clearly justifiable in the light<br>

  Author(s): Pallasmaa Juhani<br>
  Abstract: Although we spend more than ninety percent of our lives inside buildings, we understand very little about how the built environment affects our behavior, thoughts, emotions, and well-being. We are biological beings whose senses and neural systems have developed over millions of years; it stands to reason that research in the life sciences, particularly neuroscience, can offer compelling insights into the ways our buildings shape our interactions with the world. This expanded understanding can help architects design buildings that support both mind and body. In
      Mind in Architecture, leading thinkers from architecture and other disciplines, including neuroscience, cognitive science, psychiatry, and philosophy, explore what architecture and neuroscience can learn from each other. They offer historical context, examine the implications for current architectural practice and education, and imagine a neuroscientifically informed architecture of the future. Architecture is late in discovering the richness of neuroscientific research. As scientists were finding evidence for the bodily basis of mind and meaning, architecture was caught up in convoluted cerebral games that denied emotional and bodily reality altogether.

  Author(s) Pérez-Gómez Alberto<br>
  Abstract: We are bodies who start inside other bodies. Most of us think we know what our body is: it is the fleshy whole we inhabit; but the dictionary defines the word “body” much more broadly. A body is the entire material or physical structure of an individual organism; it is also an entity composed of numerous members—of people, things, concepts, or processes—a student body, a body of work, a body of evidence, the body politic. Body is used to describe the main or central part of something—the body of a temple, for instance. It can also describe<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I address a controversial topic in contemporary biopolitics/necropolitics (Mbembe 2003): the biomedical abuse and plunder of dead bodies, among these, the bodies of enemies, with the complicity and collaboration of militarized states. Although biopiracy of human biomaterials is not new, the technological capacity to harvest and to distribute these anonymously worldwide through “cannibal markets” in blood, skin, bones, organs, bodies and body parts, dna, and reproductive material to feed the desires of these new commodities for transplant medicine, for science and research, for commercial pharmacology, and for recreation and display is a late-twentieth-century innovation.<br>

But his brain lives still, patched into a computer system with a vital purpose: time travel. Sent into the past for information about a terrorist attack, Stevens ultimately saves Chicago from a massive dirty bomb. That such a radically disabled body could have such ability—to travel in time, to save a city—is the central premise of Duncan Jones’s 2011 film

  Abstract: What can live performance become when reinscribed for the page? How does a writing voice (without breath) generate the embodied animations, and invite the intimate architextures, of the timespace of performance? Torn from the “real time” of its never fully real staging, performance struggles to reenact on the page its peculiar obsession: to inhabit the magical, archaic economies of possession and dispossession. Hands empty. Hands full. Empty. Repeat. If trauma often vibrates at the collective edge of live performance, then where does trauma dwell when the performative text is held in your hands, alone?

  Book Title: Music, Analysis, Experience-New Perspectives in Musical Semiotics<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Reybrouck Mark<br>
  Abstract: Transdisciplinary and intermedial analysis of the experience of music Nowadays musical semiotics no longer ignores the fundamental challenges raised by cognitive sciences, ethology, or linguistics. Creation, action and experience play an increasing role in how we understand music, a sounding structure impinging upon our body, our mind, and the world we live in. Not discarding music as a closed system, an integral experience of music demands a transdisciplinary dialogue with other domains as well. Music, Analysis, Experience brings together contributions by semioticians, performers, and scholars from cognitive sciences, philosophy, and cultural studies, and deals with these fundamental questionings. Transdisciplinary and intermedial approaches to music meet musicologically oriented contributions to classical music, pop music, South American song, opera, narratology, and philosophy.<br>

Until, or unless, he or she “writes up,” the field worker is not really an ethnographer, only someone indulging in a kind of deep tourism.

The particular kind of body humans have helps produce ways of thinking about the world that are specific to the human species.

  Book Title: A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VENEMA HENRY ISAAC<br>
  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's entire philosophical project narrates a passion for the possibleexpressed in the hope that in spite of death, closure, and sedimentation, life is opened by superabundance, by how the world gives us much more than is possible. Ricoeur's philosophical anthropology is a phenomenology of human capacity, which gives onto the groundless ground of human being, namely, God. Thus the story of the capable man, beginning with original goodness held captive by a servile will and ending with the possibility of liberation and regeneration of the heart, underpins his passion for the more than possible. The essays in this volume trace the fluid movement between phenomenological and religious descriptions of the capable self that emerges across Ricoeur's oeuvre and establish points of connection for future developments that might draw inspiration from this body of thought.<br>

  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Building on a hermeneutic tradition in which accounts of carnal embodiment are overlooked, misunderstood, or underdeveloped, this work initiates a new field of study and concern. Carnal Hermeneutics provides a philosophical approach to the body as interpretation. Transcending the traditional dualism of rational understanding and embodied sensibility, the volume argues that our most carnal sensations are already interpretations. Because interpretation truly goes "all the way down," carnal hermeneutics rejects the opposition of language to sensibility, word to flesh, text to body. In this volume, an impressive array of today's preeminent philosophers seek to interpret the surplus of meaning that arises from our carnal embodiment, its role in our experience and understanding, and its engagement with the wider world.<br>

How might carnal hermeneutics, as it draws on multiple senses, participate in the work of refiguring traumatic wounds?

  Book Title: The Heart Has Its Reasons-Towards a Theological Anthropology of the Heart<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Tóth Beáta<br>
  Abstract: This book explores a hitherto neglected area of theological anthropology: the unity of human emotionality and rationality embodied in the biblical concept of the heart. While the theological contours of human reason have for long been clearly drawn and presented as the exclusive seat of the image of God, affectivity has been relegated to a secondary position. With the reintegration of the body into recent philosophical and theological discourses, a number of questions have arisen: if the image (also) resides in the body, how does this change one’s view of the theological significance of human affectivity? In what way is our likeness to God realized in the whole of what we are? Can one overcome the traditional dissociation between intellect and affectivity by a renewed theory of love? In conversation with patristic and medieval authors (e.g., Irenaeus, Tertullian, Gregory of Nyssa, Maximus, Aquinas) and in dialogue with more recent interlocutors (Pascal, Ricoeur, Marion, Milbank, John Paul II), this work pursues a novel theological vision of the essential unity of our humanity.<br>

However, when this iterability fails, both materially and discursively then there is a crisis of being.<br>

  Abstract: If asked to name the two favourite saints of Catholic Italy, one’s first candidate would be predictable enough. It is Giovanni Francesco di Bernardone (c. 1181-1226), otherwise known as St Francis of Assisi, founder of the Franciscan order and one of the most venerated of all religious figures, probably second only to Jesus himself within the Christian tradition. The double-tiered Basilica of Assisi, built over the crypt housing the saint’s body, was completed just twenty-seven years after St Francis’ death. Designed by one of his disciples, Brother Elia Bombardone, it is one of the great buildings of the world, and<br>

  Abstract: Alongside his christocentric pacifism, Yoder is perhaps best known for posing the church as an alternative political body to the nation state. In imitation of the politics of Jesus, Christian communities are to share goods, welcome the excluded, and practice reconciliation, servant leadership, and the priesthood of believers.¹ When it does these things, the church becomes “a proclamation of the lordship of Christ to the powers from whose dominion the church has begun to be liberated.”² Through faithfulness to its master, not compromise, the church fulfills its call “to contribute to the creation of structures more worthy of human society.”³<br>

  Book Title: Radical Embodiment-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Nikkel David H.<br>
  Abstract: "Radical embodiment" refers to an anthropology and an epistemology fundamentally rooted in our bodies as always in correlation with our natural and social worlds. All human rationality, meaning, and value arise not only instrumentally but also substantively from this embodiment in the world. Radical embodiment reacts against Enlightenment mind-body dualism, as well as its monistic offshoots, including the physicalism that reduces everything to component matter-energy at the expense of subjectivity and meaning. It also rejects certain forms of postmodernism that reinscribe modern dualisms. David H. Nikkel develops the perspective of "radical embodiment" by examining varieties of modern and postmodern theology, and the nature and role of tradition-in terms of linguistic and non-linguistic experience, the religion and science dialogue on the nature of consciousness, and the immanent and transcendent aspects of God.<br>

  Abstract: In creating humankind God sculpted “the earth being,” according to the etymology of “Adam,” the Hebrew word for “humanity” used in Genesis 2. The portrait of humankind painted by the scriptures of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam regards the human person as a psycho-somatic unity. Scientific evidence increasingly points to the truth that human beings are fundamentally embodied in nature, contrary to the Greek-influenced mind-body dualism that has reigned for most of Western theological and philosophical history.

  Book Title: Life in the Spirit-A Post-Constantinian and Trinitarian Account of the Christian Life<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): snavely Andréa D.<br>
  Abstract: Christians are united in saying that the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. But the unity breaks down when explaining how the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. Life in the Spirit is the first book to engage the post-Constantinian critique of the church with the field of Spirit Christology. Building upon the work of post-Constantinians John Howard Yoder and Stanley Hauerwas and upon the Trinitarian Spirit-Christology of Leopoldo Sánchez, this account provides a framework for seeing one’s Christian life as one transformed by the Spirit. Snavely rejects the characterisation of life in the Spirit as bringing sinners to faith, and instead proposes that as Jesus lived as the Son of the Father in the Spirit, the Spirit also makes other sons of the father in the image of Jesus. This Trinitarian interpretation shows the Christian life as being one of total trust in God with one’s own life, and after death living in Jesus’ resurrected life in the Spirit. Snavely’s account calls for a reimagining of the church and the Christian life in terms of ecclesial structure, Christian discipleship and the Christian view of marriage. Life in the Spirit will not only help Christians to have a better understanding of the place of vocation in the world as witnesses to the lordship of Jesus Christ, but it will also promote unity in the body of Christ based on the actual unity that all his adopted sons and daughters already have by belonging to Jesus Christ’s life in the Spirit.<br>

In this sense, the Eucharist is not “rooted” in its history, but rather

  Book Title: Translating the English Bible-From Relevance to Deconstruction<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Goodwin Philip W.<br>
  Abstract: In his detailed and thought-provoking work, Philip Goodwin conducts a thorough analysis of the challenges facing the Biblical translator, with particular focus on the problematic dominance of the King James Version of the Bible in our imaginations – a dominance which has had a deleterious effect upon the accuracy and originality of the translator's work. Goodwin considers the first two chapters of the Lukan narratives in depth, comparing and contrasting a breadth of widely disparate translations and drawing on a rich body of Biblical scholarship to support his thesis. A wide-ranging discussion of other linguistic issues is also conducted, touching on such vital matters as incorporating the contextual implications of the original text, and the attempt to challenge the reader's pre-existing encyclopaedic knowledge. Goodwin evolves a fresh and comprehensive answer to the difficulties of the translator's task, and concludes by providing his own original and charming translation of the first two chapters of Luke's Gospel. 'Translating the English Bible' provides a fascinating insight into the processes of translation and will interest anyone seeking accuracy and fidelity to the Scriptural message. It will also enlighten readers seeking a challenging translation of Luke that casts off the shackles of the 'Holy Marriage' tradition of Biblical translation.<br>

  Book Title: Facing the Other-John Paul II, Levinas, and the Body<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): de Malherbe Brice<br>
  Abstract: What is the significance of the body? What might phenomenology contribute to a theological account of the body? And what is gained by prolonging the overlooked dialogue between St. John Paul II and Emmanuel Levinas? Nigel Zimmermann answers these questions through the agreements and the tensions between two of the most important thinkers of the twentieth century. John Paul II, the Polish pope, philosopher, and theologian, and Emmanuel Levinas, the French-Jewish philosopher of Lithuanian heritage, were provocative thinkers who courageously faced and challenged the assumptions of their age. Both held the human person in high regard and did their thinking with constant reference to God and to theological language. Zimmermann does not shirk from the challenges of each thinker and does not hide their differences. However, he shows how they bequeath a legacy regarding the body that we would overlook at significant ethical peril. We are called, Zimmermann argues, to face the other. In this moment God refuses a banal marginalisation and our call to responsibility for the other person is issued in their disarming vulnerability. In the body, philosophy, theology, and ethics converge to call us to glory, even in the paradox of lowly suffering.<br>

  Abstract: Since John Polidori in 1819 made a vampire the eponymous hero of his Romantic tale “The Vampyre,” vampires have never disappeared from the pages of collections of supernatural tales, penny dreadfuls, or horror novels. They soon migrated to theater stages and movie screens, and more recently from the pages of serialized novels to weekly episodes on television. As cultural icons, vampires are the subject matter of an impressive body of academic writing. In his study

  Book Title: The Wedding Feast of the Lamb-Eros, the Body, and the Eucharist<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hughes George<br>
  Abstract: Emmanuel Falque's The Wedding Feast of the Lamb represents a turning point in his thought. Here, Falque links philosophy and theology in an original fashion that allows us to see the full effect of theology's "backlash" against philosophy. By attending closely to the incarnation and the eucharist, Falque develops a new concept of the body and of love: By avoiding the common mistake of "angelism"--consciousness without body--Falque considers the depths to which our humanity reflects animality, or body without consciousness. He shows the continued relevance of the question "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" (John 6:52), especially to philosophy. We need to question the meaning of "this is my body" in "a way that responds to the needs of our time" (Vatican II). Because of the ways that "Hoc est corpus meum" has shaped our culture and our modernity, this is a problem both for religious belief and for culture.<br>

  Abstract: Thinking about perceptions of body as they are used in the Bible leads, inevitably, to reflecting on clothing and the idea of clothing. Clothing is a powerful image throughout biblical literature and in human society generally.¹ At the most obvious level, clothing covers and conceals the body, protecting it from exposure to the elements and the view of other persons. But the significance of clothing extends much further since garments not only cover and conceal, but also function to display the body in particular ways and with many meanings.

  Book Title: An Archaeology of Prehistoric Bodies and Embodied Identities in the Eastern Mediterranean-  Publisher: Oxbow Books<br>
  Author(s): PAPADATOS YIANNIS<br>
  Abstract: In the long tradition of the archaeology of the eastern Mediterranean bodies have held a prominent role in the form of figurines, frescos, or skeletal remains, and have even been responsible for sparking captivating portrayals of the Mother-Goddess cult, the elegant women of Minoan Crete or the deeds of heroic men. Growing literature on the archaeology and anthropology of the body has raised awareness about the dynamic and multifaceted role of the body in experiencing the world and in the construction, performance and negotiation of social identity. In these 28 thematically arranged papers, specialists in the archaeology of the eastern Mediterranean confront the perceived invisibility of past bodies and ask new research questions. Contributors discuss new and old evidence; they examine how bodies intersect with the material world, and explore the role of body-situated experiences in creating distinct social and other identities. Papers range chronologically from the Palaeolithic to the Early Iron Age and cover the geographical regions of the Aegean, Cyprus and the Near East. They highlight the new possibilities that emerge for the interpretation of the prehistoric eastern Mediterranean through a combined use of body-focused methodological and theoretical perspectives that are nevertheless grounded in the archaeological record.<br>

  Book Title: At the Limits of Memory-Legacies of Slavery in the Francophone World<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hodgson Kate<br>
  Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing body of literature dedicated to memories of slavery in the Anglophone world, yet little has been done to approach this subject from Francophone perspectives. This collection responds to the urgent need to contribute to current research on slavery and memory studies by focusing specifically on the Francophone world. Featuring the scholarship of leading academics in France, Britain, the United States and Canada, the collection reflects upon contemporary commemorative practices that relate to the history of slavery and the slave trade, and questions how they function in relationship to other, less memorialized histories of exploitation, such as indentured and forced labour. The volume is set against the context of France’s growing body of memory legislation, as well as its close cultural and political connections to its former empire, all of which make it an influential player in how slavery continues to be memorialized and conceptualized in the public sphere. Contributors retrace and redraw the narrative map of slavery and its legacies in the Francophone world through a comparative understanding of how these different, but interconnected forms of labour exploitation have been remembered and/or forgotten from European, West African, Indian Ocean and Caribbean perspectives.<br>

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

  Book Title: Seamus Heaney as Aesthetic Thinker-A Study of the Prose<br>
  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): MacKillop James<br>
  Abstract: Seamus Heaney’s unexpected death in August 2013 brought to completion his body of work, and scholars are only now coming to understand the full scale and importance of this extraordinary career. The Nobel Prize–winning poet, translator, and playwright from the North of Ireland is considered the most important Irish poet after Yeats and, at the time of his death, arguably the most famous living poet. For this reason, much of the scholarship to date on Heaney has understandably focused on his poetry. O’Brien’s new work, however, focuses on Heaney’s essays, book chapters, and lectures as it seeks to understand how Heaney explored the poet’s role in the world. By examining Heaney’s prose, O’Brien teases out a clearer understanding of Heaney’s sense of the function of poetry as an act of public intellectual and ethical inquiry. In doing so, O’Brien reads Heaney as an aesthetic thinker in the European tradition, considering him alongside Heidegger, Derrida, Lacan, and Adorno. Studying Heaney within this theoretical and philosophical tradition sheds new and useful light on one of the greatest creative minds of the twentieth century.<br>

  Book Title: Disability Rhetoric-  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dolmage Jay Timothy<br>
  Abstract: Disability Rhetoric is the first book to view rhetorical theory and history through the lens of disability studies. Traditionally, the body has been seen as, at best, a rhetorical distraction; at worst, those whose bodies do not conform to a narrow range of norms are disqualified from speaking. Yet, Dolmage argues that communication has always been obsessed with the meaning of the body and that bodily difference is always highly rhetorical. Following from this rewriting of rhetorical history, he outlines the development of a new theory, affirming the ideas that all communication is embodied, that the body plays a central role in all expression, and that greater attention to a range of bodies is therefore essential to a better understanding of rhetorical histories, theories, and possibilities.<br>

  Book Title: Sodomscapes-Hospitality in the Flesh<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gallagher Lowell<br>
  Abstract: Sodomscapes presents a fresh approach to the story of Lot’s wife, as it’s been read across cultures and generations. In the process, it reinterprets foundational concepts of ethics, representation, and the body. While the sudden mutation of Lot’s wife in the flight from Sodom is often read to confirm our antiscopic bias, a rival tradition emphasizes the counterintuitive optics required to nurture sustainable habitations for life in view of its unforeseeable contingency. Whether in medieval exegesis, Russian avant-garde art, Renaissance painting, or today’s Dead Sea health care tourism industry, the repeated desire to reclaim Lot’s wife turns the cautionary emblem of the mutating woman into a figural laboratory for testing the ethical bounds of hospitality. Sodomscape—the book’s name for this gesture—revisits touchstone moments in the history of figural thinking and places them in conversation with key thinkers of hospitality. The book’s cumulative perspective identifies Lot’s wife as the resilient figure of vigilant dwelling, whose in-betweenness discloses counterintuitive ways of understanding what counts as a life amid divergent claims of being-with and being-for.<br>

One cannot understand France during the 1960s, as well as the nature of the political system against which the sixty-eighters rebelled, without examining the general’s central role. By the same token, the political closure the general had mandated engendered a trenchant body of oppositional cultural criticism that ultimately succeeded in undermining Gaullism’s credibility as a political model. As the decade evolved, pathbreaking works of fiction, film, and theory emerged, forming a cultural template through which the sixty-eighters viewed the shortcomings of postwar French society.<br>

  Book Title: Love and its Critics-From the Song of Songs to Shakespeare and Milton’s Eden<br>
  Publisher: Open Book Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Movsesian Arpi<br>
  Abstract: This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton’s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin’amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur’s phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself – in short, the very things it resists. The book engages with some of the seminal literature of the Western canon, including the Bible, the poetry of Ovid, and works by English authors such as William Shakespeare and John Donne, and with criticism that stretches from the earliest readings of the Song of Songs to contemporary academic literature. Lively and enjoyable in its style, it attempts to restore a sense of pleasure to the reading of poetry, and to puncture critical insistence that literature must be outwitted. It will be of value to professional, graduate, and advanced undergraduate scholars of literature, and to the educated general reader interested in treatments of love in poetry throughout history.<br>

  Book Title: Transmitters and Creators-Chinese Commentators and Commentaries on the Analects<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Makeham John<br>
  Abstract: The Analects (Lunyu) is one of the most influential texts in human history. As a putative record of Confucius’s (551–479 B.C.E.) teachings and a foundational text in scriptural Confucianism, this classic was instrumental in shaping intellectual traditions in China and East Asia until the early twentieth century. But no premodern reader read only the text of the Analects itself. Rather, the Analects was embedded in a web of interpretation that mediated its meaning. Modern interpreters of the Analects only rarely acknowledge this legacy of two thousand years of commentaries. How well do we understand prominent or key commentaries from this tradition? How often do we read such commentaries as we might read the text on which they comment? Many commentaries do more than simply comment on a text. Not only do they shape the reading of the text, but passages of text serve as pretexts for the commentator to develop and expound his own body of thought. This book attempts to redress our neglect of commentaries by analyzing four key works dating from the late second century to the mid-nineteenth century (a period substantially contemporaneous with the rise and decline of scriptural Confucianism): the commentaries of He Yan (ca. 190–249); Huang Kan (488–545); Zhu Xi (1130–1200); and Liu Baonan (1791–1855) and Liu Gongmian (1821–1880).<br>

  Abstract: Antropologia [Anthropology] is a gateway to the series of volumes devoted to particular disciplines of philosophy, taking into account their relationship with the Christian worldview and recognizing the need to include the philosophical and ideological diversity of contemporary culture. Antropologia covers Thomist tradition, enriching its achievements with other perspectives, especially Karol Wojtyla's personalism. Increasing influence of "third culture thinking", where the humanities are carried out in the context of the natural sciences, justifies the need to take up the difficult task of demonstrating complex problems of philosophical and natural anthropology. Anthropological considerations force us to realize the multifaceted nature of classical discussions on the nature of man, including theirs scientific and ideological facets, and to demonstrate them in a well-balanced manner. In this context, it enables readers to gain guidance in the debate on the philosophy of mind, providing ways of understanding and assessing the problem of the human soul (concerning the mind-body problem).<br>

  does popular culture mean popular language? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1vwmf2w">Imagining the popular in contemporary French culture</a><br>
  Author(s) Looseley David<br>
  Abstract: To the intrepid film critic the term ‘popular French cinema’ might suggest an awkward taxonomy; in the bars and restaurants around town it would strike many as an oxymoron. Conventionally, France (and Paris especially) is seen as a hub of art-house cinema, a treasure trove of films of aesthetic and ethical superiority and a protected, national industry that epitomises the ‘European way’. The stereotype may obscure a diverse body of film, but outside the halls of the academy such diversities are rapidly homogenised; sophisticated cinema-goers mildly contemptuous of the feral free-marketeers of the American film industry happily juxtapose Eric Röhmer<br>

  Abstract: We don’t grieve abstractly; we mourn particular losses of people, places, animals, objects, and ideas to whom and to which we are attached. These losses range from the most direct to those grasped only in the historical imagination. The death of a pet, the paving over of a favourite childhood playsite, the roadside body of the deer we just hit with our car, river gorges obliterated by dam-building projects, mountaintops removed by mining, once-familiar landscapes permanently transformed by nuclear contamination, night stars obscured by light pollution, and the absence of buffalo moving freely across the Great Plains are all grievable<br>

  Book Title: Encounter with the Plumed Serpent-Drama and Power in the Heart of Mesoamerica<br>
  Publisher: University Press of Colorado<br>
  Author(s): Jiménez Gabina Aurora Pérez<br>
  Abstract: The Mixtec, or the people of Savi ("Nation of the Rain God"), one of the major civilizations of ancient Mesoamerica, made their home in the highlands of Oaxaca, where they resisted both Aztec military expansion and the Spanish conquest. This book presents and interprets the sacred histories narrated in the Mixtec codices, the largest surviving collection of pre-Columbian manuscripts in existence. In these screenfold books, ancient painter-historians chronicled the politics of the Mixtec from approximately a.d. 900 to 1521, portraying the royal families, rituals, wars, alliances, and ideology of the times. By analyzing and cross-referencing the codices, which have been fragmented and dispersed in far-flung archives, the authors attempt to reconstruct Mixtec history. Adding useful interpretation and commentary, Jansen and Perez Jimenez synthesize the large body of surviving documents into the first unified narrative of Mixtec sacred history.<br>

  Abstract: The question of the one and the many, of unity and diversity, has been posed since the beginning of political thought in the West. The American Founders were well aware of the vexations attendant upon the creation of a new political body. They worked with, and against, a stock of metaphors that had previously served as the symbolic vehicles of political incorporation. As men of the Enlightenment, they rejected the images of the body politic that had dominated medieval and early modern political thinking.

  Abstract: Distinguished feminist philosophers consider the future of their field and chart its political and ethical course in this forward-looking volume. Engaging with themes such as the historical trajectory of feminist phenomenology, ways of perceiving and making sense of the contemporary world, and the feminist body in health and ethics, these essays affirm the base of the discipline as well as open new theoretical spaces for work that bridges bioethics, social identity, physical ability, and the very nature and boundaries of the female body. Entanglements with thinkers such as Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Beauvoir, and Arendt are evident and reveal new directions for productive philosophical work. Grounded in the richness of the feminist philosophical tradition, this work represents a significant opening to the possible futures of feminist phenomenological research.<br>

  Abstract: Reproductive and transplantation medicine, genetics and molecular biology provide the means for intervening in the body and for interchanging living tissues, organs, or other body materials between human beings. Examples include organ or stem cell transplantations, the genetic determination of embryos in reproductive genetics, or receptor-specific psychopharmaceuticals. However, biotechnological interventions not only aim at the materiality and functionality of the human body, but they also transform the familial and social relations among humans. This means that biotechnologies can be profound interventions into human experiences and lives.

  Abstract: In this chapter, I draw out the implications of Levinas’s argument that the body is ethically significant and the relationship between his understanding of the body and his emphasis on diachrony. In its very susceptibility to illness, injury, and aging, the body reveals our radical exposure to others. His refusal to consider the particularity of the body—its race or gender, for instance—as part of this ethical significance certainly limits the usefulness of his understanding of embodiment to political questions, as he employs that term. In addition, feminist philosophers have been wary of the implications of Levinas’s direct references<br>

  Abstract: The term “patristic social ethics” may convey the impression that the Church Fathers—already an immensely varied group of individuals covering at least half a millennium—shared a number of systematic views on social issues. It seems to suggest that they held a set of norms and rules, which can be reconstructed through the careful reading of their sermons, letters, and dogmatic works. On such an understanding, patristic teaching on property, poverty, or usury, takes the form of a coherent, discrete body of doctrines.

It embraces the corporeal in itself as its substance. It does not experience the multiple parts of the external body as divisions of the soul. Rather (like Aristotle’s sensus communis), it gathers them up into one experience. “[T]he ‘real’ outness of parts in the body has no truth for the sentient soul.”² The feeling soul in the body is “one simple, omnipresent unity.”³<br>

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Sanders Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: The science fiction genre maintains a remarkable hold on the imagination and enthusiasm of the filmgoing public, captivating large audiences worldwide and garnering ever-larger profits. Science fiction films entertain the possibility of time travel and extraterrestrial visitation and imaginatively transport us to worlds transformed by modern science and technology. They also provide a medium through which questions about personal identity, moral agency, artificial consciousness, and other categories of experience can be addressed. In The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film, distinguished authors explore the storylines, conflicts, and themes of fifteen science fiction film classics, from Metropolis to The Matrix. Editor Steven M. Sanders and a group of outstanding scholars in philosophy, film studies, and other fields raise science fiction film criticism to a new level by penetrating the surface of the films to expose the underlying philosophical arguments, ethical perspectives, and metaphysical views. Sanders's introduction presents an overview and evaluation of each essay and poses questions for readers to consider as they think about the films under discussion.The first section, "Enigmas of Identity and Agency," deals with the nature of humanity as it is portrayed in Blade Runner, Dark City, Frankenstein, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Total Recall. In the second section, "Extraterrestrial Visitation, Time Travel, and Artificial Intelligence," contributors discuss 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Terminator, 12 Monkeys, and The Day the Earth Stood Still and analyze the challenges of artificial intelligence, the paradoxes of time travel, and the ethics of war. The final section, "Brave Newer World: Science Fiction Futurism," looks at visions of the future in Metropolis, The Matrix, Alphaville, and screen adaptations of George Orwell's 1984.<br>

  Book Title: Troubling Natural Categories-Engaging the Medical Anthropology of Margaret Lock<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KIELMANN KARINA<br>
  Abstract: Where do our conventional understandings of health, illness, and the body stem from? What makes them authoritative? How are the boundaries set around these areas of life unsettled in the changing historical and political contexts of science, technology, and health care delivery? These questions are at the heart of Troubling Natural Categories, a collection of essays honouring the tradition of Margaret Lock, one of the preeminent medical anthropologists of our time. Throughout her career, Lock has investigated how medicine sets boundaries around what is deemed "normal" and "natural," and how, in turn, these ideas shape our technical and moral understandings of life, sickness, and death. In this book, nine established medical anthropologists - all former students of Lock - critically engage with her work, offering ethnographic and historical analyses that problematize taken-for-granted constructs in health and medicine in a range of global settings. The essays elaborate cutting-edge themes within medical anthropology, including the often disturbing, inherently political nature of biomedicine and biotechnology, the medicalization of mental health processes, and the formation of uniquely "local biologies" through the convergence of bodily experience, scientific discourse, and new technologies of care. Troubling Natural Categories not only affirms Margaret Lock's place at the forefront of scholarship but, with these essays, carves out new intellectual directions in the medical social sciences. Contributors include Sean Brotherton, Vinh-Kim Nguyen, Junko Kitanaka, Stephanie Lloyd, Dominique Behague, and Annette Leibing.<br>

  Abstract: As a member of the research group MéOS¹ – studying medications as social objects – I am interested in the question of what medications do to people.² The simplest way to discuss this is to speak of effect: medications are used to enhance, cure, pleasure, and stabilize bodies in need of change. As I will argue, however, effect is highly context-dependent and goes beyond the purely molecular level of the individual body. The relevance of this realm of beyond is the central point of this essay and is something I call embodied molecules. The idea of exploring effect more carefully was triggered<br>

  Abstract: Christian faith evokes diverse and sometimes competing images and associations. For some, it conjures up a fairly coherent, albeit complexly interrelated array of experiences, dispositions, attitudes, and beliefs. For others, faith names not so much the defining subjective features of religious consciousness as the objective content of Christian religion. Faith is thus construed as a set of doctrines, a peculiar body of teaching and instruction. In short, faith is a divine “deposit” — with the church or the Bible acting as its repository.<br>

Songhay bards study history by "eating the words of the ancestors," and sorcerers learn their art by ingesting particular substances, by testing their flesh with knives, by mastering pain and illness. In

Stoller argues that this attitude is in itself Eurocentric and is particularly inappropriate for anthropologists, who often work in societies in which the notion of text, and textual interpretation, is foreign. ThroughoutSensuous ScholarshipStoller argues for the importance of understanding the "sensuous epistemologies" of many non-Western societies so that we can better understand the societies themselves and what their epistemologies have to teach us about human experience in general.<br>

Furthermore, new images of the body were created and distributed via experimental sciences, which considered the mechanism of physical movement as stemming from circulation and energy consumption.

  Abstract: As a body, Wilson's essays develop related topics and connected themes. This collection organizes them in three coherent parts. The first examines the importance of folklore-what it is and its value in various contexts. Part two, drawing especially on the experience of Finland, considers the role of folklore in national identity, including both how it helps define and sustain identity and the less savory ways it may be used for the sake of nationalistic ideology. Part three, based in large part on Wilson's extensive work in Mormon folklore, which is the most important in that area since that of Austin and Alta Fife, looks at religious cultural expressions and outsider perceptions of them and, again, at how identity is shaped, by religious belief, experience, and participation; by the stories about them; and by the many other expressive parts of life encountered daily in a culture.<br>

Certainly Kameen is interested in the ways Coleridge can expand the field’s conceptions of rhetorical invention and the composing process, but his rearticulation of Coleridge goes beyond the revaluation of the romantic individual. If Coleridge is read as espousing a complex relationship among the world, the body, the mind, and writing, then his importance clearly goes beyond mystical genius.

  Book Title: Ciaran Carson-Space, Place, Writing<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER NEAL<br>
  Abstract: Ciaran Carson is one of the most challenging and inventive of contemporary Irish writers, exhibiting verbal brilliance, formal complexity, and intellectual daring across a remarkably varied body of work. This study considers the full range of his oeuvre, in poetry, prose, and translations, and discusses the major themes to which he returns, including: memory and history, narrative, language and translation, mapping, violence, and power. It argues that the singularity of Carson’s writing is to be found in his radical imaginative engagements with ideas of space and place. The city of Belfast, in particular, occupies a crucially important place in his texts, serving as an imaginative focal point around which his many other concerns are constellated. The city, in all its volatile mutability, is an abiding frame of reference and a reservoir of creative impetus for Carson’s imagination. Accordingly, the book adopts an interdisciplinary approach that draws upon geography, urbanism, and cultural theory as well as literary criticism. It provides both a stimulating and thorough introduction to Carson’s work, and a flexible critical framework for exploring literary representations of space.<br>

It signals a broad set of concerns—both technical and institutional—about how to maintain and augment the increasingly large body of digital information that humanists are both creating and using. It is a word with far more than a contemporary pertinence, however. It could (it should) remind us that the traditional problems of philology have scarcely changed at all, and certainly have not gone away.<br>

  Abstract: Cajal’s studies of the nervous system trace the limits of scientific realism. The workings of the cellular world obviously have global effects on the body, but the greater the detail of Cajal’s descriptions, the more difficult it becomes for him to explain human behavior in terms of cells. What is it about the branches of neurons that makes individuals think the way they do? Literary realism has similar limits. It may be obvious that environmental factors like alcoholism or poverty have dramatic effects on a person’s (and a character’s) identity, but the realist process of amassing minute observations is often<br>

  Abstract: One of the key questions debated in Aotearoa/New Zealand today is how well the Crown has met its obligations under the terms of the Treaty of Waitangi. The treaty requires the Crown to protect Māori interests, including land, natural resources, and cultural interests such as the Māori language. As a result of mounting Māori activism and protest in relation to these issues, a commission of inquiry, the Waitangi Tribunal, was established in 1975 to hear Māori claims. The tribunal, an independent body made up of judges, historians, Māori elders, and other experts, makes recommendations to the government. A separate arm<br>

  Book Title: Contesting Spirit-Nietzsche, Affirmation, Religion<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS TYLER T.<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche criticizes the ascetic hatred of the body and this-worldly life, yet engages in rigorous practices of self-denial--he sees philosophy as such a practice--and affirms the need of imposing suffering on oneself in order to enhance the spirit. He dismisses the "intoxication" of mysticism, yet links mysticism, power, and creativity, and describes his own self-transcending experiences. The tensions in his relation to religion are closely related to that between negation and affirmation in his thinking in general. In Roberts's view, Nietzsche's transfigurations of religion offer resources for a postmodern religious imagination. Though as a "master of suspicion," Nietzsche, with Freud and Marx, is an integral part of modern antireligion, he has the power to take us beyond the flat, modern distinction between the secular and the religious--a distinction that, at the end of modernity, begs to be reexamined.<br>

One cannot understand France during the 1960s, as well as the nature of the political system against which the sixty-eighters rebelled, without examining the general’s central role. By the same token, the political closure the general had mandated engendered a trenchant body of oppositional cultural criticism that ultimately succeeded in undermining Gaullism’s credibility as a political model. As the decade evolved, pathbreaking works of fiction, film, and theory emerged, forming a cultural template through which the sixty-eighters viewed the shortcomings of postwar French society.<br>

  Book Title: Russian Experimental Fiction-Resisting Ideology after Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clowes Edith W.<br>
  Abstract: In the three decades following Stalin's death, major underground Russian writers have subverted Soviet ideology by using parody to draw attention to its basis in utopian thought. Referring to utopian writing as diverse as Defoe's
         Robinson Crusoe, Dostoevsky'sNotes from Underground, and Orwell'sAnimal Farm, they have tested notions of truth, reality, and representation. They have gone beyond their precursors by experimenting with the tensions between ludic and didactic art. Edith Clowes explores these "meta-utopian" narratives, which address a wide range of attitudes toward utopia, to expose the challenge that literary play poses to dogmatism and to elucidate the sense of renewal it can bring to social imagination. Using both structural analysis and reception theory, she introduces readers outside Russia to a fascinating body of literature that includes Aleksandr Zinoviev'sThe Yawning Heights, Abram Terts'sLiubimov, Vladimir Voinovich'sMoscow 2042, and Liudmila Petrushevskaia's "The New Robinsons.".<br>

  Abstract: From the Revolutionary War to the Civil War, a familiar scene appears and reappears in American literature: a speaker stands before a crowd of men and women, attempting to mitigate their natural suspicions in order to form a body of federated wills. In this important study of the relationship of literature and politics, Mark Patterson argues that this scene restates political issues in literary terms and embodies the essential problems of American democracy facing both politicians and writers: What is autonomy? How does representation work? Where does true authority lie? Beginning with the debate over ratification of the United States Constitution, Patterson follows out the complex literary consequences of these questions.<br>

  Author(s): Tatar Maria<br>
  Abstract: In these compelling new essays, leading critics sharpen our understanding of the narrative structures that convey meaning in fiction, taking as their point of departure the narratological positions of Dorrit Cohn, Grard Genette, and Franz Stanzel. This collection demonstrates how narratology, with its attention to the modalities of presenting consciousness, offers a point of entry for scholars investigating the socio-cultural dimensions of literary representations. Drawing from a wide range of literary texts, the essays explore the borderline between fiction and history; explain how characters are constructed by both author and reader through the narration of consciousness; show how gender shapes narrative strategies ranging from the depiction of consciousness through intertextuality to the representation of the body; address issues of contingency in narrative; and present a debate on the crucial function of person in the literary text. The contributors are Stanley Corngold, Gail Finney, Kte Hamburger, Paul Michael Ltzeler, David Mickelsen, John Neubauer, Thomas Pavel, Jens Rieckmann, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, Judith Ryan, Franz Stanzel, Susan Suleiman, Maria Tatar, David Wellbery, and Larry Wolff.<br>

Through a consideration of various responses to the 1990s cholera epidemic, I illustrate how the appropriation of a biomedical perspective by coastal residents is linked to political and economic transformations in the country that have both enabled and limited the credibility of biomedicine for healing the body tropical. In making this case, I argue for the development of<br>

  Abstract: Kierkegaard says, quite simply, that the task set for every human being is to become a self. In this deceptively plain word “task”
                     (Opgave),he concentrates all the complexities of his understanding of the human self. By explicating the ramifications of this term, we will come to see how Kierkegaard understands the emergence of the self as a “third” (entity, or reality, or structure) beyond but including the polarities of body/soul, finitude/infinitude, necessity/possibility.<br>

  Author(s) Rutland Barry<br>
  Abstract: The border/play characteristic of contemporary women’s parodic re/- writing of fictional genres reveals engagement with narrative as a critical strategy designed to expose the positioning of woman as
                  silent other, on whose mutilated body narrative is constructed in dominant (patriarchal) discourse, and to posit alternate positionings for women as subjects producing themselves in/by language. What feminist theory has shown is that strategies of writing and reading are forms of cultural resistance. They work to turn dominant discourses inside out and challenge theory in its own terms, the terms of a semiotic space constructed in language. They do so by unfixing<br>

  Abstract: The demand for the creation of an assembly which would reflect the democratic aspirations of Fighting France had been growing since the early days of La France libre in London. Dedicated republicans including Henry Hauck, Pierre-Olivier Lapie and, most persistently, René Cassin, had been pressing de Gaulle to create such a body as had Félix Gouin, Blum’s emissary in London, who chaired a group of French parliamentary exiles in the British capital. Anxious to see some restraints placed on the authoritarian side of the general whose cause he had endorsed from the beginning, Churchill gave the idea his full support.<br>

  Abstract: A THEOLOGY IS BORN NOT in a vacuum but as a result of an encounter. This encounter then reveals a vocation. In looking for the traces of such an encounter‚ in looking for the origin of vocation‚ and hence for the roots of a theology‚ there are always the dangers of psychologism‚ of reducing the objective quality of a body of work to a subjective and perhaps even sentimental experience. Yet it is the very objectivity of a work that points to its living source. These roots would remain secret and hidden were it not for these pointers.<br>

The subject, being unextended, is not even in space; the world is a spatial system of objects that the subject contemplates from a “position” that is not part of that system.

  Book Title: Constructing Feminine Poetics in the Works of a Late-20th-Century Catalan Woman Poet: Maria-Mercè Marçal-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Vicedo Noelia Díaz<br>
  Abstract: This study focuses upon the work of the Catalan woman poet Maria-Mercè Marçal. It analyses the interaction between body and language in her first five books of poetry. Drawing on the Italian feminist thought of il pensiero della differenza sessuale, it examines the ways in which Marçal’s poetic images display her Catalan feminine subjectivity, including the function of the poet, the space of poetry and the representation of love. It also explores the potentiality of the space of poetry to reconstruct female identity and reconfigure reality. In addition, it unravels the way in which the poet uses poetry to express the love for the other whilst also extending the boundaries of the self. The central concern is to bridge the fissure between female experience and universal precepts on the art of poetry through the predominance of an embodied and natural iconography. This study presents Marçal’s poetic compositions within the international panorama of poetry and feminist studies and aims to open up new terrains of discussion in the field of language, body and writing.<br>

  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Green Richard C.<br>
  Abstract: No other word in the English language is more endemic to contemporary Black American culture and identity than "Soul". Since the 1960s Soul has been frequently used to market and sell music, food, and fashion. However, Soul also refers to a pervasive belief in the capacity of the Black body/spirit to endure the most trying of times in an ongoing struggle for freedom and equality. While some attention has been given to various genre manifestations of Soul-as in Soul music and food-no book has yet fully explored the discursive terrain signified by the term. In this broad-ranging, free-spirited book, a diverse group of writers, artists, and scholars reflect on the ubiquitous but elusive concept of Soul. Topics include: politics and fashion, Blaxploitation films, language, literature, dance, James Brown, and Schoolhouse Rock. Among the contributors are Angela Davis, Manning Marable, Paul Gilroy, Lyle Ashton Harris, Michelle Wallace, Ishmael Reed, Greg Tate, Manthia Diawara, and dream hampton.<br>

  Author(s) Pernin Judith<br>
  Abstract: Since the late 1980s, radical transformations of the Chinese film industry and art circles have led to the emergence of a significant body of independent documentary films produced and circulated without the backing of state institutions. This was definitely a breakthrough, since state documentary studios and television stations were the sole producers and broadcasters of non-fiction films in China for more than thirty years. Reforms that gradually adjusted the film and television industries to a market economy in the 1980s and 1990s generated, as a side effect, a grey area in which individual projects could be produced without prior submission<br>

  Abstract: The last decade has witnessed far greater attention to the social determinants of health in health research,¹ but literary studies have yet to address, in a sustained way, how narratives addressing issues of health across postcolonial cultural divides depict the meeting – or non-meeting – of radically differing conceptualisations of wellness and disease.² This chapter explores representations of illness in which Western narrators and notions of the body are juxtaposed with conceptualisations of health and wellness entirely foreign to them, embedded as the former are in assumptions about Cartesian duality and the superiority of scientific method – itself often conceived of as floating<br>

  Abstract: Anton Chekhov’s “Ward no. 6” (1892) has inspired a large and varied body of hypertexts in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The story’s basic premise of a psychiatric doctor who is incarcerated in the same mental hospital he used to run proved extraordinarily generative for Russian writers in the following century, especially given the notorious Soviet practice of labeling political dissidents insane. Valerii Tarsis and Venedikt Erofeev, among others, reflect this aspect of the story in their works.¹ Other major themes of “Ward no. 6,” such as the unstable boundary between madness and sanity, psychological isolation from other people, and<br>

  Abstract: Broadly speaking, the term ‘structure’ has functioned as a password for many human sciences and provided them with a unified program. Where does the concept ‘structuralism’ come from, that caused so much passion and opprobrium? The term initially had an architectural sense deriving from ‘structure,’ which designated the manner in which an edifice is built. (

  Abstract: In contemporary philosophy the phenomenological movement has offered a compelling challenge to the mind–body dualism that was instituted by Descartes amongst others in the seventeenth century. This challenge, perhaps most notably in the work of the French phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty, does not consist in the reduction of one of the opposed terms to the other in the manner of a thoroughgoing or ‘eliminative’ materialism but rather rests on a broader critique of both terms. The self, it is argued, is not originally an isolated thinking subject, certain of its own thoughts and separable from the body, whilst the body is<br>

  Abstract: So far we have seen research from neuropsychology that illustrates the role which nonconscious processing plays in our mental lives. This is connected to the world around us through the role of the body in processing and cognition. One further aspect of this picture is emotion and affect. This chapter will seek to investigate the emotive aspect in thought and the debates as to its biological or social nature. Without going too far down the well-worn road of the nature/nurture debate, it is fairly uncontroversial to claim a socially constructed aspect to emotional experience and expression, even if one believes<br>

  Book Title: Memory and the Moving Image-French Film in the Digital Era<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): McNeill Isabelle<br>
  Abstract: A vital rethinking of memory and the moving image for the digital age, Isabelle McNeill investigates the role of the moving image in cultural memory, considering the impact of digital technologies on visual culture. Drawing on an interdisciplinary range of theoretical resources and an unusual body of films and moving image works, the author examines the ways in which recent French filmmaking conceptualises both the past and the workings of memory. Ultimately the author argues that memory is an intersubjective process, in which filmic forms continue to play a crucial role even as new media come to dominate our contemporary experience.Memory and the Moving Image:*Introduces new ways of thinking about the relation between film and memory, arising from a compelling, interdisciplinary study of theories and films*Subtly explores the French context while drawing theoretical conclusions with wider implications and applicability*Provides detailed and illuminating close readings of varied moving image works to aid theoretical explorations*Moves away from auteurist approaches, examining work by canonical directors including Jean-Luc Godard, Chris Marker and Agnès Varda alongside that of less well-known filmmakers such as Claire Simon and Yamina Benguigui*Brings together thinkers such as Bergson, Deleuze, Bazin and Barthes with, for example, Rodowick and Mulvey, in an engaging interweaving of theories.Works considered include Jean-Luc Godard's Histoire(s) du Cinéma (1989-98), Yamina Benguigui's Mémoires d'Immigrés (1997), Chris Marker's CD-ROM Immemory (1998), Claire Simon's Mimi (2003), Michael Haneke's Caché (2005) and Agnès Varda's multi-media exhibition, L'Île et Elle (2006).<br>

The nineteenth century-despite forecasts of God's death at the time-not only revived older Christ types but also witnessed the rise of new ones, includingle Christ proletaire, the Mormon Christ, the Buddhist Christ, and the Tolstoyan Christ. Novelists played a crucial role in the invention and popularization of the historical Jesus in particular, one of modernity's major figures.<br>

  Abstract: Mid-nineteenth-century portraits of Jesus were not as controversial in fiction as they were in realist painting. Whereas John Everett Millais, Nikolai Ge, and Édouard Manet broke with long-standing iconographic traditions, portraits of Jesus in fiction from the same time period were innovative, in large part, by the fact of their existence. Extended literary portraits are not a common feature of premodern imaginative retellings of gospel narrative. The life of Jesus, as the canonical gospels suggest, need not accommodate descriptions of the Christ image. In the 1830s and 1840s, authors of fiction began hesitantly to describe the body of Jesus thanks<br>

  Abstract: The naturalism of lucretius has long seemed too crude and perplexing to muster serious support. It construes the smallest constituents of nature to move so fast and chaotically that they cannot become objects of perception or precise explanation; ittreats the mind to be made up of material of the same type—although not the same capacity—as the rest of the body, or animus; it links thinking to the instabilities of sense experience; it locates the mind in the middle region of the breast rather than the head; it has difficulty making sense of free will and responsibility, even while<br>

  Book Title: Heidegger and Criticism-Retrieving the Cultural Politics of Destruction<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Pease Donald E.<br>
  Abstract: In Heidegger and Criticism: Retrieving the Cultural Politics of Destruction, William Spanos examines the controversy, both in Europe and the United States, surrounding Heidegger and recent disclosures about his Nazi past. Not intended as a defense or apology for Heidegger’s thought, Spanos instead affirms the importance of Heidegger’s “antihumanist” interrogation of the modern age, its globalization of technology, and its neo-imperialist politics. The attack on Heidegger’s “antihumanist” discourse (by “liberal humanists” who have imported the European debated into the United States) aligns ideologically with the ongoing policing operations of William Bennett, Allan Bloom, E.D. Hirsch, Roger Kimball, Dinesh D”Souza, and others in the spheres of higher education and cultural production. Throughout his arguments, Spanos focuses not so much on Heidegger the historical subject as on the transformative cultural political discourses and practices, implicit in and enabled by Heidegger’s interrogations of Being and Time, that have led to the contemporary emergence of the multiplicity of resistant “Others” colonized by hegemonic discursive formations, all the while reminding us that Heidegger’s philosophic interrogations eventually generate a diverse body of transgressive writing and an oppositional intellectual climate in the West.<br>

  Abstract: In the United States, the field of architecture is in the process of evolving from what has been a practice, informed by other disciplines, into a discipline with its own body of knowledge.¹ Since the nineteenth century, its locus of education has changed from the architecture firm to the higher education institution. Its instructional practices have shifted from a predominantly apprenticeship system to a system of classroom-based teaching supplemented by apprenticeship. The role of architectural instructors is changing from master architect, whose knowledge and theory of making buildings is personally held, implicit, practical, and integrated, and who instructs by demonstration,<br>

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Obeyesekere Gananath<br>
  Abstract: Throughout his career, Obeyesekere has combined psychoanalysis and anthropology to illuminate the relationship between personal symbolism and religious experience. In this book, he begins with Buddha's visionary trances wherein, over the course of four hours, he witnesses hundreds of thousands of his past births and eons of world evolution, renewal, and disappearance. He then connects this fracturing of empirical and visionary time to the realm of space, considering the experience of a female Christian penitent, who stares devotedly at a tiny crucifix only to see the space around it expand to mirror Christ's suffering. Obeyesekere follows the unconscious motivations underlying rapture, the fantastical consumption of Christ's body and blood, and body mutilation and levitation, bridging medieval Catholicism and the movements of early modern thought as reflected in William Blake's artistic visions and poetic dreams. He develops the term "dream-ego" through a discussion of visionary journeys, Carl Jung's and Sigmund Freud's scientific dreaming, and the cosmic and erotic dream-visions of New Age virtuosos, and he defines the parameters of a visionary mode of knowledge that provides a more elastic understanding of truth. A career-culminating work, this volume translates the epistemology of Hindu and Buddhist thinkers for western audiences while revitalizing western philosophical and scientific inquiry.<br>

With the advent of each new spirituality, the Christian idea of beauty expanded to include, first, the marred beauty of the saint and, finally, that of the church torn by division-an anti-aesthetic beauty embracing process, suffering, deformity, and disappearance, as well as the radiant lightness of the resurrected body. This astonishing work of intellectual and religious history is illustrated with telling artistic examples ranging from medieval manuscript illuminations to sculptures by Michelangelo and paintings by Salvador Dalí. Astell puts the lives of medieval saints in conversation with modern philosophers as disparate as Simone Weil and G. W. F. Hegel.<br>

  Abstract: The aim of this study is to present a comprehensive analysis of the novels of Josefina Aldecoa, which span the last three decades. In doing so, it employs a thematic approach, which is combined with a dual theoretical perspective centred on feminism and cultural memory in contemporary Spain. Such a structure accommodates an in-depth investigation of Aldecoa’s body of work and seeks to highlight the interconnection between women’s experiences and Spain’s current preoccupation with cultural memory. Moreover, a key objective of this book is to draw attention to the link between Aldecoa’s narrative and the historical and socio-cultural conditions in<br>

  Medievalism as an Alternative Modernity from:

  Abstract: This chapter examines how out of the 
                  galant, aristocratic engagement with the medieval whose contours I have sketched in the previous chapters, there emerged during the first decades of the eighteenth century a new, scholarly approach to the Middle Ages. This new, academic medievalism had its institutional basis at the Académie royale des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. Originally founded by Louis XIV to compose Latin commemorative inscriptions in his honour, during the eighteenth century the Academy evolved into a full-fledged scholarly body, focusing more exclusively on historical and philological activities, and shifting its emphasis from classical to medieval subjects.

  Author(s) Bale Anthony<br>
  Abstract: Before and after the expulsion of the Jews from England in 1290, artists made and audiences understood pictured Jews as embodiments of opposition to the Christian norm, as the quintessential other. Such visual dehumanization of the Jew has been widely considered elsewhere,¹ so this essay will focus on one topos that recurs at York: the Jew in visualizations of the Funeral of the Virgin. Both the textual and visual narratives of this tale depend on the moment when a Jew tries to overturn the platform on which Maryʹs body is being carried during her burial procession.

  Book Title: Love Poetry in the Spanish Golden Age-Eros, Eris and Empire<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): TORRES ISABEL<br>
  Abstract: This work engages with a broader evaluation of early modern poetics that foregrounds the processes rather than the products of thinking. The locus of the study is the Imperial 'home' space, where love poetry meets early modern empire at the inception of a very conflicted national consciousness, and where the vernacular language, Castilian, emerges in the encounter as a strategic site of national and imperial identity. The political is, therefore, a pervasive presence, teased out where relevant in recognition of the poet's sensitivity to the ideologies within which writing comes into being. But the primary commitment of the book is to lyric poetry, and to poets, individually and in their dynamic interconnectedness. Moving beyond a re-evaluation of critical responses to four major poets of the period (Garcilaso de la Vega, Herrera, Góngora and Quevedo), this study disengages respectfully with the substantial body of biographical research that continues to impact upon our understanding of the genre, and renegotiates the Foucauldian concept of the 'epistemic break', often associated with the anti-mimetic impulses of the Baroque. This more flexible model accommodates the multiperspectivism that interrogated Imperial ideology even in the earliest sixteenth-century poetry, and allows for the exploration of new horizons in interpretation. Isabel Torres is Professor of Spanish Golden Age Literature and Head of Spanish and Portuguese Studies at Queen's University, Belfast.<br>

As such, the wilderness awaited mapping, a process that began along an east-west axis in the early days of Canada’s social and economic development, but also included longitudinal pulls to the south.

  Abstract: Writing women’s lives has always been central to the feminist project. In the 1970s confessional and autobiographical writing by women contributed to and popularized a feminist politics of self-discovery, autonomy, and solidarity.¹ Questioning the relationship between language and the subject, the body and culture, female authors asserted the social and historical import of their experiences. Notably, women’s writing provided insight into women’s experiences of war and the Third Reich at a stage when feminist history of the period was still in its infancy.² And now, in the twenty-first century, women writers are continuing to revisit the National Socialist past and<br>

Both his professional (and professorial) beginnings and his tragic personal end condition our perception of his philosophical achievement: his appointment, at the extremely young age of twenty-four, to a chair of classical philology, and his final decade of insanity, following his mental collapse in 1889.

  Book Title: Thomas King-Works and Impact<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Gruber Eva<br>
  Abstract: Thomas King is one of North America's foremost Native writers, best known for his novels, including 'Green Grass, Running Water', for the 'DreadfulWater' mysteries, and for collections of short stories such as 'One Good Story, That One' and 'A Short History of Indians in Canada.' But King is also a poet, a literary and cultural critic, and a noted filmmaker, photographer, and scriptwriter and performer for radio. His career and oeuvre have been validated by literary awards and by the inclusion of his writing in college and university curricula. Critical responses to King's work have been abundant, yet most of this criticism consists of journal articles, and to date only one book-length study of his work exists. 'Thomas King: Works and Impact' fills this gap by providing an up-to-date, comprehensive overview of all major aspects of King's oeuvre as well as its reception and influence. It brings together expert scholars to discuss King's role in and impact on Native literature and to offer in-depth analyses of his multifaceted body of work. The volume will be of interest to students and scholars of literature, English, and Native American studies, and to King aficionados.

Abstract: Although his arguments could be tighter, Steffen makes some novel points. He suggests that crime, as an abuse of freedom, is appropriately punished by limitations on freedom—the greater the crime the greater (longer) the appropriate limitation. He also argues that implementation of the death penalty results in a focus on the criminal’s body, rather than on the person. This objectification, he argues, is inconsistent with the sort of respect for the criminal which is necessary for holding him responsible for his crime.<br>

Abstract: This remark is inspired by Jérôme Baschet’s emphasis on the “spiritual body” as a duality characterized by the domination of the soul over the body and by the body’s elevation through submission to the soul. As a model for the authority of the clergy over secular society, such a hierarchical and dynamic union appears as a fundamental ideological and social matrix in Medieval Latin Christendom.

Abstract: In the default style ascribed to expressive individualism, the meaning of speaking is to discover emotions and articulate them intensely (e.g., Bellah et al.
            1985, p. 123; Wuthnow1994). In that context, the language of personal empowerment could lead, unsurprisingly enough, to verbalizing emotion endlessly. In the context of the ACES style, members associated personal empowerment with finding the inner strength to create public issues reasonably, rather than by‐passing them as some of ACES’s detractors did, or laughing them off, as did a boozy man at the Wild West Days parade who asked why he should worry about Microtech when he had already “put all sorts of toxics in my body.”<br>

Abstract: We have thus followed a strange movement, a sort of coming and going between perceiving subjects and perceived objects, a zoom effect like that of a camera trying to set the right distance with its object in order to achieve a maximum degree of clarity—total transparency. On the one hand, we have seen how the tricky adjustment between the multiplicity of stabilized representations of Hawking and my face‐to‐face interaction with him has fragmented his identity. Like an impressionist painting, distance allows us to see what proximity causes us to lose. The layering of the multiplicity of narratives about Hawking reveals the stable identity of an individual that face‐to‐face contact does not allow. The closer we get to the object‐subject, the further we move from it. We no longer know who or where he is. All the categories we normally use in thinking about a person, a body, a machine, a mind, an interaction, a conversation, a text, and speech are blurred. In his presence, Hawking seems even more difficult to seize than we had imagined. The reason is, first, because, as we have shown, the depth of the social body (the one that talks of the other as much as of itself and allows the accumulation of self‐definitions), normally visible but unnoticed in any interaction, is absent in his case. Second, the internal functioning of the flesh‐and‐blood body, normally invisible, becomes visible and distributed here (the
      Iandlegsare mixed in the same discourse and are detached from the body; they are before him while his voice is next to him, and the flesh‐and‐blood body is collectively taken care of) and omnipresent (it appears at different moments during the interaction). Third, the machine, by the coordination of the actions it allows, disturbs the interaction as much as it creates it. This is where the confusion and fragmentation of identity is pursued by recomposition. Here we follow, step by step, how the machine to which this silent body is attached makes the component~<br>

Abstract: This was a proud list for Old England; and the account of their lives, their zeal, their eloquence and sufferings for conscience sake, is one of the most interesting chapters in the history of the human mind. How high it can soar in faith! How nobly it can arm itself with resolution and fortitude! How far it can surpass itself in cruelty and fraud! How incapable it seems to be of good, except as it is urged on by the contention of evil! The retired and inflexible descendants of the Two Thousand Ejected Ministers and their adherents are gone with the spirit of persecution that gave a body and soul to them; and with them, I am afraid, the spirit of liberty, of manly independence, and of inward self‐respect is nearly extinguished in England.

Abstract: Man’s incomprehensibility to himself thus designates a privilege, one by which man, or rather the one who alone (taking up Leibniz’s formulation) is able to say
         ego, arrives at recognizing, precisely by never himself knowing what, or rather whom, it is that he resembles, who it is who preserves his identity and can name him—none other than the One who created him. I cannot define myself, but, like every human being (and it is precisely in this that we recognize a human being), no one can know me and tell of me except, eventually, the one who creates me. God alone knows and preserves within his own secret the secret of man. Thus my unknowing of myself—otherwise called the impossibility of my gaining access to myself through any idea, concept, or image whatsoever that I may produce, except through the image that another gives to me—in no way signifies a flaw or defect in my knowledge, as metaphysics has so often claimed. Take, for example, after Malebranche,35Baruch Spinoza’s belief that he can hold that “mens se ipsam non cognoscit, nisi quatenus corporis affectionum ideas percipit” (“the mind does not know itself except insofar as it perceives ideas of affections of the body”).36This is a problematic thesis in every respect, if only because it implies that by knowing the ideas of what affects its body, the mind would thus know itself as this very body and, because this body is affected by every other body, the idea that themenswould have of itself would thus coincide with that of the complete extended world. In this way we would instead have to confirm that what man would know of himself would precisely not be himself, but anything other than himself. Similarly, when Kant underscores that the transcendentalIhas of itself only a “gänzlich leere Vorstellung” (“completely empty representation”) and thus that it has “no experience” of itself and that “the transcendental object is equally unknown [gleich unbekannt] in respect to inner and to outer intuition,” wh~<br>

Abstract: That the official doctrines whose function is to express the distinctiveness of the community vis‐à‐vis others have a basis in preexisting attitudes, orientations, and practices should not prevent us from acknowledging the real changes that a tradition undergoes in defining itself. The formulation of doctrines in response to a theological challenge does not leave the underlying social reality of the religious community unchanged. Inasmuch as the very existence of a social group includes a subjective element—that is, a social group fully comes into being only when it is aware of itself as such—the doctrines that communicate a community’s sense of identity to itself (and others) exercise a genuinely creative function. Out of a diffuse and inchoate sense of belonging to a tradition, one often shared by others, a religious community forges through its doctrines a sense of itself as a distinctive religious body. Religious doctrine shares with political speech the power to establish—to call into existence—a social group.

Author(s): McNay Lois <br>
Abstract: Where Meyers looks at images, McNay examines theorists: Pierre Bourdieu, Judith Butler, Paul Ricoeur, and Cornelius Castoriadis. In each case McNay lays out what she takes to be the merits of each writer’s views, while asking how the important step for feminists, from theory to action, is to be taken. And in each case the answer to this question is elusive. This is due in part to internal differences between the writers McNay considers. It is far from clear that Butler’s views on the body inform the same idea of agency as Ricoeur’s theory of narrative, for example, and as the text grows increasingly complex the very concept of agency seems to recede. This elusiveness is also partly due to the critique of theory itself. While striving to preserve the value in each competing view of subjectivity, McNay draws the reader’s attention to such serious drawbacks that one despairs for these theories altogether.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur suggests that, for a person, there are a series of dialectics at work in this process of identity narration [
         29]. First, there is explanation and understanding operating in dialectic; a process of interpretation involves a threefold movement of interpretation, understanding, and explanation. In other words, as we saw above, a person interprets a symbol, understands it, and then explains its meaning; Ricoeur argues that this happens regardless of whether we privilege one or the other of two kinds of events—interpretations or facts—because both are present and part of one set of operations. Second, Ricoeur attends to the importance of the dialectic between self and other, which he suggests is multiple in the sense that it is characterized by experience of one’s own body, the self of reciprocity or dialogue with other people, and the dialogue with what can be thought of as the “other within.” The last, he argues, is experienced as conscience. Third, there is the dialectic of identity, which is shaped by narrative in time. Each of these contribute to a dynamic relationship between sameness and selfhood, by which he means that we can be identified in time as the same person, but we also change over time as we develop selfhood.<br>

Abstract: The argumentative equivalence of race and gender in the analysis of
         Paris Is Burningis mirrored, in turn, in analogical descriptions that the film cannot sustain. Questioning the results of Venus’s denaturalization of gender and sexuality, Butler writes, “As much as she crosses gender, sexuality, and race performatively, the hegemony that reinscribes the privileges of normative femininity and whiteness wields the final power torenaturalize Venus’ body” (1993, 133). However, although one might well argue that Venus desires whiteness and its privileges, she never attempts to pass as white; she does not cross racial lines in the film (as she does gender lines) unless we, through a complete substitution of gender for race, consider any drag to be a subversion of whiteness, in which case whiteness becomes, as Richard Dyer powerfully argues, everything and nothing at once (1988, 45–46).<br>

Abstract: One can find such a coalescence of subaltern religious representations and creation of a politically solidary narrative via intentional hybridization in the works of the Korean
            minjungpoet Kim Chi Ha (1941– ). Kim’s poetry weaves Catholic liberation theology with the antifeudal and anticolonial social vision of the Tonghak religion, which rose as an indigenous religious movement of peasants for democratic revolution in Korea at the turn of the nineteenth century and played a prominent role in the 3.1 Independence Movement of 1919. The Tonghak religion itself was the product of a coalescence of elements of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and indigenous beliefs in the subaltern religious and social imagination of the Korean peasantry. In the unfinished talk poem (ballad)The World of Chang Il Tam, one of the works for which he was imprisoned, tortured, and sentenced to life imprisonment by the dictatorial South Korean regime of Park Chung Hee in 1976, Kim merges the symbols of the Eucharist—the mystical body of the deity that is eaten—with the Tonghak teaching of “human being is heaven [in nae chʾǒn]”: “Food is heaven / As we eat / God enters us / Food is heaven. / Oh, food / Should be shared and eaten by all.” See Kim Chi Ha,The Gold‐Crowned Jesus and Other Writings, ed. Chong Sun Kim and Shelly Killen (Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1978), 13–39. See also hisSaengmyǒng(Seoul: Sol, 1992), 132–49. Kim’s religiously hybrid poetic vision has been one of the mainsprings of inspiration for South Korea’sminjungtheology.

Abstract: Ibid., 83. For Tesauro, the metaphor of the saint as shield is of great relevance. If in
            SympathyMaurice and the shroud are the shields of the Catholic Savoy family, inEdipo(Oedipus, 1661), Tesauro’s interpretation of Seneca’s tragedy, Oedipus is the shield that prevents the divinity from exerting his power of purification. In Tesauro’s tragedy, Oedipus holds a long monologue on the “voracious plague” that afflicts the city of Thebes. A praetor replies to the Oedipus that the heavens are merciful because “they oppose your [Oedipus’s] virtue like a shield against their own furor.” See Emanuele Tesauro,Edipo, ed. Carlo Ossola (Venice: Marsilio, 1987), 1.1, verse 4, 79, and verses 47–48, 80. We could thus say that, for Tesauro, Maurice is a sort of anti‐Oedipus who has made himself into a lucid mirror of the shroud (the shield reflecting divine will). The saint’s body is a transparent surface reflecting and “actualizing” the “symbol” of the shroud. By contrast, Oedipus’s ignorance of his sins is a darkened, blind shield that prevents the divinity from shining through.<br>

Issue: jr.2005.85.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Young III William W.<br>
Abstract: The central reference point for Frei’s reflection on Midrash is an essay by Raphael Loewe, which Frei cites on multiple occasions. The essay, “The ‘Plain’ Meaning of Scripture in Early Jewish Exegesis,” argues against the view that the “plain” sense of scripture in rabbinic interpretation was simply what the text itself says (i.e., biblical literalism); for Loewe, this view obfuscates the argumentative and subjective elements underlying the presentation of an interpretation as “literal.” Rather,
      peshat, the plain or “flat” sense of scripture, functions as the extension of authoritative communal readings that should guide the ongoing practice of interpretation. “The evidence here set forth … suggests that the essential notion conveyed by the root at this semantic stage isauthority… the extension of an opinion, received by a teacher or elaborated by himself, over a wider body which (by acknowledgement therefore) broadens the currency of the authority of the source whence it emanates.”4As authoritative teaching,peshatrepresents the reading (or body of readings) passed on by the authority of the teacher. Such authority, however, is not heteronomous with respect to the community; rather, it grows from the communal tradition’s reading and depends on the reception and recognition (“acknowledgement”) of the authority by the community. “Peshat, therefore, means authoritative teaching in two possible senses. Either teaching propounded by an authoritative teacher, orteaching recognized by the public as obviously authoritative, since familiar and traditional. … It is the italicized alternative that is the more important where the nounpeshatoccurs.”5<br>

Abstract: Perhaps not so surprising is the fate of traditional literary critics like F. R. Leavis, Elder Olson, and Cleanth Brooks. Cited six or seven times for the first ten years of
      CI’s history, each has been cited one or two times in the last fifteen years. Other literary critics who have fallen out of vogue in the pages ofCIinclude Monroe Beardsley, Harold Bloom, Wayne Booth, Kenneth Burke, Northrop Frye, I. A. Richards, and René Wellek. This shift is indicative both of the change in the discipline of literary studies and, perhaps more importantly, of the change in the identity of the journal from a journal of literary criticism to something more interdisciplinary. While the New Critics and their contemporaries have given way to newer models of analysis, a perhaps more unexpected decline can be found when we turn to the first generation of poststructuralist literary critics. The frequency of citation of the works of Jonathan Culler, Stanley Fish, and J. Hillis Miller drops dramatically over the course of the journal’s history. But perhaps this decline is actually a plateau. When Culler’s books on structuralism and deconstruction first appeared in the 1970s and 1980s, they had an immediate and dramatic impact on the discipline, being cited over and over again. With time, they have been assimilated into the theoretical body and will continue to be cited at a more moderate pace. Similar spikes can be seen in more recent years in the frequency of citation of Judith Butler, Homi Bhabha, James Clifford, and Gayatri Spivak. While the conservative critics at theNew Criterionwould see this as evidence of the trendiness of critical theory, equating the reputations of Butler and Bhabha to other late nineties phenomena such as the Backstreet Boys and Beanie Babies, we read this as a more organic intellectual evolution from assertion to fact. Initially, certain theorists and terms are cited frequently for five years or so, followed by the inevitable backlash and/or assimilation~<br>

Abstract: A discussion of death almost one month later illustrated precisely this confusion. Mrs. Barrett wanted to convey that when God takes life, death is peaceful, whereas when humans take life, death is not. Obliquely, Mrs. Barrett was making a point about abortion, homicide, and genocide. In the chapter of
            The Hiding Placethe students had just read, Corrie ten Boom’s sister had died a brutal death in Ravensbruck concentration camp. After confessing to the crime of hiding Jews, her sister, Betsy, had been interred, and had died of illness and starvation. Corrie identified the body, and noted the beauty of her sister’s face. Discussing the passage, Mrs. Barrett and her students interpret beauty literally rather than metaphorically. Though it begins on track, the discussion about Betsy’s face derails in the shadow of 9/11 as the students and Mrs. Barrett herself struggle to distinguish whether those killed on 9/11 provide an example of God’s or humans’ timing in taking life. The confusion results, in part, from the conviction expressed in Mrs. Barrett’s prayers. If God controls all events on earth and if God’s acts further the good, then whose agency is ultimately reflected in Betsy’s death?<br>

Abstract: A serious objection against the concept of autonomy is that it does not allow for the polarity between activity and passivity that controls human life every moment of the day, and that this concept permits only an activist anthropology that conflicts with the contingency, vulnerability, fragility, and finitude of human life. Does this concept of autonomy really not allow for the three forms of passivity that Ricoeur identified—the passivity that my body imposes on me, the passivity inherent in our mutual recognition of each other, and the passivity that provides the soil in which the seed of the voice of conscience lodges?
            27In my view autonomy and passivity are not necessarily mutually exclusive, for why can people not handle these forms of passivity autonomously? Why can they not accept the transience of physical life with dignity? Why can they not consort with a beloved with dignity, when the supreme form of loving lies in being loved? And why can they not be a sounding board for the voice of conscience with dignity? Finally, why should their autonomy conflict with their creaturely relation to God, since autonomy is in fact implicit in creation, as Georg Essen rightly puts it?28<br>

Abstract: He reiterated the argument of Avramov that the mausoleum was a “foreign body” in authentic Bulgarian sensitivity, identity, and culture and that it burdened “our historical memory.” Asked whether the demolition of the mausoleum would not also obliterate the important memories of the evils of communism, as well as the historical memory of communism itself, Fotev responded that there was no alternative to the destruction of the mausoleum. It could not be successfully transformed, according to him. At the same time, he asserted a duty “to preserve the memory of this darkest page in our modern history, which lasted close to a century.” An authentic Bulgarian monument dedicated to the victims of totalitarianism was mandatory. In the years after this interview, a monument was indeed erected in the garden of the People's Palace of Culture to commemorate the victims of Communist terror. It is an almost exact replica of the Vietnam War Memorial on the Mall in Washington, D.C. (

Abstract: There is a good body of work in recent French philosophy on the issue of recognition. Emmanuel Renault, Christian Lazerri, and the antiutilitarian MAUSS (Mouvement anti‐utilitariste en sciences sociales) come readily to mind. Axel Honneth and Charles Taylor are influential, but so, too, are Bourdieu and other French sociologists. In spite of the original contributions of these French authors, none of their work has been made available to English readers to date. A first step toward filling this lack has been made with this translation of the final opus of the recently deceased Paul Ricoeur on the theme of recognition.<br>

Article Title: European Memories: Jan Patočka and Jacques Derrida on Responsibility<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: Patočka holds that it is only in Christianity that the most powerful plumbing of the depths of responsibility has occurred—in other words, that only here is it conceived in a truly fundamental manner. He can do so because this conception of responsibility articulates, as it were, the only conditions under which responsibility is possible. In Christianity alone, it becomes clear that “responsibility demands irreplaceable singularity” (
      GD,p. 51). Christian responsibility is also, therefore, tied to a gift of death—of “another death” (GD,p. 40), which is not the one to be found in the Platonic version of the care of the soul. As Derrida reminds us, when Patočka argues that “themysterium tremendumannounces, in a manner of speaking,another death.…another way of giving death or of granting oneself death,” “the word ‘gift’ is uttered” (GD,p. 40). This gift of death is a gift in an eminent sense. It is the gift by the other on which the gift of responsibility itself rests or with which responsibility coincides. Only through this gift of death does access to genuine responsibility become possible because “only death or rather the apprehension of death can give this irreplaceability [without which there can be no true responsibility], for it is only on the basis of it that one can speak of a responsible subject, of the soul as conscience of self, of myself, etc.” (GD,p. 51; trans. mod.). This gift is another way of giving oneself death, first and foremost, in the sense of apprehending death. In the originary Platonic version of the care of the soul, the philosopher, by giving himself death as that which will only affect him as a bodily being, frees himself from death; he collects and gathers himself within himself. Derrida writes that the (philosopher’s) self “comes into beingas suchat the moment when the soul is not only gathering itself in the preparation for death but when it is ready to receive death, giving it to itself even, in an acceptation that delivers it fro~<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: The surfacing of fundamentalisms in our time, echoing a long and often suppressed history of struggle, represents not so much a rupture from the received order of time but rather a repressed revenant. Its reappearance reminds us of a historical perspective joined to the present that has always provided the stage for a constant enactment of the past in the present. What the current conjunctures disclose is a configuration Edmund Husserl once thought of as a “‘thickened’ present,”
         8a present filled with traces of different moments and temporalities, weighted with sediments. He referred to the “comet’s tail” of retentions that manage to maintain their identity long after the inaugurating event has passed.9Husserl also used the example of how notes of a musical score are succeeded but still remain. It should be recalled that Husserl’s conception of time consciousness was yoked to the category of lifeworld; unlike the everyday, it does not take into consideration the empirical world and history so that one may examine a time such as it first appears to consciousness, “an immanent time in the course of consciousness,” what has been described as that which is most subjective in subjectivity.10Phenomenology, driven by its own scientific aspirations, aimed to avoid becoming simply a variant of introspection, as such. It sought, therefore, to steer clear from descriptions of lived time as it was given so as to clarify the essential character of a consciousness of time, reaching “finally the one infinite objective time in which all things and events—bodies and their physical properties, psyches and their psychic states—have their definite temporal positions, which we can determine by means of a chronometer” (PIC,p. 7;PIZ,p. 7). As for preobjective time, it is a “flow of the modifications of the past” and a continuing gushing forth of the now (PIC,p. 74;PIZ,pp. 71–72), a flux of lived experiences where originary impressions succeed each other, each constrained by its h~<br>

Abstract: At this point in the story, Smith adds eight verses where the KJV makes do with one referencing Cain’s killing of Abel. Smith’s verses provide motive for the crime. Cain, we are told, “listened not any more to the voice of the Lord” and “loved Satan more than God.” As a consequence, Satan invites Cain to enter into a secret covenant “that he would do according to his [Satan’s] commands” and, in exchange, Satan promises “this day I will deliver thy brother Abel into thine hands.” The reversal implicit in this contract is made explicit when Cain rejoices: “Truly I am Mahan, the master of this great secret, that I may murder and get gain … and he gloried in his wickedness.” Later, he exults over the body of his brother: “I am free; surely the flocks of my brother falleth into my hands.” The exiled Cain will later teach his Satanic covenant to his sons whose “works were abominations, and began to spread among all.”
         61But, always in Smith’s narrative, individuals are free and capacitated to choose, as is evidenced by the women who resist their husbands’ acceptance of Cain’s antiorder. The secrets of Cain’s order were not shared with the women in the family “because that Lamech [Cain’s fifth generation descendant] had spoken the secret unto his wives, and they rebelled against him, and declared these things abroad, and had not compassion. Wherefore Lamech was despised, and cast out, and came not among the sons of men, lest he should die.”62Thus, for Smith, the potential for evil is coexistent with existence itself, but sin—the embracing of evil and antiorder—came into the world through Cain.<br>

Abstract: Although these two schools did not originally differ greatly with respect to doctrinal content, sharing as they did a common body of brahmanical religious teaching, they did differ in terms of their respective methods. This difference in method is clearly indicated by the respective senses of the terms
         sāṃ
            khyaandvedāntabefore these terms came to designate philosophical schools. In its early usage in the epic literature,sāṃ
            khyaprobably did not refer to a particular philosophical system but referred more generically to the intellectual method of salvation.28Edgerton interprets this original sense ofsāṃ
            khyaas “(the method of salvation) based on reckoning or calculation.”29In a similar way, the termvedānta, before it came to designate a particular set of doctrines, referred to the interpretive‐exegetical study of the Upaniṣadic corpus.30This early sense ofvedāntastill remains close to its literal reference to a body of texts situated “at the end of the Veda.” Thus, from its earliest beginnings, the Vedāntic school was defined by its fidelity to the Upaniṣadic texts.31Significantly, early texts such as Kauṭilīya’sArthaśāstraappear not to have recognized Vedānta and its closely allied sister school, the Pūrva‐mīmāṃsā, as schools of philosophy (ānvīkṣikī), viewing them instead—and not unjustly—as schools of Vedic exegesis.32While acknowledging the risks involved in using Western categories in the interpretation of Indian culture, we might capture the difference between Sāṃkhya and Vedānta by characterizing the former as primarily a system of philosophy and the latter as one of theology.33Of course this difference in the respective attitudes of these two schools toward “faith” and “reason” was a matter of emphasis. Vedānta, for its part, recognized the validity, albeit restricted and subordinate, of the use of reason (yukti) in deciding matters of interpretation and doctrine.34For its part, Sāṃkhya also acknowledged ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: In light of this discussion, we may now go back to the question that introduced the foregoing arguments. Where does the soul of Joseph Le Doux’s mother go when it leaves the body? My soft‐transcendental answer, Proustian in nature, is that it goes, or more exactly it remains, where it should be in the first place, namely, in the organismic memory that mourning “injects in [her son’s] blood stream.” It is the embodied token of his self’s altruistic identification in the loved one.<br>

Author(s): Zimmerman Virginia<br>
Abstract: This interesting work presents fragments and traces from geological and archaeological practices in nineteenth-century Britain and considers their connections with and influence on Victorian literature.
      Excavating Victoriansis not exactly history of science but, rather, a work of literary criticism that draws very heavily on the history of science. Virginia Zimmerman underscores the disjunction between scientific and literary writing as an artifact of our view from the twenty-first century, drawing on Gillian Beer'sDarwin's Plots(Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1983) for useful context and analysis. She identifies the writings of Charles Lyell and Charles Dickens, along with those of their contemporaries, as part of a single body of literature, written in response to the newly discovered vastness of time and to emphasize the authority of the individual to interpret (and thus reclaim) the past. Zimmerman uses the notion of the “trace,” as defined by Paul Ricoeur, to indicate “an object's origin in the past but also its duration into the present” (p. 8); the strategies the Victorians used to cope with this confused temporality is the major resonating theme, along with the continual conjunction of construction and destruction. This juxtaposition of preservation and decay is emphasized throughout: in geology, with the fossil remains of long-extinct species; in archaeology, with the action of Vesuvius that at once destroyed Pompeii and forever preserved its remains (which would otherwise have been lost); and in Victorian London, with the continual building projects that uncovered the traces of Roman occupation.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: In affirming “negative rationality” (N5383) at the center of the human subject, Coleridge joins a tradition of asserting theological mysteries (e.g., Tertullian, Blaise Pascal) but also creates a displacement in the traditional concepts of faith and prayer to make the paradoxical cry of Mark 9:24 archetypal. Even when writing about the Lord’s Prayer, his reflections tend to bear its trace. In 1831, for instance, he describes himself as “a paralytic but yet a living Nerve” in Christ’s body and begs “thy Will be
         done: Let but the vital warmth of thy redemptive Love pierce to me” (N6621). The prayer thus translates the petition into a version of Mark 9:24, willing for one’s will to be broken, willing against oneself. The form is characteristic of most of Coleridge’s citations of Matt. 6:10 (see N5516, N5634, N6474). While such an interpretation is not foreign to the great Protestant theologians, it is only one element of their readings: for Coleridge, it appears dominant.42In foregrounding this strange, paradoxical tenor, he looks forward to Søren Kierkegaard, the most notable theologian of paradoxical faith, who would deepen Coleridge’s assertion of an existentialist religious act: “A Faith with a Belief indeed, but with a belief that derives it’s [sic] origin & stability wholly from the Antecedent Faith” (N6666, fol. 85).43<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 605587<br>
Date: 6 2010<br>
Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: Yet this secular turn would have been impossible, Sheehan suggests, without the catalyst of Pietism, a Lutheran reform movement with deep roots in the mystic tradition. Sheehan is certainly justified in identifying Pietist devotion with religious “individualism,” especially given its privileging of conscience, but such an emphasis obscures countervailing tendencies that called the self's cognitive faculties into question. Indeed, among early Pietism's influences was the notorious Madame Guyon, whose theology of self-annihilation had been the spark that set off the Quietist Affair.
         38According to Guyon, the self must “lose without ceasing its entire will in the will of God” and remain “indifferent to all things, whether for the body or the soul, for temporal possessions or eternal possessions.”39This is not to say that Sheehan is unaware of similar turns against spiritual agency. As he observes in his discussion of German Romanticism, Schleiermacher's “theology of feeling” repeatedly emphasized “an absolute dependence on God” (Sheehan, 229). Nevertheless,The Enlightenment Biblesituates these findings within an overarching narrative of the rise of cultural autonomy without considering the extent to which figures like Schleiermacher also represented an opposing shift toward dispossession.40Spinoza's praise of determinism, Guyon's arguments against spiritual self-ownership, and Schleiermacher's recognition of humanity's eternal indebtedness to God all contributed, in their various ways, to a radically immanent critique of transcendence, one that undermined autonomy on the basis of the persistent and immediate presence of the divine.<br>

Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: To illustrate the extension of the political through sovereign power, Agamben invokes Herman Melville’s
         Bartleby, The Scrivener, but we might find another figure in the character of the Magistrate from J. M. Coetzee’sWaiting for the Barbarians.10This nameless Magistrate displays the inscription of imperial power in his body as the result of the power of the Empire that he serves. The Empire intrudes on his border village when it decides it is at war with the barbarians surrounding it. This Magistrate, long out of the reach of the centers of power on the edge of the anonymous Empire, criticizes the futile efforts of the Empire to combat the barbarians surrounding them and identifies their status as convenient fictions for the Empire’s sovereignty. When the soldiers of the Empire attempt to destroy these barbarians, all they can round up are some fisherfolk. Yet, when the Magistrate undercuts the Empire’s efforts, he is himself arrested, tortured, and imprisoned.<br>

Article Title: Literary Unrest: Blanchot, Lévinas, and the Proximity of Judaism<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: The mode that is attributed to the Jew in Lévinas's essay is here called merely nomadic. It is nevertheless clear that the relationship between “man” and the “nomad” mirrors the relation of the anti-Semite to the Jew, as the “nomad” is presented as tied to technology and as such represents a threat to “man.” At the same time that it generalizes Lévinas's text, the opening of Blanchot's essay nonetheless manages to parallel the first paragraph of Lévinas's, even alluding obliquely to Heidegger's critique of flight in “Das Ding.” Within the body of the essay, Blanchot does take up specifically the category of the pagan, declaring that Gagarin's space flight is a threat to the pagan in all of us: he who is tied to enrootedness, to tradition, to his biological race, he who consoles himself among the trees over the evil of mankind. The Jew, however, is not mentioned. Even when Lévinas is paraphrased in the essay it is without specific citation, and he is referred to not as someone who speaks in the name of Judaism but as “the man with no fixed abode,” as a representative of the nomads (“C,” p. 13; “CS,” p. 269). In repeating Lévinas, Blanchot has insisted on resisting the move back to the proper, which Lévinas's essay performs in its emphasis on Judaism's message. Lévinas uses Gagarin's flight to lead back to the truth of Judaism, concluding his own essay with the claim that, like technology, Judaism “has demystified the universe” and, moreover, “has discovered man in the nudity of the face” (“H,” p. 259; “HGU,” p. 234). Blanchot uses Lévinas's essay to remind us that Gagarin tears us away from the proper in
         every sense. His omission of both Lévinas's name and of Judaism underscores the point that deracination as a moral concept would prohibit reappropriation of any kind. The message of Gagarin's speech from space is for no one to claim and for no one to own, that is, that “truth is nomadic” (“C,” p. 13; “CS,” p. 271). Blanchot has thus doubly displaced Lévinas'~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: It is utterly clear that Faustus's inner life is tortured. The longing and the sense of exile invoked by his cries (“see, see where Christ's blood streams…one drop would save my soul…ah my Christ”) are utterly palpable yet horribly answered by sharp internal pain, as if an invisible claw slashed at Faustus's heart for its very longing (“Ah, rend not my heart for naming of Christ”). And by this rending sharpness Faustus becomes all the more alienated from mercy, as if he were confronted with the hallucination of Christ's blood disappearing (“Where is it now? ’Tis gone”), or as if God himself looked down in the sternest, most unforgiving judgment (“see where God / Stretcheth out his arm, and bends his ireful brows!”). But what makes God seem entirely confounding is not merely that he seems to all too ready to squash Faustus, as if Marlowe's hero were nothing more than a scurrying, terrified bug, but also that Faustus himself finally seems horrified by damnation yet remains utterly exiled and bereft of any chance for his soul to find rest because he manifests the very same habit of mind he displayed in his opening soliloquy. He still feels that he can live only in his body, addressing the earth as if it could hide him from God by hiding his body (“Then will I headlong run into the earth: Earth gape! O no, it will not harbor me” [5.2.87]). He still feels like salvation is an annihilation worse than death, and for that very reason he cannot help but prefer either to be in endless pain in hell or to have no soul at all (“O no end is limited to damned souls! / Why wert thou not a creature wanting soul?” [5.2.104–5]). And he still thinks that his soul is flesh and that his flesh will endure forever in hell (“Now body, turn to air, / Or Lucifer will bear thee quick to hell / O soul, be changed into little water drops, / And fall into the ocean, ne'er to be found” [5.2.116–19]). Thus he can do nothing but call on God in a gasping panic (“My God, My God!” he cries, just before~<br>

Abstract: Vásquez’s overall project is to “rematerialize” (as he puts it) the study of religion, and the key to his positive theoretical position lies in the way he conceptualizes materialism. His focus on this rematerialization is on three areas: the body, practice, and emplacement. The book is divided into three parts, each corresponding to these domains. However, it is indicative of his interests and intentions that part 1 on embodiment contains seven chapters, while parts 2 and 3 contain two chapters each. He chooses materialism “because it approaches religion as it is lived by human beings, not angels” (5).<br>

Abstract: A volume edited by Moore and Sanders (
         2001) includes an introduction that offers a comprehensive analysis of the extensive body of anthropological literature on African witchcraft since Evans-Pritchard, the surface of which I have barely been able to scratch in the present discussion. Several of the contributions directly address evil and misfortune (Rasmussen2001) and morality (Sanders2001; van Dijk2001), while Moore and Sanders in their introduction highlight the ambivalence of witchcraft in relation to both morality and modernity. A contemporaneous volume edited by Bond and Ciekawy (2001) on witchcraft in Africa with contributions primarily by philosophers and anthropologists takes up morality and ethics and on occasion directly addresses evil but for the most part adopts a similar concern with the broader meaning of witchcraft. The volume edited by Stephen (1987) on witchcraft and sorcery in Melanesia is singularly concerned with bringing scholarship from that geographical region out from under the theoretical and ethnographic shadow of Africanist scholarship. With such a goal, the theme of evil is peripheral to issues of cosmology, politics, religion, warfare, social change, legitimate uses of sorcery, and the validity of a distinction between sorcery and witchcraft. Likewise, the volume on witchcraft and sorcery in Southeast Asia edited by Watson and Ellen (1993) also sets itself off against Africanist scholarship but does so more by observing the different colonial circumstances that resulted in these practices being both less frequently reported and less of an overt social problem than in Africa, as well as a scholarly problematic more related to the diagnosis and curing of sickness than to rationality and social control, and the effect of relations with major religious traditions in addition to Christianity (Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism). Here evil is explicitly recognized as a topic, primarily with reference to different degrees of evil attribut~<br>

Abstract: Lear calls attention to the inadequacy of our response when he staggers onstage with Cordelia’s lifeless body. His rebuke indicts the audience as well as the actors/characters at his side:
      
            As Marianne Novy observes, no spectator can respond accordingly, and our inability is profoundly embarrassing. For Novy, this unsettling insufficiency instills within each of us a keen sense of isolation. As we watch on in silence while Lear bursts his lungs and then his heart, we come to feel a sharp separation not only from the characters onstage but also from our fellow spectators. Nevertheless, Novy insists that this feeling of isolation ultimately gives way to a sense of solidarity. I cannot know if you and I are feeling the same thing, and I cannot deny that neither of us is feeling enough, but the simple fact that we are both feeling something (whatever it is) attests to a basic connectedness that, finally, fashions us into a community of care. “The one consolation that [Shakespeare] offers—and in a theater it is a significant one—is that we feel each other’s loss because of our basic connection.” Although our emotional response to Lear’s tragedy will never rise to the height it deserves, it is—at least for Novy—enough to knit us together.

Abstract: In the context of the poem’s obsession with manufacturing satanic speech, these seemingly trivial lines may hold the key to understanding the fate of the serpent. Teskey provides another helpful gloss: “Satan emits sound through the serpent either by using the serpent’s tongue or by emitting pulses of air, which make sound by vibrating in the elongated tube of the serpent’s body.”
         
               In pursuing the question of who ultimately speaks the words that seduce Eve, we are led to the perhaps unexpected question—Is the serpent more like a singer or more like a trumpet? If the latter is true, if Satan merely emitted pulses of air through his body, then surely the serpent is innocent (we might imagine two serpentine fangs hanging like quotation marks over his mouth, signifying that the pulses of air that glide through them have their true origin in another). But what if the serpent used his own tongue? What if he was inspired by Satan and took some pleasure in shaping those seductive syllables? What if he experienced the satanic voice uniquely as his own, even for a moment—as we saw comically in the case of Raphael and tragically in the case of Adam? How well, we might ask, did the serpent govern his tongue?38<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Badiou sees the ecclesia as a “site of contestation that requires nothing less than an active and never-ending pursuit of clarification to remain faithful to the truth-event that is named in the resurrection.”
         
               According to Hiebert, his reading of Paul helpfully articulates a vision for the shape of the church within the conditions of late capitalism.171
            
               Let us examine this thesis more closely. Hiebert argues that Badiou derives from Pauline ecclesiology the conviction that the mission of the church consists not in reactively overcoming capital but rather in the “vulnerable stance of patiently dwelling within the world [where] capital dominates, and struggling to remain faithful to the event of the resurrection, even if it means that Christ’s own body becomes infected.”172
            
               This “struggling universality” (as Žižek puts it)173
            
               of the ecclesia may stem only from fidelity to the event that necessitates ongoing clarification. Such a universalism, which by nature adopts what Badiou calls a “militant discourse,” is not primarily a reaction to external threats (which would make Badiou’s position all the more amenable to the mechanized logic of capital), but rather embodies a stance of vulnerability and thus can be expressed only in a “militant discourse of weakness.”174

Abstract: Katherine A.

Abstract: At some places it could have been useful to set this body of texts in an even wider perspective. The silence about careers, for instance, is surprising when contrasted with academic novels in which university life is described as a theater of politics and passions. And the positive tone of most of these autobiographies may also have been enhanced by the current pressure to produce positive resumés.<br>

Author(s): Anderson Judith H<br>
Abstract: The final chapter, which considers the
      Lex Mercatoria(1622) of the merchant Gerrard de Malynes, can stand for what is most distinctive about Anderson’s book. Like all that precedes it, it is the product of equal parts intense close reading and deep research. (The endnotes, fully a third again of the book’s length and set in smaller type, are a rich mine both of reference and reflection.) She unfolds Malynes’s body-soul-and-spirit allegory of “the three Essentiall Parts of Trafficke” (177) — commodities, money, and exchange — in order to show how he argues for the overriding economic importance of monetary policy. Malynes has his critics, both on account of his metaphors (which were disparaged by contemporaries such as Thomas Mun) and his theory (Mun again, and most modern economists). What Anderson is ultimately concerned to show, however, is how, for all of the potential intricacy of the relations between body and exchange, Malynes’s conceit is sterile, never transforming or vitalizing what I. A. Richards would call its economic tenor. His book had little power to change the way his contemporaries talked about money. Critics mostly celebrate the discovery of metaphorical overplus: here is a valuable lesson in how metaphor might fail.<br>

Abstract: Wu argues that a “fundamental logic” underlies the structure of burials (219), and that only by uncovering this logic can we truly understand Chinese tombs. This thesis is reflected in Wu’s decision to arrange the book thematically into chapters that represent what he considers the “three most essential aspects of any manufactured work”: spatiality, materiality, and temporality (14). Because he is not bound by the same constraints that accompany the more traditional chronological and individual approaches to studying tombs, Wu is able to draw freely from a large, albeit fragmented, body of material and textual evidence to support his points. A major strength of this book may also be perceived as a weakness: Wu seems to be able to offer explanations for practically all the visual phenomena in tombs. One may question the reliability of such a comprehensive explanation for such an enormous amount of information.<br>

Abstract: Michel Foucault in "Revolutionary Action: 'Until Now' " (an interview),
Language, Counter-Memory, Practice: "By humanism I mean the totality of discourse
through which Western man is told: 'Even though you don't exercise power, you can
still be a ruler. Better yet, the more you deny yourself the exercise of power, the more
you submit to those in power, then the more this increases your sovereignty,' Human-
ism invented a whole series of subjected sovereignties: the soul (ruling the body, but
subjected to God), consciousness (sovereign in a context ofjudgment, but subjected to
the necessities of truth), the individual (a titular control of personal rights subjected to
the laws of nature and society), basic freedom (sovereign within, but accepting the
demands of an outside world and 'aligned with destiny'). In short, humanism is
everything in Western civilization that restricts the desirefor power ..." (221 )<br>

Article Title: The Self beyond Itself: Hermeneutics and Transpersonal Experience<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263716<br>
Date: 6 1, 1930<br>
Author(s): Underhill David R.<br>
Abstract: This essay examines, from the point of view of an existential hermeneutics, five accounts of transpersonal experience: Robert Monroe's Journeys Out of the Body, Paul's experience in the third heaven in II Corinthians 12, a description of rapture by Teresa of Avila, a disembodied vision of guardian spirits by John Lilly from The Center of the Cyclone, and the vision of the assault of the Lords of the Dead from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Through a consideration of world, embodiment, death, care and other existential categories, the discussion in each case focuses on a central ambiguity about the personal identity of the narrator. The question of authenticity, in a Heideggerian sense, is posed to these materials, and the central ambiguity is shown to strike so deeply as to undercut the assumption of autonomy as the criterion of authenticity. Being-toward-death is relativized in such experiences, but relativized by an even more radical threat to individual existence. In conclusion, some generalized principles are offered as heuristic criteria for interpreting transpersonal experience in general.<br>

spatial identification [with its specular image], the succession of phantasies that extends
from a fragmented body-image to a form of its totality that I shall call orthopaedic - and,
lastly, to the assumption of the armour of an alienating identity, which will mark with its
rigid structure the subject's entire mental development" (p. 4)<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303122<br>
Date: 10 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Yates Ingrid<br>
Abstract: This article investigates the use of extended metaphor in automobile fan discourse. It starts out with a definition of extended metaphor as literary, consciously sustained metaphor, and goes on to redefine it as consciously sustained but not exclusively literary; extended metaphor can also be found in consumer discourse. The article proceeds to describe the body of automobile fan discourse, its text types and communicative functions. Next, the article gives an overview of the most frequently used metaphorical concepts by which cars are represented. Particular attention is paid to those concepts that humanize or animate the car. Against this background, a text from the magazine Car & Driver that lobbies against safety legislation for sport utility vehicles is then analyzed. It is shown that the author skillfully employs two extended metaphors to argue his cause: CARS ARE CREATURES, THESE CREATURES ARE MALTREATED, and CONSUMER RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ARE MALTREATERS OF CARS. These concepts are sustained throughout the text through both lexical choices and grammatical patterns. It is shown that the metaphorical concept THE CAR IS HUMAN/ANIMATE is a powerful tool of the ideology of automobilism that is consciously drawn upon and reinforced in a specific text.<br>

Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
Issue: i20109441<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Baek Jin<br>
Abstract: In his philosophy of nothingness, Kitarō Nishida illuminates the matrix of transformation of the world "from the Created to the Creating" (tsukuru mono kara tsukurareta mono e) through shintai, or the body. In this matrix, shintai enters into the stage of an action-sensation continuum and emerges as the immaculate iconic tool of nothingness to create new figures as extended self. This idea of shintai has resonance with the development of postwar art in Japan. The "Space of Transparency" put forth by Ufan Lee, the leader of Monoha, is the principal example. This essay investigates Nishida's notion of shintai and its influence on Lee's theory of art.<br>

Author(s): Shalin Dmitri N.<br>
Abstract: This article offers an alternative to classical hermeneutics, which focuses on discursive products and grasps meaning as the play of difference between linguistic signs. Pragmatist hermeneutics reconstructs meaning through an indefinite triangulation, which brings symbols, icons, and indices to bear on each other and considers a meaningful occasion as an embodied semiotic process. To illuminate the word-body-action nexus, the discussion identifies three basic types of signifying media: (1) the symbolic-discursive, (2) the somatic-affective, and (3) the behavioral-performative, each one marked by a special relationship between signs and their objects. An argument is made that the tension between various type-signifying media is unavoidable, that the pragmatic-discursive misalignment is an ontological condition, and that bridging the gap between our discursive, affective, and behavioral outputs is at the heart of ethical life.<br>

Issue: i20628279<br>

Author(s): Kosicki Piotr H.<br>
Abstract: Beginning with Maurice Halbwachs's theory of collective memory and the great body of sociological, historical, and political-science literature on war and aggression that postdates Halbwachs, the author attempts to identify the elements of aggressor—victim memory through a detailed analysis of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In participant and third-party narratives of the genocide, it is possible to observe a commemorative quality in the campaign of mass murder. The author suggests that the persistence of post-traumatic culture and the failure of dialogue can lead people to kill in remembrance of earlier aggression: in such cases, "acting out" substitutes for "working through," with horrifying consequences.<br>

Abstract: Drawing attention to the complex reciprocal relationship between commercialized leisure and commercial literature in the so-called "Age of Wit," this essay reconceives of the witty and witless in two important ways. Taking for granted, first of all, that wit is usually analyzed in terms of the efficacy of verbal language, the essay examines how and why debates concerning true and false wit were played out in physical terms—in this case, through the motions, gestures, and attitudes of the dancing body. Second of all, the essay attempts to account for the enduring, if unwitting, attractions of "false wit" by likening it to the tricks and transformations of contemporary English pantomime. Satirists of the 1720s, 1730s, and 1740s frequently invoke the unmeaning motion of Harlequin as a visual way of proscribing the verbal excesses of extravagant language. At the same time, apologists for pantomime associate Harlequin's "dumb Wit" with truth, reason, and the pattern of nature, claiming that the genre's corporeality allowed it to transcend the limitations and equivocations of words. The essay concludes that the popularity of pantomime contextualizes the Augustan reaction against false wit, in that it identifies a source of aesthetic pleasure in the public's eagerness to be duped by apparent sameness in difference. Early eighteenth-century readers enjoy luxuriant, illogical, and mixed metaphors, forced similes, and trifling jibes and quibbles for the same reason that early eighteenth-century spectators delight in the unexpected turns of pantomimic entertainment: in a world under the sway of Harlequin's magical slapstick, audiences derive satisfaction from being deceived.<br>

Abstract: In many parts of the world, excavations of British military sites have unearthed material reflecting lifeways in the British Empire. Specifically, studies of historical ceramics and glass have greatly advanced our understanding of status and material expression. This study highlights the current body of knowledge on British military crested ceramics, contrasting the rarity of archaeological finds with their abundance in documentary sources. An elemental stylistic analysis reveals that these crests expressed regimental affiliation as the fundamental unit of self-identification. Symbolic interpretation of these crests stresses their active role in the socialization of officers and structuring collective memory, particularly through the mess institution.<br>

Article Title: The Double Center of Gravity in Durkheim's Symbol Theory: Bringing the Symbolism of the Body Back in<br>

Abstract: By studying Durkheim through a Schopenhauerian lens, the one-sidedly cognitivist and functionalist reception of his social theory can be balanced. Durkheim explicitly rejected such monistic interpretations. His dialectical approach was always aimed at an essentially dualistic perception of man and society, wherein the lower pole, the individual, is central. In Durkheim's symbol theory, this position leads to two kinds of symbols: those that are bound to the human body, here called "this and that" symbols, and those people can choose freely, here called "this for that" symbols. This twofold symbol theory can already be found in medieval philosophy (e.g. Dante Alighieri) as well as in the work of Paul Ricoeur. For Durkheim the human person is the symbol par excellence. By implication the rituals in which the person is (re)constructed, that is the rites of passage, should be central. The interpretation here opens up new perspectives for a more psychological interpretation of Durkheim's sociology.<br>

Abstract: The Phenomenology says that every knowledge is a perspective knowledge, because every knowledge is situated in a time and in a space. The human's embodiment discloses a perspective overview on the world. The paper claims the aim to analyze how the sexual and gender dimensions, which are incarnated in a determinate body, are present in the qualitative research, specifically into the ethnographic observation. First for all, we hypothesize that the gender is a border for the access into a field and not in other, so to be man or woman is not neutral for the knowledge of a specific social context. Moreover, the performative dimension of the gender, which shows the norms that pre-exist and that conduct the role's interaction (i.e. the role's gendered content and the role's gendered language) is another tie in the participant observation. The awareness that all the knowledge is gendered, requires to the fieldworker to play a double competence (ability). The researcher must use the self reflexivity to point out his gender identity and his background on this theme: he must point out his background frame relatively to the gender, his gender behaviour's expectations in the interaction, and his correlated opinions. The researcher, moreover, must know that exist a cultural mainstream about the gender, but that the concrete gender playing is based on the interaction in a concrete frame. So, we have a lot of concrete ways in which the gender is embodied. The researcher on the field, so, must enter in a knowledge's circulation in which must point attention to: the epistemic interdependence, i.e. the knowledge borns in the symbolic interaction between the researcher and the subject; the gendered nature of the communicative interaction between the researcher and the subject; the negotiable nature of the concrete managing of the gendered role in the interaction.<br>

Abstract: The article analyses the meaning of tattooing as a form of narration. Introducing the body as a text that can convey different forms of thought (derived both from philosophy and from sociology), the author maintains that the body modification is today as an open and living work whose interpretation has an influence on the individual identity and can be changed by means of the interaction with others. A thumbnail sketch of the history of the practice among traditional communities up to contemporary society is drawn to provide a series of fundamental usages for the inscription of the body. The concern here is to show tattooing as an expression of the whole individual (no longer divided into mind vs. body) and of his own perceived identity, underlying the relation of the chosen symbols (and of the symbolic ritual) with society, which remains the main source offering forms of representation and the main stage for the construction of identity. So that the whole final text can be read as the result of a process where the authorship is shattered among the society itself.<br>

Abstract: Controlling for insecurities depends on a capacity to make inferences on the basis of experiences about the past, yet the use of knowledge about the past for anticipating and predicting future threats is highly problematic. This article examines the problem of governing individuals on the basis of what is available about their past deeds and social networks in governmental and commercial archives. It highlights the tension between administrative and private narratives about individuals, the former being constructed on the basis of minute details collected and stored about individuals since birth, and the latter referring to the accounts individuals offer of themselves. By applying the notions of ipse and idem identity developed by Paul Ricoeur, the article examines the two-way flow between memory and identity and the consequent concern that administrative narratives are blind to the ethical renewal of individuals, to the capacity of Man to extricate himself from the shackles of his past. To prepare the ground, the article considers some inherent limitations of biopolitics, pointing out that although biopolitics was classically concerned to govern both individual bodies and the body politic, administrative and governmental limitations have led states to govern the "average citizen" rather than individuals in their "individuality."<br>

Author(s): SLATMAN JENNY<br>
Abstract: In this paper, I explore the meaning of bodily integrity in disfiguring breast cancer. Bodily integrity is a normative principle precisely because it does not simply refer to actual physical or functional intactness. It rather indicates what should be regarded and respected as inviolable in vulnerable and damageable bodies. I will argue that this normative inviolability or wholeness can be based upon a person's embodied experience of wholeness. This phenomenological stance differs from the liberal view that identifies respect for integrity with respect for autonomy (resulting in an invalidation of bodily integrity's proper normative meaning), as well as from the view that bodily integrity is based upon ideologies of wholeness (which runs the risk of being disadvantageous to women). I propose that bodily integrity involves a process of identification between the experience of one's body as "Leib" and the experience of one's body as "Körper." If identification fails or is not possible, one's integrity is threatened. This idea of bodily integrity can support breast cancer patients and survivors in making decisions about possible corrective interventions. To implement this idea in oncology care, empirical-phenomenological research needs to establish how breast cancer patients express their embodied self-experiences.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: The method adopted in this study of Meir Shalev's poetics involves the simultaneous application of two complementary theories: the theory of literary mythopoesis (based on Aleksei Losev's personalistic theory of myth) and the theory of the origins of signs, language and culture developed by Eric Gans. It is shown that images of incorporated memory in the novel function as synergetic mechanisms both of turning signs into personalities and of turning personalities into signs. The unity of the body and memory representations appears to be the prominent feature of Shalev's postmodern fiction, which serves as the significant step in the development of magical realism in Israeli literature.<br>

Abstract: Every community which regards as normative certain texts given by the worthies of old must develop a "hermeneutic," a means whereby these fixed standards can be kept in an effective relationship with the ever-changing frontier of day-to-day experience. In the two centuries surounding the turn of the era, six factors impelled Rabbinic Judaism toward the elaboration of a hermeneutic far more self-conscious than anything previously known: the canon of the Scripture was fixed; a body of authoritative Torah not part of that canon had to be kept in fruitful relationship to it; the institutions of Bet-Kenesset and Bet-Midrash emerged as settings suitable for carrying on the hermeneutical task; sectarian competition increased the urgency for an explicit hermeneutic; Hellenistic culture offered models from its own interpretive tradition; and the normative role of the Temple in religion ceased. Out of this period emerged a sophisticated system of "hermeneutics," or praxis of interpretation. The essay reviews the traditional lists of seven and thirteen middot, together with other methodological devices not part of the lists, and — with the help of illustrations drawn from Mekilta de R. Ishmael — offers a logical and literary analysis of each one. A comparison of the results of these analyses with hermeneutical devices found in both Old and New Testaments and in the larger Hellenistic milieu leads to the conclusion that the system of Rabbinic hermeneutics was sui generis, and was the indigenous response of the Tannaim and their immediate successors to their own urgently felt need for an effective hermeneutic.<br>

Abstract: Today, bioethical themes are no longer the exclusive patrimony of university classrooms. Everyone is talking about them; "secular" and "catholics" alike. Catholics are often accused of imposing a "confessional" point of view. This article wishes to clarify this point given its importance in themes regarding the life and death of man, such as: artificial fecundation, abortion, cloning, brain death, organ transplants, and euthanasia. The article is based on a philosophical reflection starting with anthropological considerations. The extensive number of themes does not allow taking all of them into consideration. Thus the article adheres to the following outline: 1. Establish the epistemological bases for a rational discourse based on universal premises, with particular reference to artificial fecundation and the nature of human sexuality. 2. Analize the "human nature" condition of the embryo, of the physically and mentally disabled, of the terminally ill, and their status as "human persons"; this discourse is founded on the ontological status of the human body. 3. Present the value of the human body as a psycho-biological unity, which constitutes man's substantial unity. 4. We call this psycho-biological unity "person": "corpore et anima unus"; an individual subject with a rational nature, with its own singularity and oneness. The person has an absolute value, therefore cloning, even for "therapeutic reasons", is contrary to its ontological status. 5. From the consideration that a "person is", while a "personality becomes", we can explain how the person develops and matures his biological and spiritual capacities, without incurring changes in his ontological status. 6. The psycho-biological unity of the human person (corpore et anima unus) is at the basis of death in man, a unique reality. In analysing "human death" we should avoid two reductions: a biological reduction which curtails death to physical-biological processes and events (medical diagnosis of brain death)~<br>

Abstract: The present article considers the relationship between the understanding of the Word of God on the part of the Church and on the part of the individual theologian. The importance of written communication for this relationship is presented and analysed. The concept of body (corpus) is applied analogically to the Church and to texts of the Tradition. The author suggests that fruitful incorporation of theological texts into the corpus of the living texts of Christian faith actualizes and symbolises the integration of individual theological understanding with that of the Church. L'articolo considera la relazione della Chiesa da una parte e del teologo individuale da un'altra alla comprensione della Parola di Dio. Analizza l'importanza, per questo rapporto, della comunicazione scritta del lavoro teologico. Il concetto di corpo si applica analogicamente tanto alla Chiesa quanto ai testi scritti della Tradizione. L'incorporazione feconda del testo teologico nel corpus dei testi viventi della fede cristiana attualizza e simboleggia l'integrazione della comprensione del teologo individuale con quella della Chiesa.<br>

Abstract: The theoretical premise of this essay is that metaphors are not simply decorative figures of speech; they have instead played a decisive role in the formation of scientific theory. My specific intention is to show how the metaphors of the "machine", the "body" and the "invisible hand", in diverse ways, provided models with which to represent a social and economic order which was the unintended outcome of human actions. Moreover, reciprocal comparison reveals the limitations on their use, and the reasons why the "invisible hand" was more successful than the other two metaphors in conveying the concept of the competitive market.<br>

Abstract: We can distinguish two different kinds in the educational process, the one called «learning education» and the one leading to a possible «autonomous education» in which every-body's freedom is above everything else. The former is education for technoscientists. The later, the «autonomous education» is supported by the thesis that knowing oneself as «moriturus», forces one to provide a sense or meaning, technologies and educational sciencies not being enough. Death forces us to decide the possible, only opposed by the impossible.<br>

Abstract: En Palestine, chaque année au mois d'avril, a lieu le pèlerinage musulman de Moïse (mawsim al-Nabî Mûsâ). Située dans le désert, entre Jérusalem et Jéricho, la tombe du prophète rassemble autour d'elle des pèlerins venus de l'ensemble de la Cisjordanie. Ce lieu de mémoire collective fixe et rappelle un événement lointain rapporté par la tradition musulmane : la mort de Moïse. Dans le même temps, il suscite des questionnements en chaîne : le législateur des Hébreux est-il mort dans ce lieu? Ou, comme le stipule la Bible, dans un endroit inconnu des hommes? Estil d'ailleurs vraiment mort? Son corps est-il là? Etc. Ces questions, qui portent sur les circonstances et la réalité de l'événement, reviennent à s'interroger ici et maintenant sur la présence d'un intercesseur efficace entre les hommes et Dieu. Elles sont donc étroitement liées à une problématique plus large, celle de savoir comment construire l'accessibilité et le contact avec un « ailleurs invisible », ce Dieu transcendant et lointain que l'islam propose à l'instar du judaïsme et du christianisme. Dans cet article je propose d'explorer l'indécision qui est le corollaire de cette longue série de questionnements ne trouvant aucune réponse définitive. In Palestine every year in the month of April, the Muslim pilgrimage of Moses (mawsim al-Nabî Mûsâ) takes place. Located in the desert between Jerusalem and Jericho, the grave of the Prophet gathers pilgrims from the entire West Bank. This place of collective memory fixes and recalls a distant event reported by Muslim tradition: the death of Moses. At the same time, it raises questions: did the Hebrew legislator die there? Or, as stated in the Bible, in a place unknown to men? Is he really dead? Is his body there? Etc. These questions, which relate to the circumstances and the reality of the event amounts to question here and now the presence of an effective intercessor between man and God. They are closely related to a larger issue, that of how to build accessibi~<br>

Abstract: Au Japon où se côtoient et s'imbriquent deux religions, le bouddhisme dont on connaît la richesse iconographique et le shintô, aniconique, l'identification très systématique des dieux et des bouddhas atteste de la porosité des catégories d'existants visibles ou invisibles. Si, pour certains, les bouddhas sont les formes originelles des dieux locaux, pour d'autres, ils n'en sont que les émanations. Cette incertitude théologique rend sujette à débats la présence des entités vénérées aussi bien que la nature de leur figuration, à la fois corps, représentation et substitut. Les spectacles populaires de marionnettes, des objets animés bons à brouiller les catégories du vivant et de l'inerte, laissent accroire qu'une forme de ruse rituelle, le simulacre, permet d'animer une statue inauthentique ou de transformer un corps d'homme vulgaire en un dieu vivant. La croyance en l'existence d'êtres surhumains se forge dans le rituel où substitué et substituant sont soigneusement confondus grâce à des mises en scène humaines ou divines qui dévoilent un monde où les possibilités de transformations seraient autres qu'ici-bas. In Japan, where two religions coexist and overlap, Buddhism known for its iconographic wealth and Shinto, aniconic, the very systematic identification of gods and Buddhas attests to the porosity of the categories of visible or invisible existing entities. If for some Buddhas are the original forms of local gods, for others they are just manifestations. This theological uncertainty allows us to debate the presence of worshiped entities as well as the nature of their representation, both body, representation and substitute. Popular puppet shows, animated objects blurring the categories of living and inert entities, let people believe that some form of ritual ruse, the simulacrum, can animate an inauthentic statue or transform a common man's body into a living god. Belief in the existence of supernatural beings is forged in the ritual in which the substituted and ~<br>

Abstract: Finke, pp. 41-42: "In the Middle Ages, torture was not regarded simply as a form of
punishment. It was, as Foucault has shown, a technique and a ritual, a semiotic system which 'must
mark the victim.' Torture inscribed on the victim's body the 'signs' of the ruler's power. It was
one of the most visible displays of that power, an art, 'an entire poetic' that competed with other
visual displays of theocratic rule. The marking of the victim's body signifies the power that
punishes. "In the 'excesses' of torture, a whole economy of power is invested". In her excesses,
the mystic becomes at once both torturer and victim. This, it seems to me, is the whole point. The
mystic's pain - her inflicting of wounds upon herself — grants her the authority to speak and be
heard."<br>

Abstract: Este artículo presenta una reflexión en torno al terremoto como condición histórica de espacios nacionales y regionales que se representa en diversas memorias presentes en la larga duración de la historia de Chile. Los terremotos, sucesos naturales violentos que sacuden el cuerpo en la contingencia, se representan en diferentes memorias (individuales y colectivas) con imágenes que refieren al quiebre y ruptura de estructuras materiales, familiares, sociales, políticas, económicas y culturales, pues como memoria herida está obligada a confrontarse con pérdidas. Las memorias colectivas constituyen así, al mismo tiempo, testimonios de movimientos en el tiempo posteriores al terremoto y miradas que orientan con sentido de futuro a una comunidad y su inminente reconstrucción (material y simbólica). This article presents a reflection on earthquakes as a historic condition of national and local spaces, and represented in various present memories forming part of Chile's long history. Earthquakes, natural and violent events that shake the body in the contingency, are represented in different memories (individual and collective) through images that refer to the breakdown and rupture of material, family, social, political, economic and cultural structures, because as a wounded memory it is obliged to face up to its losses. Thus, collective memories are, at the same time, testimonies of the earthquake, and gazes fixing the future that guide a community on its path to (material and symbolic) reconstruction.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores trivial or minor issues of body parts and relics and the major matter of evil. These incongruities offer a means of reflecting on the relationships between sociology and theology as re-set by the advent of postsecularity and the fears of Benedict XVI concerning the dictatorship of relativism. Efforts to resolve these incongruities draw attention to metaphors and the limits of sociological rhetoric in handling matters pertaining to theology. A means of overcoming these dilemmas is to be found in the musical explorations of Weber who offers a way of coming to terms with the irruptive spectres of postsecularity.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i24484208<br>
Date: 8 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): da Silva António Barbosa<br>
Abstract: The purpose of this theoretical article is to discuss the existential and universal feature of suffering—as illustrated by Job's suffering in the Book of Job in the Bible and by the survivors of the 2004 Asian tsunami catastrophe—and to highlight its significance for health care. Further, the study is aiming at contributing to health professionals' understanding of patients' suffering. The sources are narratives, comprising Job's book, TV interviews 1 year after the tsunami catastrophe and the survivors' autobiographies. The methodological approach is a philosophical analysis. The existential, universal, ontological and epistemological aspects of suffering are carefully scrutinized to unveil the universal and existential versus culture-specific features of suffering. Based on the results, the authors' recommendations are (1) a holistic concept of the patient and health care has to seriously consider suffering in all its complexity because when a person is in pain, it is not his/her body but the whole person as a unity of body, psyche and spirit that suffers and (2) suffering should be seen as the most central concept of health care, which should provide treatment for physical pain and all dimensions of suffering: physical, social, mental and spiritual aspects.<br>

Author(s): Tyree-Hageman Jennifer<br>
Abstract: This paper traces the development of the historical origins of an economic ethos and the groups that carried and transformed this ethos in two key economic sectors: first, Silicon Valley, and second, Wall Street. Financialization of the US economy is closely connected to a political logic that celebrated the capacity for the self-regulation of markets and condemned state intervention, bringing free-market thought to the fore. A growing body of sociological literature explains the rise of neoliberalism as an intellectual project, as a series of policy reforms, and as a form of politics. This dialogue has largely lacked sufficient critical analysis of whether a motivating ethos allowed market fundamentalism to emerge and take hold across different economic sectors. An analysis of the resurgence of free-market ideas in two important sectors of the US economy, informed by Weberian theory, reveals a distinct element, in this case an ethos, which itself motivates and sustains free-market thinking. In Silicon Valley and on Wall Street an economic ethos emerged from the structuring of ideas and ethics into specific historical contexts by distinct groups within each economic sector.<br>

Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Benjamin Roy<br>
Abstract: In this paper, I examine the influence of the Gospel of John on Joyce's aesthetic. My basic claim is that the gospel aided Joyce in charting a middle course between materialism (body without spirit) and spiritualism (spirit without body). After examining the temptations of flying too high (symbolism, mysticism, gnosticism) and flying too low (historicism, realism, materialism), I show how Joyce made use of the Johannine strategies of epiphany and realized eschatology to achieve a synthesis between these extremes. The essay is much indebted to two students of John—Rudolph Bultmann and Franz Mussner—who examined John's peculiar synthesis of fact and allegory. In addition, the scholar Jacques Aubert was indispensable for his analysis of a similar trajectory in Joyce's aesthetic.<br>

Abstract: Official collective statements of Catholic bishops construct and promote the imaginary of the Philippines as "Catholic nation." This conflation of the body Catholic and the body politic has served as the church's platform for defending its interests in education against perceived nationalist threats and for engaging social issues. This article traces the genealogy of this discourse and uncovers its distorted account of the Filipino nation's emergence and its deductive pastoral logic. Given the inevitable link between "the religious" and "the secular," the imaginary is challenged today by the call for greater inclusivity and the impact of digital connectivity on community, whether religious or national.<br>

Abstract: Although Dooyeweerd says that "all human acts have their origin in the soul," and
therefore beyond time, he holds that they function only within the temporal structure of the
human body (TM, XX; cf XIV). For this reason he opposes the phenomenology of Husserl and

Abstract: I cannot go into the question whether substances can be such self-causing causes and
consequently how agency could be conceived in a metaphysics of substances. Moreland and
McRae (2000) argue for such an approach in their important work on anthropology and eth-
ics. I conclu with their spirit (a defense of the notion of soul in a biblical sense), without shar-
ing their mind-bodv dualism and the metaphysics behind it. One could make a case, I think, of
the statement that in their account the substantiveness of the body gradually disappears, in
spite of their body — soul dualism. Another issue is the distinctness between biblical and scien-
tific language. An important argument in almost all dualist accounts is the séparation between
body and 'soul' at death. I am not convinced that this 'séparation' can be used as an argument
for body-soul dualism as a philosophical position. Is what occurs at the moment of death not
just as mysterious as what occurs at the moment of conception (and in God's act of création)?
By introducing the biblical notion of the soul in a scientific discourse on mind-body dualism,
one is coerced to adapt the biblical meaning of the concept to the prevailing ontology of sub-
stances and entities; and this almost always implies not only réduction (loss of meaning), but
also adoption of certain conceptual characteristics inherent in the metaphysics of substances
(such as separateness of substances; or self-sustenance; or being bearer of a bundie of fea-
tures).<br>

Abstract: In the passage at issue Cooper quotes Dooyeweerd via the English translation of Ber-
kouwer (1957). Berkouwer in turn quoted Dooyeweerd's (1940, 181) article on the problem of
time, which does contain the passage about the human soul which "naar het getuigenis van de
Schrift door den tijdelijlten dood niet getroffen wordt, maar ook na de aflegging van het
"lichaam", d.i. van heel den tijdelijken in individualiteits-structuur besloten beslaansvorm, blijft
voortbestaan." But the translation is incorrect! The translators of Berkouwer's book rendered
the passage as follows: "The soul. Scripture shows, is not affected by temporal death, but after
the end of the body (i.e. of all the temporal aspects of man), it continues as a form of existence
with an individuality structure" (Cooper 1989, 251). The Dutch text, Berkouwer (1957, 285,
note 148), quotes Dooyeweerd correctly. In Dooyeweerd the term 'individuality structure'
refers to the body; the translators related it, wrongly, to the soul. It is likely that this has
occasioned Cooper's misunderstanding. The passage should read: "As Scripture testifies, [the
human soul] is not touched by temporal death, but continues to exist even after the shedding
of the 'body', i.e. [the shedding] of the entire temporal, individuality-structure-enclosed form of
existence."<br>

Abstract: By turning the all-of-life into a program, neo-Calvinism would not only disqualify itself as
worldview but would also contradict Bible texts implying a distinction between the essential
and the inessential, as for instance the apostle Paul's insistence that 'food does not bring us
near to God' (1 Cor. 8:8), and his avowal: Ί beat my body and make it my slave' (1 Cor. 9: 27).<br>

Article Title: Le corps souffrant chez Lu Xun : allégorie muette de l'obstacle et appropriation de la modernité<br>
Publisher: Presses Universitaires de Vincennes<br>
Issue: i24715391<br>
Date: 1 1, 2015<br>
Author(s): Vuilleumier Victor<br>
Abstract: Le corps chez Lu Xun est peu décrit. Cette absence permet de dire indirectement une souffrance multiple : la honte ressentie devant la crise historique de la Chine dont la nature nationale est tenue pour responsable; la mélancolie existentielle. En revanche, le corps est allégorisé comme signe de la tradition, qui fait obstacle à l'émancipation de l'individu. Libérer la voix de la nation chinoise impose de détruire symboliquement le corps reçu en héritage, de subvertir l'esthétique et les paradigmes scientistes de la corporalité et de la puissance élaborés par la modernité chinoise mondialisée. Le vrai médecin agit par l'écrit sur l'esprit, non sur le corps ou la civilisation matérielle. Accorder la primauté au cœur sur le corps permet de fonder un projet de modernité, en métaphorisant la médecine importée. The body in Lu Xun's writings is rarely depicted. This absence allows the text to indirectly express the meaning of suffering in its multiple dimension (the shame felt in the face of China's historical crisis, which the national nature is held liable for, and the existential melancholy). However, the body is allegorized, and embodies the sign of a tradition that limits the emancipation of the individual. The liberation of the Chinese national voice requires symbolically destroying the inherited body, as well as subverting the sublime aesthetics of corporeality and the scientist paradigm of the body defined by the Chinese globalized modernity. The real physician impacts on the spirit by means of the writing, and not on the body or the material civilization. To ensure a greatest value to the heart rather than to the body is regarded by Lu Xun as a way to establish a project of modernity, by the metaphorization of the imported medicine. 在魯迅作品里，很少描寫身體。這種缺席可以有助於用非直接的方式來言說一種多 重的苦痛（包含在中國的歷史危機面前所體會到的羞恥感，中國人的國民性被認為 是要對這種危機負責，也包含存在的苦悶）。相反，身體被加以寓言化，成為傳統 符號的寓言，阻礙個體的解放。解放中國民族的聲音，迫使要用象徵的方式摧毀作 為遺產來接受的身體，顛覆既有的美學観，亦顛覆由經歷世界化的中國現代性所建 構出的體魄與力量的科學主義範式。真正的醫生通過書寫的形式對精神加以作用， 而不是針對身體或者物質~<br>

Abstract: In her interpretation of Freudian psychology Madelon Sprengnether conceives the figure of the spectral
mother as the recurrent metaphor of the presence of the absent, prompted by memory. The mother's body
becomes in his view the locus of desire and endless return; its loss the necessary step for ego formation: "The
mother's body becomes that which is longed for yet cannot be appropriated, a representative of both home
and not home, and hence, in Freud's terms, the site of the uncanny. As both origin and Other, the preoedipal
mother escapes the equally devastating effects of idealization and erasure, allowing for the possibility of maternal
discourse as well as a non-phallocentrically organised view of culture" (Sprengnether 1990, 9).<br>

Publisher: Society for Historical Archaeology<br>
Issue: i25616488<br>

Author(s): McCarthy John P.<br>
Abstract: Much archaeological scholarship on consumption has approached its subject matter as the means to an end—e.g., as a way of studying socioeconomic status—rather than as a proper object of study in its own right. The "consumer choice" school, and, more recently, advocates of consumer behavior studies, have supported approaches that emphasize quantitative methods, at the same time downplaying the "qualitative" or symbolic aspects of consumption. A considerable body of literature on the symbolic aspects of consumption exists both in historical archaeology and other fields. The intention of this essay is to draw together this recent literature on consumption and combine it into a single approach that emphasizes shopping as the meaningful action at the very heart of consumption. With the emphasis on agency, this approach presents shopping as that crucial moment of transformation where identity, intention, and symbol combine in the decision to purchase, to own, an object.<br>

Abstract: A number of investigators are agreed that the popular medical systems of tribal, peasant, and allied peoples are "effective." Most of the literature closely examining that effectiveness focuses on the ethnopharmacological dimensions of the healing systems and generally ignores psychosocial factors. Recent developments in psychophysiology may offer insights into these neglected areas. The specific idea to be examined here is that successful "general medical treatment," or "symbolic healing," by either the shaman or physician, is based in part on a psychosocial mobilization of the patient's biochemical response system. Moreover, it is argued that to account fully for these processes we must reconceptualize the character of the human organism; a unitary alternative to standard Western Cartesian dualism (mind vs. body) is proposed, based on a model derived from recent research in neuroendocrinology. This model can be the basis for a nonreductionist theory of medical effectiveness needed to account for a series of observations (derived from both anthropological and medical contexts) which seem to transcend the explanatory powers of the traditional reductionist biomedical model.<br>

Author(s): Bonvillain Nancy<br>
Abstract: This paper discusses semantic aspects of noun incorporation in Akwesasne Mohawk, one of six Northern Iroquoian languages spoken today. Meanings of verb stems with incorporated nouns are shown to range from literal referents of transitive action to abstract, nontangible metaphors. NI is examined as the structural means through which novel semantic units are formed. These new units expand the interpretative range of basic meanings as part of creative linguistic and conceptual processes. Metaphors are created to fulfill lexical and poetic functions. Data are presented and analyzed from body part and other semantic domains.<br>

Abstract: The article explores somatic metaphors related to explosion, outburst and eruption in diverse media. This inquiry lies in the intersection among philosophy, literary criticism and history of art and its conclusions are relevant to musi-cology. It is argued that there are various basic orientations, persuasions and biases underlying specific uses of metaphors of somatic eruption. The article endeavours to propose an alternative reading of body fluids as metaphoric sites of festive critique in subversively humorous discourse and art, which differs from more prevalent psychoanalytic interpretations. A text by Hélène Cixous, as well as visual material by Jenny Saville, Cindy Sherman, Bruce Nauman and Pieter Brueghel the Elder is scrutinized. The most appropriate musical example in this context is probably (especially the introduction to) the Háry János Suite by Zoltán Kodály.* By grouping male and female artists together, an underlying picaresque or subversively humorous, non-binary and geneticist match is suggested in their work. Yet, at the same time it is argued that female body fluids present women with metaphoric vantage points that facilitate understandings beyond the borders of patriarchal culture. /// Članak se temelji na većem istraživačkom projektu koji pokušava sagledati griješnu i komičnu ili feminističku likovnu umjetnost unutar šire pikareskne tradicije vizualne kulture.

Povratne pikareskne metafore pomno se ispituju zbog njihova potencijala da priopće takve iskaze, i to ne samo u umjetničkim djelima muških i ženskih umjetnika i u predstavljanjima muških i ženskih tijela, nego i medu umjetnicima i teoretičarima.

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>

Author(s): della Dora Veronica<br>
Abstract: Over the past few years, the relationship between landscape and the body as two physical entities mutually informed through performance has been increasingly interrogated by cultural geographers. Similar issues about memory, embodiment and performativity have been raised in the social sciences, yet often obliterating the material specificities of place and landscape. This paper reconsiders the relationship between landscape and memory in terms of embodied, visual and spatial practice, rather than as a contested cultural politics of heritage and identity (as it has been generally understood in cultural geography after the so-called 'cultural turn'). Drawing on Nora's 'memory places' and on the Deleuzian notion of 'ontological past', as well as on recent writing on historical geographies of exploration and travel, the paper explores the spatial re-activation of Classical historical memory by nineteenth-century British officers and travellers to Aegean mountain peaks through their embodied and site-located practices of climbing, surveying or simply 'gazing'.<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i30157392<br>
Date: 7 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): McDonald William C.<br>
Abstract: Hie vor dô wir kinder wâren by Der Wilde Alexander (fl. 1250) proceeds from the words of St. Paul: "Even so we, when we were children [nepioi], were in bondage under the elements of the world" (Galatians 4:3). Accordingly, the "Kindheitslied" is no nostalgic song of retrospection in the form of sacred, didactic allegory (a gloss is absent), but rather is an extended scriptural analogy addressing the change from the Old Law to the New. The words dô and nu (1,1 and 1,7) reflect New Testament rhetoric. The biblical echo in the opening line permits immediate identification; thus Alexander relies neither on progressive unveiling of his message nor on a language or ciphers. The "Kindheitslied" can be profitably discussed in conjunction with the body of literature on the encounter of Church and Synagogue.<br>

Abstract: Many contemporary sources, including anthropological, define politics as the vying for power that occurs in the public domain, the goverance of the body politic, or strategies for advancing particular interests as general. While not inaccurate in terms of reflecting politics in the modern state, the instrumental notion often excludes a sense of politics that involves a struggle for mutual recognition or consensus through the medium of discourse. Discourse becomes the central concept in grasping the relation between politics and secret societies among the peasantry. It is argued in this essay that politics displayed through discourse goes a long way towards defining the public in peasant societies. In terms of augmented repression, either from a centralized state or local elites, the sense of public submerges itself in the hidden discourse or code of the secret society. This theme is examined with respect to the Mau Mau of Kenya and late nineteenth and twentieth-century Chinese secret societies.<br>

Author(s): Young Michele<br>
Abstract: This article argues that Jürgen Habermas's view of religion as anathema to rational critical discourse reflects his misunderstanding that religion comprises a monolithic and immutable body of dogma that is closed to reason. Illustrative data from Catholic history and theology and empirical data gathered from contemporary American Catholics are used to show the weaknesses in Habermas's negation of the possibility of a self-critical religious discourse. Specifically, I highlight the doctrinal differentiation within Catholicism, its longstanding theological emphasis on the coupling of faith and reason, institutional reflexivity, and the doctrinally reflexive reasoning that contemporary Catholics use in negotiating what might appear as "contradictory" identities (e.g., being gay or lesbian and Catholic). Although the data presented take issue with Habermas's disavowal of religion, the article shows that the practical relevance of doctrinal reasoning at both the institutional and the individual level vindicate Habermas's faith in the emancipatory potential of reasoned argumentation to advance participative equality.<br>

Abstract: Essentialist and postmodern feminisms are often regarded as incompatible. I propose that Buddhist theories of subjectivity change the nature of the tension between them as presently construed because Buddhist traditions describe a mind not wholly governed by language, and a subjective mental dimension that is entirely integrated with the body and its sensations. A corollary is the compatibility Buddhists perceive between conditioned subjective states (akin to postmodern feminisms) and the unconditioned (akin to essentialist feminisms).<br>

Publisher: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers<br>
Issue: i40010631<br>
Date: 3 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Svenaeus Fredrik<br>
Abstract: In this paper I develop a phenomenology of falling ill by presenting, interpreting and developing the basic model we find in Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness (1956). The three steps identified by Sartre in this process are analysed, developed further and brought to a five- step model: (1) pre-reflective experience of discomfort, (2) lived, bodily discomfort, (3) suffered illness, (4) disease pondering, and (5) disease state. To fall ill is to fall victim to a gradual process of alienation, and with each step this alienating process is taken to a new qualitative level. Consequently, the five steps of falling ill have not only a contingent chronological order but also a kind of logical order, in that they typically presuppose each other. I adopt Sartre's focus on embodiment as the core ground of the alienation process, but point out that the alienation of the body in illness is not only the experience of a psychic object, but an experience of the independent life of one's own body. This facticity of the body is the result neither of the gaze of the other person, nor of a reflection adopting the outer perspective of the other in an indirect way, but is a result of the very otherness of one's own body, which addresses and plagues us when we fall ill. I use examples of falling ill and being a patient to show how a phenomenology of falling ill can be helpful in educating health-care personnel (and perhaps also patients) about the ways of the lived body.<br>

Issue: i40013929<br>
Date: 4 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Fink-Jensen Kirsten<br>
Abstract: In this paper Kirsten Fink-Jensen suggests how a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective can contribute to the knowledge of learning and teaching processes in music education in school The philosophical frame is Danish philosophy of life, represented by Knud Ejler Løgstrup, and Merleau-Ponty's philosophy of body, both pointing to the wholeness of mind and body in all kinds of actions. Within this framework interpretation is an epistemological, practical-hermeneutic activity based on different analytical methods. Phenomenologically, experiences of music are constituted in an intertwinement of personal, cultural, and local meaning. The challenge facing the teacher is then to understand what becomes meaningful to persons in a given situation. 'Bodily dialogue' is a metaphor of a hermeneutic process of understanding that highlights the importance of bodily aspects in the teacher's answer to a child's musical attuned articulations. This focus can facilitate children's learning processes and change and qualify the teacher's didactic reflections on the impact and progression of music lessons.<br>

Issue: i40027896<br>
Date: 3 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Moore Cerwyn<br>
Abstract: This article makes a contribution to hermeneutic explorations in global politics. Taking as its points of departure the growing body of work on film and the turn to aesthetic and intertextual IR, the article argues that a further conversation with cinema and poetics can be used to develop the interpretive canon in global politics. In particular, the analysis draws upon the idea of cinematic poetics, and more generally the work of Andrei Tarkovsky, who, throughout his films and written work, articulates a particular form of Russian interpretivism. The article explores Tarkovskian cinema and engages in debates about artistic creativity and aesthetics, filmic representations of belonging and spiritualism, all shaped by a Russian hermeneutic tradition. The final sections apply these themes, illustrating how the icon presents a way to read the themes of suffering and salvation, inscribing the formation of identities in global politics.<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: To see, to speak, to think : these are the three main topics of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, tragically interrupted in 1961. He intended to write two works on The Origin of Truth. To understand the relationship between Merleau-Ponty I and Merleau-Ponty II it is a good lead to pay attention to the relationship between seeing, speaking and thinking. In a central passage of Phenomenology of Perception (p. 451) this relationship is called Fundierung. Merleau-Ponty conceives it as a two way relationship, which excludes every possibility of reducing one term (thinking, reason) to another (perception, language). Yet, at that time he is not able to point out clearly the originality of thinking. L'Oeil et l'Esprit and Le Visible et l'Invisible provide a first outline of l'Origine de la Vérité. The 'second' Merleau-Ponty wants to 'reassume' his whole philosophy in what he calls : fundamental thinking. Painting opens the way to the mystery of seeing : something visible begins to see. Subject and object are no longer opposed to one another ; not even related by intentionality. The new key-word is Ineinander (interrelatedness, to be in one another, chiasm). 'La chair' (the flesh) is a new notion, broader and more fundamental than the body. The sensible reflects upon itself. This 're-flection' (reflexivity or reversibility) is a work of Being. The visible can be seen in principle. Philosophy should accompany the coming-to-see of the visible. In this perspective the transition to thinking (or ideality) must be seen as a new case of 'reversibilité'. The generality of the visible opens up to the 'invisible', that which in principle cannot be seen, but is 'the other side' of the visible. The basic phenomenon of expression is central here. Language is not an absolute starting point. Language is rather a new and more subtile form of coporeity, a new instance of the same basic reversibility, which already contains the seeds of ideality (logos endiathetor). The idea is of the word (logos ~<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40044033<br>

Author(s): Barber Michael<br>
Abstract: Dorion Cairns correctly interprets the preconstituted stratum of Edmund Husserl's Fifth Cartesian Meditation to be the primordial ego and not the social world, as was thought by Alfred Schutz, who considered Husserl to be insufficiently attentive to the social world's hold upon us. Following Cairns's interpretation, which involves recovering and reconstructing strata that may never exist independently, one better understands how the transfer of sense "animate organism" involves automatic association, or somatic apprehension. This sense-transfer extends to any animate organism, not just humans, and draws on extensive unreflected-upon similarities despite the distinctive fact that the other's body is never given to oneself as is one's own. Following Cairns's interpretation, one can also understand the second epoché as an imaginative, reconstructive abstraction rather than as an example of failed ascesis. Consequently, Husserl appears as less intellectualized in his approach to empathy than often thought to be and more confident in the phenomenologist's capacity to imagine and attend selectively to experience.<br>

Abstract: La plongée sous-marine en milieu naturel est une activité qui modifie l'équilibre et la perception du corps. Les plongeurs – souvent convaincus de pratiquer une activité sans danger – s'exposent pourtant à des risques potentiellement mortels. À partir d'une enquête ethnographique, l'auteur montre qu'en définitive ce sport laisse une place aux transgressions des normes où le risque est progressivement converti en sécurité. Cet arrangement implique d'acquérir la maîtrise des « techniques de neutralisation ­­» du risque, permettant aux plongeurs d'entretenir paradoxalement un système normatif, tout en le « violant ». Il apparaît ainsi que la transgression des normes de sécurité est moins un acte individuel qu'une conduite déterminée par l'organisation sociale de la plongée. Diving in a natural medium modifies the equilibrium and perception of the body. Divers — often convinced to practice a safe activity — expose themselves to potentially mortal risks. On the basis of an ethnographic survey the author shows that this sport leaves room for an infringement of norms where risk is progressively neutralized. This implies that divers master the neutralization techniques that enable them paradoxically to maintain a normative system and to violate it at the same time. Infringement of safety norms thus appears to be an individual act rather than a behaviour determined by the divers' social organization. Der Tauchsport in einem natürlichen Medium verändert das Equilibrium und die Wahrnehmung des Körpers. Die Taucher — die oft davon überzeugt sind, dass sie einen risikolosen Sport treiben — setzen sich potentiell tödlichen Risiken aus. Auf der Basis eiener ethnographischen Studie zeigt der Autor, dass dieser Sport Platz für eine Übertretung der Normen lässt, wo das Risiko allmählich neutralisiert wird. Dies setzt voraus, dass die Taucher die Neutralisationstechniken beherrschen, die sie paradoxerweise ermöglichen, ein normatives System zu erhalten und zur gleicher Zeit zu verletz~<br>

Abstract: Il s'agit d'éclairer plusieurs déplacements qui se sont produits dans les trente dernières années. Tout d'abord la création d'un milieu d'experts intermédiaires entre la politique, l'administration et la recherche. Ensuite un changement du cadre à l'intérieur duquel se situe la réflexion. Il s'agit moins de penser la cohésion d'une société dans un cadre national qu'à la manière dont le pays peut maintenir son rang dans la compétition internationale. Enfin un changement d'orientation politique : le souci de la formation de l'élite redevient primordial même s'il ne s'agit plus de maintenir une tradition culturelle mais de sauvegarder ses parts de marché. Le texte étudie ces évolutions en France en distinguant trois périodes : une période de « politique à l'état gazeux » où la gauche tente de transformer les idéaux libertaires de 1968 en programme de gouvernement ; une tentative de passage à l'état solide avec la loi d'orientation de 1989 et la création de la Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective ; une déstabilisation de ce système par le ministre Claude Allègre qui jette le système éducatif français dans le grand bain de la concurrence internationale. Il s'ensuit une période à la fois « sous influence » et d'incertitude. The idea is to explain several moves that have happened in the last thirty years. First of all, the creation of a body of experts, middlemen between politics, government and research. Then a change in the setting of the thinking process. It is less to think about social cohesion within a national setting than the way the country can live up to its ranking when competing at the international level. Finally, a change in political orientations: teaching the elite becomes a crucial problem again even if it does not mean keeping cultural traditions alive any more but securing market shares. This article studies those changes and defines three periods: firstly, a period of politics in "gaseous-state" in which the left tried to change 1968's liberta~<br>

Abstract: Cet article (1) présente une réflexion théorique sur la notion de genre, de ses définitions et ses usages en sciences sociales. S'opposant à l'approche dominante qui conçoit le genre comme identité ou attribut socialement construits des personnes, conception qu'elle considère comme essentialisante ou substantialisante, l'auteur argumente en faveur d'une approche relationnelle du genre conçu comme modalité des relations sociales. Elle se fonde pour cela sur des travaux d'anthropologie comparative et historique qui contraignent à reconsidérer le dualisme du moi et du corps constitutif de l'idéologie individualiste de la personne, et critique I'hypostase du Moi comme homoncule constitué à partir d'une absolutisation de la première personne. Analysant le système sexué des trois personnes grammaticales, elle soutient que, n'étant pas référentiel, « le je de l'interlocution n'a ni sexe, ni genre ». Les apports croisés de l'anthropologie et de la philosophie analytique la conduisent à revoir la notion de personne pour mieux penser la capacité proprement humaine de se reconnaître comme d'un sexe sans être jamais assigné à celui-ci. This article presents a theoretical work on the idea of gender, its definitions and uses in social science. The author objects to the mainstream approach that sees gender as an identity or an attribute that some people socially construct. She sees that idea as essentializing or substantializing. She argues in favor of a relational approach of gender conceived as mode of social interactions. Her approach is based on comparative and historical works of anthropologists that lead to consider the dualism of the ego and the body which make the individualistic ideology of a persona, and she criticizes the hypostasis of the ego as homunculus made up from absolutizing the id. Analyzing the gender system of the three grammatical persons, she asserts that, as it is not a reference, the other person's "I" does not have a sex nor a gender. The contributions f~<br>

Abstract: The title of the essay refers to the famous statement in Foucaults introduction to his History of Madness where he writes that "we have to do justice to Freud". The problem, however, is that Foucault's philosophy does not seem to do justice to Freud. Foucault's use of Freud is ambiguous: sometimes he uses him for purely instrumental purposes (when reconstructing the history of madness and sexuality), but sometimes—for anthropological purposes signaling Freud's role in redefining our common humanity and particularly our relation to language, life and work. The author confronts Foucault's ambiguous reading of Freud with the equally ambiguous reading of Foucault by Derrida. Derrida discusses Foucault twice. Once in the essay Cogito and The History of Madness in which Derrida takes on Foucault's understanding of Descartes and his role in the exclusion of madness from the realm of reason. The second time—in his essay To Do Justice to Freud. Here Derrida disagrees with Foucault whether Freud managed to reestablish the body's communication with reason which Descartes destroyed.<br>

Author(s): Zablocki Charles F.<br>
Abstract: This article is about the influence of the work of the German sociologist Max Weber (1864-1920) on English-speaking anthropologists. Although Weber does not figure prominently in the history of anthropology, his work has, nonetheless, had a profound influence on anthropological methodology and theoretical thinking on the relationship between religion and political economy. The "interpretive anthropology" first developed by Geertz has roots in Weber's "interpretive sociology." Bourdieu's "theory of practice" is also strongly Weberian in character. The anthropological study of religion, and particularly the debate over the foundations of this field between Geertz and Asad, is reconsidered in light of Weber's sociology of religion. His comparative study of the ethics of the world's religions and particularly the "Weber thesis" about the relationship between religion and the development of bourgeois capitalism are shown to have been the foundation for a large body of anthropological research on religion and political economy in societies in which the major world religions have been long established. The essay ends with a suggestion that Weber's work on politics and meaning merits reexamination in light of contemporary anthropological interest, derived from Foucault, in power and knowledge.<br>

Abstract: This paper critiques the rise of scientific approaches to central questions in the humanities, specifically questions about human nature, ethics, identity, and experience. In particular, I look at how an increasing number of philosophers are turning to evolutionary psychology and neuroscience as sources of answers to philosophical problems. This approach constitutes what I term a biological turn in the humanities. I argue that the biological turn, especially its reliance on evolutionary psychology, is best understood as an epistemology of ignorance that contributes to a climate of hostility and intolerance regarding feminist insights about gender, identity, and the body.<br>

Abstract: Attention to bodies has transformed the study of religion in the past thirty years, aiding the effort to overcome the discipline's Protestant biases by shifting interest from beliefs to practices. And yet much of this work has unwittingly perpetuated an individualist notion of the religious subject. Although religionists are now well aware that bodies cannot be studied apart from the social forces that shape them, all too often the religious subject stands alone in a crowd, participating in communal rituals, subject to religious authorities and disciplinary practices, but oddly detached from intimate relationships. In this article, I first argue that the turn to the body was motivated by what it appeared to reject: theoretical questions about subjectivity. I then seek to challenge prevailing trends by arguing that these same theoretical insights should now prod us to attend to the import of intimacy and personal relationships.<br>

Abstract: The study of early Christian asceticism, which formerly focused strictly on ascetic practices, has been transformed in recent years. In addition to ascetic practices, scholars analyze the discourse of asceticism, which emphasizes the decentering of the self, the problematizing of the person's ability to govern the body and be considered righteous before God. Although this approach has pushed back the origins of ascetic discourses in Christianity, the decentering of the self can be observed in Qumran texts. In the present article this ascetic discourse of the decentered self is traced in other pre-Christian Jewish texts and in an unexpected context-novelistic texts. This approach allows for an exploration of literary, ritual, and ascetic aspects of the texts, and some consideration is given to the social context of these important developments.<br>

Abstract: This article analyzes the function of letter writing and epistolary correspondence in Gustavo Sainz's fiction, particularly Obsesivos días circulares (1969) and A la salud de la serpiente (1991). It contends that the personal letter emerges in these novels as a form of expression and communication that breaks with the models of individual and collective identity fostered and consolidated by the Mexican state during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In addition, epistolary writing responds to the political situation in post-Tlatelolco Mexico by contesting the temporal homogeneity needed to imagine the nation as a unitary social body progressing toward modernity. Epistolary writing thus opens the narrative text to competing, unresolved temporalities while at the same time unmooring individual subjectivity from the destinies of a repressive nation-state.<br>

Abstract: This paper reviews a body of data that identifies underlying influences that have contributed to an evolving change in American Psychiatry toward a more positive and receptive stance toward religion and spirituality over the past three decades. This development, surprising in light of the remedicalization of psychiatry and its predominantly neuro-biological orientation, is attributed to five foundational ideas that have helped to leverage this change. These are significance of culture, creative power of ritual, psychic function of belief, neuro-biology of spirituality, and relevance of recovery narratives. The impact of these factors for psychiatric assessment and treatment is described, as well as the contribution of the Oskar Pfister legacy and award to the ongoing dialogue between religion and psychiatry. Adapted from the American Psychiatric Association's 2011 Oskar Pfister Lecture in Religion and Psychiatry.<br>

Abstract: Contemporary poetry, since Rimbaud and Mallarmé, invests issues which used to be the preserve of rational philosophy, while philosophy since Nietzsche makes greater use of poetic expressivity. The convergence is towards the sensory focus of perception, rational thought, and expression, the body; but, except at the limits, philosophy establishes concepts, poetry speaks from within.<br>

Abstract: La tentative autobiographique de Jacques Derrida, portée par plusieurs de ses livres, paraît contredire toute une part de son élaboration philosophique qui, quant à elle, s'efforce de démontrer l'impossibilité de tenir un discours sur la vie et sur l'identité. D'où la nécessité, pour Derrida, de déplacer les coordonnées traditionnelles de la forme autobiographique. Nous proposons dans cet article de désigner comme hétérofiction la modification derridienne de la pratique du récit de soi. L'hétérofiction suppose une multiplicité de versions (il y a plusieurs récits de vie), une multiplicité de dictions (dans ces récits, le dire précède toujours le dit), une multiplicité d'énonciations (plusieurs voix sont requises pour porter ces récits), et enfin une multiplicité de confessions (chaque récit réserve la ressource d'un secret supplémentaire). Jacques Derrida's ventures into autobiography, as seen in a number of his books, seem to contradict a large body of his philosophical work, which, for its part, tries to demonstrate the impossibility of holding a discourse on life and identity. Thus the necessity for Derrida of displacing the usual parameters of the autobiographical genre. We will here use the term hétérofiction to designate Derrida's modification of the practice of self-narrative. Hétérofiction supposes a multiplicity of versions (there are a number of lifenarratives), a multiplicity of dictions (in the narratives, speech supplants content), a multiplicity of modes of enunciation (several voices are necessary to carry the narratives), and finally a multiplicity of confessions (each narrative keeps a supplementary secret back from the telling, as a resource).<br>

Abstract: S'appuyant sur un corpus de textes adolescents adressés au site Internet www.filsantejeunes.com, notre analyse tente de cerner le problème de l'indicibilité du sensible, puisque la plupart de ces textes se limitent à élaborer un discours sur le corps, ses difficultés à être la source de bien-être, à se conformer aux normes de beauté, et n'abordent pas le phénomène, l'expérience de perception du monde. La théorie des instances proposée par Jean-Claude Coquet permet de rendre compte de cette impossibilité de dire le sensible, laquelle serait due à une mise en tension conflictuelle des deux instances du non-sujet et du sujet. Ce conflit sans issue peut aboutir à des comportements de boulimie et/ou d'anorexie, aux conséquences graves pour la santé, voire la vie du sujet. La psychothérapie, dans ces cas-là, devrait viser une réconciliation des instances. Ces textes adolescents constituant des exemples d'écriture autobiographique, genre discursif très prisé à l'adolescence, permettent aussi de contribuer à l'analyse de la genèse de ce genre littéraire, où s'impose la reprise différée, par le sujet adulte voire vieillissant, d'expériences anciennes de l'instance non-sujet, expériences corporelles de prise directe avec le monde. This analysis, based on a corpus of texts by teenagers posted on www.filsantejeunes. com, tries to take the measure of the issue of the impossibility of expressing in language the experience of sensing the world -since most of these texts are content to limit themselves to elaborating discourses about the body, its difficulties at being a source of happiness, at conforming to norms of beauty, and do not deal with the phenomenon, namely the experience of perceiving the world. The theory of instances, or of the grounding of utterance, elaborated by Jean-Claude Coquet, can explain this impossibility of expressing in language the experience of sensing the world: it is due to a conflict between the two instances, the grounding in the subject or in the no~<br>

Abstract: En explicitant le concept linguistique de prédicat et en étendant sa portée, l'auteur introduit et définit celui de « prédicat somatique », responsable de l'expression du sensible dans le langage. Il en illustre la pertinence et en spécifie le contenu analytique à travers trois exemples. La reprise critique de l'analyse du « sein nu » dans Palomar d'I. Calvino par A. J. Greimas (dans De l'imperfection) permet de dégager les propriétés du « corps percevant ». L'analyse d'un énoncé de la mère de Jamel Debbouze dans Télérama fait ressortir l'expression corporelle d'une vérité « refoulée, proscrite, par le langage », un « ça » vrai, expression d'un non-sujet immanent. Enfin, la relation fondamentale entre « l'acte politique » et « le corps parlant » est dégagée à partir de positions exprimées par Jean-Claude Milner et ici analysées dans la perspective du « prédicat somatique », dont trois variétés se trouvent ainsi dégagées au terme de l'article. Developing and extending the validity of the linguistic concept of predicate, the author introduces and defines the notion of "somatic predicate", responsible for expressing in language the experience of the senses. Three examples both show the notion's pertinence and specify its content. A critical reappraisal of A. J. Greimas' analysis of the « naked breast » in Italo Calvino's Palomar (in De l'imperfection) leads to defining me characteristics of the « perceiving body ». The analysis of an utterance of Jamel Debbouze's mother in Télérama stresses the physical, bodily expression of a truth "repressed, prohibited, by language", a true "id", the expression of an immanent non-subject. Finally, the fundamental relation between the "political act" and the "speaking body" is shown through opinions expressed by Jean-Claude Milner which are here analysed from the perspective of a "somatic predicate", three varieties of which have thus been described and defined by the end of the article.<br>

Author(s): Wilson Henrik<br>
Abstract: A theory of the embodiment of action is proposed. Reflections on relations between human intentions, the human body and the notion of agency lead us to argue that phenomenological analysis is not sufficient for such a theory. Our consideration, that the most fundamental level of embodied agency is that of life itself, brings us to the philosophy of biology and the theory of the organism: briefly, certain parts of the natural environment are intrinsic to the constitution of organisms and, in their more sophisticated configuration, as agents. Action is embodied in the sense that certain physiological processes are internal in relation to it and play a constitutive role in its performance. The way in which environment, context and consciousness affect and constitute the nature of agency at personal and sub-personal levels is elaborated. We see that human agents perceive and act upon their world through a complex shifting between those levels. A summary of the ways in which the social sciences can be enriched by this more comprehensive view of human agency provides the basis of justification for claiming Actor-Network Theory (ANT), originally developed by sociologists studying science and technology, as a promising framework for the continuation of this reasoning.<br>

Author(s): Cyr Rachel E.<br>
Abstract: Commenting on the significance of his work at a mass grave in Vukovar, Croatia, 1993—1995, anthropologist Clyde Snow predicted that the application of forensic scientific methods in the documentation of mass atrocity would help prevent the future denial of atrocities. A couple of years later in nearby Kosovo, others would follow forensic scientific investigators only to report what they never saw or never found leading many commentators and tertiary witnesses to doubt that atrocities had occurred. As absence and lack arise against the backdrop of forensic discourse, we are called upon to weigh the stakes of negative evidence witnessing and its implications for cultural memory. This article contends that the semiotic and positional peculiarity of negative evidence in an era of forensic testimony has its analogue in the paschal figure of Jesus' empty tomb. Analyzing the rhetoric of denial that accompanied the forensic investigations of Kosovo in the late 1990s, the author suggests that the empty tomb is a paradigm that renders intelligible the interdiction implicitly placed on the forensic presencing of the body as well as the problematic with which memory is met in a world where forensic scientific testimony grows in importance.<br>

Abstract: In the twentieth century the phenomenon of the subjective body was integrated into ontology in philosophy, moving from Phenomenology to Existentialism. The rediscovery of the body and affect as a way of thinking also led contemporary cognitive science to the topic of the relationship between emotion and cognition, to the necessity of expanding the model of the mind and of experiencing emotions and physical sensation. The extension of the explanatory possibilities of a scholarly metalanguage into the area of the emotions and physical sensation is also important for the analysis of the acoustic aspect of lyric verse. In the acoustic flow of verse, the sounds of language have, apart from a phonemic function, their own sensuous (emotional) effect of the articulating body. In literary studies so far the acoustic flow has been interpreted only at the segmental level as a sequence of phonemes or sounds (for example in constructs of acoustic succession, phonetic instrumentation, or phonetic composition). At the suprasegmental level the acoustic flow must be conceived of as a sequence of syllables, a sequence of articulated phonations, the semantic movement of the phonemic flow. A syllable has no semantic value, but does have an experiential form, which influences motivation, behaviour, and experience. In addition to sonic and tonal modulation at the suprasegmental level, qualitative modulation, modulation of timbre, and the sequences of tones and of noise are also employed. In modelling the semantic movement of syllables in a phonemic flow the methodological approaches of experimental psychosemantics have been used. Connotational objectivization took place in three dimensions that were polarized on the basis of domestic and alien, light and darkness, activity and passivity, and research was conducted with a sample of 2,800 respondents. The analysis of the acoustic side of lyric verse would be incomplete if in addition to accentual rhythm and melody we did not also consider ~<br>

Abstract: Avec l'avènement récent des neurosciences cognitives, le problème corps-esprit passait du registre traditionnel de la réflexion philosophique au domaine factuel de l'investigation scientifique. Une possible réduction de la pensée à ses infrastructures cérébrales rencontre cependant des ècueils d'ordre épistémologique considérables. C'est dans l'aval de ces problèmes impliquant le nouveau dialogue des neurosciences avec les réalités cliniques que s'inscrit l'étude présentée. Dans ce contexte de discussion sont abordés les fondements théoriques des neurosciences contemporaines comme la mise en perspective des recherches sur le cerveau dans le discours actuel des sciences humaines. Tout en considérant l'importance heuristique des recherches conduites sur les instances neurocognitives et sur la matérialité tissulaire des intégrations psychophysiologiques, les travaux présentés tendent à montrer que les relations fonctionnelles tissées entre le cerveau et la pensée ne sauraient se déchiffrer sur la base théorique des seules herméneutiques réductives. Si le tissu nerveux implique dans ses vecteurs de causalité la manifestation potentielle de comportements adaptatifs progressivement plus complexes, le tissu cérébral n'implique pas directement dans ses virtualités fonctionnelles la manifestation de l'esprit. A cet égard, les travaux abordés soulignent au niveau de la réflexion critique comme sur le plan de l'analyse factuelle que l'émergence de la pensée n'enracine pas sa nécessité dans la complexité des connexions neuronales. Arguments et propos qui tendent à réviser les nouveaux paradigmes neurophilosophiques de la vie mentale intéressant le substantialisme de la conscience et la dimension logistique de l'esprit. Some metaphysical aspects concerned with the mind-body problem are approached in these theoretical studies involving the new neuronal materialism.

Abstract: In spite of the Reformed tradition's profound respect for the bible as the living Word of God, it has often tolerated an uncritical stance on cultural-historical biases both within the bible and during its history of interpretation. Consequently, dynamic processes of interpretation and reinterpretation within these documents have often been neglected as important hermeneutic keys for later audiences. Amidst many opportunities posed by postmodern thinking, and by voices from feminist, womanist and other contextual theologies, the Reformed tradition remains particularly challenged to account for its identity and ethos in terms of its primary theological orientation and God images. The essay aims at providing a possible theological-rhetorical path towards reopening the transformative potential of two texts that are life-inhibiting for many people today, namely 1 Cor 14:33-40 and Eph 5:21-6:9. Both are surrounded by references to the resurrection of Jesus Christ, with the implied rhetorical effect that the church may be edified and unified in love. However, through the history of interpretation of these texts, the functioning of the body of Christ was often inhibited while church leadership was distorted. The essay therefore centers biblical "authority" - as ultimate test for the relevance and lifegiving potential of the Reformed tradition - within the multidimensional (albeit patriarchal) nature of these texts, particularly within their soteriological perspectives on God and humanity. The theological framework of these texts is thus emphasised as a visionary strategy towards the liberation and healing of creation.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i396847<br>
Date: 10 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): MellonAbstract: This article considers some methodological issues that arise when empirical inquiry is conducted within the framework of qualitative assumptions about the nature of reality and how we as humans can know it. These assumptions posit an empirical reality that is complex, intertwined, best understood as a contextual whole, and inseparable from the individuals-including the researchers--who know that reality. Four primary issues are considered in this article: the researcher as interpreter; the emergent nature of qualitative research; understanding the experience of others; and trustworthiness in qualitative research. Further, the article discusses methodological practices that have arisen in the context of qualitative assumptions and issues. The practices described are drawn from diverse qualitative research traditions, including participant observation, naturalistic inquiry, grounded theory, hermeneutic approaches to the interpretation of texts (and actions as texts), qualitative evaluation, and a body of methodological literature that calls itself generically "qualitative research." The goals of the article are threefold: (1) to present the internal rationale of qualitative research as issues and practices that arise within the context of assumptions about reality and what we can know about it; (2) to encourage researchers to examine the relevance of qualitative assumptions, issues, and practices to their own research problems; and (3) to point readers toward more detailed discussions of qualitative research.<br>

Abstract: A ideia de máquina ultrapassa as suas concretizações materiais sugerindo um certo tipo de objetividade e autonomia, inerente ao funcionamento de sistemas como o Direito. A conceção do Direito como uma espécie de máquina jurídica é ambivalente, mostrando tanto a imparcialidade do Direito como as suas perversões anti-humanas. A relação entre mente e corpo é central no Direito da responsabilidade, sugerindo, porém, uma máquina humana em que a responsabilidade corresponde apenas a uma técnica de preservação de um sistema. A pessoa, todavia, não tem de ser reduzida a um algoritmo como diz Penrose. É a configuração do objeto do Direito que o reduz a um funcionamento limitado e incapaz de uma justiça criativa. A redefinição do objeto humano no Direito reclama um novo pensamento, associado aos conhecimentos não jurídicos sobre o comportamento humano. The idea of machine exceeds its material embodiments suggesting a certain kind of objectivity and autonomy inherent to the functioning of systems such as Law. The conception of Law as a kind of legal machine is ambivalent, showing both the impartiality of the law as their anti-human perversions. The relationship between mind and body is central to the law of responsibility, even though suggesting a human machine on which liability is merely a technique for preserving a system. The person, however, need not be reduced to an algorithm as Penrose says. It is the configuration of the object of knowledge as a system identical to a machine and the subjects of norms as human machines which reduces it to a limited and incapable of running a creative justice. The redefinition of the human object in Law calls for a new thinking, not necessary associated with the legal knowledge about human behavior.<br>

Abstract: Secondo S. Moravia, "il mind-body problem è, sotto molti aspetti, un problem piuttosto
goffo e poco attendibile", che oggi non regge più, "perché ... l'uomo non è più interpretabile come
homo duplex; perché un ente come 'la mente' naturalmente non esiste; perché lo stesso corpo è un
concetto estremamente generico e anch'esso per tanti versi derivante da una metafìsica irreversi-

Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>

Author(s): Hanich Julian<br>
Abstract: In this article I suggest that we, as human beings, gain personal recognition not only through intersubjective encounters with others, but also through aesthetic experience. To support my claims about what I call 'aesthetic recognition,' I focus on a pervasive but rarely explored phenomenon: the cinematic shock. Not only a staple ingredient of thrillers, horror films, and disaster movies, it is also found in art-films. The cinematic shock will serve as the case in point of my argument because in its lived intensity, density, and conspicuousness we can describe it more easily with appropriate words than other aesthetic experiences that are equally able to foster aesthetic recognition but are less readily accessible via language. When experienced in the social environment of the movie theater, cinematic shocks enable two widespread types of aesthetic recognition: aesthetic experience as individual self-recognition, and aesthetic experience as a collective recognition of accord. Due to the strongly affective lived-body experience brought about by an encounter with the aesthetic object, the recipient not only feels self-aware of and self-affirmed in his or her own embodied existence, he or she also experiences confirmation as part of a group responding equally—in accordance—to an aesthetic object. This double recognition gained from the cinematic experience of shock derives from the individual film experience and the collective theatrical experience. An additional outcome of my methodological reliance on dense phenomenological descriptions may be an argument for the value of phenomenology in both the study of film and of aesthetics more generally.<br>

Abstract: Neste ensaio, entrelaço fios de vidas das mulheres negras que estáo atadas óï fio da minha vida. Com os fios soltos das canções de Zezé Motta e dos escritos da filósofa Hannah Arendt, teço este texto-existência. Na leitura dos ensaios e poemas de Marlene Nourbese Philip, escritora afro-caribenha, me inspiro não só para resistir às amarras culturais hegemônicas, mas também para transcendê-las, criando possibilidades de escrita que vincule a dinâmica da fala com a dinámica da ocóo, compondo um texto que se movimenta ora como dança, através do espaço, ora como urna canção, ritmada pelo tempo, pois criar e dançar uma coreografia é uma forma de fazer historia. Como investiga Selma Treviños, trata-se de urna ferramenta para animar o passado ou uma "escrita" acerca de algo que já foi feito, se concordamos que cada corpo carrega sua pròpria história e individualidade, memòria, sentimentos e emoções. Na busca do entendimento desta minha breve existência, danço, escrevo, teço palavras com fios desfiados da flor do útero das minhas ancestrais. Vasculho minhas lembranças e, na memória corporal, decifro a dor, encontró a raiz da violência, observo o medo, destilo a alegría, enfeito a doçura, mergulho na paz e conheço a liberdade. In that essay I interweave threads of the black women's lives that are tied to the thread of my life. With the free threads of Zezé Motta's songs and of philosopher Hannah Arendfs writings, I weave this text-existence. In the reading of the essay and poems of Marlene NourbeSe Philip, writer Afro-Caribbean, I am inspired not only to resist the hegemonic cultural ties, but also transcend them, creating possibilities of writing that links the dynamics of the speech with the dynamics of the action, to compose a text that is moved some times as a dance through the space, other times as a song, with its rhythm determinedby time, because creating and dancing a choreography is a form of making history. As investigates Selma Treviños it is a tool to encourage th~<br>

In the context of Hawthorne's life, these stories show his foresighted theorizing of medical hegemony and its dangers to public and individual health.<br>

Issue: i40170775<br>

Author(s): Beauchamp Paul<br>
Abstract: Avec quelques ouvertures nouvelles en direction des sciences humaines, et dans la ligne d'ouvrages publiés par l'auteur, surtout L'Un et l'Autre Testament, vol. 1 (1977), vol. 2 (1990) et Le Récit, la Lettre et le Corps (1982), l'accomplissement des Écritures, comme plénitude de l'acte du Christ, est proposé comme fondation d'une théologie, qui ne peut pas ne pas être biblique. Le chemin consiste à chercher la vérité anthropologique de l'accomplissement dans les dimensions humaines de la Parole et du Corps, vécues dans l'échange narratif. Le lieu de cet échange est la figure des noces à ses niveaux divers de réalisation, individuelle, sociale, historique. With some new pointers taken from anthropology and prolonging the inspiration of works previously published by the author (in particular: L'Un el l'Autre Testament, vol. 1, 1977; vol. 2, 1990 and Le Récit, la Lettre et le Corps, 1982), we here find the proposition that the fulfilment of Scriptures, inasmuch as it is the culminating point of the work of Christ, could be the basis for a genuinely and unescapably biblical theology. The method consists in searching for the human anthenticity of fulfilment in the anthropological dimension of Speech and Body understood as life through tales exchanged. The crucial point of that exchange is marriage symbolism on its different levels of experience: personal, social and historical.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur se donne pour but de montrer en quoi les philosophies existentialistes rappellent à la foi chrétienne les questions décisives auxquelles elle doit sans cesse se confronter. Il le fait en partant de thèmes concrets traités par les existentialistes de manière à interpeller la foi de manière radicale: les enjeux de la liberté, l'incarnation de l'être humain dans un corps et une histoire, et les difficultés de la communication avec autrui. Par là même l'existentialisme est à même de «nettoyerc» la foi chrétienne. The writer shows existentialist philosophies reminding the Christian faith of decisive questions it must continually ask itself. On the basis of such concrete themes treated by existentialists, he questions the faith in a radical way concerning the stakes of freedom, the incarnation of humankind in a body and in history, and the difficulties of interpersonal communication. Existentialism is thus in a position to «cleanse» the Christian faith.<br>

Issue: i40182176<br>

Author(s): Michel Beat<br>
Abstract: L'œuvre de Michel Henry aura été de «recueillir» et développer le côté affectif de la phénoménologie, que Husserl, dans un passage clé de ses Idées directrices, a délaissé au profit du côté intentionnel de la subjectivité — tout comme trois siècles plus tôt Descartes avait «recueilli» la subjectivité écartée par Galilée. Le texte qui suit compare le concept de soubassement, ou âme, chez Husserl avec celui de chair chez Michel Henry. On verra que les deux philosophes parlent d'une couche sensible, qu'on peut d'une certaine manière situer entre corps et esprit, de deux points de vue diamétralement opposés. Au-delà de l'opposition entre les deux philosophies, cette recherche mène à une interprétation topologique du rapport entre corps, âme et esprit, tel que suggéré par le terme husserlien de soubassement, et propose un éclairage différent de la notion henryenne d'auto-affection. Michel Henry's objective was to "pick up" and develop the emotional side of phenomenology, which Husserl, in a key passage in Ideas, left aside in favour of the intentional side of subjectivity — just as Descartes, three centuries earlier, "picked up" subjectivity left aside by Galileo. In this article, we compare the concept of the sub-basement, or soul, for Husserl, with that of the body for Michel Henry. We will see that both philosophers speak of a sensitive layer that can be situated in a certain manner between body and spirit, from two diametrically opposite points of view. Beyond the opposition of the two philosophies, this research leads to a topological interpretation of the relation between body, soul and spirit, as suggested by Husserl's term sub-basement, and proposes a different light on Henry's notion of self-affection.<br>

Abstract: Metaphor, Vibration and Form identifies a process that underlies all ritual enactments. Whether it is Joseph Campbell's analysis of the Hero's journey, Victor Turner's theoretical and experiential interest in symbols, or Charles Laughlin's cycle of meaning, there is at work a particular kind of behavioral transformation system. It begins with the mind and the meanings provided metaphorically for symbols, then proceeds to an intense focus on symbolic sequences in meditation or in ritual dramas, so that the metaphor is taken into the body as physical experience. From this physical "ownership" of the metaphor, the properties associated with it are encouraged, socially and ritually, to come to the surface and be enacted in the form of everyday behavior. Questions of symbolic appropriation, the redundancy of symbol, and professional responsibility are addressed in the concluding remarks.<br>

Abstract: Les analyses de Hannah Arendt et de Alain Finkielkraut démontrent clairement la nécessité et l'urgence d'une réflexion sur la signification politique de la pensée. L'humanité cesse d'être humaine dès lors qu'il n'y a plus de place pour la figure de l'ennemi : elle est multiple et pluriellement pensante. Ainsi la discorde est-elle le bien politique le plus précieux. Alors que la fraternité sentimentale et manichéenne masque le totalitarisme et la violence, la solidarité, elle, fait signe vers l'unité à travers le multiple : elle constitue un espace à plusieurs voix. Le Christ n'a-t-il pas demandé l'amour des ennemis? The analyses made by Hannah Arendt and Alain Finkielkraut show clearly the necessity, and indeed the urgency, of reflecting on the political significance of one's personal morality. Humanity ceases to be human when it decrees that there is no longer any room in the world for whomever may be its enemy; a body of persons tends to think collectively in this way. Thus it turns out that of all political stock-in-trade, discord becomes the most precious item. Good-versus-evil brainwashing, and calls for brotherhood on one's own side of a conflict, are used to mask totalitarianism and violence, but universal solidarity includes everyone and implies universal concord. Did Christ not entreat us to love our enemies?<br>

Author(s): Weiss Paul<br>
Abstract: This paper seeks to contribute to the growing body of literature on interpretive policy inquiry. As such, its specific focus is the presentation of the interpretive approach as a corrective for the shortcomings inherent in the standard view. Following an outline of the problems facing the received view, a systematic, philosophically grounded, statement of the interpretive position is developed. Thereafter, the tangible positive consequences for policy making of this approach are further discussed. The paper concludes with some reflections on the relationship between the positivistic and interpretive paradigms.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i413081<br>
Date: 3 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Zelinsky Jonathan M.<br>
Abstract: Concepts of place, narrative, tradition, and identity are employed in a conservative reading of the Texas A&M Bonfire. Texas A&M embodied regional narratives of a dual Southern commitment to economic and technological development and conservation of traditional cultural. Institutionalized at Texas A&M in the late nineteenth century, these narratives made a paradoxical place. Bonfire expressed and obscured this paradox. In line with the narrative of tradition, Texas A&M was an all-male military school until 1965. The students were uniform, isolated, and regimented. This social structure engendered intense feelings of loyalty and community. These social emotions were further aroused at events like yell practice, and projected onto Bonfire. After the Second World War the commitment of university administrators to economic and technological progress increasingly threatened the narrative of tradition and the cultivation of manliness. Student veneration of Bonfire intensified. After 1965 mandatory military drill was discontinued, women were enrolled, and the student body was enlarged. Social pluralism fragmented the meaning of Bonfire; conflict and disorderly behavior ensued. By the 1990s the university had partly rationalized Bonfire as a corporate symbol; however, this trend was tragically terminated in 1999 when the cumulative errors of the oral tradition caused Bonfire to collapse, killing twelve students.<br>

Issue: i219810<br>

Author(s): Ward Glenn<br>
Abstract: The conceptual dominance of the "heterosexual" in modern thinking has conditioned us, when we consider the Canterbury Tales, to think about the Pardoner and his audience in essentialist terms. The Pardoner and the Host's kiss, however, stills and defers attempts by the masculine gaze of Harry and the "redeemed" pilgrims to control what the Pardoner means. By returning meaning to circulation, the kiss provides an instance in which the Pardoner's body can do more than simply deconstruct categories or gesture elsewhere for meaning. Offering an alternative view of the Pardoner's supposed "destructive otherness," this essay suggests that his true import lies not in his alterity but in his similarity to the other pilgrims and ultimately to us as readers-in short, that the Pardoner constitutes the "open secret" of the Canterbury project.<br>

Abstract: Using a form of narrative analysis, I explore how marriage in contemporary China influences people's identity formation as "men with disabilities." In particular, I examine how local practices of marriage exclusion shape the definition, marginalization, and experience of men who have trouble walking. This discussion is more phenomenological than most previous accounts of men's experiences of marriage in Chinese Society. [marriage, disability, identity, body, manhood, narrative, China]<br>

Abstract: Jurisprudence traditionally approaches the law as an external object; the jurisprudential scholar generally seeks to describe legal doctrine in terms of its objective and observable properties. Professor Balkin argues that seemingly fixed, inherent characteristics of legal doctrine-most notably, whether or not a given body of law is "coherent" or possesses "integrity"-are better understood as projections from the individual observer. Judgments about legal coherence are in reality the result of only one of many interpretive postures an observer might take, but one that implicates the integrity of the observer's own world view. Furthermore, this process of interpretation does not leave the observer untouched, for the process of interpretation itself constructs the observer.<br>

Abstract: David Jenkins persistently recommended that in reading the Bible the reader has always to ask ‘How did people think then which led them to put it like that?’ He provided the following as an example. The writers of the gospels lived at a time when demon possession was the available conceptuality if a person fell to the ground writhing and foaming at the mouth. In the Middle Ages, the conceptuality within which explanation arose was that of the humours of the body and the cure would have been blood-letting. In medicalized 21st century conceptuality, it would be said that the person was having an epileptic fit and the needed response is to keep calm and re-assure.<br>

Abstract: This study presents an interpretation of the configuration of the poetic subject in the books of poems El Primer Libro (1985) and Albricia (1988) by Soledad Fariña (1943), which understand a self in a continuous process of gestation and birth. This process serves the purpose of recomposing a disarticulated subjectivity lost in the framework of the political and cultural conditions imposed by the military dictatorship that ruled Chile in the 1970s and 1980s. By using a metaphor of a journey and searching for a new language, the subject attempts to access a primitive stage andfind its maternal self in order to confront the dominant power, by codifying and configuring herself through an otherness in a feminine body-text. However, this process of maturation and discovery is intervened and left incomplete by the impulse of modernity, thereby creating a deformed, dissociated and off-centered self, which aims at growing opposed to logos. This conflict turns the upcoming of the new self into a painful event, like giving birth, that stems from the subject's wounded and fractured body, intending to re-establish de selffrom its fragments, traces and memories.<br>

Abstract: Abstract. This paper demonstrates the sorts of questions that arise for sociologically informed disability studies scholarship in the midst of the interactional scenes of access struggles in an educational workplace environment. From my experiences in the third largest building of a large Canadian university, I have recollected ordinary talk that justifies the exclusion of disabled people and have pieced together narratives representing things-possible-to-say-today about accessibility struggles. By using an interpretive sociological approach, this paper explores how meanings of disability are generated through talk that justifies the exclusive shape and inaccessible structures of university life. I demonstrate that access is not a synonym for justice but is a beginning place for critical questioning where social relations between body and space can be thought anew. This paper adds to sociologically informed disability studies scholarship by analyzing how the ordinary everyday narration of disability acts as a social power reproducing the status-quo even as the material environment changes.<br>

Abstract: Recent scholarship has given considerable attention to lyric poetry as a form of sensuous knowledge. This approach emphasizes the corporeal origins of poetry, its genesis in the body or in language viewed as material. The question of sensuous knowledge is central to the larger theoretical issue of modernity itself, in which lyric holds a central yet ambiguous status. The question of sensuous knowledge is ultimately a question of meaning. However, modern thought — thought pertaining to “modernity” — is fundamentally circular. This would seem to establish an epistemological impasse for aesthetics. But I argue that this circularity offers an important, and necessary, way to limit knowledge and thereby ground an ethical subjectivity. My essay places formalism at the heart of sensuous knowledge. In this essay I develop an account of the importance of abstraction in sensuous knowledge by way of Kant's concept of
         Darstellung, “presentation [of sensory experience].” The “presentation” is the object as it has undergone a structural process of internalization and been made available for psychic use as meaning; that requires a recognition of loss. Where this is important for literature is that twentieth-century American poetry frequently uses very personal images of family life as a way of conveying sincerity about corporeal experience. I use this discussion of circularity in modern aesthetic thought to argue that there is a risk to taking shortcuts to meaning through images of the material bodies of children. In these contemporary poems by Gary Snyder, Sharon Olds and Rita Dove, the poets reject loss in favor of a very modern “affirmation” of the material. But affirmation and the visual image as a sign of affirmation cannot alone bind meaning to us. That meaning must be internalized through theworkof poetic presentation.<br>

Abstract: Yet the very title of the collection and its constituent poems,
      Sonnagrams, echoes the name of an obstetric ultrasound procedure that sends sound waves through the body, suggesting a sounding or reverberation that recurs to (imminent) birth as a trope for poetic making. In a sonogram, the length of time that an echo takes to return measures the depth of the body's tissue, which causes interference for the echo. In this vividly corporeal portrayal of poiesis, an alternative to the aggression of cannibalism, the poet turns an ear to his or her predecessors and their echoes filter through the poet's body, leaving the realm of sound to begin to form images.<br>

Abstract: Abiku children are given marks on their faces or other visible parts of the body so that when they are born again, those marks will reveal them for who they are: deceivers, spirit children. Some of the children, now having been discovered and shamed, decide to stay in the land of the living. Some, nevertheless still return to the “spirit world” because of their stronger binding pacts with other children there (Maduka, 18). The Grebo (Jabbeh Wesley's ethnicity), believe, as do most West African cultures, that such spirit children exist. In these cultures, children are given similar names. Dekuah in Grebo can be broken down as De “come,” Kuah, “to die.” A child who has come to die. Other names associated with the Dekuah (Abiku) phenomenon are Mudi, “Go Back”; Sejlah, “We Don't Want You”; Kude, “The Devil's Mother,” and so on.<br>

Abstract: Questions like this have shaped much of my own work. Being surrounded by so many enthusiastic but incompatibly articulate spokespersons for neglected lifeworld concerns, I concluded that criticism of tradition is most powerful when offered by those who are already in the midst of trying to be better phenomenologists—not, of course, in the sense that they are trying to be better members of a philosophical school but in the sense that they are motivated by the urge to find better ways to articulate something that tradition distorts or neglects. Why
      shouldaccounts of what matters most in life first be measured against the standards of “clear and distinct” propositional speech? Does anyone reallylive though life, thinking of it as a process going on inside our bodies? Do we reallyexperiencefreedom as an unconceptualizable combination of limitlessness and limit? And why throw the metaphorical wet blanket of a rigorously trained consciousness and its “correlates” over thepretheoretical practices of everyday life? Negative genuflections to philosophy's traditional priorities, privileging the subjective instead of the objective, inner instead of outer, lived body instead of house-for-the-mind—all of these inversions ultimately foster the continuing and undeserved hegemony of a traditionally objectivist understanding of what is Really Real. Kockelmans once told me that Merleau-Ponty eventually decidedPhenomenology of Perception“was not yet a philosophical book.” To be sure, its content and much of its treatment of that content is phenomenological, but its structure is still Cartesian. To start with specificallybodilyperception, however generously reconceived, still implies that other dimensions of presence to the world—linguistic, social, cultural, political, historical—can be added on at a later time, perhaps along with discussions of abstractly identified and timeless “topics” like freedom, the self, and so on.<br>

Abstract: Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts contended that the state adequately proved that the second paralyzing injection “serves two purposes: (1) preventing involuntary convulsions or seizures during unconsciousness, thereby preserving the procedure's dignity, and (2) hastening death” (
      Baze v. Rees, 553 U.S. 35 [2008]). Yet the preservation of dignity and quick death can be ensured only if the body is made to look dead before it actually is. Moreover, the dignity in death demanded by the Court takes us back to Kant's insistence that the death penalty is necessary in principle but must be practiced in a way that preserves the condemned person's dignity.<br>

            qua res cogitans) is always thinking. But for Brentano deep dreamless sleep means that the self/I becomes absent, and so we must not simply equate the psychic substance (traditionally called “soul”) with the self-aware I or the subject. In this respect, Brentano would not follow Bolzano, for whom it would be inappropriate to say, “I have a soul,” because for Bolzano “soul” means the first-person referent of “I,” whichhasits acts, body, brain, and so on.
                  Yet Brentano's claim that there is self-awareness by the I-substance rounds out his own view of self-awareness as a “knowing [7
               Bekenntnis] which relates itself to that which has the knowing.” And such aKenntnis“is an accident and each which has the knowledge is a substance.”
                  Yet there is no necessary connection between the substance of “I” or “self” and the accident of self-awareness. We will return to this.8<br>

Abstract: There are perceptible changes in the orientation of SPEP papers in the 1960s. The eleven papers from the first two programs that James Edie edited and published in 1965 range within the phenomenological/existential area from issues of perception, lifeworld, and Husserlian horizons to authentic existence, solitude, and avoidance of the void.
         
               The next three meetings broadened the range of topics considerably by featuring papers that connected phenomenology to artificial intelligence, natural science, linguistics, schizophrenia, body image, social roles, tragedy, the experience of the holy, Hume, Kant, and Wittgenstein. A new person in the European scene, Jacques Derrida, was invited to the fifth conference, but he was unable to attend (he sent a mimeographed copy of his paper that was available in French for those at the conference who might wish to read it).1<br>

Article Title: Ethics and Religion in Continental Philosophy<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: In my own opinion the most interesting expression of the religious turn in Continental philosophy is found in Derrida because Derrida is by anyone's standards a secular thinker and even, by the standards of the local pastor or rabbi, an atheist. So it came as a shock to read about Derrida's “religion” in his famous “Circumfession” (1989), which is a deconstructive riff on Augustine's
            Confessionsin which Derrida restages the scene of theConfessions. We come upon a scene in which the speaker (Augustine/Jackie), an emigrant from North Africa to the Big Apple (Rome/Paris), has his back to us and is praying to someone (te, God/tu), while his mother (Monica/Georgette) lies dying on the northern shore of the Mediterranean (Ostia/Nice). Derrida tells us that he has been praying all his life and that no one, not even his mother, has understood this, which has led to a misunderstanding of his work.
                  But to whom is Derrida praying, and how could he be praying at all? Does he not “rightly pass for an atheist”?20
               
                  There is a more obscure sense of religion “without religion” in Derrida, and a prayer to a God not only unknown but nonexistent that nonetheless constitutes a genuine prayer. If, as Jean-Louis Chrétien says, himself one of the new religious phenomenologists,21
               prayeris a “wounded word,” what word is more wounded than a word from one who does not know to whom he is praying (a lost letter, destination unknown), or if anyone is there to hear his prayers, or if he is praying at all, who has to pray to be able to pray at all, for something, he knows not what, something “coming,” the coming or incoming (invention) of something unforeseeable?
                  Derrida's atheism is crucially important to his religion because it allows him to isolate the very structure of prayer, and hence of the religious posture, with or without what we in the great monotheisms call “God,” thereby putting into questi~<br>

Abstract: The account of the aspect in Husserlian phenomenology is well known. With his theory of adumbrations, Husserl described how the perceived object is given in a one-sided, partial manner. The perception of its actual profile or aspect is given against the horizon of a set of potential perceptions of its other sides. Together these actual and potential perceptions are unified to form the sense of the thing that is perceived. For Deleuze, though, Husserl's account operates on the level of aftereffects because it does not ever consider the genesis or coming into being of the aspect itself. It is this event—the genesis of the aspect as such—that Deleuze's work brings to the fore. The Deleuzian aspect is separated from every figure and context. Think of it as being like the smile of the Cheshire Cat, which wanders away from the cat's body. This is not simply an imaginary or hallucinatory appearance; instead it indicates the genesis of a sensation prior to the work of figuration or its placement within a context. Every figure or form is a secondary coagulation or solidification of this primary sensation. To the extent that the aspect disarticulates itself from every position or background field, it can rightly be called an in-visible. This is how a minimal phenomenology approaches the invisible. That is, it approaches this minimal threshold of sense—the threshold that gives rise to sensation and conscious experience.<br>

Abstract: Mimesis
         2constitutes what Ricoeur calls the “pivot” of his analysis inTime and Narrative. By describing mimesis2in this way, Ricoeur emphasizes its mediating function: in order for a narrative prefigured in mimesis1to be refigured by a reader in mimesis3, it must undergo a kind of alchemy that recuperates the same old stories of public opinion into potentially new stories about the possibilities of future action. In order to generate such possibilities—to enter the “kingdom of theas if,” as Ricoeur puts it—a narrative must be configured for optimal translation. This configuration phase features an “interplay of innovation and sedimentation” that ensures that the resulting narrative will not simply be a reproduction of the culture in which it was constructed but rather a singular work that presents resources for future action, whether literary or political (1984, 1:64–69). If the prefiguration of mimesis1highlights the similarities among historical narratives shaped by the same cultural context and historical subject, then the configuration of mimesis2highlights the remarkable variety within this same body of texts. Or, to focus on the significant agent, mimesis1prefigures the field of action in which the historical agent exists, whereas mimesis2features the configuring choices, self-conscious and otherwise, of the agent who writes, revises, or otherwise re-presents history.<br>

Abstract: Other contributors set out to explore the playwright's more expansive visions of health and the interconnection of corporeal and spiritual wellness. “I also expect a doctor to be an evolutionist,” Shaw wrote in
      Doctors' Delusions, and referred anyone for whom his views on medical practitioners were unclear to “read the preface to [his]Back to Methuselahuntil itisclear.”
            Taking such a cue in a slightly different direction with “An Imperfect Butlerite: Aging and Embodiment in28
         Back to Methuselah,” Glenn Clifton provides an overview of the playwright's understanding of the body within the larger context of evolution, set against the backdrop of Samuel Butler's and Henri Bergson's notions on both topics. Doing so enables him to track the body's vexed abjection through the entire cycle, arguing that Shaw's asomatous fantasizing is both apprehensive about mortality and ethically humane.<br>

Author(s): Einsohn Howard Ira<br>
Abstract: In the face of this chilling assessment, Shaw reached the only conclusion that made logical sense to him: life's invincibility, the core of Lilith's claim, “heralds a victory for evolution that is fully compatible with a defeat for mankind.”
         
               However distressing it may be to contemplate in the abstract, the conjunction of evolution's victory and mankind's defeat comported perfectly with his tragic consciousness. Beneath the antic pose he often presented sardonically to an all-too-credulous public, Shaw harbored the corrosive awareness that we mortals may never be able to synthesize the dualities that inescapably circumscribe the human condition—thought and deed, wisdom and power, body and spirit—in a way that both ensures the survival of the race and enhances the plight of the downtrodden. For Shaw, at his nadir, the issue was not that we lack individuals with the requisite qualities to meet developmental imperatives. We do not; the Life Force fills this need, everlastingly. Of more concern to him was the inescapable fact that gifted visionaries never seem to gain sufficient traction to alter the downward spiral of events decisively, once and for all. Either they are ignored altogether by an otherwise engaged multitude or the presiding authorities devise ever more diabolical means of neutering them or their accomplishments. Winter, spring, summer, or fall, they are always unwelcome.24
            
               As time marched on, the marriage of contraries Shaw longed to effect seemed less and less achievable, and this growing anxiety was reflected not just in his plays but in his prose writings as well. Bleakness enveloped him at every turn, with no reprieve in sight. In his considered judgment, if humankind was a hair's breadth away from dissolution, and this certainly seemed to be the case in his eyes, it is because we are our own worst enemy. If the species is irretrievably lost, Shaw concludes, we have no one to blame but ourselves. Fr~<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Rhetoric, like utopian studies, is a discipline with perpetual disagreement over the basic definition of its subject. Rhetoric has been explored both as a body of theories on how to influence people through spoken or written language and as a practice or
         techneof eloquence and power in communication. Some scholars define rhetoric as the systematic art of inducing belief (James Murphy, Erika Lindeman); some, as a constitutive process of cultural formation (Marc Fumaroli, Paulo Valensio). There are modern rhetoricians who focus almost exclusively on language used in particular situations (Kenneth Burke, Lloyd Bitzer), while others expand the scope of rhetoric beyond language to any symbolic media (Sonja and Karen Foss, Charles Bazerman). This essay proceeds with the traditional assumption that rhetoric means nothing if it claims to be everything. In this vein, rhetoric is not synonymous with all communication. It is a mental and symbolic art with an aim of persuasion or, more broadly, identification with an audience so that it might be predisposed over time to act in certain ways. This is a postmodern point of view that borrows freely, but not exclusively, from classical rhetorical theories and is influenced strongly by the work of Kenneth Burke.<br>

Abstract: The nation is a shifting concept, an ideological construct, a master signifier whose function is to maintain or to bring into being its own referent. “A nation is the same people living in the same place,” says Leopold Bloom—“or also living in different places.”
         
               In these terms a nation is the historical alibi for the incoherence of geography: it is the invention of an identity and a rationale for a place or population without a predetermined identity or rationale. The nation of the epic is as such the diametric opposite of the Utopian space, a dreamscape that invokes a radical rationalization of the body politic5
            withoutactual people or place. Utopianism's mythic delineations reveal historical nationhood's own lack of definability and suggest that such teleological definition may be incompatible with historical materiality. If, after all, Utopianism is a manifesto, then it is one of the imagination, one without contemporary or coterminous manifestation. Utopianism exposes the indeterminacy of nationhood, an immanent uncertainty that echoes the theories of Werner Heisenberg or, for that matter, of James Joyce. In the work of James Joyce, that avatar of ambiguity, we find, as Wicht writes, that “national identity is created by the discriminating reinterpretation and refashioning of selected historical data and cultural discourses”
               —nationhood is not an absolute but a fluid and culturally subjective mode of positioning.6<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: And yet, a partial resolution resides in the shared condition of all of us having grown up in cultures where the denotative and connotative codes of architecture are learned through the body—even if often repressed on account of some obsession with novelty, perhaps, or because the built environment has become increasingly impoverished during the past century or more—and Utopia arguably describes something unique about human longing and desire, for a better way of being and sociability alike, achieved within settings suited to such accomplishment. Put as succinctly as possible: Utopia and architecture are pervasive, contributing in equal measure to the very fabric out of which individual and collective lives are made. If this claim were to be believed, then I would invite readers to consider the articles that make up this special issue on the problematic of architecture and Utopia as attempts to recover (or recuperate) Utopia for architecture and as attempts to resituate architecture and the city at the center of utopian considerations.<br>

Abstract: Culture apprentices the body to its style. Gestures are the visible and kinaesthetic trace of that apprenticeship. They are specific to bodies, families, age grades, ethnic groups, social orders, and historical moments. They are folklore. The gestures I consider here are affiliated with talk. They conjure up in the gesture space in front of the body the iconic and metaphoric objects that talk mentions. In a gesture, Maurice Merleau-Ponty writes, "the intentional object is offered to the spectator at the same time as the gesture itself” ([1962] 1995:186). The gesturer's intentionality colonizes the spectator's, making it intersubjective: phenomenology's foundational perspective.<br>

Publisher: SF-TH Inc.<br>
Issue: sciefictstud.38.issue-1<br>
Date: 3 1, 2011<br>
Abstract: Characterizing the slipstream genre, Bruce Sterling locates it between mainstream and science fiction; it “sets its face against consensus reality” and makes us feel “very strange.” A strong slipstream candidate is Steven Hall’s
         The Raw Shark Texts(2007). Manifesting as a distributed literary system, the text has as its core a print novel, but other internet and real world sites also contain fragments or “negatives.” One of the text’s two villains, Mycroft Ward, has transformed into an online database; a posthuman subjectivity, he appropriates “node bodies” that upload their information and download new instructions. This separation of content (online database) from form (node body) is, according to Alan Liu, one of the primary characteristics of postindustrial knowledge work. To this extent, Hall positions his narrative not only against databases but also against knowledge that is, in Liu’s terms, autonomously mobile, transformable, and automated, having lost its material instantiation and been pulverized into atomized bits of information. The text’s second villain—a “conceptual shark,” the Ludovician—represents the complete fusion of form and content; the typographical symbols used to describe the shark also comprise its flesh in verbal and graphic representations. The text thus positions its protagonist, Eric Sanderson, as caught between twenty-first-century forms of knowledge and the implosion of signifier into signified. In this sense, the novel functions as a parable for the contemporary human condition, looking toward a posthuman future but incarnated within an ancient biological heritage.<br>

Abstract: R.A. Lafferty's reputation for rollicking humor and poetic verve, as demonstrated in such stories as “Narrow Valley” (1966) and “Slow Tuesday Night” (1965) belies the considerable theoretical and narratological complexity of his entire body of work. This article draws on the vocabulary developed by Paul Ricoeur in
         Interpretation Theory(1966) andTime and Narrative(1983–85) to explore Lafferty's process of world creation in light of his startling 1979 announcement that the cognitive world of humanity had come to an end. Thus, in this post-conscious state, it was left to science fiction to develop potential replacements. In his writings Lafferty seeks not only to project new worlds but also to reconstruct the world-building capacity in others, enabling readers and writers alike to collaborate toward a future for humanity.<br>

Abstract: In contemporary Western culture, death is often made separate from life. The dying body is rendered invisible, even though sociocultural performances of death foreshadow and signify death and dying. This article challenges this signifying by arguing that death and dying are constituted performatively through the inscriptive surfaces of living, dying, and dead bodies, rendered visible by breath and breathing. The article begins by reflecting on the experience of witnessing the author's mentor's dying breath. Thinking through the dying breath, it then questions to what extent the separation of death from life is maintained by what is unspoken of the dying and dead body. Finally, the article considers the analytical implications of the argument for those who remain behind to grieve for, and remember, the dying bodies, and those to whom those bodies once belonged<br>
