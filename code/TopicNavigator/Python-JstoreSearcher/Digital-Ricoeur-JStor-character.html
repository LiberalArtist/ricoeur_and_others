  Securing a Vibrant Democracy from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt16wd0hf">Invoking the Invisible Hand</a><br>
  Abstract: FDR understood the dynamics of politics and public policy. Defending the dedicated financing of Social Security, he recounted that “we put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and their unemployment benefits. With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program.”¹ And he was right. Dedicated financing distinguished Old-Age Insurance from most other social policies and provided the program with a compelling basis for support. Old-Age Insurance ostensibly operated independently, and its conspicuous character enabled Americans to develop a proprietary view<br>

  Book Title: Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy-The Living Art of Michael C. Leff<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Henry David<br>
  Abstract: What distinguishes the study of rhetoric from other pursuits in the liberal arts? From what realms of human existence and expression, of human history, does such study draw its defining character? What, in the end, should be the purposes of rhetorical inquiry? And amid so many competing accounts of discourse, power, and judgment in the contemporary world, how might scholars achieve these purposes through the attitudes and strategies that animate their work?
      Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy: The Living Art of Michael C. Leffoffers answers to these questions by introducing the central insights of one of the most innovative and prolific rhetoricians of the twentieth century, Michael C. Leff. This volume charts Leff 's decades-long development as a scholar, revealing both the variety of topics and the approach that marked his oeuvre, as well as his long-standing critique of the disciplinary assumptions of classical, Hellenistic, renaissance, modern, and postmodern rhetoric.Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy includes a synoptic introduction to the evolution of Leff 's thought from his time as a graduate student in the late 1960s to his death in 2010, as well as specific commentary on twenty-four of his most illuminating essays and lectures.<br>

  Book Title: The Thought of Music-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Kramer Lawrence<br>
  Abstract: What, exactly, is knowledge of music? And what does it tell us about humanistic knowledge in general?
      The Thought of Musicgrapples directly with these fundamental questions-questions especially compelling at a time when humanistic knowledge is enmeshed in debates about its character and future. In this third volume in a trilogy on musical understanding that includesInterpreting MusicandExpression and Truth, Lawrence Kramer seeks answers in both thoughtaboutmusic and thoughtinmusic-thinking in tones. He skillfully assesses musical scholarship in the aftermath of critical musicology and musical hermeneutics and in view of more recent concerns with embodiment, affect, and performance. This authoritative and timely work challenges the prevailing conceptions of every topic it addresses: language, context, and culture; pleasure and performance; and, through music, the foundations of understanding in the humanities.<br>

  Abstract: Many readers have been inclined to pass quickly over Canto XVIII, thinking its philosophical discussion of love and free will to be of little importance and finding no particularly significant character or event. To such readers, the philosophical discussion may appear repetitive of Marco Lombardo’s statements on free will and the soul in Canto XVI; moreover, there is nothing in Canto XVIII to match Marco’s engaging image of the

  Book Title: Transpacific Displacement-Ethnography, Translation, and Intertextual Travel in Twentieth-Century American Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Huang Yunte<br>
  Abstract: Yunte Huang takes a most original "ethnographic" approach to more and less well-known American texts as he traces what he calls the transpacific displacement of cultural meanings through twentieth-century America's imaging of Asia. Informed by the politics of linguistic appropriation and disappropriation,
      Transpacific Displacementopens with a radically new reading of Imagism through the work of Ezra Pound and Amy Lowell. Huang relates Imagism to earlier linguistic ethnographies of Asia and to racist representations of Asians in American pop culture, such as the book and movie character Charlie Chan, then shows that Asian American writers subject both literary Orientalism and racial stereotyping to double ventriloquism and countermockery. Going on to offer a provocative critique of some textually and culturally homogenizing tendencies exemplified in Maxine Hong Kingston's work and its reception, Huang ends with a study of American translations of contemporary Chinese poetry, which he views as new ethnographies that maintain linguistic and cultural boundaries.<br>

  Author(s) Pickstone John V.<br>
  Abstract: No other discipline within the humanities has had to struggle with its own interdisciplinary character as much as theater research in Europe. The fathers of the new-born scholarship
                     Theaterwissenschaftwere mainly concerned with distinguishing theater from other forms of art and with asserting its right as an independent field of enquiry. The need to define a specific methodological approach, however, was not taken into account. This initial lack in the creation of the scientific discipline has influenced the controversial development of theater studies and has caused frequent identity crises.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287gfz">Figures of a Changing World: Metaphor and the Emergence of Modern Culture</a><br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche is fundamentally concerned with the circuitous and deceptive character of our relations to things, and with the transcendence of actuality to our representations of it at the level of the signifier. But to a semiotician, the distinction between linguistic activity and extralinguistic reality is naive, and so I turn to Umberto Eco’s more doggedly semiotic approach to this distinction in
                  A Theory of Semiotics. Eco divides semiotics into two parts: the theory of codes or signification and the theory of sign-production or language use.Codedesignates the system of rules that “generate signs as concrete occurrences in communicative intercourse.”¹<br>

  Abstract: In this collection scholars suggest that using "myth" creates a framework within which to set biblical writings in both cultural and literary comparative contexts. Reading biblical accounts alongside the religious narratives of other ancient civilizations reveals what is commonplace and shared among them. The fruit of such work widens and enriches our understanding of the nature and character of biblical texts, and the results provide fresh evidence for how biblical writings became "scripture."<br>

                  logosrhetoric, especially in its arrangement, remains opaque.² Paul’s extraordinarily dense language intertwines the specific circumstances of Paul and his readers with the work of God in Christ.

  Abstract: In his epics Milton attempts to portray decisive identity. By “decisive identity” I mean a conscious guiding of individuation wherein identity and character are created through moral decisions. Decisive identity does not imply creating what we initially are. Rather, it involves consciously deciding what we become, which requires a troublesome but indispensable element, freedom. Milton develops themes, character, and plot by showing the origins and consequences of identity-forming decisions. These decisions are the foci of moral judgment and meaning. In

  Author(s): PATTERSON DAVID<br>
  Abstract: "In the Holocaust novel, silence is always a character, and the word is always its subject matter." So writes David Patterson in this profound and original study of more than thirty important writers. Contrary to existing views, he argues, the Holocaust novel is not an attempt to depict an unimaginable reality or an ineffable horror. It is, rather, an endeavor to fetch the word from silence and restore it to meaning, to resurrect the human soul, to regenerate the relation between the self and God, the self and other, the self and itself.<br>

  Abstract: “The Reason of the Gift”¹ is part of Jean-Luc Marion’s broader phenomenological project, which begins from his critique of the traces of a constituting subject retained by Husserl and Heidegger. While Marion’s phenomenology of givenness (

  Book Title: Veiled Desires: Intimate Portrayals of Nuns in Postwar Anglo-American Film-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SABINE MAUREEN<br>
  Abstract: A provocative, interdisciplinary study of nuns on the big screen, from The Bells of St. Mary's (1945) to Doubt (2008), that shines fresh light on the cinematic nun as a woman and a religious in the twentieth century. Ingrid Bergman's engaging screen performance as Sister Mary Benedict in The Bells of St. Mary's made the film nun a star and her character a shining standard of comparison. She represented the religious life as the happy and rewarding choice of a modern woman who had a "complete understanding" of both erotic and spiritual desire. How did this vibrant and mature nun figure come to be viewed as girlish and naive? Why have she and her cinematic sisters in postwar popular film so often been stereotyped or selectively analyzed, so seldom been seen as women and religious? In Veiled Desires--a unique full-length, in-depth study of nuns in film--Maureen Sabine explores these questions in a groundbreaking interdisciplinary study covering more than sixty years of cinema. She looks at an impressive breadth of films in which the nun features as an ardent lead character, including The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), Black Narcissus (1947), Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison (1957), Sea Wife (1957), The Nun's Story (1959), The Sound of Music (1965), Change of Habit (1969), In This House of Brede (1975), Agnes of God (1985), Dead Man Walking (1995), and Doubt (2008). Veiled Desires considers how the beautiful and charismatic stars who play chaste nuns, from Ingrid Bergman and Audrey Hepburn to Susan Sarandon and Meryl Streep, call attention to desires that the veil concealed and the habit was thought to stifle. In a theologically and psychoanalytically informed argument, Sabine responds to the critics who have pigeonholed the film nun as the obedient daughter and religious handmaiden of a patriarchal church, and the respectful audience who revered her as an icon of spiritual perfection. She provides a framework for a more complex and holistic picture of nuns on screen by showing h~<br>

  Abstract: This collection of ground-breaking essays considers the many dimensions of prayer: how prayer relates us to the divine; prayer's ability to reveal what is essential about our humanity; the power of prayer to transform human desire and action; and the relation of prayer to cognition. It takes up the meaning of prayer from within a uniquely phenomenological point of view, demonstrating that the phenomenology of prayer is as much about the character and boundaries of phenomenological analysis as it is about the heart of religious life.The contributors: Michael F.

  Abstract: Merold Westphal has been one of the most significant voices in Continental philosophy of religion in recent years. He, along with Paul Ricoeur, has contributed what might be called a specifically Protestant inflection to the ongoing “theological turn in phenomenology,” a movement that otherwise bears the largely Catholic accent of thinkers such as Marion, Henry, and Chrétien. Yet another contributor to this debate, the theologian David Tracy, has made a useful distinction between what he calls the “sacramental” character of the Catholic vision and the “prophetic” character of the Protestant.

Before examining some of their appropriations in the North American context in more detail, it might be worthwhile to consider this apologetic or quasi-apologetic character more fully.

  Book Title: Finding God in All Things: Celebrating Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stagaman David<br>
  Abstract: Three of the most influential Catholic theologians of the twentieth century-Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-were all born in 1904, at the height of the Church's most militant rhetoric against all things modern. In this culture of suspicion, Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner grew in faith to join the Society of Jesus and struggled with the burden of antimodernist policies in their formation. By the time of their mature work in the 1950s and 1960s, they had helped to redefine the critical dialogue between modern thought and contemporary Catholic theology. After the dtente of the Second Vatican Council, they brought Catholic tradition into closer relationship to modern philosophy, history, and politics. Written by leading scholars, friends, and family members, these original essays celebrate the legacies of Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner after a century of theological development. Offering a broad range of perspectives on their lives and works, the essays blend personal and anecdotal accounts with incisive critical appraisals. Together, they offer an accessible introduction to the distinctive character of three great thinkers and how their work shapes the way Catholics think and talk about God, Church, and State.<br>

  Book Title: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness traces the reflections of the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankelevitch on the conditions and temporality of forgiveness in relation to creation, history, and memory. The author demonstrates the influence of Jewish and Christian thought on Jankelevitch's philosophy and compares his ideas about the gift character of forgiveness, the role of retributive emotions in conceptions of justice, and the limits of reason with those of Aristotle, Butler, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Scheler, Arendt, Derrida, Levinas, and Ricoeur. The Shoah was the pivotal historical event in Jankelevitch's life. As this book shows, Jankelevitch's question "Is forgiveness possible as a response to evil?" remains a potent philosophical conundrum today. Paradoxically, for Jankelevitch, evil is both the impetus and the obstacle to forgiveness.<br>

  Abstract: The very notion of seductive ethics is likely to give us pause, to seem more error than paradox. Ethics is more often than not conceived as the very resistance to seduction, if not in fact to any sort of pleasure (or bliss, which seems to undermine the ethical subject).¹ It is dutiful, we think, a little bit ascetic (provided we don’t overly enjoy our asceticism), rule-bound or abstemiously virtuous. And if seduction is about sustaining the possible, then to prescribe, whether character or behavior, seems contradictory to it.

  Abstract: During the 1880s, Peirce employed the triadic nature of thought to ground his budding cosmology. As Karl-Otto Apel suggests, it was during this time (particularly in 1885) that Peirce developed a “metaphysics of evolution.”¹ Peirce’s attempt to expose a continuous relation among the three aspects of human thought becomes a desire to unify three realms of being. He comes to reassert the necessary connection between epistemology and ontology. Just as Kant’s discussion of imagination and reflective judgment in 1792 leads him to speculate on the topics of time and purposive nature, Peirce’s examination of the triadic character of logic and<br>

  Book Title: Conrad's Marlow-Narrative and death in 'Youth', Heart of Darkness, Lord Jim and Chance<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wake Paul<br>
  Abstract: Variously described as ‘the average pilgrim’, a ‘wanderer’, and ‘a Buddha preaching in European clothes’, Charlie Marlow is the voice behind Joseph Conrad’s ‘Youth’ (1898), Heart of Darkness (1899), Lord Jim (1900) and Chance (1912). Conrad’s Marlow offers a comprehensive account and critical analysis of one of Conrad’s most celebrated creations, asking both who and what is Marlow: a character or a narrator, a biographer or an autobiographical screen, a messenger or an interpreter, a bearer of truth or a misguided liar? Reading Conrad’s fiction alongside the work of Walter Benjamin, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida and Martin Heidegger, and offering an investigation into the connection between narrative and death, this book argues that Marlow’s essence is located in his liminality – in his constantly shifting position – and that the emergence of meaning in his stories is at all points bound up with the process of his storytelling.<br>

Part Two discusses the importance of place in relation to the church, and themes of innovation, undecideability and new forms of monastic community. Part Three addresses themes in discipleship: simplicity, mysticism, the passions and pilgrimage.

  Abstract: In reflecting upon the above treatments of aspects of historicity in the Fourth Gospel, a multiplicity of approaches and disciplines is here employed in getting at a common interest: the historical character of the Johannine tradition and ways in which it casts light upon the Jesus of history—his intentions, doings, teachings, travels, and receptions, as well as impressions, memories, interpretations, narrations, and writings about him in later settings. The division of the Gospel of John into three sections involving chapters 1–4, 5–12, and 13–21 works well as a means of dividing up the ministry of Jesus<br>

  Abstract: The thought and practice of sixteenth-century Anabaptism seem peculiar to many moderns precisely because modernity has no conceptual framework capable of correctly understanding the movement. Recent philosophical trends within postmodernity, however, provide fresh models for reassessing Anabaptism in terms more attuned to Anabaptism’s unique character. Some working within the Anglo-American strains of postmodernity have addressed and advanced post-Enlightenment thought in a remarkably successful manner, especially in regard to theology.¹ In this idiom, George Lindbeck is prominent among recent scholars using postmodern philosophy to help us imagine new ways of thinking about theology, particularly regarding the nature of religion, doctrine, and<br>

  Author(s) Thumpston Rebecca<br>
  Abstract: Musicology has always been puzzled with semantic questions: does music have meaning? The difficulty lies in music’s inability to function referentially. One might say that literature suffers from the opposite problem: verbal texts contain a centrifugal tendency to direct the recipient’s attention away from their artwork character (form) in favor of their referential message (content) (Kyndrup, 2011, p. 87). However, the specific case of poetry (as opposed to prose) often displays a certain quality that maneuvers attention toward the form of the message itself; a move notably termed

  Book Title: Mestizaje and Globalization-Transformations of Identity and Power<br>
  Publisher: University of Arizona Press<br>
  Author(s): YOUNG PHILIP D.<br>
  Abstract: The Spanish word
      mestizajedoes not easily translate into English. Its meaning and significance have been debated for centuries since colonization by European powers began. Its simplest definition is "mixing." As long as the term has been employed, norms and ideas about racial and cultural relations in the Americas have been imagined, imposed, questioned, rejected, and given new meaning.Mestizaje and Globalizationpresents perspectives on the underlying transformation of identity and power associated with the term during times of great change in the Americas. The volume offers a comprehensive and empirically diverse collection of insights concerning mestizaje's complex relationship with indigeneity, the politics of ethnic identity, transnational social movements, the aesthetic of cultural production, development policies, and capitalist globalization, with particular attention to cases in Latin America and the United States.Beyond the narrow and often inadequate meaning of mestizaje as biological and racial mixing, the concept deserves an innovative theoretical consideration due to its multidimensional, multifaceted character and its resilience as an ideological construct. The contributors argue that historical analyses of mestizaje do not sufficiently understand contemporary ways that racism, ethnic discrimination, and social injustice intermingle with current discourse and practice of cultural recognition and multiculturalism in the Americas.Mestizaje and Globalizationcontributes to an emerging multidisciplinary effort to explore how identities are imposed, negotiated, and reconstructed. The chapter authors clearly set forth the issues and obstacles that Indigenous peoples and subjugated minorities face, as well as the strategies they have employed to gain empowerment in the face of globalization.<br>

  Abstract: Most academics read

As Gayatri Spivak argues, its mode of representation is “citation, reinscription, re-routing the historical,“epitomizing postcoloniality because it systematically dislodges “every metropolitan definition” (104). The novel is predicated on this trope of postcolonial disruption, foregrounding the political and cultural fallout of imperial contraction and the immigration of former colonial subjects to the metropole. InThe Location of Culture,Homi Bhabha famously reads Rushdie’s novel as a testament to “culture’s [inherent]hybridity” and the “indeterminacy of diasporic identity” (38, 225).

  Abstract: The cosmologies implicated in sorcery practice are human-centric. Within them, human beings are at the heart of processes that are integral in the formation of their psychical, social and political universes. Sorcery fetishises human agency, often one which it magically enhances, as the key mediating factor affecting the course or direction of human life-chances. The fabulous character of so much sorcery practice, its transgressive and unbounded dimensions, a rich symbolism that appears to press towards and beyond the limits of the human imagination, is surely connected to the overpowering and totalising impetus that sorcery recognises in human agency and capacities.<br>

  Abstract: It is not a rare phenomenon today to find a concert hall—that bourgeois temple of the cult of Art—filled with religious music. This may not seem surprising, since soon after its invention in the eighteenth century the concert hall became a location for the performance of religious repertoires. The times have changed, however, and the position of religion today can hardly be compared with the one it occupied centuries ago. The presence of religion in classical music performances today is mostly historical in character, such as, for instance, when Handel’s oratorios are played, or Mozart’s

  Book Title: On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy-A Guide for the Unruly<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything,even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.<br>

  Abstract: Emmanuel Levinas’s writings are rich in comments and reflections on art, poetry, and the relations between poetry and ethical theory.¹ Of particular importance is the question of language, because there appears to be a kind of symmetry between language as an ethical relation and the language of poetry, both of which expose us to regions of subjectivity or existence on the hither (anarchic) side of cognition and being. The ethical and the poetic are evidently species of saying (

  Book Title: Reading Daniel as a Text in Theological Hermeneutics-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hebbard Aaron B.<br>
  Abstract: Reading Daniel as a Text in Theological Hermeneutics sets out to read the book of Daniel as a narrative textbook in the field of theological hermeneutics. Employing such disciplines as historical criticism, literary criticism, narrative theology, and hermeneutics, this work seeks to maintain an interdisciplinary outlook on the book of Daniel. Two inherently linked perspectives are utilized in this reading of Daniel. First is the perception that the character of Daniel is the paradigm of the good theological hermeneut; theology and hermeneutics are inseparable and converge in the character of Daniel. Readers must recognize in Daniel certain qualities, attitudes, abilities, and convictions well worth emulating. Essentially, readers must aspire to become a Daniel. Second is the standpoint that the book of Daniel on the whole should be read as a hermeneutics textbook. Readers are led through a series of theories and exercises meant to be instilled into their theological, intellectual, and practical lives. Attention to readers is a constant endeavor throughout this thesis. The concern is fundamentally upon contemporary readers and their communities, yet with sensible consideration given to the historical readerly community with which contemporary readers find continuity. Greater concentration is placed on what the book of Daniel means for contemporary readers than on what the book of Daniel meant in its historical setting. In the end, readers are left with difficult challenges, a sobering awareness of the volatility of the business of hermeneutics, and serious implications for readers to implement both theologically and hermeneutically.<br>

  Book Title: The Fate of Saul's Progeny in the Reign of David-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Longman Tremper<br>
  Abstract: Cephas Tushima provides a thorough analysis of the fate of Saul's heirs, focussing on whether their tragedies were due to continuing divine retribution, coincidence, or Davidic orchestration. He concludes that David was unjust and calculating in his dealings with the Saulides and, like other Near Eastern usurpers, perpetrated heinous injustices against the vanquished house of Saul. Traditionally readers saw Saul as evil and David as a hero; but more recently scholars have written about Saul as a tragic character and David as a villain, turning the book of Samuel into deeply contested interpretive territory. Tushima provides analysis of the critical literature surrounding this contentious issue and contributes his own study that will prove important to the continuing debate. He assesses David's character by analysing how he treats the surviving children of his predecessor, drawing upon the provisions for justice in the covenant community in the book of Deuteronomy. He demonstrates a connection between Samuel and the Torah through themes and motifs, and develops theological conclusions from them on such issues as the impact of human conduct on the environment, marriage, monarchy and Zion theology.<br>

  Abstract: While in Genesis 2-11 the Yahwist confronts the issue of evil through a sequence of stories on the progressive deterioration of the divine-human relationship, in Genesis 4 he describes the initial slaughter of one human being by another as fratricidal. This book provides a close reading of J's story by using literary criticism and psychological criticism, and shows that the biblical author has more than an "archaeological" design. His characters - including God, Adam, Eve, Cain, and Abel, plus minor character - are paradigmatic, as they allow J to proceed with a fine analytical feel for the nature of evil as performed by "homo" as "homini lupus." No imaginative "mimesis" of evil has ever been recounted with such an economy of means and such depth of psychological insight.<br>

  Abstract: Theological discourse, whether implicitly or explicitly, is in search of some kind of justification. It was because of its contamination by various intellectual heresies, old and new, that often this justificatory practice rather than letting the discourse flow beyond itself, tended to lead it into the fortress of a regulatory concept, practice or institution or a contingent or illusory foundation. But as history so often witnesses, it is precisely when discourse guards itself most securely that it must face the most formidable objection because it loses its ecstatic character, ceasing thus to reflect the overriding feature of its source.<br>

  Author(s) Chung Paul S.<br>
  Abstract: Luther’s theological aesthetics of God’s glory in Christ’s suffering love lays a basis for reshaping and redirecting motives of Asian post-confessional theology toward a different understanding and transformation of Luther. When Luther encounters a postmodern context, he can best be understood by challenging and transcending him. His doctrine of justification, theology of the cross, Trinity, law and gospel, eucharistic theology, and two kingdoms theory among others are seen at the point of the death, resurrection and reconciliation of the crucified Christ, the scope and reach of which is of inclusive, universal character allowing and tolerating other ways.

  Author(s) Milbank John<br>
  Abstract: Our attempt to understand the unity of being in terms of gift so far has brought to light the primal character of gift. Gift is a primal, a principle, inasmuch as it is a permanent source. The positivity of concrete singular beings suggested by originary experience rests on the permanent, personal principle of originating and ordering, a Father whose face we are invited to see in his beloved, Incarnate Son. Gift is also a primal because it indicates “first-ness.” According to this second sense of “primal,” being’s primordial unity is an ever-new beginning. Each concrete singular being is created; it<br>

I shall deal with basic elements in Marx’s political economy and his method of historical materialism in reference to Hegel, because Marx’s thought cannot be properly understood without Hegel’s concept of labor and alienation in civil society. Marx’s critique of religion implies his negative evaluation of the role of church mission in the domestic-economic context, as well as in the colonial context.

  Book Title: Writing and Materiality in China-Essays in Honor of Patrick Hanan<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Widmer Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Speaking about Chinese writing entails thinking about how writing speaks through various media. In the guises of the written character and its imprints, traces, or ruins, writing is more than textuality. The goal of this volume is to consider the relationship of writing to materiality in China’s literary history and to ponder the physical aspects of the production and circulation of writing. To speak of the thing-ness of writing is to understand it as a thing in constant motion, transported from one place or time to another, one genre or medium to another, one person or public to another. Thinking about writing as the material product of a culture shifts the emphasis from the author as the creator and ultimate arbiter of a text’s meaning to the editors, publishers, collectors, and readers through whose hands a text is reshaped, disseminated, and given new meanings. By yoking writing and materiality, the contributors to this volume aim to bypass the tendency to oppose form and content, words and things, documents and artifacts, to rethink key issues in the interpretation of Chinese literary and visual culture.<br>

  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>

  Abstract: Martin Price writes here about ways in which character has been conceived and presented in the novels of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Beginning with chapters that cogently argue the artistic value of character, Price then deals with the different forms character has taken in individual novels. His first discussions center on authors-Jane Austen, Stendhal, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, and Leo Tolstoy-who define individuals by their adherence or opposition to social norms. The next chapters deal with novelists for whom the moral world is largely internalized. The characters of Henry James, Joseph Conrad, D.H. Lawrence, and E.M. Forster live in society and act upon it, but the authors are particularly concerned with the confusions, terrors, and heroism that lie within consciousness. The last chapter uses novels about the artist by James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Thomas Mann in order to apprehend the process by which experience is transformed into art.<br>

  Book Title: Science Fiction Double Feature-The Science Fiction Film as Cult Text<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): DUCHOVNAY GERALD<br>
  Abstract: Critical discussion of cult cinema has often noted its tendency to straddle or ignore boundaries, to pull together different sets of conventions, narrative formulas, or character types for the almost surreal pleasure to be found in their sudden juxtapositions or narrative combination. With its own boundary-blurring nature—as both science and fiction, reality and fantasy—science fiction has played a key role in such cinematic cult formation. This volume examines that largely unexplored relationship, looking at how the sf film’s own double nature neatly matches up with a persistent double vision common to the cult film. It does so by bringing together an international array of scholars to address key questions about the intersections of sf and cult cinema: how different genre elements, directors, and stars contribute to cult formation; what role fan activities, including “con" participation, play in cult development; and how the occulted or “bad" sf cult film works. The volume pursues these questions by addressing a variety of such sf cult works, including Robot Monster (1953), Zardoz (1974), A Boy and His Dog (1975), Tetsuo: The Iron Man (1989), Space Truckers (1996), Ghost in the Shell 2 (2004), and Iron Sky (2012). What these essays afford is a revealing vision of both the sf aspects of much cult film activity and the cultish aspects of the whole sf genre.<br>

  Abstract: The enigma of the work of modern art is also the name for its constitutive character. The character of this self-contradicting existence is what makes the work of art into the occasion for a baffling and befuddling encounter. The complement to enigma in the work of art is its truth content. Key to engaging the work of art’s enigma and truth content is the mimetic relation between experience and the work of art. The misalignment between the work of art and human experience is an opportunity for encountering what exists as objective contradiction. The ongoing dance between the mimetic misalignments<br>

  Author(s) O’Donnell Mike<br>
  Abstract: The purpose of this chapter is to explain the rise, character and trajectory of radicalism in the United States during ‘the long nineteen sixties’ and to comment on its significance to some of today’s related issues. For comparative purposes, I will also refer to nineteen sixties radicalism in Britain. My already smouldering interest in American radicalism was ignited in 1968 when as a student I attended the ‘alternative’ democratic convention in Chicago, if ‘attended’ is the right word to describe the heavily policed gatherings of assorted radicals in the parks and streets outside the official Convention Hall.

  Abstract: Much water has flown down the Jordan, Jhelum, ganges, Cauvery, Mahanadi, thames, rhines and Mississippi rivers since the dawn of humanity and the independence of india, and in recent years much discussion has taken place over the nature of secularism in india, including its uses and abuses. Broadly speaking, we can classify the various contending positions on secularism in india into three approaches: a) those who defend the secular character of the Indian Republic as enshrined in the Constitution of India; b) those who oppose it on the grounds that the practice of Indian state-led secularism has been a pseudo-secularism;<br>

  Book Title: The Resounding Soul-Reflections on the Metaphysics and Vivacity of the Human Person<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Kimbriel Samuel<br>
  Abstract: It is surely not coincidental that the term “soul" should mean not only the centre of a creature’s life and consciousness, but also a thing or action characterized by intense vivacity (“that bike’s got soul!"). It also seems far from coincidental that the same contemporary academic discussions that have largely cast aside the language of “soul" in their quest to define the character of human mental life should themselves be so – how to say it? – bloodless, so lacking in soul. This volume arises from the opposite premise, namely that the task of understanding human nature is bound up with and in important respects dependent upon the more critical task of learning to be fully human, of learning to have soul. The papers collected here are derived from a conference in Oxford sponsored by the Centre of Theology and Philosophy and together explore the often surprising landscape that emerges when human consciousness is approached from this angle. Drawing upon literary, philosophical, theological, historical, and musical modes of analysis, the essays of this volume vividly remind the reader of the power of the ancient language of soul over against contemporary impulses to reduce, fragment, and overly determine human selfhood.<br>

  Author(s) Desmond William<br>
  Abstract: Separated by centuries, but united by their faith, and a certain kind of idiosyncratic genius, both Evagrius of Pontus and Søren Kierkegaard developed the traditional concept of “the soul” within anthropologies grounded in their dynamic metaphysics. Each posited a tripartite composition of the human being, consisting of body, mind/soul, and soul/spirit. Despite the variable terminology used by the thinkers (and their translators), both employed a “third term” to designate the relation between the person’s corporeal and incorporeal aspects: a relation that is, itself, constitutive of the character of one’s being and a litmus test for one’s moral and spiritual health.<br>

  Abstract: Like the first law of thermodynamics, literary fiction requires momentum. Fiction relies on propulsive devices: basic units of charge that power action, event, and consciousness, calibrated by laws of narrative motion and physical, material impressions of kinetic and potential energy transference. (These need not involve tales of actual motion or much, if any, movement—consider Beckett’s minimalism or the generic predicates for entropy in naturalist writing.) Fiction requires and is measured through potential—what fuels its psychosocial dynamics, the impetus of plot and character development, and its chronotopic ability to traverse multiple times and spaces.

  Book Title: The Qing Formation in World-Historical Time-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Struve Lynn A.<br>
  Abstract: For many years, the Ming and Qing dynasties have been grouped as “late imperial China," a temporal framework that allows scholars to identify and evaluate indigenous patterns of social, economic, and cultural change initiated in the last century of Ming rule that imparted a particular character to state and society throughout the Qing and into the twentieth century. This paradigm asserts the autonomous character of social change in China and has allowed historians to create a “China-centered history." Recently, however, many scholars have begun emphasizing the singular qualities of the Qing. Among the eight contributors to this volume on the formation of the Qing, those who emphasize the Manchu ethos of the Qing tend to see it as part of an early modernity and stress parallel and sometimes mutually reinforcing patterns of political consolidation and cultural integration across Eurasia. Other contributors who examine the Qing formation from the perspective of those who lived through the dynastic transition see the advent of Qing rule as prompting attempts by the Chinese subjects of the new empire to make sense of what they perceived as a historical disjuncture and to rework these understandings into an accommodation to foreign rule. In contrast to the late imperial paradigm, the new ways of configuring the Qing in historical time in both groups of essays assert the singular qualities of the Qing formation.<br>

  Author(s): Mäkikalli Aino<br>
  Abstract: This collection of essays studies the encounter between allegedly ahistorical concepts of narratology and eighteenth-century literature. It questions whether the general concepts of narratology are as such applicable to historically specific fields, or whether they need further specification. Furthermore, at issue is the question whether the theoretical concepts actually are, despite their appearance of ahistorical generality, derived from the historical study of a particular period and type of literature. In the essays such concepts as genre, plot, character, event, tellability, perspective, temporality, description, reading, metadiegetic narration, and paratext are scrutinized in the context of eighteenth-century texts. The writers include some of the leading theorists of both narratology and eighteenth-century literature.<br>

  Book Title: Norms of Rhetorical Culture-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Farrell Thomas B.<br>
  Abstract: Rhetoric is widely regarded by both its detractors and advocates as a kind of antithesis to reason. In this book Thomas B. Farrell restores rhetoric as an art of practical reason and enlightened civic participation, grounding it in its classical tradition-particularly in the rhetoric of Aristotle. And, because prevailing modernist world views bear principal responsibility for the disparagement of rhetorical tradition, Farrell also offers a critique of the dominant currents of modern humanist thought.Farrell argues that rhetoric is not antithetical to reason but is a manner of posing and answering questions that is distinct from the approaches of analytic and dialectical reason. He develops this position in a number of ways: through a series of bold reinterpretations of Aristotle's
      Rhetoric; through a detailed appraisal of traditional rhetorical concepts as seen in modern texts from the Army-McCarthy hearings to Edward Kennedy's memorial for his brother, Mario Cuomo's address on abortion, Betty Friedan'sFeminine Mystique, and Vaclav Havel's inaugural address; and through a fresh appraisal of theories on the character of language and discourse found in contemporary philosophy, literary criticism, anthropology, deconstructionism, Marxism, and especially in Habermas's critical theory of communicative action.<br>

  Book Title: The Ambiguous Allure of the West-Traces of the Colonial in Thailand<br>
  Publisher: Hong Kong University Press, HKU<br>
  Author(s): Chakrabarty Dipesh<br>
  Abstract: The book brings studies of modern Thai history and culture into dialogue with debates in comparative intellectual history, Asian cultural studies, and postcolonial studies. It takes Thai Studies in new directions through case studies of the cultural hybridity and ambivalences that have emerged from the manifold interactions between Siam/Thailand and the West from 1850 to the present day. Central aims of The Ambiguous Allure of the West are to critique notions of Thai "uniqueness" or "exceptionalism" and locate Thai Studies in a broader, comparative perspective by arguing that modern Siam/Thailand needs to be understood as a semicolonial society. In contrast to conservative nationalist and royalist accounts of Thai history and culture, which resist comparing the country to its once-colonized Asian neighbours, this book's contributors highlight the value of postcolonial analysis in understanding the complexly ambiguous, interstitial, liminal and hybrid character of Thai/Western cultural interrelationships. At the same time, by pointing to the distinctive position of semicolonial societies in the Western-dominated world order, the chapters in this book make significant contributions to developing the critical theoretical perspectives of international cultural studies. The contributors demonstrate how the disciplines of history, anthropology, political science, film and cultural studies all enhance these contestations in intersecting ways, and across different historical moments. Each of the chapters raises manifold themes and questions regarding the nature of intercultural exchange, interrogated through theoretically critical lenses. This book directs its discussions at those studying not only in the fields of Thai and Southeast Asian studies but also in colonial and postcolonial studies, Asian cultural studies, film studies and comparative critical theory.<br>

  Abstract: Musical narrative resists simple formulation, its complex identity emerging through a confluence of factors. First, the essential characteristics of narrative are partly obscured by the distinct inflections given it by the different media through which it manifests itself. Dramatic narrative is phenomenally immediate, realized by characters and settings both visually and audibly present. Literary narrative is likewise relatively specific with respect to character and setting, but is constructed through verbal description and dialogue. Mythic narrative invokes characters, settings, and/or themes with numinous cultural significance, situating these elements in an idealized, hyper-real manner. Historical narrative ostensibly employs real events and characters<br>

  Author(s) HAUERWAS STANLEY<br>
  Abstract: As the audience for Emmanuel Levinas’s philosophical and Jewish thought has grown, his claim that ethics rather than ontology is first philosophy has become a more familiar — if resisted — view. This claim is central to Levinas’s thought and indeed, as will be made clear, figures importantly in relation to problems of rhetoric, ideology, and idolatry within discourse. For without the priority of ethics, a critique of these functionings would, for Levinas, be impossible. In order to demonstrate the importance, relations among, and shifting character of the problems of rhetoric, ideology, and idolatry in Levinas’s writings, I shall first briefly trace<br>

  Abstract: The vocabulary and cadences of Scripture—particularly of the LXX—are imprinted deeply on Paul’s mind, and the great stories of Israel continue to serve for him as a fund of symbols and metaphors that condition his perception of the world, of God’s promised deliverance of his people, and of his own identity and calling. His faith, in short, is one whose articulation is inevitably intertextual in character, and Israel’s Scripture is the “determinate subtext that plays a constitutive role” in shaping his literary production.¹<br>

  Book Title: The Politics of Pessimism in Ecclesiastes-  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Sneed Mark R.<br>
  Abstract: Scholars attempt to resolve the problem of the book of Ecclesiastes’ heterodox character in one of two ways, either explaining away the book’s disturbing qualities or radicalizing and championing it as a precursor of modern existentialism. This volume offers an interpretation of Ecclesiastes that both acknowledges the unorthodox nature of Qoheleth’s words and accounts for its acceptance among the canonical books of the Hebrew Bible. It argues that, instead of being the most secular and modern of biblical books, Ecclesiastes is perhaps one of the most religious and primitive. Bringing a Weberian approach to Ecclesiastes, it represents a paradigm of the application of a social-science methodology.<br>

  Abstract: Contemporary fiction by Native Americans frequently traces crises of self-transformation.² Unique complications in the transformational process arise for Indian characters, sometimes on account of their half-blood or mixed-blood status, sometimes owing to their efforts to sustain tribal values in a white world, and other times due to their attempts to live by the rules of the dominant society. In the end, such characters usually shape themselves less according to traditional models drawn exclusively from a particular culture than to models that they half-invent and half-discover through bicultural experience. Thus, in their patterns of character development, American Indian narratives emphasize flexibility<br>

Despite the metafictional character of his de-naturing of traditional narratives, his ex-posing of the ideologies concealed behind Western myths, and his interrogation of the hidden structures of thought and feeling (Logos and Eros) in which writer and reader are enmeshed, Robbe-Grillet’s detecting project can itself be generated only from within the traditional frames of language, myth, and feeling.<br>

Ricoeur’s analysis is anchored to the established phenomenological precepts of Kant and Husserl, for in order that metaphor may refer, its transgressive character must ultimately be tamed by the master discourse of philosophy. However, according to Jacques Derrida’s deconstructive practice, the philosopher’s discourse is itself shot through with metaphor. It<br>

  Book Title: Heidegger and the Thinking of Place-Explorations in the Topology of Being<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Malpas Jeff<br>
  Abstract: The idea of place--topos--runs through Martin Heidegger's thinking almost from the very start. It can be seen not only in his attachment to the famous hut in Todtnauberg but in his constant deployment of topological terms and images and in the situated, "placed" character of his thought and of its major themes and motifs. Heidegger's work, argues Jeff Malpas, exemplifies the practice of "philosophical topology." In Heidegger and the Thinking of Place, Malpas examines the topological aspects of Heidegger's thought and offers a broader elaboration of the philosophical significance of place. Doing so, he provides a distinct and productive approach to Heidegger as well as a new reading of other key figures--notably Kant, Aristotle, Gadamer, and Davidson, but also Benjamin, Arendt, and Camus. Malpas, expanding arguments he made in his earlier book Heidegger's Topology (MIT Press, 2007), discusses such topics as the role of place in philosophical thinking, the topological character of the transcendental, the convergence of Heideggerian topology with Davidsonian triangulation, the necessity of mortality in the possibility of human life, the role of materiality in the working of art, the significance of nostalgia, and the nature of philosophy as beginning in wonder. Philosophy, Malpas argues, begins in wonder and begins in place and the experience of place. The place of wonder, of philosophy, of questioning, he writes, is the very topos of thinking.<br>

  Abstract: One of the most powerful words in the English language, "corruption" is also one of the most troubled concepts in law. According to Laura Underkuffler, it is a concept based on religiously revealed ideas of good and evil. But the notion of corruption defies the ordinary categories by which law defines crimes-categories that punish acts, not character, and that eschew punishment on the basis of religion and emotion.

  Abstract: Repetitionis a necessary feature of narrative. A repeated name, for example, permits us to track a single character across a novel. Repetition’s operation ofsimilitudeurges consistency over time, emphasizing the reality of things and of persons, as when we speak of habits, customs, conventions. While some repetition is necessary for narrative stability, it can also afford uncertainty because every iteration can seem to bear more—or different—meaning in its new context. William Empson describes the effect of Sidney’sArcadia:“in tracing their lovelorn pastoral tedium through thirteen repetitions, with something of the aimless multitudinousness of the sea<br>

  Book Title: Metaphor-  Publisher: Harvard University Press<br>
  Author(s): Donoghue Denis<br>
  Abstract: Metaphor supposes that an ordinary word could have been used, but instead something unexpected appears. The point of a metaphor is to enrich experience by bringing different associations to mind, by giving something a different life. The prophetic character of metaphor, Denis Donoghue says, changes the world by changing our sense of it.<br>

  Abstract: Cajal’s studies of the nervous system trace the limits of scientific realism. The workings of the cellular world obviously have global effects on the body, but the greater the detail of Cajal’s descriptions, the more difficult it becomes for him to explain human behavior in terms of cells. What is it about the branches of neurons that makes individuals think the way they do? Literary realism has similar limits. It may be obvious that environmental factors like alcoholism or poverty have dramatic effects on a person’s (and a character’s) identity, but the realist process of amassing minute observations is often<br>

  Abstract: In his influential examination of the social and historical conditions that gave rise to the historical novel, Georg Lukács describes the power of a “real mass movement” to influence the way people view and lend importance to history. “The appeal to national independence and national character,” Lukács writes, “is necessarily connected with a re-awakening of national history, with memories of the past, of past greatness, of moments of national dishonour, whether this results in a progressive or reactionary ideology” (25).

  Abstract: Considerations of center and periphery in Heian Japan involve at the highest level the relationship between the central political apparatus and the hinterlands, the sixty-six provinces and two islands (Iki and Tsushima) that constituted the conceptualized polity. Indeed, the very existence of a state presupposes control over the human and material resources of the space thought to constitute the geographical area of that conceptualized state. This was never an easy task for Japanese rulers, despite the insular character of Japan that seems to lend itself to simple mapping of a discrete geopolitical entity.

  Book Title: Religion after Religion-Gershom Scholem, Mircea Eliade, and Henry Corbin at Eranos<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wasserstrom Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: By the end of World War II, religion appeared to be on the decline throughout the United States and Europe. Recent world events had cast doubt on the relevance of religious belief, and modernizing trends made religious rituals look out of place. It was in this atmosphere that the careers of Scholem, Eliade, and Corbin--the twentieth century's legendary scholars in the respective fields of Judaism, History of Religions, and Islam--converged and ultimately revolutionized how people thought about religion. Between 1949 and 1978, all three lectured to Carl Jung's famous Eranos circle in Ascona, Switzerland, where each in his own way came to identify the symbolism of mystical experience as a central element of his monotheistic tradition. In this, the first book ever to compare the paths taken by these thinkers, Steven Wasserstrom explores how they overturned traditional approaches to studying religion by de-emphasizing law, ritual, and social history and by extolling the role of myth and mysticism. The most controversial aspect of their theory of religion, Wasserstrom argues, is that it minimized the binding character of moral law associated with monotheism.<br>

He struggled with balancing the intellectual appeal of philosophy with the “certainty” he hoped to find in positivist science. That move heralded the series of clinical studies that would eventually emerge in the therapeutic system of psychoanalysis, a psychiatry he would consistently call a “science.” Freud never abandoned his commitment to scientific knowledge and perhaps more importantly, scientific reason.

  Abstract: Carol Shields opens

How does the repeatedly “mediocre” (113) Canadian become so extraordinary? This ordinary, “miserable adolescent” (165) would indeed remain as such without the construction of a spatialized identity, which renders the character exceptional and serves as the structural frame ofLarry’s Party. InL’expérience intérieure, Georges Bataille discusses the “labyrinthine construction of being,” which, he argues, takes the form of a “course we follow from<br>

  Book Title: Aphorism in the Francophone Novel of the Twentieth Century-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): BELL MARK<br>
  Abstract: Aphorism in the Francophone Novel of the Twentieth Century includes critical readings of Terre des hommes by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Alexandre Chenevert by Gabrielle Roy, Gouverneurs de la rosée by Jacques Roumain, Pluie et vent sur Télumée miracle by Simone Schwarz-Bart, La route des Flandres by Claude Simon, Présence de la mort by C.F. Ramuz, and Neige noire by Hubert Aquin. Bell addresses the problems inherent in the term aphorism, the narrative and discourse function of aphorism within the genre of the novel, the interrelation between the structure of aphorism and the epistemological and hermeneutical functions this sub-genre may perform as a component part of the narrative fabric, the "national" character of aphoristics, and the problems that arise from "anthologizing" a novel's aphorisms.<br>

  Contemporary Fiction-Elegy from:

  Abstract: In this study I have argued that Mavis Gallant and Alice Munro have adapted conventions of elegy within fictional frameworks, a practice refined by modernist fiction-elegists such as Virginia Woolf and James Joyce. A digressive structure, the focus on the self (on the narrator-elegist or character-elegist as survivor), and a tendency towards selfreflexivity are characteristics of both modern and late modern fiction-elegies. But where Woolf and Joyce employ self-reflexivity as a trope of consolation and suggest that the work of art is an immortal and idealized product achieved at the end of the work of mourning, Gallant and Munro use<br>

  Abstract: Infinitely layered echoes of past, present, and future phantoms, which reflect the interaction and transformations of internalized life and communal events within the self and society, take place within the crux of a multilevel framework that extends through time and space. Twins held the keys to one another’s lives, but their relationship also symbolically represents the communal reality. I look at communal twinship on a macro level, examining it via time and space. First, I look at political and socio-economic twinships and their demographic character. Then I map out the geographical context and spatial negotiations within which the interethnic dialogue<br>

  Book Title: The Rhetorical Emergence of Culture-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Girke Felix<br>
  Abstract: "Just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric" - the first half of this central statement from the International Rhetoric Culture Project is abundantly evidenced. It is the latter half that this volume explores: how does culture emerge out of rhetorical action, out of seemingly dispersed individual actions and interactions? The contributors do not rely on rhetorical "text" alone but engage the situational, bodily, and often antagonistic character of cultural and communicative practices. The social situation itself is argued to be the fundamental site of cultural creation, as will-driven social processes are shaped by cognitive dispositions and shape them in turn. Drawing on expertise in a variety of disciplines and regions, the contributors critically engage dialogical approaches in their emphasis on how a view from rhetoric changes our perception of people's intersubjective and conjoint creation of culture.<br>

Between the late 1800s and early 1900s, America welcomed more immigrants to its shores than at any other period in its history. As the nation incorporated the new groups, artists and writers responded in ways to help the nation address the changing character and identity of the country. To the present day, the<br>

It is all too easy to forget the weight of history felt by European postwar planners at that time, realized primarily as fear: of a repetition of the economic chaos after the First World War, and of renewed German aspirations to avenge and<br>

  Abstract: One of the central issues in the relationship of politics and religion is the status, scope, and limits of religious toleration. Although the principle of toleration is generally taken for granted by most Americans in an almost ritualistic fashion, they tend to ignore the controversial character of the principle itself: what it means, how it is to be applied, what its limitations are, and, in general, how it is grounded in moral and political philosophy. When asked about the moral basis of toleration the general answer is that toleration comes from pluralism, and ours is a pluralistic society. Q.E.D. It<br>

  Abstract: The concept of character has two uses in children’s literature discourse. One use belongs to literary criticism, as the critic and reader observe the people in a story or novel as “characters,” that is, as agents or actors (Burke 1973 ) whose actions move a story through time. The other use refers to the moral qualities of a person. These uses of “character” are related, as the root of the English word lies in a Greek word for a tool used to mark or engrave a material (

Alternate, less extreme ways of thinking about language and social organization were available (e.g., James’s pluralism, Bahktin’s and Voloshinov’s analyses of language as a dialogic enactment of multiple social tensions), but we can speculate that the rapid, violent, traumatic character of social change—and, indeed, of many of the significant events of the twentieth century—and the extreme claims made by positivist thinkers in<br>

Though somewhat preliminary to the main argument of the chapter, the opening pages resituate Barrett Browning within—or at least close to—a church group that has mistakenly been judged in its midcentury character by the theology and practice of an earlier time. The mistake matters for literary studies because it has marred our perception of the importance of religion to arguably the most important woman poet of the period. Certain of Barrett Browning’s<br>

  Abstract: Of course Hotspur is speaking in character, as a bluff soldier – in a non-trivial sense these are his not Shakespeare’s words. Nevertheless it is always something of a shock to come across, in the greatest poet of the English language, such a memorable expression of the hatred of poetry. Glendower has been wittering on about his supernatural and poetic endowments, and Hotspur has had enough. The bombastic Welshman assures Hotspur he has “framèd to the harp / Many an English ditty lovely well, / And gave the tongue a helpful ornament – / A virtue that was never seen in you”<br>

  Abstract: Let us suppose that we reject the ‘myth of the given’ or the idea of ‘contents’ of consciousness whose character explains what it is like to have our experiences, and adopt instead an account in terms of the ways things can become intentional objects of experience through the manner of our bodily interactions with them. This may still leave us with the uneasy feeling that something the ‘given’ was meant to suggest has dropped out of our story, namely, the way in which our perceptions and especially our bodily sensations are not only what we

  Abstract: Although our contemporary world is marked throughout by the importance of questions of identity, something increasingly reflected in the directions of contemporary social–scientific research, in the general field of nationalism studies the issue of the attraction and salience of national identities has not been sufficiently examined. This is partly due to the hegemonic position of modernist and constructionist approaches in the relevant literature.² In opposition to the common doxa reproduced by nationalist myths, contemporary research on the nation tends to stress the constructed character of national identity: the nation is primarily understood as a modern social and political construction.<br>

  Author(s) McQuillan Martin<br>
  Abstract: Evolutionary psychology, a recently constituted but already broadly extended programme in the study of human behaviour, is notable for, among other things, the unusually pre-emptive character of its claims. According to its major proponents, ‘reverse engineering’, the method that defines and distinguishes evolutionary psychology, permits identification of the underlying, innate mental mechanisms that govern all human behaviour, from incest-avoidance and femaleadolescent anorexia to past-tense formation and a taste for Victorian novels. In supplying these identifications, it is said, evolutionary psychologists provide genuinely scientific explanations for human behaviours and cultural practices that, up to now, have been improperly or inadequately explained<br>

  Abstract: Where did modernism happen? What were its important places and distinctive geographies? These are not new questions and, until relatively recently, might have been thought settled. A powerful and well-rehearsed narrative about modernism defines it as essentially metropolitan and internationalist in character, recalling that the majority of high-modernist writers and artists were exiles or émigrés, and that their texts are conspicuously polyglot, heteronomous, and fashioned from diverse cultural materials. Modernism, according to Malcolm Bradbury, was ‘an art of cities’ and the jolting energies of life in the major European capitals can be read in the fractured, discontinuous forms of modernist<br>

  Abstract: Utopia can be a placeholder for social change, a no-place that the apparatus of theater—its liveness, the potential it holds for real social exchange, its mortality, its openness to human interactions that life outside this magical space prohibits—can model productively. In the last chapter, I found these feelings of utopia in Holly Hughes, Peggy Shaw, and Deb Margolin’s interactions with their audiences. Their stories directly addressed spectators and modeled an ephemeral but powerful intersubjectivity that let spectators experience affectively, if fleetingly, what utopia might feel like.

  Book Title: The Real and the Sacred-Picturing Jesus in Nineteenth-Century Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): GATRALL JEFFERSON J. A.<br>
  Abstract: The figure of Jesus appears as a character in dozens of nineteenth-century novels, including works by Balzac, Flaubert, Dickens, Dostoevsky, and others.
         The Real and the Sacredfocuses in particular on two fiction genres: the Jesus redivivus tale and the Jesus novel. In the former, Christ makes surprise visits to earth, from rural Flanders (Balzac) and Muscovy (Turgenev) to the bustling streets of Paris (Flaubert), Seville (Dostoevsky), Berlin, and Boston. In the latter, the historical Jesus wanders through the picturesque towns and plains of first-century Galilee and Judea, attracting followers and enemies. In short, authors subjected Christ, the second person of the Christian trinity, to the realist norms of secular fiction. Thus the Jesus of nineteenth-century fiction was both situated within a specific time and place, whether ancient or modern, and positioned before the gaze of increasingly daring literary portraitists. The highest artistic challenge for authors was to paint, using mere words, a faithful picture of Jesus in all his humanity. The incongruity of a sacred figure inhabiting secular literary forms nevertheless tested the limits of modern realist style no less than the doctrine of Christ's divinity.<br>

  Abstract: Deeply shaped by the presentiment of an impending catastrophe, the dialogue between Adorno and Benjamin depicts a melancholy constellation. In a previous chapter, we have already observed the ambivalent assessments of Benjamin on melancholy, as they appear in both his book on the German tragic drama and his strongly critical review of Erich Kästner’s novels. Now, it is important to emphasize the melancholic character of Benjamin himself. According to many witnesses, melancholy was his deepest disposition; it also explains his fascination with
                  Angelus Novus, the Paul Klee painting that he acquired in Munich at the beginning of the 1920s, which<br>

  Author(s): ROMBERG RAQUEL<br>
  Abstract: In this intimate ethnography, Raquel Romberg seeks to illuminate the performative significance of healing rituals and magic works, their embodied nature, and their effectiveness in transforming the states of participants by focusing on the visible, albeit mostly obscure, ways in which healing and magic rituals proceed. The questions posed by Romberg emerge directly from the particular pragmatics of Puerto Rican brujería (witch-healing), shaped by the eclecticism of its rituals, the heterogeneous character of its participants, and the heterodoxy of its moral economy.<br>

  Abstract: While the nondiscursive, frequently digressive character of the
      Mnemosyne-Atlascomplicates any linear narrative of its themes and contents, Christopher D. Johnson traces several thematic sequences in the panels. By drawing on Warburg's published and unpublished writings and by attending to Warburg's cardinal idea that "pathos formulas" structure the West's cultural memory, Johnson maps numerous tensions between word and image in theMnemosyne-Atlas. In addition to examining the work itself, he considers the literary, philosophical, and intellectual-historical implications of theMnemosyne-Atlas. As Johnson demonstrates, theMnemosyne-Atlasis not simply the culmination of Warburg's lifelong study of Renaissance culture but the ultimate expression of his now literal, now metaphoric search for syncretic solutions to the urgent problems posed by the history of art and culture.<br>

  Book Title: Outlaw Rhetoric-Figuring Vernacular Eloquence in Shakespeare's England<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mann Jenny C.<br>
  Abstract: A central feature of English Renaissance humanism was its reverence for classical Latin as the one true form of eloquent expression. Yet sixteenth-century writers increasingly came to believe that England needed an equally distinguished vernacular language to serve its burgeoning national community. Thus, one of the main cultural projects of Renaissance rhetoricians was that of producing a "common" vernacular eloquence, mindful of its classical origins yet self-consciously English in character. The process of vernacularization began during Henry VIII's reign and continued, with fits and starts, late into the seventeenth century. However, as Jenny C. Mann shows in
         Outlaw Rhetoric, this project was beset with problems and conflicts from the start.<br>

  Book Title: The Faustian Century-German Literature and Culture in the Age of Luther and Faustus<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Weeks Andrew<br>
  Abstract: The Reformation and Renaissance, though segregated into distinct disciplines today, interacted and clashed intimately in Faust, the great figure that attained European prominence in the anonymous 1587 'Historia von D. Johann Fausten'. The original Faust behind Goethe's great drama embodies a remote culture. In his century, Faust evolved from an obscure cipher to a universal symbol. The age explored here as "the Faustian century" invested the 'Faustbuch' and its theme with a symbolic significance still of exceptional relevance today. The new essays in this volume complement one another, providing insights into the tensions and forces that gave the century its distinct character. Several essays seek Faust's prototypes. Others elaborate the symbolic function of his figure and discern the resonance of his tale in conflicting allegiances. This volume focuses on the intersection of historical accounts and literary imaginings, on shared aspects of the work and its times, on concerns with obedience and transgression, obsessions with the devil and curiosity about magic, and quandaries created by shifting religious and worldly authorities.

  Abstract: For many reasons, we can consider the sixteenth century a Faustian age.

That person or character is Faust himself, who embodies the zeitgeist or spirit of the age.

  Book Title: El niño en el cine argentino de la postdictadura (1983-2008)-alegoría y nostalgia<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): DUFAYS SOPHIE<br>
  Abstract: Este libro constituye la primera monografía dedicada al papel del niño en el cine latinoamericano. El análisis detallado de una decena de películas argentinas de la post-dictadura dirigidas entre 1983 y 2008, incluyendo tanto clásicas (La historia oficial, Un lugar en el mundo) como olvidadas (Amigomio, El rigor del destino), revela cómo la mirada y el lenguaje del niño son puestos al servicio de una alegoría nostálgica, estructurada en torno a la memoria o al lenguaje verbal y vinculada a la figura del padre ausente. Dufays combina los análisis fílmicos con una amplia reflexión teórica sobre las cuatro nociones clave de alegoría, melancolía, nostalgia y duelo y los articula con una genealogía de la figura alegórica del niño en las tradiciones narrativas latinoamericanas. Este recorrido permite al lector explorar las significaciones simbólicas y discursivas que el personaje infantil, la infancia y la familia han adquirido en el cine y en el contexto postdictatorial argentino. Sophie Dufays es investigadora postdoctoral del Fondo Nacional de Investigación Científica de Bélgica, en la Universidad de Louvain-la-Neuve. This book is the first monograph devoted to the role of the child in Latin American cinema. Through close analysis of about ten Argentine fiction films of the post-dictatorship period directed between 1983 and 2008, including both classic such as The Official Story and A Place in the World) and forgotten works such as Amigomío and El rigor del destino. Dufays shows how the child's gaze and language are a means of focusing a nostalgic form of allegory, structured around either memory or verbal language, and related to the figure of the absent father. In combining these analyses with a wide theoretical articulation of four key notions (allegory, melancholy, mourning and nostalgia) and with a genealogy of the allegorical child character in Latin American narrative traditions, Relatos de infancia allows the reader to explore the meanings that childhood and fa~<br>

  Abstract: Unlike any other medium, literature has the ability to employ the reader’s imagination in the construction of bodies. When a narrator communicates information about a text’s characters, the reader completes the act of constructing bodies by imagining their contours, postures, and gestures. A character’s gender is thus dependent upon both the narrator’s speech—his/her use of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives—and the reader’s expectations regarding gender. If the narrator omits information about the character’s gender, the reader finds clues in the text—social cues, behaviors, and actions—to fill in that information and assign one. Such moments activate literature’s potential<br>

Conversely, the metaphor of the portrait suggests that biographies can capture the character of a subject, bringing a person to life through ‘attention to detail and skill in representation’ (Lee 2009, 2).

Human beings find meaning and identity in the temporal character of existence (Urry 1991, Collinson 2003).

  Abstract: Orthodoxy, as already suggested, through the dialectical interaction of her religious content—doctrinal and functional—with the national substance of the Serbian being, sacralises the identity of the latter in the confines of the human–divine communion. Spatial, sacramental, historical, temporal, aesthetic, and spiritual signifiers or referents of faith contribute toward the constitution of a holistic and objectified experience that permeates the nature of the national collectivity. A genealogy of right belief, underlined by the “mediative” presence of venerated patriots and the autocephaly of ecclesiastical institutions, concretise the convergence of the catholic and universal character of Orthodoxy into a unique<br>

  Abstract: By referring to the Muslim Canon in Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, it is my intention to underline the specific character of the perspective I wish to cast in this essay upon the Koran and the canonical texts that complement it. It is primarily an historical perspective, insensitive to the mythological accounts one normally encounters with respect to the histories of significant events and times—historical events, often construed as born virtually complete and pristine.<br>

  Abstract: When we think about the various visible objects that comprise the landscape of the ancient Greek epic, the first to come to mind are the Shield of Achilles, the scepter of the Achaians, and the bed shared by Penelope and Odysseus. These objects—whether unique or of a general class—are like snapshots in the epic narrative. Individually, they have been the focus of extensive scholarship on the poems, principally in terms of their metonymic relationship to the narrative at large (

Abstract: Linguistic anthropology is not a unified field, but it does have some commonly held theoretical views and practices. Many have been consistent over time. Two obvious ones are the importance of learning a field language and the importance of collecting language data, understood broadly as anything from eliciting text to recording naturally occurring speech, for a variety of research aims. As for a general model of language as culture, there is a clear shared sense that language is structured and structuringthat it is a cultural practice both deriving from and helping to constitute society and culture. Linguistic phenomena have unconscious character (as Boas argued) as well as regularities of communicative practice and certain persistent features of reference (Sapir
         1949:104) that function in the production of shared meaning or some approximation of it. Well before the linguistic anthropologists of Durantis third paradigm started thinking about practice theory and performativity, Sapir articulated this view: While we often speak of society as though it were a static structure defined by tradition it is only apparently a static sum of social institutions; actually it is being reanimated or creatively reaffirmed from day to day by particular acts of a communicative nature which obtain among the individuals participating in it.b[1931]<br>

Abstract: “What interests us here … is how art functions as communication,” Luhmann says (p. 39), and that is the crux of his conception of art: it is the medium and not the message that is important. The work of art is produced
      exclusivelyfor the purpose of communication and that it accomplishes this goal or fails to do so by facing the usual, and perhaps increased, risks involved in all communication. Art communicatesby using perceptions contrary to their primary purpose. … Art seeks a different kind of relationship between perception and communication—one that is irritating and defies normality—and just this is communicated” (pp. 22–23; author’s emphasis). Thus, what is most interesting about Luhmann’s view of art is also what is most interesting about his general theory: its sophisticated and elaborate explorations in the evolutionary development of the media of communication, which are perhaps unparalleled in contemporary theory. But due to his bracketing of the cultural dimension of art, he views the message or meaning that the artwork itself claims to convey as wholly residual. And what is art without meaning? Not only is this a problem for art, it is a problem for Luhmann’s theory; he cannot clearly define the source of art’s “irritating” character nor the “normality” it seeks to defy because he brackets the ideas and ideals that constitute the meaning (read: message) of any conceivable artwork. This gives the 300‐plus pages of Luhmann’s book a rather repetitive and tiring quality; it constantly seems as if he is writingaroundart rather thanaboutit. This is the price he pays for a theory in which the criterion is systems complexity rather than cultural meaning.<br>

Author(s): Mialet Hélène<br>
Abstract: According to Polanyi:
         
               The computer, in the present context, has thus become an appendix of the human body owing to the acquisition of a number of skills that Hawking has mastered: the rapidity with which he touches his commutator, the manipulation of certain operations for selecting words in the construction of sentences, the choice of the right keys to activate the synthetic voice.To use language in speech, reading and writing, is to extend our bodily equipment and become intelligent human beings. We may say that when we learn to use language, or a probe, or a tool, and thus make ourselves aware of these things as we are of our body, we
            interiorizethese things andmake ourselves dwell in them.42
               43As one would say of an individual who has mastered all the subtleties of a new language, he has, as one of his students points out, “become totally ‘fluent’ with his computer.” The designer of Hawking’s software, Walter Woltosz, recalls that Hawking could be much faster with using a new software called EZ Keys at carrying on a conversation, but Hawking thinks that he is faster on Equalizer: “It is burned into his brain. He has been using it for fifteen years … fifteen hours a day and he knows it so well that he is very comfortable with it.… It really is an extension of himself now.”44As Polanyi says, “Every time we assimilate a tool to our body our identity undergoes some change; our person expands into new modes of being,”45or, as Drew Leder suggests, in the tradition of Merleau‐Ponty: “The true relation between body and instrument, phenomenological rather than crudely materialistic in character, is only revealed when we reverse the analogy. It is not that the body is like a tool, but that the tool is like a second sort of body, incorporated into and extending our corporeal powers.”46“To incorporate a tool is to redesign one’s extended body until its extremities expressly mesh with the world” (
               , p. 34).AB~<br>

Abstract: As the memory of the sufferings of Puritans and Dissenters faded into the distant past, it was important to maintain the strength of Dissenting loyalties among each new generation by keeping their history alive. Joshua Toulmin, Dissenting minister, historian, and editor of the 1790s edition of Neal, commented: “The youth of the present day grow up at a great distance of time from the transactions and events, under the immediate and lively impressions of which their ancestors were formed to support, with enlightened minds and consistent firmness, the character of Protestant Dissenters and Advocates of Religious Liberty.”
      63But, Toulmin advises, there is no shortage of appropriate works of history to keep on the shelves of the family library, and it would encourage younger members of Dissenting families if some of the shorter and more readable of them were “always lying on the table in the parlour.”64<br>

Abstract: Not only does man know that he does not know himself, even if this were only because within his most intimate depths he discovers an unfathomable memory: “Magna vis est memoriae, nescio quid horrendum, Deus meus, profunda et infinita multiplicitas. Et hoc animus est et hoc ego ipse sum. Quid ego sum Deus? Quae natura sum?” (“Great is the power of memory, an awe‐inspiring mystery, my God, a power of profound and infinite multiplicity. And this is mind, this is I myself. What then am I, my God? What is my nature?”).
         31But above all, man understands, within this impasse, that the one who is alone in knowing him remains for him another, namely, God: “Utrum ita sim, nescio. Minus mihi in hac re notus sum ipse quam tu. Obsecro te, Deus meus, et me ipsum mihi indica” (“Whether I am one or the other I do not know. In this matter I know myself less well than I know you. I beseech you, my God, show me myself”).32Under Augustine’s analysis, man’s incomprehensibility to himself thus takes on yet wider and vaster dimensions. To begin with, as in the Greek fathers, the analysis points out not only the image and likeness of God within man’s incomprehensibility but also a unique privilege held by the human being with regard to all other creatures (which only resemble theirgenus, which is to say, themselves). Next, this incomprehensibility tells man that he goes beyond and exceeds himself, in short that “l’homme passe infiniment l’homme” (“man transcends man”), following the formulation of an exemplary Augustinian: in a word, man passes beyond his own means, man lives above his means.33Finally and above all, according to a strict consequence, only the infinite and incomprehensible can comprehend man, and thus tell him of and show him to himself; only God can reveal man to man, because man only reveals himself by revealing, without knowing it, the one whose image he bears. Not only is it true that “Je est un autre” (I is another), but this other calls himself God within man,~<br>

Abstract: In the parallel English colonial tradition, we might think of a Lawrence Durrell character from the “Alexandria Quartet” (1957–60) or one of the sophisticated European archeologists in Anthony Minghella’s film
            The English Patient(1996), dining, drinking, and dancing to jazz at the country club. Braudel,The Mediterranean,2d ed., 2:1239, 1242–43, adds references to Durrell and other novelists—Carlo Levi alone is cited in the first edition (pp. 1091–92)—to emphasize “those local, permanent, unchanging and much repeated features which are the ‘constants’ of Mediterranean history.” Braudel even quotes Durrell, “Under the formal pageant of events which we have dignified by our interest, the land changes very little, and the structure of the basic self of man hardly at all.”<br>

Abstract: By extending these ideas on reading to a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur is able to argue that identity is a temporal structure that rests on narrative, as well as a project that is ongoing for individuals during their lifetime. Reading is central to this project because it is only in reading that the dynamism of configuration completes its course; in other words, the passage from prefiguration via configuration to refiguration results in transfiguration of worlds. In this relationship of worlds, it is the person as reader who takes this journey [
         21]. His thesis is that “the process of composition, of configuration, does not realize itself in the text but in the reader, and under this condition configuration makes possible refiguration of a life by way of the narrative” [44, p. 430]. As part of this, a person can be called upon to make an account of herself, and such an account, Ricoeur argues, involves a positing of a beginning, a middle with its highs and lows, and an ending [14]. Through composition, or configuration, this account is dynamic; we can weave different plots about our lives. Ricoeur reminds us that “just as it is possible to compose several plots on the subject of the same incidents … so it is always possible to weave different, even opposed, plots about our lives” [30, p. 248]. But, simultaneously, a life can have the quality of being singular and complete. In terms of a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur best captures this when he argues that “to understand oneself is to understand oneself as one confronts the text and to receive from it the conditions for a self other than that which first undertakes the reading. Neither of the two subjectivities, neither that of the author nor that of the reader, is thus primary in the sense of an originary presence of the self to itself” [44, p. 17]. For Ricoeur, it is through this task that we achieve, by dint of effort, a dynamic balancing of a sense of self, which is, on the one~<br>

Abstract: There is nothing particularly new or different about the politics Haraway articulates if one compares it to the strategies of the New Left in the sixties, to different versions of French poststructuralist theory, or to some versions of postcolonial theory in their postmodern, discursive guise. As Michael Ryan suggests, the New Left’s strength was precisely its diversity and diffuse nature. He argues that the binarism posited between a unified, authoritative, effective politics and ineffective anarchy is simplistic: “It is possible to combine a sense of commonality amid diversity, firmness of resistance, and aggressivity of attack with a plurality of different struggles” (
         1982, 216). Similarly, Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe’s (1985, 167–71) ideas of resistance are based on radical pluralism, the blurring of frontiers, and the unsutured character of the social. For Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari (1983, 76), the schizophrenic (like the cyborg) ruptures wholeness and puts disjunctions to affirmative use: “He is and remains in disjunction.” Deleuze and Guattari’s later concepts, such as rhizomatic thought and nomadism, are similar attempts to name disruptive ontologies. Finally, Haraway’s politics has much in common with Homi Bhabha’s (1994, 11, 207–9) valorization of interstitial and border spaces as sites for solidarity, and with his celebration of hybridity as a metaphor for postcolonial writing, colonial discourse, and colonized identities.9<br>

Abstract: I borrow Min’s helpful definition of religion as “concrete totalities”: “a system of symbols that comprises beliefs, rituals, and practices that embody the collective self‐understanding of its adherents within a ‘plausibility structure’ (Peter Berger), i.e., those objective socio‐historical conditions that render such self‐understanding plausible” (Min, “Dialectical Pluralism,” 590). For the dynamic models of culture that stress the indeterminate, hybrid, conflictual, and contested character of cultural identity formation predicated on sociohistorical processes and an understanding of religion in accordance with those models of culture, see Tanner,

Abstract: Tesauro, “La Simpatia,” in
            Panegirici, pt. 2, 44. It is interesting to note that, in theAdmonitions, Francis of Assisi states that God “created and formed” (creavit et formavit) man in the image of his beloved Son “according to the body” (secundum corpus) and in his likeness “according to the soul” (secundum spiritum). See Francis of Assisi,Admonitiones, inOpuscula, ed. Caietanus Esser (Grottaferrata, Rome: Collegii S. Bonaventurae, 1978), chap. 5, 65–66. Compare Eric Doyle and Damian McElrath, “St. Francis of Assisi and the Christocentric Character of Franciscan Life and Doctrine,” inFranciscan Christology, ed. Damian McElrath (St. Bonaventure, NY: Franciscan Institute, 1994), 1–13: “It seems clear that [Francis] is asserting … that the first Adam was created after the image of the second Adam, Jesus Christ. The body of the Incarnate Word … was the blueprint for the bodies of the first human beings” (7).<br>

Abstract: As stated in
         The Identity of Jesus Christ, the narrative set forth in the Gospels sets forth a Christian way of reading in which Jesus’s identity is understood as the conjunction of his enacted intention, the enacted intentions of God and others, and the circumstances in which he finds himself, including Israel’s history with God. The narrative of Christ’s life serves as a “summation” of Israel’s history, as scripturally narrated.42Jesus’s identity is thus the continuation, and intensification, of this history, and the narrative is of his making this history his own. Continually, however, such appropriation is shaped by Jesus’s obedience to God; his “identity” is thus found in his responsive actions, rather than his own intentionality. His obedience to God, as the unifying element of his character, integrates varied states of character and existence: “There is no power for salvation in such pre‐established, paradoxical qualities as helplessness and power, guilt and purity, either in themselves or apart from him. They become efficacious because they arehisand because he holds them together in the enactment of his obedience to God.”43<br>

Abstract: In the religious domain, too, both perspectives are needed. The participant perspective is necessary to get to know and understand our own religion better, even if we have grown up in it. A religion can only be understood by examining it from the inside, experiencing its myths and rituals from the inside, and joining personally in the community. Conversely, we only get to know the distinctive character of our own religion by comparing its structures and processes with those of other religions and determining the similarities and differences between people’s religious experiences in our own and in other religions. In short, we need to (learn to) switch between the participant and observer perspectives not only in respect of other religions but also in respect of our own.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: The Platonic responsible self or soul cares for itself and achieves in this manner a resemblance—however temporary—to the gods by measuring itself against the Good. The Christian self’s responsibility rests on its relation to an other. It is neither a relation of the self to itself, nor one that the self can freely choose to take upon itself, nor one that it can ignore. Rather, “the Christian reversal’ that converts the Platonic conversion
      in turn, involves the entrance upon the scene of a gift” (GD,p. 40). Patočka argues that, in Christianity, the “responsible life was itself presented as a gift from something which ultimately, though it has the character of the Good, has also the traits of the inaccessible and forever superior to humans—the traits of themysteriumthat always has the final word” (HE,p. 106). Understanding responsibility as a gift makes all the difference. Such an understanding makes responsibility into a function of an event, the singular event of a gift by another, which, furthermore, is addressed to the human as a singular human being. In fact, the gift, insofar as it is always directed specifically atthishuman being, is constitutive of his or her singularity and irreplaceability. But, according to Christianity, responsibility is also a gift that comes from an absolute other, that is, a self‐effacing Goodness that gives this gift in selfless love and to which the donee is thus constitutively unable to respond in kind. As a consequence,
            
      there is thus a structural disproportion or dissymmetry between the finite and responsible mortal on the one hand and the goodness of the infinite gift on the other hand.… It inevitably transforms the experience of responsibility into one of guilt: I have never been and never will be up to the level of this infinite goodness nor up to the immensity of the gift, the frameless immensity that must in general define (
         in‐define) a gift as such. [GD,p. 51]<br>

Abstract: The current return to a historical present teeming with competing temporalities from the past recalls both repetitions from other times and places and what perceiving them meant for social theory. Specifically, this recognition refers to those attempts envisaged by people like Tosaka and Maurice Halbwachs before World War II who sought to account for the spectacle of mixed temporalities in the present. Both, it is important to acknowledge, discounted the veracity of history’s claims to a true time and proposed conceptions of temporality they believed to be emanating from the historical process itself (as they conceived it). The consequence of Halbwachs’s and Tosaka’s interventions was to deprivilege state archives and thus shifted the order of the Hegelian allegory symbolizing the conflict between Chronos, the god of Time, and Zeus, the god of politics who created state and hearth. In this struggle, Chronos, who inevitably devours his own, engulfing all in his passage, is ultimately dominated by Zeus, who creates the state, which in turn conquers time. Just as important is the state’s capacity to transform in history all that Mnemosyne—the goddess of memory—had been able to collect after the rampaging passage of time.
         25It is also worth mentioning that while Halbwachs codified the separation of history from memory and upheld the claims of the latter over the former (that is to say, the claims of time over space) the effort to rematerialize time—yet retain its qualitative character—by freeing it from an interiorized, psychological consciousness was not attempted in Europe or America, but Japan. Tosaka’s critique of what he called “borrowed time,”26referring to history’s reliance on conceptions of time from other disciplines—the physical sciences, but especially the inner time consciousness of phenomenology and even mythology—and his identification of the everyday (especially as lived by the worker) revealed the real source of historical time, the “mystery of~<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: Stories begin with a view to their end; just as types must take their bearings from antitypes. Both of these truisms meet in the Adamic myth’s orientation to a future that overcomes the breach occasioned by the fall and, for Christian readers, through one who will mediate a new covenant of salvation. Thus, unlike the Babylonian cosmogonic myth that was directed toward “cultural‐ritual re‐enactment” of a past event and the Greek tragic myth that explained the present “spectacle of Terror and Pity,” the Adamic myth was most essentially eschatological: it was oriented to the “man to come.”
         78This was for Christianity the “second‐man,” the offer of “so much more” in Jesus Christ. Intermediate types were offered by the biblical narrative, however: figures that represented the promise of overcoming the fall and of ideal fulfillment of human potential asimago dei. In the traditional narrative, Abraham is the first and most fully drawn of such figures.79In the character of Enoch, Smith found an earlier figure to suggest another measure of human potential: theurgy, or the right to access heavenly powers and even to influence future events related to salvation.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: Against the first characterization of Advaita teaching, the recognition of the double‐voiced character of Śaṅkara’s interpretation of the
         anayatvamsutra (II.1.14)—that is, as internally constituted by the realist cosmological discourse that it subverts—suggests that the interpretation of theBhāṣya’steaching in terms of the illusionist doctrine ofmāyāvādais reductionistic. Moreover, well‐intentioned attempts to dissociate Śaṅkara frommāyāvādathat presume a monological conception of theBhāṣya’sdiscourse, attempts such as that of Srinivasa Rao mentioned above, end up effectively conceding the claim they set out to deny; their affirmation of the reality of the world typically appeals to a denial of substantial change, a claim that implicitly relegates changing, finite existences to the realm of the unreal.114As for the static and abstract conception of brahman, this notion can be seen as the result of the later tradition’s attempt to impose a rigid, categorical distinction between the concepts ofīśvaraand the highest (paraṃ) brahman. This effort to systematize Śaṅkara’s somewhat inconsistent, fluid, and intuitive use of the termīśvarawith respect to the various expressions for brahman effectively pulls apart the dialectical interplay between the personalistic and impersonalistic aspects of brahman in theBrahma‐sūtra‐Bhāṣya. What Hacker characterizes as an “illogical” combination of intuitive theism and intellectual monism can perhaps be better understood as an instance of what Michael Sells, in a discussion of apophatic language in the West, calls “a discourse of double propositions.”115A reading of theBrahma‐sūtra‐Bhāṣyathat appreciates the creative interplay among this text’s multiple voices preserves the vitality and intensity of theBhāṣya’sdiscourse on brahman, a liveliness of expression that we may assume more accurately reflects Śaṅkara’s religious vision.<br>

Her argument intersects with mine at points, as when she argues that “the problems which beset the heroines of the 1970s classics were never resolved” (Whelehan2005, 6). “Nowhere is this more apparent,” she writes, “than in the open endings of the novels where the central character may find herself alone, or on the threshold of decisions, always looking back” (5).

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: In his notion of involuntary memory, Marcel corrects the Aristotelian principle that an object of the imagination that is imprinted in memory cannot coincide with the present experience of the object itself, because “there is no such thing as memory of the present.” Although he espouses the Aristotelian principle that “one can only imagine what is absent,” Marcel sees this principle as invalidated whenever the essential character of a presently experienced sensation coincides with that of a sensation imprinted in memory. In such an instance, one can enjoy the impression of the present sensation to the fullest; thanks to the intensifying “application” of one’s imagination of it, one enjoys, in other words, the impression that a sensation or event from the past is being concretely resuscitated in the here and now. This imaginative appreciation of the present throws one into the bliss of a dimension “emancipated from the order of time” (affranchie de l’ordre du temps) and makes one oblivious of or indifferent to the squalor of one’s “directly felt reality.” Aristotle, “On Memory,” in

Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Viewed in these Augustinian terms, just‐war morality invites one to ask what a war means—how we interpret ourselves and others regarding matters of life and death. Death raises fundamental questions regarding horizons of meaning and desire, and war asks in the starkest terms whether its participants are willing to impose or take on the ultimate sacrifice. In this respect we continue to travel with Augustine despite our distance from him. For surely he would have us ask whether we possess a second‐order framework for determining whether the desires aroused by killing, death, and sacrifice are themselves desirable. That is to say, Augustine would have us ask about the effects of killing on individual and corporate character and how death affects the practices of self‐interpretation and the public history we wish to write about ourselves. War for Augustine was not only a matter of personal virtue and vice; it also raised questions of meaning and memory as these bear upon the formation of civic identity and the construction of desire across generations.<br>

Abstract: It is explicitly cinema's contribution of new concepts that prompts Rodowick, in another state‐of‐the‐field article, to hitch both Deleuze and Stanley Cavell to an enterprise within “philosophy” rather than within “theory,” whose energy he declares to be drained.
         47For theory seems too programmatic and imperious, whether driven by science in Althusser's sense (Grand Theory) or by models taken from natural and cognitive science (posttheory). Defending the latter, in a rebuke to Rodowick, Malcolm Turvey proudly reminds us that once continental film studies had been deracinated from the anglophone field, thanks largely to the relentless analyses of Noël Carroll, room was cleared for specific, targeted, and useful work. Turvey runs through a litany of recent and distinct gains in theories of emotion, editing, perception, imagination, pleasure, music, comprehension, interpretation, character identification, narrative, and suspense.48While those who write books and articles in these areas invariably do so by turning to well‐developed notions in the social sciences or philosophy, they do so, Turvey believes, from the strength of their own discipline. Here he connects to something I have been advocating all along; “most of us are not philosophers, sociologists, or economists butfilmscholars. What this means is that, at the end of the day, we have to use our expertise—gained from watching large numbers of films, observing them and the response of viewers to them carefully, and learning about the contexts in which they were made and exhibited—to evaluate the theories we take from other disciplines in terms of whether they successfully explain (or not) film.”49<br>

Author(s): Mrozik,  Susanne<br>
Abstract: In another respect, however, Mrozik’s work moves beyond the aims of classical historical and philological research by attempting to engage this text as a “living argument” that has implications for how contemporary scholars and religious practitioners should engage in ethical reflection. This engagement represents the second goal of her work, to “explore the ethical implications of the
      Compendium of Training's discourse on bodies for both medieval and contemporary audiences” (7), a goal that she takes up explicitly only in a brief concluding chapter. This project clearly resonates with the work of other contemporary scholars, including those who, influenced by feminist and postcolonial critiques of positivist methodologies, emphasize the intersubjective character of human encounter and understanding. Here Mrozik, drawing on Ricoeur’s work, employs a feminist “hermeneutics of recovery and suspicion” that seeks to take seriously the truth claims presented by the text as a valuable resource for contemporary ethics while also critiquing the text’s validation of particular social hierarchies, including those based on sex and caste. The author questions the assertion of some scholars that Indian Mahayana Buddhism invariably represented an elevation of the status of Buddhist women and argues against attempts to downplay evidence of sexual inequality by recourse to the Buddhist doctrine of “emptiness.” For Mrozik, the diverse forms of human embodiment provide the ground on which a serious engagement with ideals of human virtue must proceed.<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: Similar illustrations of immanent dispossession abounded during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. While Fénelon's censure in 1699 appeared to neutralize the threat posed by mysticism, Christian apologists turned from this victory to confront attacks on human agency stemming from Spinozist and materialist circles. A key battle in this polemic was fought over the status of free will as a property of the thinking subject, whether human or divine. Spinoza aimed to demonstrate that God acts
         asnature, notonnature, and out of sheer necessity. Created beings operated under a similar compulsion. The distinction between subject and object, famously associated with Descartes, was thereby dissolved. To cite theEthics(1677): “When we say that the human mind perceives this or that thing, we say nothing else than that God possesses this or that idea.”46In other words, the subject's thoughts are not its own, unique to itself, but are the manifestation of God thinking in the world and through the mind. It followed from this premise that “there is no absolute or free will,” a conclusion that undermined the possibility of transcendence for any being.47Spinoza therefore understood the highest form of wisdom, which he called the “intellectual love of God,” to be the recognition of the determined character of our existence. We are, he asserted, “part of the whole of nature, whose order we follow.”48In consequence, true liberty “is to be and to remain chained by the bonds of [God's] love.”49And this love, Spinoza claimed, was not directed toward the individual human person. It was, on the contrary, “part of the infinite love with which God loves Himself.”50For Spinoza, then, intellectual love is radically self-referential—not to the human subject, but to divine substance. The beatified self exists merely as an effect of God/Nature's immanent presence and totalizing force. At the same time, Spinoza extended dispossession beyond what Fénelon's Christian beliefs would permit~<br>

Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: More, of course, remains to be said about the character of the prophetic and promissory in this scene, the tableau of a table host giving to those who desert him in the moments before his betrayal and eventual execution. Much remains to be developed in conversation with Tillich’s work to continue the work of political reasoning in and with the prophetic, searching for other ways and rationale to take the form or locus of divine promise and the character of the interaction between God’s gift as participation in the divine being, the breath of the Spirit that gives life and the promise that renews all things—all important subjects to which Tillich and others contribute. Nevertheless, the concept of possibility and promised being that we have found can develop and expand a concept of the political that does not include what it excludes, indeed, does not embrace only the abandoned. By finding the sign of the promise, we have discovered that being otherwise than sovereign does not move beyond ordinary sovereignty. It does not seek to dispel the realm of political autonomy with an ecclesial life beyond the realm of nonecclesial humanity. Yet, it recognizes the embrace of the marginal and barbarian that ordinary sovereignty includes by excluding. Finally, owing to the indeterminate character of a promissory note, the pledge, it does not trump, overwhelm, or absorb the world. It rather opens and transforms it from within with its unlooked‐for gift of possibility.<br>

Abstract: Here, via simile, Dante makes the observable action of the nonhuman creature in the natural world parallel the actions of the blessed, as it evades being a mere sign; in its immanence, it becomes analogous to the blessed in their transcendent condition, the living proof of the order and harmony of creation in which creatures “share the being of another,” as Coetzee's character puts it.<br>

Abstract: Due to the encyclopedic character of the work and the extensive range it covers, however, certain significant thinkers are often treated too quickly, whereas other, more marginal thinkers are treated too closely. This is particularly the case in his treatment of hermeneutics in the “pre-modern” period. For example, in chapter 6, entitled “From the Third Century to the Thirteenth Centuries,” he covers no fewer than twenty-four thinkers. At times, one feels flooded and inundated with a litany of references and historical facts, and it is easy to get confused as to the overall trajectory and purpose of the chapter and how it contributes to the formation and development of hermeneutics. The work would have been better served if it was more balanced and had devoted the same kind of sustained attention and precision to important “pre-modern” thinkers that it devoted to many key figures in modern and contemporary hermeneutics. In the same vein, in the rush to cover the history of hermeneutics, chapters are often oddly divided. For instance, the reader may be surprised to find the thought of Karl Barth lumped in together with structuralism and poststructuralism in a chapter loosely titled, “Some Mid-Twentieth Century Approaches.” It remains unclear as to why such disparate figures and strands of thought are gathered together into a single chapter, and it thus lacks the tightness and coherence of argument that it otherwise could have. If certain sections may glide over thinkers too quickly and other sections pay attention too closely, there are, despite the encyclopedic range of this book, certain gaps altogether in the history of hermeneutics that Thistleton offers. Thistleton himself concedes in his conclusion, for example, that there is insufficient attention paid particularly to Catholic biblical scholarship, which clearly indicates a way of introducing hermeneutics from a distinctly Protestant perspective. Any work that seeks to introduce a subject matter necessarily ma~<br>

Article Title: Still Life in a Narrative Age: Charlie Kaufman's<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 659348<br>
Date: 4 2011<br>
Author(s): Landy Joshua<br>
Abstract: Neither—to return to the earlier objection—has Kaufman quite yielded to the narrativity brigades by agreeing to tell that time-honored story, “Charlie becomes a writer.”
         36To be sure, the fictional character Charlie “grows” and “adapts” and “learns” and “overcomes obstacles to succeed in the end.” But above and behind Charlie, we sense the existence of an entity who doesnotgrow and adapt and learn, an entity who may well feel, with Susan, that “for a person, adapting is almost shameful; it's like running away,” an entity who has been more or less the same since the days ofBeing John Malkovitch. Here is where the distinction between Charlie and Kaufman, which might seem like a technical issue, actually becomes of prime importance (figs. 5–6). In the movie, one might say, Charlie becomes Donald. But, in real life, there is no Donald; in real life, there is only Kaufman, someone who is, we assume, an amalgam of Charlie and Donald, at once, enduringly, with an inexorable combat being unchangingly waged in his head, that marvellous, mysterious head into which Valerie Thomas, in the opening scene, expresses a desire to climb. From this point of view, the film is a spurious diachrony concealing a genuine synchrony; only superficially the story of how Charlie became Donald,Adaptationis, at a deeper level, the entirely nonnarrative portrait of a never-changing Kaufman.37<br>

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>

Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: Even to consider these questions, let alone to feel stirred or moved by them, is, it seems, to begin to doubt the goodness of God.
      38And to doubt the goodness of God, even if you still believe in his existence, is to slide into what was generally understood in the period as atheism.39Perhaps that is why Prynne accused acting companies of “prophanely” playing the history of Faustus despite the fact that the play stages the orthodoxy of the unrepentant magician's damnation. Or perhaps something else was at stake in Prynne's sense that the play was profane. Insofar as Faustus is compelling as a tragic character, his play will reveal the inexorable negativity at the heart of Protestant Christianity; it will lay bare not that damnation is predestined but that salvation itself entails self-obliteration into the absolute otherness of an inscrutable God. From a humanist perspective such Christianity is fundamentally tragic because the life that it offers universalizes all sensuous particularity, all subjectivity signified or even felt in the material embodiment of persons and texts. But the ultimate effect of Marlowe's play is not simply for the audience to doubt whether they should continue to desire God and salvation; rather, it is for the audience terrifyingly to feel that God is watching them doubt and, bending down his “ireful brows,” judging their thoughts and feelings and condemning them to the damnation that they are compelled to contemplate. And in a context where magic was a theatrical show created by the devil but permitted by God so he could see whether his subjects would, as Perkins put it, cleave to him or to the devil and his wicked instruments, to cleave in compassion to Faustus was to sense yourself entering into alliance with the devil, alienated from the inscrutable source of your immortal soul.<br>

Abstract: Yet Larmore also suspects the ideal of personal autonomy underlying the constricted view of the mind as a “mirror of the world”; he thinks it encourages the idea that we have to endorse or decide to adopt any “element of good or bad” or criterion found in the world before it can move us (104). But, while Larmore offers ample reasons to reject this view of the mind as essentially disengaged before its choices or endorsements, neither this disengaged view nor the suspect “specular model” of the mind in general follows from the more modest thesis that decision has a unique role to play in our agency—for decisions may always respond to considerations that are either apprehended as normative or potentially action guiding before we are intentionally committed to them, or to considerations that are dependent on past decisions (to which this same condition applies together with a ban on infinite regresses). Similarly, we should not construe “autonomous” decision or action as completely independent of all prior reasons or even of the community of language speakers in relation to which our thoughts have meaning (105). This is a straw man version of autonomy that goes beyond even Stoic autarky to total solipsism—as if Sartrean arbitrary choice were the only way to explain the concept of self-determination or deep responsibility for one’s character. Nor need Kant’s conception of autonomy imply that the world or order of reality itself cannot contain any normative facts (107), although it has sometimes been misread that way. Instead it may simply mean that distinctively moral norms are not essentially coercive—that right is not mere might—because they fit our fundamental nature as beings capable of making decisions in response to the other nonmoral normative aspects of reality that Larmore calls a “third ontological order” in addition to physical and psychological facts (126). Kant does not hold that our rational assent to moral norms is optional; it is implicit in what we are. ~<br>

Abstract: Some of the earliest forms of the generic notion of evil demarcate
            abominations—acts that, like incest, cannibalism, patricide—elicit horror and disgust. Abominations are violations, disorders of nature that issue in natural sanctions: plagues or expulsions. The world in whichevilis construed as a form ofsinful disobedienceis a world defined by a divinity who gives commands, exacts obedience, punishes, or rewards (Genesis and Exodus). A world focused on virtue andviceis a naturalistic, social world (Theophrastus, Butler, Mandeville). Virtues are those traits that—like courage and justice—preserve and enhance a community. The vices—greed, disloyalty, envy, self-indulgence, disrespect—threaten the social order. The origins and sanctions for vices are social: an unfortunate upbringing in a malformed polity can issue in the kind of corruption whose sanction is the loss of trust and cooperation. Withmalevolence(Pope Innocent III, Calvin), we enter a new world, a world of individual will and responsibility. While malevolence is normally marked by a defective will,sinfuses disobedience with a defiant will (Aquinas, Jonathan Edwards). But while the earliest forms of disobedience can be relatively innocent, sin presupposes that Everyman, in the full knowledge of the difference between good and evil, right and wrong, willfully violates the divine order by presumptuous pride (Milton’s Satan, Goethe’s Faust). When the disposition or proclivity to sin—construed as pride or egoism—becomes an inherently dominant and psychologically structuring motive, only divine grace can set aside divine punishment. Evil becomes less fraught when morality returns to the secular, social order during the Renaissance and Enlightenment. Setting aside the theology and metaphysics of sin, the new psychology turned to characterizing character traits that—like wanton cruelty—generate “man’s inhumanity to man” (Montaigne, Voltaire).Partiality, egoism—the desire for glory or selfinterest—remai~<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 674410<br>
Date: 02 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Rüpke Jörg<br>
Abstract: So far, two motifs for Varro’s historicizing seem to lurk between his compositional decisions and wordings. On the one hand, historicizing religion allows Varro to reconcile postulated rather than known origins, which are thought to be in accordance with philosophical reasoning, with the brute facts of contemporary religion. On the other hand, Varro is accounting for actual and observable change.
         
               The first motif points to the overall philosophical character of the work and it points to Varro’s striving at coherence in these sixteen books. The other motif fits very well into the context, which has been reconstructed for antiquarian writings in the century before the50
            Antiquitates, that is, the perception of accelerated change leading to attempts to document and systematize (and thereby frequently modify or even invent) tradition.

Article Title: Milton’s “Unoriginal” Voice: Quotation Marks in<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673750<br>

Author(s): Hequembourg Stephen<br>
Abstract: Dictates or inspires—so much in Milton’s great poem depends on such little words as “or.” As Peter Herman rightly notes, “the Miltonic ‘Or’ inscribes incertitude at the heart of
      Paradise Lost.”
               In both40
            Destabilizing Milton(2005) andThe New Milton Criticism(2012), we find compelling arguments against the critical urge to find inParadise Losta coherence of design and a consistency of belief, to disregard, that is, the poet’s own vacillations and contradictions or to resolve them too readily into a higher unity.
               As I have argued, the question of quotation marks and of the source of satanic speech reveals many such “undecidable” moments—literary knots that cannot be undone by any amount of critical savvy. One of the most destabilizing aspects of41
            Paradise Lostis that one simply cannot know who speaks some of the poem’s most important and memorable passages. But in this particular case, we confront, I believe, something vaster than the incertitude of a single mind (even one as wily and well stored as Milton’s). The argument of the poem involves the poet in the impossible task of imposing onto a sudden and inexplicable theological event the logic of narrative, with all its linear causality, foreshadowing, and character development. A drama of the fall must begin with either a push from outside or an inclination from within, but choosing either would be a theological disaster. The blocking of a voice’s origin is a crucial part of Milton’s aesthetic repertoire because it allows him to tell the story of original sin without falling into either extreme. The phenomenon of the unoriginal voice illustrates just how exquisitely crafted uncertainty can be in Milton, how it manifests itself in such minute discriminations: Does Eve quote or create the dream voice? Does Raphael report or invent? Does Satan play the serpent as an instrument, or does he make him sing? The “New Milton critics” are right to recognize the fund~<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Bonhoeffer’s critique of religion and morality and Badiou’s approach to Greek and Jewish discourses share an underlying negative, anti-idolatrous intuition that allows Bonhoeffer to preserve the holistic and gratuitous character of faith concurring with life and that enables Badiou to speak of the content of the “resurrection truth-event” as the exclusive source of the declaration’s force. Bonhoeffer focuses on acting on the word of Jesus by the participation in Jesus’s being for others, whereas Badiou stresses the importance of declaring the event by the subjective persistence of fidelity that constitutes truth’s substance. But in both cases, faith seen as the only accurate response to Jesus’s call to discipleship (Bonhoeffer)/the event interrupting the old order (Badiou) presupposes some sort of ontological “empty space” or “void” that makes faith as such possible and results in a new type of language that breaks up with traditional religious discourses.<br>

Abstract: The meaning of
         catharsisin Aristotle’sPoeticsis heavily debated, with most interpretations clustering around three key translations: purgation, purification, and clarification. In his 1599 treatise on tragicomedy, Giambattista Guarini likened catharsis to the medical procedure of purging, as neither seeks eradication of the target element but instead restoration of balance (The Compendium of Tragicomic Poetry (1599), inLiterary Criticism: Plato to Dryden, ed. Allan H. Gilbert [Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1962], 517–20; see also O. B. Hardison Jr., “Three Types of Renaissance Catharsis,” inPoetics and Praxis, Understanding and Imagination: The Collected Essays of O. B. Hardison, Jr.[Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1997], 78–94). Martha C. Nussbaum has characterized catharsis as a “clearing up” or “cleaning up” of emotions (“Tragedy and Self-Sufficiency: Plato and Aristotle on Fear and Pity,” inEssays on Aristotle’sPoetics, ed. Amélie Oksenberg Rorty [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1992], 280), and Gerald F. Else has argued that catharsis is a purification of the act of the character rather than a purgation of the emotions of the audience (Aristotle’s Poetics: The Argument[Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1963], 230–31, 422–40). John P. Anton, critiquing Nietzsche’s reading of Aristotle’sPoetics, argues that Nietzsche was incorrect in construing catharsis as a purge of emotions, also claiming that it is a clarification of events (“Nietzsche’s Critique of Aristotle’s Theory of Tragic Emotions,” inTragedy and Philosophy, ed. N. Georgopoulos [New York: St. Martin’s, 1993], 19–38). In light of this ongoing debate about the meaning of a single Greek word, several critics have suggested other language and models through which to examine the phenomenon of audience response to tragedy—a useful critical strategy for discussing how modern audiences might conceptualize their own reaction to what they see on stage.

Article Title: Poetics of Conspiracy and Hermeneutics of Suspicion in Tacitus's<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: ca.2013.32.issue-1<br>
Date: 04 2013<br>
Abstract: This article argues that the end of Tacitus's
         Dialogus de Oratoribusis inconclusive in ways that draw attention to the difficulty of interpretation not onlyofthe dialogue, as by modern scholars, but alsointhe dialogue, as by its leading characters. The inconclusiveness is especially marked by a commonly noted, but little discussed, feature of the end: when the rest of the characters laugh at the point of departure, Tacitus himself does not. Arguing that this difference of affective response on the part of the characters prefigures differences in interpretive response on the part of readers, the article identifies different strains in recent scholarship: pessimistic and optimistic. Both forms of response entail an attribution of a “poetics of conspiracy” (Hinds) to the ultimate speaker of the dialogue, the author Tacitus, and a “hermeneutics of suspicion” (Ricoeur) to its reader. At the same time, the author's double-position, as character and author, between narrated event and narration of the event to the reader, suggests that the other characters in the dialogue may, like the author and reader, also exercise such poetics and hermeneutics on one another and themselves. The article ends with thecomparandumof the first satire of Tacitus's near contemporary, Juvenal, suggesting that, in the case of these works that can look with hindsight on the social and political past of the Early Empire, their modes of transmission and reception may be politically determined (e.g., as conspiratorial, suspicious) but may also demonstrate, within the restrictions of social and political determinations, a high degree of contingency, reflexivity, and autonomy. Such possibilities suggest that the text itself is part of a pragmatic and performative tradition of the kind enacted by its characters, in addition to a tradition of the production of (comparatively static and unfree) “literary” works.<br>

Abstract: Conventional views of text/music relationships in early Italian opera focus on the imitation of affections. But by dealing exclusively with the referential meanings of texts (e.g., emotions, images, and concepts) these views overlook an important aspect of music's interaction with language. In opera, music also imitates language's contextual and communicative functions—i.e., discourse, as studied today by the subfield of linguistics called pragmatics. In his operas Monteverdi fully realized Peri's ideal of “imitating in song a person speaking” (“imitar col canto chi parla”) by musically emphasizing those context-dependent meanings that emerge especially in ordinary language and that are prominent in dramatic texts, as opposed to poetry and prose. Such meanings are manifest whenever words such as “I,” “here,” and “now” appear— words called “deictics”—with the function of situating the speaker/singer's utterances in a specific time and place. Monteverdi highlights deictics through melodic and rhythmic emphases, repetition, shifts of meter, style, and harmony, as part of a strategy to create a musical language suited to opera as a genre and to singers as actors. In
         Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patriaandL'incoronazione di Poppea, this strategy serves large-scale dramaturgical aims with respect to the relationships among space, time, and character identity, highlighting issues also discussed within the contemporary intellectual context.<br>

Article Title: Teaching Freedom? Postmodern Perspectives<br>
Publisher: American Educational Research Association<br>
Issue: i249760<br>
Date: 7 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Young Aaron<br>
Abstract: Postmodern theory is often seen as a realm either of totally free play--where anything goes and there are no rules at all--or of despair where all visions of equality and democracy are equated with totalitarianism. Coherent ways of talking about "actors" or "responsibility" can appear to be entirely repudiated. Further perceived as elitist, obscure, convoluted, and entirely removed from any kind of practical reality, postmodernism is often viewed as having nothing relevant to say to teachers or those interested in concretely improving education. This paper attempts to show that these visions are not entirely fair to the ways many "postmodern" theorists strive to explore carefully the myriad tensions invariably involved in politics and pedagogy or to the (perhaps surprising) egalitarian commitments that generally undergird their projects. Taking advantage of the fluid and ultimately undefinable character of the idea of the "postmodern," this paper draws from an eclectic group of thinkers, teasing out a range of different perspectives that might inform, complicate, and contest efforts to "teach freedom."<br>

Author(s): Schwaller De Lubicz William<br>
Abstract: This paper follows two purposes: the first to unpack some of the artistic cargo of symbols as distinct from the more conventional aspects of them (e. g., their ability to refer to other things or events, and their ability to communicate ideas), and the second to show, by means of contrasts, the actual workings of Interpretation Theory as it could be applied to the analysis of art-making and art-viewing. For the first purpose, the author draws material from philosophy, dramatic writings, linguistic theory, and statements of artists in an analytic search for the often intractable character of the artistic image. For the second purpose, the author demonstrates, through the use of logic and the poetic metaphor, how a particular form of hermeneutic inquiry can be applied to assist an understanding of the assumptions upon which research is often built.<br>

Publisher: Duke University School of Law<br>
Issue: i259905<br>
Date: 3 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Coons Morris B.<br>
Abstract: There are powerful historical, constitutional, empirical, and policy justifications for a return to the practice of having juries, not judges, impose sentences in criminal cases. The fact that Americans inherited from the English a mild preference for judge sentencing was more a historical accident than a case of thoughtful policy. Jury sentencing became quite widespread in the colonial and postcolonial eras as a reflection of deep-seated mistrust of the judiciary. The gradual drift away from jury sentencing was driven not by a new-found faith in the judiciary, but rather by the now discredited paradigm of rehabilitationism. Now that that paradigm has shifted to neoretribution, and that the essential moral character of the criminal law has been rediscovered, jurors should likewise be rediscovered as the best arbiters of that moral inquiry. A return to jury sentencing would also mesh nicely with the Court's struggle in its Apprendi line of cases to find a sensible way to distinguish between elements and sentence-enhancers under the Sixth Amendment. A Sixth Amendment interpreted to include the right to jury sentencing would also restore the textual symmetry between the Sixth and Seventh Amendments. There are no constitutional, empirical, or policy reasons why a defendant accused of committing negligence has the right to have both his guilt and damages assessed by a jury, but a criminal defendant has only half that right.<br>

Article Title: Rethinking the Political: Some Heideggerian Contributions<br>
Publisher: University of Notre Dame<br>
Issue: i261382<br>
Date: 10 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Pangle Fred<br>
Abstract: Recent literature on Heidegger concentrates heavily on his (temporary) involvement in or collusion with Nazi ideology and policies. Without belittling the gravity of the issue, this article shifts the focus somewhat by invoking a distinction which recently has emerged (or reemerged) in political thought: namely, the distinction between "politics" and "the political" or between politics viewed as partisan ideology or policy making, on the one hand, and politics seen as regime or paradigmatic framework, on the other. The main thesis of the article is that Heidegger's promising contributions to political theory are located on the level of ontology or paradigmatic framework rather than that of ideological partisanship. While not neglecting the dismal intrusions of the latter plane, the article probes Heideggerian cues for a "rethinking of the political" by placing the accent on four topical areas: first, the status of the subject or individual as political agent; second, the character of the political community, that is, of the polity or (in modern terms) the "state"; thirdly, the issue of cultural and political development or modernization; and finally, the problem of an emerging cosmopolis or world order beyond the confines of Western culture. In discussing these topics, an effort is made to disentangle Heidegger from possible misinterpretations and to indicate how, in each area, his thought pointed in the direction of an "overcoming" of Western political metaphysics.<br>

Abstract: Despite the significant impact of the awareness of perspectival relativism on the religious imagination, recent philosophers and theologians have rarely subjected epistemological relativism to careful scrutiny. This paper attempts to overcome the current theological impasse by a careful exploration of the metaphysical implications of relativism. The central thesis of the essay is that truth is relative because meaning is contextual and being is relational. Contextualized meaning and relational being join to form relative truth disclosed through symbolic awareness. The roots of contemporary relativism lie deep within eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophical movements and are inseparably entangled with the psycho-social pluralization endemic to the process of modernization. The efforts of Neo-orthodoxy, polytheism, and the scientific study of religion to resolve dilemmas posed by epistemological relativism are inadequate. What has gone unnoticed is that the discovery of truth's relativity is the realization of its inherently dialectical character. This insight begins to emerge when it is recognized that meaning is contextual and context is semiophantic. Principles identified in Hegel's logic, in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of temporality, and in Ricoeur's and Gadamer's hermeneutics disclose that meaning assumes form through dialectical interrelationship in which co-implicates mutually constitute each other. The synchronic and diachronic dimensions of relationality reveal the inexhaustability and perpetual revisability of meaning. The problem of semantics, however, is inseparable from the question of ontology. Ontological reflection leads to the conclusion that being itself is dialectical-fundamentally social or essentially relational. Determinate identity is born of ontological intercourse with otherness. Relations are not external and accidental, but are internal and essential to being itself. Identity and difference, unity and plurality, oneness and manynes~<br>

Abstract: Painting is a mute art, abstract painting conspicuously so; how might its meanings be constituted in acts of painting and looking, respectively, without explicit and articulate guidance, always assuming that such meanings are not arbitrary? How might we identify these meanings, other than through 'reading' or decoding? Agnes Martin's work of the New York years suggests particular ways of answering such questions. Crucial factors are: the practical rather than axiomatic or geometric character of Martin's grids; the perceptual instability of her work; the 'dissonance' between rectangle and square, field and frame; the bodily address of the work; Martin's aspiration to make a new American art. Circumstantially important are the close friendships among the artists at Coenties Slip, as interpreted in photographs by Hans Namuth, and the marginal and temporary status of the loft community, set in the shadow of Wall Street, as viewed in the context of urban development. The argument is that the ethos of friendship and temporary community was particularly important in the formation of Martin's work, and helps in understanding the terms of our encounter with it. Here it is essential to recogn3ize the difference in historical situation between painter and viewer -- these indeed being works in respect to which situatedness is acutely felt. The argument is sustained with reference to: the phenomenology of embodied perception and tacit understanding (Todes and Merleau-Ponty); the dialectic between self-definition and subjection to power (Foucault); Gertrude Stein's modernism and "The Making of Americans".<br>

Abstract: Groethuysen, he concludes, "It is time for
us to realize that our vacuous individualism can no longer be supported by our
pretentious universalism, that we are but one peculiar culture among many, that we
have underrated the importance of culture, that our history-or our rejection of
history-and our concept of human nature are but one curious set of myths among
many. Rousseau, Kant, Hegel, Marx, and the other were great storytellers, Homerids
of a new and abstract odyssey. The hero was a fictional character called 'humanity,'
ourselves writ large and glorified on the stage of the gods. But that story is, or ought
to be finished. It is time to begin listening seriously to others" (History and Human
Nature [New York, 1979], p. 360).

Abstract: When analysing the concept of social relationship, the link between a person and an individual, who from a sociological perspective do not have the same semantic value, needs to be reconsidered as whole. As an individual is typically enclosed in a social dimension, it cannot have a self-referential character. Instead, it tends to half-reveal the authentic foundation of the civil society on the basis of a range of values which, after leading to the recognition of the self, activate relationships with the social other and the rest of the world including the transcendental one. In fact, within the opening relationship it's possible to find the conscience of own existence, to purchase the awareness of own identities and to become responsible of own world of life. Considering the aspects of sociological compromise and moral quality of the afore-going, it is clear that socio-cultural exchanges — where relationship skills come clearly into play — are the heuristic foundation of the complex relationship between individuals and society. Consequently, such exchanges become social dynamics through which affective similarities and legitimate differences interact to build an ethical balance for society as well as support a differentiated development of social bonds.<br>

Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services<br>
Issue: i23019993<br>
Date: 3 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Rothchild Jonathan<br>
Abstract: I argue that the aporetic character of clemency must be understood in terms of its unmerited and merited character to achieve the underlying purposes of justice within criminal justice: justice as fairness (punishment must be deserved and proportionate) and justice as restoration (repair of the harm to victims and society and the reintegration of offenders) are paramount goals. Rather than destabilizing political order, pardons can render productive potential tensions between justice as fairness and justice as restoration. Taking as my conceptual point of departure Paul Ricoeur's claims about the suprajuridical and supraethical character of pardon, I develop the argument through three central sections: an excursus into historical and contemporary practices of clemency in the United States; a critical analysis of the merited and unmerited aspects of clemency with respect to remorse and atonement theories within theological and legal discourse; and a normative engagement with pardons and felony disenfranchisement.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>

Author(s): GUNNELL JOHN G.<br>
Abstract: The turn to the philosophy of scientific realism as a meta-theory for the study of International Relations manifests a reluctance to confront the basic problem of the relationship between philosophy and social scientific inquiry. Despite the realists' rejection of traditional empiricism, and particularly the instrumentalist account of scientific theory, the enthusiasm for realism neglects many of the same problems that, more than a generation earlier, were involved in the social scientific embrace of positivism. One of these problems was a lack of understanding regarding the character and history of the philosophy of natural science and its relationship and applicability to the study of social phenomena. Proponents of realism have also neither adequately articulated and defended realism as a philosophical position, and distinguished it from other perspectives, nor confronted the fundamental challenge to realism and other foundationalist philosophies which has been mounted by the contemporary critique of traditional representational philosophy.<br>

Abstract: This essay represents an attempt to critically assess the intellectual orientation often termed 'structuralism.' In particular, the essay is concerned with European, and even more specifically French, structuralism as displayed in the writings of Louis Althusser, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, and C. Levi-Strauss. The analysis indicates that despite a novel language, an often rigorous character, and some interesting, indeed exciting, intellectual constructions, structuralism is very much a child of positivism. The positivism/structuralism relationship is most clearly revealed when structuralism is contrasted with Marxian social inquiry. For comparative and illustrative purposes, then, the essay contrasts structuralism and Marxism.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: Although the character of Job's wife has been given very little space in the biblical text of Job, she has been treated by many exegetes as significant. There are two main streams of interpretation in which she has figured prominently. In classical Christian approaches, ranging from Augustine to some modern commentators such as Habel, Job's wife tends to be regarded as a temptress in the mold of Eve and as a collaborator of the Satan. Post-modern, especially feminist, approaches tend to rehabilitate the character of Job's wife, accrediting her with prompting Job's critical reflection and with anticipating the direction in which the plot of the book develops. In the present article, interpretive approaches to Job's wife, including the favorable approach of some Jewish exegesis of antiquity, as well as the somewhat middle road of medieval Jewish exegesis, are surveyed. A critical discussion of feminist treatments of Job's wife deals primarily with the work of Newsom, Pardes and van Wolde. The place of Job's wife in the book is assessed with regard to how her theological views compare to those of the Satan on the one hand, and Job on the other, as well as to her role as a catalyst in the plot.<br>

Abstract: The major thesis developed in Sartre's L'imaginaire is that all imaginary acts can be subsumed under the heading of one "image family" and, therefore, that imagination as a whole can be theorized in terms of pictorial representation. Yet this theory fails to meet the objective of Sartre's study, to demonstrate that imaginary activity is not a derivative of perception but an attitude with a character and dignity of its own. The subsidiary account of imagination in terms of neutralization of belief has the advantage of not being constrained by the requirement that imaginary activity serve a purely reproductive function of bringing an absent "original" into a quasi presence and, thus, leaves room for free creativity and fiction. It also points to a concrete lived experience of alterity at the heart of subjective life where the subject stages its life as if it were the life of an other, putting pressure onto Sartre's contention that the cogito defines subjectivity.<br>

Abstract: By incorporating the battle of Waterloo into the events of their novels, Hugo and Stendhal create a portrait of its principal protagonist, Napoléon ler. Associated in one case with a spatial prison out of time and in the other case with a temporal exile out of space, the image of the emperor is that of a figure of power deprived of time and, consequently, of its legitimacy. Stendhal imprisons his character in the present to deny the reality of Napoleon's defeat. Hugo, on the other hand, exiles his character from the present to link the past to the future and propose a new model of heroism.<br>

This connection is not to be understood within the frame of a metaphysical thought of god, but in the context of the realism of mercy: God's time is qualified by the movement of mercy. Discussing different theories of time (Augustin, M. Theunissen, U. Beck, E. Erikson) the character of time as a gift is elaborated and understood as a way of secular speaking of God.<br>

Abstract: As a major source of social values in East Asia, Confucianism assumes especial significance amidst the proliferation of instrumental rationality in modern societies. This study attempts to answer the question: how Confucian are contemporary Chinese? By way of constructing an ideal type of Confucian actors, which is then applied to a survey of three Chinese communities, this study tries to formulate a new perspective in depicting the character of modern Confucian actors, measured in terms of their dynamic proximity to the Confucian ideal type. Our approach marks a shift of emphasis, both empirically and methodologically, compared with previous work on this topic. On the empirical side, our study breaks with the long-standing, classical distinction between the 'gentleman' and the 'commoner' prevalent in Confucian discourse. Degrees of proximity to Confucian values are viewed in representational—i.e. non-evaluative—terms. In constructing the ideal type of Confucian actors, we distinguish between formal and substantive values in Confucianism. This analytical distinction allows our study to demonstrate the continued relevance of Confucianism. While substantive values change over time, the formal, analytical core that captures the essence of Confucianism continues to survive in the face of the vicissitudes of modernity and the spread of instrumental rationality.<br>

Abstract: La présente contribution propose, à titre préliminaire, de considérer l'idée du sacré dans le monde de l'Islam à partir de l'architecture et de distinguer trois catégories de monuments religieux : 1) les grands sanctuaires panislamiques (comme La Mecque, Médine et Jérusalem) dont le caractère sacré est plus ou moins constant; 2) la mosquée, aux valeurs sacrées variables selon le moment; 3) les lieux saints (mashahid), qui, quelles qu'en soient les formes, reflètent les besoins des fidèles dans leurs espaces aussi bien que dans les pratiques que l'on y décèle. As a preliminary, we propose to consider the concept of holiness in the Islamic world starting with architecture, and distinguishing three categories of religious buildings : 1) Large pan islamic sanctuaries (such as Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem), the sacred character of which remains more or less steady; 2) Mosques the sanctity of which varies according to time; 3) Holy places (mashahid) whatever shape they may assume, answering the needs of the faithfuls in the space offered as well as in the practices available.<br>

Author(s): Rock Paul<br>
Abstract: Two visions of homicide, murderers and victims are contrasted. One, conventional in criminology, has it that murders are the culmination of drawn-out, acrimonious transactions occurring within demographically homogeneous sectors of the population. It leads to a blurring of moral identities and causal relations. The other is championed by homicide 'survivors' organizations, and it claims an existentially validated authority. Homicide is experienced by 'survivors' as a chaotic episode which gives way to strong, antagonistic archetypes of victim and offender. The two visions are examined, in part, to promote an appreciation of the analytic complexities of the phenomenon of murder; in part, to point to the fraught politics that are beginning to emerge around resolving the character of murder.<br>

Abstract: This article attempts to refine the understanding of translation, thus contributing to evaluate its role in reception theory and in the history of ideas. A discussion of on the character, theories, and practices of translation in early-modern times is its entry point of analysis. During this period, what mattered in the first place was not the extent to which the translated text succeeded or failed in making the source text and its "original" ideas accessible in the target language, but rather the extent and the way in which the source text was instrumental in pursuing the agenda set by the translator or others in compliance with specific contexts. Such a perspective on translation seems also appropriate to current modes of inquiry for which translation is not an instance of inter-cultural communication, aiming to penetrate the Other in its fullness and make it intelligible in its otherness, but a communicative act whose purposes are predominantly intra-cultural and consist in supporting domestic agendas to which the translated text looks instrumental.<br>

Author(s): Bongmba Elias<br>
Abstract: This essay suggests that the images of love in Ngugi's first written novel, The River Between can be read as a phenomenology of love. Such a phenomenology demonstrates that the love Waiyaki, the main character, has for Nyambura points to a conciliatory path in resistance to colonialism. It is argued that although the main character fails in his mission, his declaration of love for the daughter of the pastor, who opposes indigenous practices, is an erotic manifestation that is a rejection of partisan spirit as well as a critique of Christian praxis in colonial Kenya, and could serve as a basis for reconfiguring contemporary gender relations.<br>

Author(s): Souza lara<br>
Abstract: This article inquires as to the meaning of nervoso (nerves) among poor, working-class women from Salvador, Brazil. Our aim is to understand nerves as an experience that emerges from the background of a life trajectory and that, in many significant ways, disrupts the taken-for-granted character of that trajectory. From a phenomenological-hermeneutical tradition, we explore the links between experience, embodiment and temporality and then discuss the relevance of this approach for the understanding of women′s nervoso. In order to do so we present the life histories of three middle-aged women who have been afflicted with nerves. The accounts describe significant ways in which culturally inherited possibilities – grounded in a lived context of class and gender – are recovered and come to pre-figure a certain future. As we argue throughout the article, it is only when we situate the experience of nervoso within the temporal frame of life that we can truly understand it – that is, grasp it as part of a movement that involves both recovery and creation of meaning.<br>

Author(s): KI-ZERBO Lazare<br>
Abstract: L'article aborde la problématique herméneutique africaine par le biais de la phénoménologie, un courant philosophique contemporain inauguré par Husserl. Sans discuter le rapport spécifique à l'Afrique, il développe partiellement un programme qui pourrait s'intituler « la crise de la conscience africaine et la phénoménologie » et qui bénéficie aujourd'hui des progrès des études scientifiques africaines, précisément celles de Abdou Touré, sociologue ivoirien et Goran Hyden. Dans un premier temps, l'auteur expose le fondement concret de la démarche critique : c'est la crise africaine articulée au concept phénoménologique du monde de la vie. Dans un second temps, les résultats de cette explication sont illustrés à partir des ouvrages de Abdou Touré et Goran Hyden. Le premier démontre le caractère schizophrénique de la culture officielle ivoirienne et le caractère endogène antagonique du travail populaire spontané. Le second met en cause l'économie politique africaine en proposant le concept d'« économie de l'affection ». Cependant, la perception théorique de celle-ci n'a pas empêché l'auteur suédois de retomber dans l'eurocentrisme. Si elle évite ce genre d'écueil, la phénoménologie peut enrichir considérablement de son radicalisme critique le programme herméneutique, auquel Kwamé Nkrumah et Cheikh Anta Diop ont contribué de façon décisive. This article takes a new approach to African hermeneutical problematics by way of phenomenology — the contemporary philosophical current initiated by Husserl. Without touching on the specific relationship to Africa, it partially develops a proposition which could be called « the crisis of phenomenology and the African conscience », a programme which profits nowadays from the progress in African scientific studies as exemplified by Abdou Touré (a sociologist from the Ivory Coast) and Goran Hyden. In the first part, the author presents the concrete basis for his method : the crisis in Africa articulated in terms of the phenomenological~<br>

Author(s): ATKINS KIM<br>
Abstract: In his famous paper, What Is It Like To Be A Bat?, Thomas Nagel argues against a reductive physicalist account of consciousness by highlighting what he calls "the subjective character of experience". In this paper I will argue that Nagel's insight is important for understanding the value placed on patient autonomy in medical ethics. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience brings with it the necessity for an epistemological humility with respect to the lives of others and what can be said to be "right" for them. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience lies at the heart of empathy and our capacity to make decisions that genuinely reflect respect for the patient's autonomy. Through the example of a case involving extreme medical intervention, I identify some impediments to the proper recognition of autonomy. These kind of cases highlight the significance of affective responses with respect to the subjective character of experience, and, by extension, to our capacity to imagine and act in accordance with another's perspective. I argue that affective responses are appropriate and needed considerations in the case where one must attempt to assume another's perspective in order to respect autonomy. I conclude that understanding that experience has an irreducibly subjective character is essential to respecting patient autonomy.<br>

Abstract: The concept Deckerinnerung (en. screen-memory), which appeared in Freud's work in 1899, points towards the important epistemological question about the possibility of adequation or coincidence (Deckung) between past experience and the current act that is being presentified. This can take the form of remembering as such or be conceived as fantasy. In order to clarify the differences between fantasy and memory, or rather their interconnection in the Deckerinnerung, they need to be looked at phenomenologically, and in doing so various aspects should be analysed, such as: the character of positional and neutralised acts of presentification; the interference of conscious attention and the phenomenon of inhibition in the act of presentification; the state of memories in the unconscious and the possibilities of their association between themselves or modification by other current acts. While Freud introduces the subject without further analysing it, Husserl's theories offer a valuable contribution here. In this context, there is first a need to outline the way in which Husserl's investigations into memory come close to Freud's discourse, in the sense that they lead to a "Phenomenology of the Unconscious" (Hua XI; Mat. VIII).<br>

Abstract: Vgl. Anm. 47 u. 49, Erdmann, a. a. O., S. 8; Helmholtz: Die Thatsachen in der Wahrneh-
mung (1878). In: Vorträge und Reden. Bd. 2, S. 238; vgl. dazu Helmholtz' Distanzierung von
Berkeley im Handbuch der physiologischen Optik. 2. Aufl., S. 612. Helmholtz hält Berkeleys
Standpunkt für falsch, demzufolge „nicht bloß die Qualitäten der Empfindung, sondern auch die
Wahrnehmungen überhaupt nur innere Prozesse seien, denen nichts äußeres entspräche". Berke-
ley wird „zu dieser Schlußfolgerung verleitet durch den falschen Satz, die Ursache (das wahrge-
nommene Objekt) müsse ihrer Wirkung (Vorstellung) gleichartig, also auch ein geistiges Wesen,
nicht ein reales Object sein". Gerade einen solchen Ubergang von einer Vorstellung zu einer rea-
len Ursache hatte Schopenhauer als mit dem Satz vom Grunde unvereinbar erklärt (s. o.
Anm. 36). Im übrigen kann Helmholtz so nur um den Preis einer systematischen Ambiguität
von einer Ursache sprechen. Einerseits ist ein reales, physiologisch faßbares Agens gemeint, das
Sinnesempfindungen verursacht und somit einer Welt I angehören muß; andererseits ist ein Ob-
jekt der Wahrnehmung (Welt III) gemeint, das aufgrund der Sinnesempfindung erschlossen wird.
Daß die äußere Realität (Welt I) und die innere Welt der Wahrnehmung (Welt III) sich aufgrund
eines unbewußten Inferenzprozesses „decken" können, ist eine selbst metaphysische Vorausset-
zung, die den physiologisch gewendeten Idealismus Helmholtz' realistisch einfärbt. Tatsächlich
verlaufen „die mit dem Character der Wahrnehmung auftretenden Bewußtseinsacte... so, als ob
die von der realistischen Hypothese angenommene Welt der stofflichen Dinge wirklich bestände.
Aber über dieses,als ob' kommen wir nicht hinweg, für mehr als eine ausgezeichnet brauchbare
und präcise Hypothese können wir die realistische Hypothese nicht anerkennen..." (Vorträge u.
Reden. Bd. 2, S. 239) - „da neben ihr noch andere unwiderlegbare idealistische Hypothesen mög-
lich sind", die das Leben als Traum erscheinen lass~<br>

Abstract: By establishing a parallel between the cycle of Lumière films and the Age of the Enlightenment ("siècle des lumières"), the author identifies the pensive character of the films' images as well as the aesthetic of the visible world they display. She then examines the transformation of a time-image into a memory-image in the Lumière films, arguing that the films are not only offer time-images, that is, residual images of the past, but have become images-as-memory in the contemporary spectator's mind.<br>

Abstract: There is an obvious parallel between foundationalism, which ignores history in working out the conditions of knowledge, and radical relativism, which contends that by virtue of its own historical character there is no way to choose among different interpretations, all of which are "equally good." Might it not be, rather, that the recent historicist attack on the very idea of rationality is as damaging as foundationalist objections against the plurality of conceptual schemes or frameworks? Can philosophy maintain the traditional distinction between the form and content of knowledge, between rationality and historicity between doxa and episteme?<br>

Abstract: For Dooyeweerd's Western oriented, sometimes even nationalistically tinted and yet, in
its intention, normative view of culture, see A New Critique, vol. 2, pp. 266-68, etc. In his
Roots in particular, the Occident' is very central (ch. 1, §§ 3,17-25), as the following passage
illustrates: Ά truly scriptural view of history... knows that the great antithesis between the
ground motive of the divine revelation of the Word and the ground motive of the apostate
spirit operates [in history] in the power struggle for the future of western civilization' (p.
108). Yes, Dooyeweerd at one point even calls the Dutch national character, in view of its
calvinistic bent, its humaneness, its sober life-style, and the like, a 'normative type' of histor-
ical disclosure and differentiation (p. 82). See also the striking analysis by C. T. Mclntire in
'Dooyeweerd's Philosophy of History', especially pp. 104-5, together with the nuanced criti-
cism of S. Griffioen in 'De betekenis van Dooyeweerd's ontwikkelingsidee', pp. 105-7.<br>

Abstract: For the distinction made here between pluralism in philosophy, in social theory and in
ethics, see especially the contributions by W. Kerber and L. Samson on "Pluralismus." The
distinction between philosophical, societal and normative pluralism is descriptive in
character and far from exhaustive. There is also a pluralism of world views (see Wilhelm
Dilthey's 'Streit der Weltanschauungen') and of scientific théories (see Thomas Kuhn's
'paradigm switch')·<br>

Abstract: On the "participation idea" see Steen, Structure, p. 209; on the collapse of structure into
direction see Ibid., p. 83, where Steen writes: "It might be said that structure tends to be
reduced to direction... Structure is transcendentally-directed meaning. Meaninglessness,
nothing, and meaning loss tend to occur when this direction is lost. The structure is almost its
pointing character." Steen finds in this state of affairs what he calls the "semi-contradictory
theme" in Dooyeweerd's thought.<br>

Abstract: There is a certain order here: character is a set of dispositions at the level of the act-
structure; temperament is the ensemble of dispositions that is anchored in the psychical sub-
strncture; typical tendencies in motor behaviourand bodily expression are related to the biotic
and physical substnicture. It is interesting that the distinction between character and tem-
perament, after having become obsolete at the end of the fifties and after decades of absence
in the scientific literatnre on personality and personality development, has re-emerged some
15 years ago and has begnn a second life.<br>

Abstract: In Matter and Memory, Bergson examines the relationship between perception and memory, the status of consciousness in its relation to the brain, and more generally, a possible conjunction of matter and mind. Our reading focuses in particular on his understanding of the evanescent presence of the present and of its debt vis-à-vis the "unconscious" consciousness of a "virtual" past. We wish to show that the Bergsonian version of a critique of "the metaphysics of presence" is, for all that, an offshoot of a Platonic type of metaphysics. It is true that Bergson departs from traditional stand-points on the side of a self-sufficient and original present and a form of presence to which the transparency of consciousness would confer the character of immediate evidence. All the same, it can hardly be claimed that his rehabilitation of the past and the unconscious opens up new perspectives on how forgetting and death are bound up with the work of memory.<br>

Author(s): Louden Bruce<br>
Abstract: Some sixty times in the Iliad and Odyssey, the narrator describes a sequence of events with the climactic phrase, "And now X would have happened, had not Y intervened." Though some recent studies have begun to focus on this narrative technique, a fuller accounting of its properties remains desirable, as many of the passages where it is employed are quite significant to the overall construction of the plots. I have termed the phenomenon pivotal contrafactuals. The present study argues that the composer achieves three general narrative benefits by employing this device. First, it is a method for emphatically changing the direction of the plot (hence the adjective "pivotal"). Second, it allows the narrator to confer added emphases of various kinds upon the events he describes. Third, the narrator often uses the construction to make an editorial comment upon the character on whose behalf the intervention occurs. Intriguingly, Homer appears to link some pivotal contrafactuals together through various means. Some occur as equivalent elements in different multiforms of a common type scene. Some occur in different narratives describing the same event. These latter raise the possibility that divine intervention of which he is unaware occurs in Odysseus's narrative of his wanderings. Finally, I suggest that a passage at the beginning of the Catalogue of Ships, which has attracted various interpretations, is a modified pivotal contrafactual.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342993<br>
Date: 5 1, 1981<br>
Author(s): Goekjian Richard T.<br>
Abstract: Evaluation of the influence of Hayden White on the theory of history is made difficult by his preference for the essay form, valued for its experimental character, and by the need to find comparable data. A quantitative study of citations of his work in English and foreign-language journals, 1973-1993, reveals that although historians were prominent among early readers of Metahistory, few historical journals reviewed White's two subsequent collections of essays and few historians-except in Germany-cited them. Those historians who did tended still to cite Metahistory and often the parts of it devoted specifically to nineteenth-century historians. Literary critics, on the other hand, were relatively late to discover White, but during the "narrative turn" of the 1970s and 1980s his work was important for students of the novel and the theater. Recognition of it was especially marked in Spanish-speaking countries and in Germany. As a result, salient themes of White's later work-the ideological and political import of narrativization, the "historical sublime," and writing in the "middle voice"-have largely gone unremarked by historians and philosophers. Both these groups have tended to be irritated by White's bracketing of questions of historical epistemology; some have accused him of effacing the line between fiction and history, while White's numerous literary readers have generally applauded his tendencies in this direction. White however has consistently maintained that there is a difference, although not the one conventionally postulated. His exploration of writing in the "middle voice" brings his work full circle, in that it promises a "modernist" realism appropriate for representing the "sublime" events of our century.<br>

Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>
Issue: i342974<br>
Date: 10 1, 1899<br>
Author(s): Bosanquet Martyn P.<br>
Abstract: The paper examines the very different insights of theorists into the interpretation of the historical meaning of literary reception (especially recent German theorists of Rezeptionsgeschichte) and Anglo-American theorists of the "new" history of political thought (especially Quentin Skinner and J. G. A. Pocock). Among the former, readers create meaning; among the latter, authorial intended meanings are fundamental. Both perspectives are valuable, but one-sided. The differences between them arise from different perspectives on the character of a text. But those perspectives are not as incompatible as has been supposed, especially by reception theorists. By examining the incoherences of literary reception theory when viewed from the perspective of the intentionalists, and by examining the one-sidedness of intentionalist theory in the light of a modified version of the reception perspective, it is shown that an understanding of historical meaning requires both insights. The argument is illustrated by reference to the history of political thought, a history which might more usefully be conceived as the history of political literature.<br>

Author(s): Carroll Linda L.<br>
Abstract: From the beginning of his career, sixteenth-century playwright Angelo Beolco (also known as Ruzante, the name of the peasant character he created and played) declared his anguish at the worsening of the peasants' economic and political position. Illegitimate child of the authoritarian patriarch of a minor noble family beginning its decline and (probably) a household servant likely of peasant origin, he appears to have identified with the peasants' exclusion from governing institutions and the blocking of their access to wealth. At first, the Evangelical reform movement, with its emphasis on justice for the poor, appealed to him as an effective instrument for persuading the powerful to correct the situation. That hope having proved illusory, Beolco passed through a rapid evolution of beliefs that calls into question Lucien Febvre's theory of the parameters of religious experience in the Renaissance. The present article explores this evolution.<br>

Author(s): Emery Jacob<br>
Abstract: Andrey Bely's novel "Petersburg" (one of the high points of Russian literary modernism and a rough analogue to James Joyce's Ulysses) repeatedly claims that parent and child, being of the same flesh and blood, share an ambivalent identity. At the same time, because the novel opens by invoking a major character's genealogical relation to Adam, the book implies that this kin identity is universal and can be applied to the entire human race. This essay analyzes the role of kinship metaphor in "Petersburg", demonstrating that tropes of parent-child identity facilitate the novel's dizzying metaphoric conflation, that they form a kind of metafictional mirror in which the novel probes its own nature as a work of the imagination, and that Bely's theory and practice of metaphor touch on broader philosophical issues of figure and fictionality.<br>

Abstract: La place de la musique dans À la recherche du temps perdu a suscité nombre de commentaires. Le présent propos connecte ces points à un débat interne aux musicologues français. Si certains l'envisage contre toute interpretation subjective, d'autres entendent la recentrer sur deux axes majeurs: 1) le statut d'écrit littéraire 2) révélant l'expérience musicale d'autre part. Or, de récents articles insèrent Proust à ce débat. Il s'agit de comprendre en quoi réactualiser écrivain ayant fait d'un roman un projet esthétique où la question du langage est centrale peut relancer la discussion du lien musique-langage, ici en un rapport où s'adjoint la musicologie, elle-même objet d'une dissension. /// The work À la recherche du temps perdu by Marcel Proust has provoked numerous commentaries which referred to the importance conferred upon music in this novel. In this, interest was pointed either at the music sources, the listening, or the connections between the architecture of the novel and the musical structure of the composer Vinteuil, the character in the novel. This article offers the articulation of those debates which occur within the French musicology which question its objects in the way that some consider it as a science or discipline at intersection of others, which has to return necessarily within sciences called exact and/or humane, opposed to all subjective interpretations; the other try to center again musicologist's activities in two main axes: the status of a writing with a literary aspiration on one side, and a report about musical experience on the other. In this, recent articles were putting Marcel Proust in the focus of a contemporary debate, trying to understand in which way the reactualisation of a writer - who out of one work had made an aesthetical project in which the question of language became central - can renew the discussion about connections between music and language, but this time within a triangular connection in which musicology is added, whi~<br>

Article Title: Language and the Making of Place: A Narrative-Descriptive Approach<br>
Publisher: Association of American Geographers<br>
Issue: i323950<br>
Date: 12 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Tuan Yi-Fu<br>
Abstract: How places are made is at the core of human geography. Overwhelmingly the discipline has emphasized the economic and material forces at work. Neglected is the explicit recognition of the crucial role of language, even though without speech humans cannot even begin to formulate ideas, discuss them, and translate them into action that culminates in a built place. Moreover, words alone, used in an appropriate situation, can have the power to render objects, formerly invisible because unattended, visible, and impart to them a certain character: thus a mere rise on a flat surface becomes something far more-a place that promises to open up to other places-when it is named "Mount Prospect." The different ways by which language contributes toward the making of place may be shown by exploring a wide range of situations and cultural contexts. Included in this paper are the contexts of hunter-gatherers, explorers and pioneers, intimate friendship, literary London, Europe in relation to Asia, and Chinese gardening and landscape art. There is a moral dimension to speech as there is to physical action. Thus warm conversation between friends can make the place itself seem warm; by contrast, malicious speech has the power to destroy a place's reputation and thereby its visibility. In the narrative-descriptive approach, the question of how and why language is effective is implied or informally woven into the presentation, but not explicitly formulated or developed. Ways of making place in different situations-from the naming of objects by pioneers, to informal conversation in any home, to the impact of written texts-are highlighted and constitute the paper's principal purpose, rather than causal explanations, which must vary with each type of linguistic behavior and each situation.<br>

Article Title: Qur'an and Science: A Hermeneutical Approach / ‮القرآن والعلم: منهج تفسيري‬<br>
Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
Issue: i25728159<br>
Date: 1 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): ‮کامبانيني‬ ‮ماسيمو‬<br>
Abstract: The aim of the present article is to investigate how the passages of the Holy Text regarding natural sciences or the cosmological order of the universe can be read from a hermeneutical viewpoint, in a philosophical rather than a historical, grammatical or stylistic sense; the debated problems of literary and artistic character, and the relationship between Qur'an and science per se, are not involved here. If we assume as a working hypothesis the Gadamerian perspective that 'being, as far as we can understand it, is language', we can accept that the being of God and of the universe are disclosed in Qur'anic language and that the Qur'an becomes the framework of the aletheia (in the Heideggerian sense) of science. This paper utilises the above-mentioned epistemological and hermeneutical key in order to make a first attempt to explore the possibility of a philosophical analysis of the question of science in the Qur'an, and concludes that, although it can sound highly paradoxical, the attitudes of total agreement, partial agreement or no agreement between Qur'an and science are not mutually exclusive, but rather work in parallel at different linguistic levels. ‮الهدف من هذه الدراسة هو بحث کيف يمکن فهم الآيات القرآنية المتعلقة بالعلوم الطبيعية أو النظام الکوني من وجهة نظر منهج تفسيري من ناحية فلسفية لا تاريخية أو نحوية أو بلاغية. لن يتم هنا مناقشة قضايا أدبية أو فنية أو العلاقة بين القرآن والعلم في هذا البحث. إذا افترضنا أن وجهة نظر جادامير (remadaG)، ‮ وهي أن " الوجود، کما نفهمه، هو اللغة "، تعتبر نظرية قابلة للتطبيق، يمکن أن نقبل أن وجود الله والکون يبين من خلال اللغة القرآنية وأن القرآن يصبح إطار الوصول للحقيقة، طبقاً لفهم هيدجر (reggedieH). ‮إن هذا البحث يستخدم علم الحد والمنهج التفسيري من أجل القيام بأول محاولة لاستکشاف إمکانية تحليل فلسفي لقضية العلم في القرآن. وقد انتهى هذا البحث إلى أن التوافق بين القرآن والعلم تاما أو جزئيا أوعدم التوافق لا يعتبر أمرا قاطعا من الجهتين لکنه يعمل على درجات لغوية مختلفة متوازنة.‬<br>

Abstract: This article highlights two features of Qur'anic style and content: duality/opposition and typological figuration, which can be seen as providing a continuous and consistent 'narrative stream' through the Qur'an. It is of some interest that both of these features have been singled out as distinctive of apocalypse as a genre in the study of numerous religious and cultural traditions. As debate on whether or not the Qur'an is a bona fide example of apocalyptic literature quietly continues, the interplay of conceptual and substantive oppositions and dualities is discussed in order to highlight the importance of this prominent feature to both the form and contents of the Book. It is suggested that its function is profoundly related to the typological figuration indispensable to the Qur'anic depiction of, for example, the character of the prophets and therefore prophethood. Whether or not this represents a genuine instance of apocalyptic literature, it nonetheless remains that the prominence of the motif renders the Qur'an susceptible of a reading expressive of something called an apocalyptic imagination. It is hoped that this article succeeds in demonstrating that in fact these apparently familiar subjects are stimulated to new life by considering them as defining, interlocking, structural elements of a distinctive Islamic apocalypse. ‮تبرز هذه الدراسة خاصيتين لأسلوب القرآن ومادته: الثنائية/التقابل وتصنيف النماذج مما قد ينظر إليه على أنه يمثل تيارا مستمرا ثابتا في القرآن. ومن اللافت للنظر أنه قد جرى الترکيز على هاتين الخاصيتين على أنهما يختصان بالحديث عن أحوال الآخرة في کثير من الأديان والتقاليد الثقافية. وفي هذا المقال سندرس التفاعل بين الثنائية والتقابل لکي نبرز الأهمية الأساسية لهذه الخاصية بالنسبة لشکل القرآن ومحتواه. فنحن نرى أن وظيفتها تمت بقوة إلى ظاهرة تصنيف الأنواع في تصوير القرآن لشخصيات الأنبياء ثم النبوة نفسها. والأمل أن ينجح هذا المقال في التدليل على أن هذه الموضوعات المألوفة يمکن رؤيتها على أنها نمط إسلامي فريد في الحديث عن الأخرويات.‬<br>

Abstract: La obra de Manuela Infante es una de las más interesantes del teatro chileno emergente de la última década, por su contenido autorreflexivo y amplio espectro de alusiones culturales. En su pieza Juana (2004) destacan las referencias a obras de Vicente Huidobro, Rodolfo Usigli y Bernard Shaw, que vinculan la concepción dramática de esta joven dramaturga chilena con los postulados estéticos y filosóficos de estos autores, en los que convergen arte, mito y memoria. Se estudiará la reelaboración de la figura de Juana de Arco en la obra mencionada a la luz de estos intertextos, para demostrar que el "trabajo de la memoria" histórica que realizan Infante y la Compañía Teatro de Chile, tiene fundamentos en una sólida tradición latinoamericana y europea. The plays of Manuela Infante may be considered some of the most interesting works when we study the new Chilean drama of the last decade, both because of their introspective contents and because of the wide range of cultural allusions to be found in her plays. In her piece Juana (2004), we find significant references to the works of Vicente Huidobro, Rodolfo Usigli and Georges Bernard Shaw, thus establishing a relationship between the dramatic conceptions of this young Chilean playwright and the philosophical and esthetic tenets of those authors: there we may find a convergence of art, myth and memory. In this essay we will study the reworking of the character of Joan of Arc in the already mentioned play Juana, and we will explore the importance of these intertexts in order to show that the 'works of historical memory' to be found in Infante and the Compañía Teatro Club is founded on a solid Latin American and European tradition.<br>

Publisher: University of North Carolina Press<br>
Issue: i344318<br>
Date: 6 1, 1973<br>
Author(s): Williame Herman<br>
Abstract: The opposition between phenomenological sociology and Durkeimian sociology is not as absolute as it is often presented. The various ways in which Durkheim's work has been read by phenomenological authors throughout the last fifty years testify to a development toward greater proximity, implying changes in phenomenologists' interpretation of Durkheim as well as in their own starting points. Beginning with an exposition of one of the most antithetical stands towards Durkheim, the article points out different phases of the aforementioned development: (1) A more or less total opposition; (2) A positive view of the challenged that phenomenologists can find a Durkheim's work and an attempt to incorporate it into their own viewpoints without really changing the latter; (3) A simultaneous reinterpretation of Durkheim's sociologism and the pehnomenological notions of subjectivity and intentionality, on the common basis of a renewed insight into the corporeal character of human social phenomena.<br>

Author(s): Abbott H. Porter<br>
Abstract: Beckett's aggressiveness in crossing generic lines paradoxically accompanied a keen sensitivity to genre and medium differences that often constrained his writing. My argument here is that this combination of abandon and respect was founded in a recognition not just of formal differences in art but of differences in the ways we think. In the wake of groundbreaking work by Jerry Fodor and Howard Gardner, there has been a great deal of research advancing (and qualifying) a modular conception of how the mind evolved and how it continues to work in modern humans. This work puts new light on both the formal differences between mimesis and diegesis, and on Beckett's approach to these two different ways of rendering narrative. Particularly it makes clear why Beckett should have so radically subordinated character and action to staged diegesis in his later work.<br>

Author(s): Banerjee Sanjoy<br>
Abstract: How does international interaction shape states' patterns of thought, emotion, and action? This paper examines the processes by which motives and practices feed each other in reproducing historical structures. An artificial intelligence model defines state-subjects as cultures combining special meanings that produce causal attribution, state self-identification, emotions, and action motives. These special meanings are built from subjective cultural categories describing social acts and group character of the self and others. Anger, pride, fear, and relief motivate action. A collection of such subject-cultures may produce a pattern of actions that reiterates the cultures. The model discriminates between those combinations of elements in special meanings which reproduce subjects and historical structures, and those which do not. The meanings discovered in such reproduction analysis can be validated by discourse analysis.<br>

Abstract: Twelve years after the genocide, nothing has been forgotten in Rwanda. The country resembles a multiplicity of experiences, words and silences. The aim of the article is to reflect on the representations – or absence of representations – of the past. The approach is based on the ambivalence of any reference to the past. It is not a question of making a judgement in the abstract about the more or less legitimate character of the attitudes observed, but to understand the dynamics at work. The analysis is divided into three parts. The first part recalls the specific aspects of the case under study. The second examines the silences that weigh upon Rwandan society. The third notes the main accounts of the past.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to analyse some questions proposed by the debate on the issue of modernity and post-modernity in the context of the philosophy of Leonardo Coimbra, from the reflection on these issues made by Jürgen Habermas in the work
         The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity. Thus, the critique to modern reason, the reflection on the metaphysics, the issues about the relationship between reason and faith, the religious phenomenon, the process of secularization, are our starting point for the questioning and the philosophical understanding that postmodernity makes of these problems The inauguration of this new rationality allows a new questioning about the reason and the world, manifesting the sublime character of its nature, allowing a new reflection, a critique of self-sufficient and self-reflexive reason and recovering another discursive and cooperative form of reason.<br>

expects that it may be better simply to see Usbek as a distant authority figure, since he is
the remote ruler of his seraglio. See Carr, 'The Secret Chain of the Lettres persanes',

Abstract: Edward X. Gu charts the changing and complex relationship existing between intellectuals and party/state in China during the "culture fever" era of 1979 to 1989. He draws on theoretical insights from the "new institutionalism" literature to problematize the "civil society" approach and to interrogate earlier scholarship emphasizing the anti-establishment character of intellectuals. His detailed investigation of three intellectual groups reveals that intellectuals attained some measure of autonomy and independence but only by developing collaborative and cooperative relations with the party-state. Thus, the author defines the boundaries of the "cultural public space" that emerged in Deng's China.<br>

Abstract: The structural analysis of myth is a prime focus of anthropological interest, largely because of the efforts of Levi-Strauss. This paper uses some Levi-Straussian ideas to develop a strategy for myth analysis that I call the non-sense-in-myth strategy (NIMS). The strategy is given a trial run on a well-known and (I believe) much-misunderstood myth: Adam and Eve in Eden. The structure identified has an evolutionary character consistent with many modern understandings concerning the nature of human reality. NIMS, a mediator between Levi-Straussian intellectual leaps and a real methodology, indicates the value of cautious optimism concerning the question "Can structural analysis of myth become a scientific endeavor?"<br>

Abstract: A number of investigators are agreed that the popular medical systems of tribal, peasant, and allied peoples are "effective." Most of the literature closely examining that effectiveness focuses on the ethnopharmacological dimensions of the healing systems and generally ignores psychosocial factors. Recent developments in psychophysiology may offer insights into these neglected areas. The specific idea to be examined here is that successful "general medical treatment," or "symbolic healing," by either the shaman or physician, is based in part on a psychosocial mobilization of the patient's biochemical response system. Moreover, it is argued that to account fully for these processes we must reconceptualize the character of the human organism; a unitary alternative to standard Western Cartesian dualism (mind vs. body) is proposed, based on a model derived from recent research in neuroendocrinology. This model can be the basis for a nonreductionist theory of medical effectiveness needed to account for a series of observations (derived from both anthropological and medical contexts) which seem to transcend the explanatory powers of the traditional reductionist biomedical model.<br>

Abstract: Evil should be characterised as a specific constellation, which results from destructive connections between individual activities and systemic influences. The article shows some important aspects of the structure of evil and prefers the terms of wickedness and obscene coincidences to describe its own character. Therefore, also the division between rationality and affectivity appears as inadequate, because evil has on the one side an intrinsic attractiveness for individuals and is on the other side in modern societies more and more a product of a rationality, which is free from passion. Especially the emotional impoverishment is responsible for the increase of evil, which is demonstrated by two examples. Based on Paul Ricoeur, the evolution of malum can be developed by a short analyse of the relationship between Ethics and Emotions.<br>

Author(s): Giulea Dragoş A.<br>
Abstract: In his second theological oration (Oratio 28,3), Gregory Nazianzen equates the divine glory (kabod) of the Holy of Holies with the divine essence and asserts their inaccessible character. An investigation into the meaning of these two terms unveils their origins in two distinct traditions, the former tracing its roots back to the ancient Semitic symbolisms of the forbidden divine glory and throne, the latter to the Hellenistic philosophical conception of an immaterial and incomprehensible divinity. The thesis advanced in this study is that these two different languages represent two semiotic forms of apophaticism, one expressed through the mysterium tremendum inspiring symbols and images of fire, dazzling glory and enigmatic heavenly creatures, guardians of the enthroned kabod, the other through negative philosophical terminologies. The identity of the two semiotic forms is established at the end of an investigation that concludes with the observation that Hellenistic theologians developed their apophatic discourses mostly in the context of interpreting biblical reports on the theophanies of the divine and unapproachable enthroned kabod. It was in this hermeneutical context that they "translated" the symbols of interdiction into philosophical negative concepts.<br>

Author(s): Wolseley Ronald N.<br>
Abstract: Narrative methods are used to analyze the cultural dynamics of civil society through a comparison of African-American and "main-stream" newspaper coverage of the Rodney King crisis in Los Angeles. The newspapers' different narrative constructions affected the selection and interpretation of significant crisis events, shaped social expectations about how the crisis would be resolved, and constrained the range of symbolic strategies available to local political elites. Through and application of narrative methods, this case demonstrates how the analysis of plot, character, and genre can help explain the interplay between the analytic and concrete forms of culture and the dynamics of social problems and social change more broadly.<br>

Abstract: Since several well known critics have recently declared that the golden age of literary theory has come to an end, this might be the moment to rethink a theoretical problem that attracted some interest in the academic world from the late 1970s to the early 1990s: the relationship between historiography and literary criticism. Although the histoire des mentalités has given the literary text an unprecedented status in the reconstruction of the collective imaginary and although the discussion of similarities between forms of narrative in historical and fictional texts has undoubtedly intensified the dialogue between historiography and literary criticism, some aspects have been overlooked in the debate of the last twenty to thirty years. First, for both types of texts, fictional as well as historiographic, the wide range of narrative and representational strategies has not been taken into account; second, more recent narratological methods of analysis have not been applied to historiographic texts; third, the interest for the narrative character of historiographic texts can be found almost exclusively among literary critics and philosophers and much less among historians; and fourth, the analysis of narrative structures inside and outside the limits of fictional writing has eclipsed the main characteristic of literary texts, their inherent potential to produce pleasure.<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i30154098<br>
Date: 7 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Johannsen Jochen<br>
Abstract: After some initial remarks on the ongoing historiographic debates regarding experience as an analytical category, the article first tries to show, through a concise survey of J. G. Herder's essays on Ossian and Shakespeare, that Herder cannot be claimed as a source for the notion of historical experience in the sense of an immediate access to the past, as the theorist of history F. R. Ankersmit has stated. Instead, this article argues, experience can be understood as one of the key terms of Herder's historical view of modernity, whose development he describes as involving a paradigmatic change in the character of human experience itself. For Herder, the shift from primary to secondary experience in the modern historical process results in the necessity of an aestheticization of historiography. In this respect, the article briefly concludes, Herder inspired 19thcentury historians such as G. G. Gervinus.<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i30154135<br>
Date: 12 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Statkiewicz Max<br>
Abstract: The article resituates Ricur's theory of métaphore vive in the contemporary context of the so-called "cognitive revolution." The latter denomination is highly misleading. There is nothing revolutionary about the cognitivist study of metaphor as a general pattern of thought; just like the discipline of rhetoric that was already on the decline in l8th century Europe, it is conservative in its validation of everyday, ideologically charged language as the model for all language, including that of poetry and art. Riceur’s conception of "live metaphor," on the other hand, does justice to the "revolutionary" character of poetic language, its function of breaking the order of "commonplaces we live by"—and are ruled by. A "poem in miniature," metaphor constitutes the model for any "poietic," creative imagination. Resulting from a clash, disturbing the common everyday language, live metaphor (and poetry in general) projects a world in such a way as to render strange and thus question the world we live in.<br>

Abstract: Although the I960 student sit-ins were not nearly as uncoordinated as contemporaneous and subsequent accounts suggested, their repeated characterization in participants' accounts as "spontaneous" merits explanation. Analysis of campus newspaper articles and letters to the editor, speeches, and organizational and personal correspondence shows the emergence of a coherent and compelling narrative of the sit-ins, in which spontaneity denoted not a lack of prior coordination but independence from adult leadership, urgency, local initiative, and action by moral imperative rather than bureaucratic planning. Narratives of the sit-ins, told by many tellers, in more and less public settings, and in which spontaneity was a central theme, helped to constitute "student activist" as a new collective identity and to make high risk activism attractive. It was the storied character of representations of the sit-ins that compelled participation. This case suggests the more general importance of narrative-as distinct from collective action "frames"-in accounting for mobilization that takes place before the consolidation of movement organizations.<br>

Abstract: Whose perspective is reflected in ethnographic accounts is the enduring problem in bringing ethnographic observation forward in the construction of ethnographies. Both ethnographic research and modes of account display a liminal character that puts this problem in a more organizational perspective on their heterogeneous authority and unites doing ethnography and constructing ethnographies in similar ontological ambiguities arising in the social organization of communication.<br>

Author(s): Yankelovich Donald<br>
Abstract: A social psychologist dissatisfied with the oversocialized conceptions of man which predominate in sociology may well seek in the psychoanalytic theory of the instincts a countervailing individuality and a hard core of human nature as a basis for resistance to social determinism and relativism. Nevertheless, man appears to be a "denatured" and symbolling, rather than an instinctual creature. The mechanistic and biologistic psychoanalytic metapsychology has obscured Freud's central discovery of the unconscious dimensions of man's reality-constructing activity. Intrapsychic conflict and man's resistance to socialization arise not from any clash between nature (instinct) and culture (civilization), but from contradictions between conscious and unconscious fantasies and among the varying projects and definitions related to different moments of a person's biography. While social psychologists need to be reminded of man's unconscious symbolic action and interaction, psychoanalysts must be recalled (perhaps by the followers of Mead, as well as by disciples of Lacan) to the essentially semiotic character of their enterprise. In both disciplines the task is hermeneutic more than ontological: our aim is less to reveal Reality than to describe our varying (personal and social) "realities" and their expression in the myths and metaphors we live by -- consciously, preconsciously and unconsciously. /// Un psychologue social insatisfait des conceptions sursocialisées de l'homme qui prédominent en sociologie peut très bien chercher dans la théorie psychanalytique des instincts une individualité compensatoire, un noyau dur de nature humaine comme base de résistance au déterminisme et relativisme social. Néanmoins, l'homme paraît un être "dénaturé" et vivant de symboles plutôt qu'un être d'instinct. La métapsychologie psychanalytique (mecaniste et "biologitique") a obscurci la découverte centrale de Freud de la dimension inconsciente de l'activité constructive du réel de l'homme. Les~<br>

Publisher: University of New Mexico<br>
Issue: i286652<br>

Author(s): Yang Barbara<br>
Abstract: Beginning in the 1970s there has been a shift in cultural anthropological methodology from participant observation toward the observation of participation. During participant observation ethnographers attempt to be both emotionally engaged participants and coolly dispassionate observers of the lives of others. In the observation of participation, ethnographers both experience and observe their own and others' coparticipation within the ethnographic encounter. The shift from the one methodology to the other entails a representational transformation in which, instead of a choice between writing an ethnographic memoir centering on the Self or a standard monograph centering on the Other, both the Self and Other are presented together within a single narrative ethnography, focused on the character and process of the ethnographic dialogue.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i288399<br>
Date: 9 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Zur Stathis N.<br>
Abstract: I discuss several conceptual problems raised by current understandings of political violence, especially as they pertain to actions, motivations, and identities in civil wars. Actions "on the ground" often turn out to be related to local and private conflicts rather than the war's driving (or "master") cleavage. The disjunction between dynamics at the top and at the bottom undermines prevailing assumptions about civil wars, which are informed by two competing interpretive frames, most recently described as "greed and grievance." Rather than posit a dichotomy between greed and grievance, I point to the interaction between political and private identities and actions. Civil wars are not binary conflicts, but complex and ambiguous processes that foster the "joint" action of local and supralocal actors, civilians, and armies, whose alliance results in violence that aggregates yet still reflects their diverse goals. It is the convergence of local motives and supralocal imperatives that endows civil wars with their particular and often puzzling character, straddling the divide between the political and the private, the collective and the individual.<br>

Author(s): Williams Richard P.<br>
Abstract: There can be ethical understanding of organizational policy issues and that is important. However, there can be policy understanding about what the organization should do without understanding of individual level responsibility. There can be cognitive understanding of both policy and individual level ethics responsibilities and that is important. However, there can be cognitive understanding without affective, emotive concern. intellectual understanding without affective concern can lead to understanding without motivation. There can be cognitive understanding and affective concern and that is important, but not enough. There can be cognitive understanding and affective concern without effective political method. An action-learning approach to organizational ethics can join cognitive understanding of policy and individual level issues with both affective concern and effective political method. Joining of cognitive understanding, affective concern, and effective political method can stimulate and enable ethical character.<br>

Publisher: University of Notre Dame Press<br>
Issue: i40000764<br>
Date: 4 1, 1983<br>
Author(s): Jung Patricia B.<br>
Abstract: An account of character is developed on the basis of Ricoeur's philosophy of the will. Particular attention is paid to the role of the bodily involuntary in the process of character-formation. This augments the interpretation of the moral meaning of sanctification developed by Hauerwas. When interpreted in light of corporeality, sanctification entails not only a perceptual transformation but also an affective change in the agent's value orientation, the competent retraining of the agent's emotions, and the gracious triggering of an adoptive disposition toward the agent's incarnate situation. Finally, the rootedness of character in embodiment, with the attendant problem of automatism, indicates the limits of the usefulness of an "ethics of character" for moral theology.<br>

Publisher: Scholars Press<br>
Issue: i40000781<br>
Date: 10 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Lewis Paul<br>
Abstract: Jonathan Edwards's work is notable because he understands emotions to be central to character and agency. As such, he offers an alternative to currently dominant approaches to character ethics, often inspired by Aristotle, which largely ignore emotions or, when they do recognize that emotions are important dimensions of character, treat emotions in a problematic manner. In order to demonstrate Edwards's relevance to contemporary work on character and emotions, I begin by providing some background on character ethics. I then set out relevant features of Edwards's work before relating those features to the constructive work of Stanley Hauerwas and Robert Solomon. Such comparisons illustrate the contributions which Edwards can make to an ethic of character.<br>

Issue: i40000783<br>

Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: As Kosky and Avram show, the work of Levinas represents a significant contribution because (1) he takes seriously the challenge posed by the decay of religious traditions and other inherited frameworks of meaning and (2) he insists on the unconditional character of the good. Nonetheless, critical questions about the adequacy of this contribution need to be pressed more forcefully. I suggest that from the point of view of theological ethics his work is problematic in three ways: (1) He can give little guidance concerning what values we ought to seek; (2) in indentifying the good with the event of encountering the completely other, he falsely in- flates moral demands at the same time that he devalues commonalities; and (3) he offers scant grounds for affirming the goodness of being.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000901<br>
Date: 9 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Ferreira M. Jamie<br>
Abstract: Levinas himself raises the question: "why would I feel responsible in the presence of the Face" since "we are separate ontological beings?" This questions the character of our response to the other--both in terms of agency and motivation. While the general reception of Levinas's thought has focused on his description of us as "hostage"--that is, on the moment of assignation (or assignment) by the other--I suggest that Levinas himself also, though not as directly, addresses (as he needs to) the correlative moment, the moment of response. My essay reconstructs Levinas's implicit understanding of the character of our initiative in the light of his concept of Desire. I explore the different dimensions of Desire as appetite and generosity, and I argue that the "transition to moral consciousness" that Levinas wants to "justify" is one from complacent happiness to "non-complacent happiness" and can be illuminated by the notion of "passion seeking its downfall."<br>

Author(s): Guevin Benedict M.<br>
Abstract: Stanley Hauerwas, in developing what he calls "an ethics of character," discusses the importance of vision, imagination, and community for the shaping of character by means of "stories." Hauerwas convincingly argues that if persons are to be Christian disciples, they must allow their own way of life to be shaped by the story of Jesus' life. What Hauerwas does not undertake to explain is how the literary impact of stories (where vision, imagination and community become operative) affects the shaping of character. In this essay, I will demonstrate how the literary impact of one type of story, viz., the parable, can affect the shaping of character.<br>

Abstract: El cambio social, ¿es realizado por actores/agentes (=sujetos, individuales y supraindividuales), o bien por determinismos colectivos (como estructuras y sistemas)?, ¿o tal vez por una combinación cualquiera entre actores y mecanismos sociales? Las teorías sociológicas, desde el Ochocientos hasta hoy, se han dividido en dos grandes campos: a) Por un lado, han habido teorías que han adoptado un "paradigma olístico". b) Por otro, han emergido teorías que, juzgando las primeras como infectadas de determinismo, han elaborado un "paradigma accionista". Muchos autores han mezclado o combinado juntos ora una, ora otra de estas posturas sin lograr encontrar un punto de vista capaz de integrarlas o trascenderlas. El resultado es que, hoy, la mayor parte de las teorías oscilan entre el primer y el segundo paradigma, o bien tratan de comprender el cambio social a través de mezclas o "fórmulas combinatorias" entre las dos. La tesis del autor es que ni las teorías sistémicas (olísticas) ni las accionísticas (individualistas) ni sus combinaciones pueden encontrar una "comprensión adecuada" del cambio social. Ofrecen visiones parciales de la historia, que son insuficientes en tanto que comparten una carencia común: la idea de que la relación social sea un resultado (un efecto) de "otras" variables en juego, como las estructuras sociales o --por el contrario-- la subjetividad individual, o bien un determinismo en sí misma. Para comprender el cambio social se precisa de una teoría adecuada al carácter relacional de la realidad social, como realidad sui generis "hecha de" relaciones sociales. Se propone aquí un paradigma, denominado "relacional", según el cual el cambio social consiste en la "emergencia" de realidades sociales movidas por sujetos (individuales y colectivos) queestán en relación entre ellos en un determinado sentido. "Comprender" signifìca "relacionarse" con todo lo que tal relación (¡social!) significa y comporta. En la parte final se trata de ejemplificar las potenc~<br>

Abstract: Com este texto o autor procura uma resposta para a seguinte pergunta: "Que tipo de método poderá confirmar ou infirmar a hipótese segundo a qual o acto educativo é, no seu núcleo e na sua origem entitativa, confrontação violenta entre duas consciências?". Depois de esclarecer que esta hipótese inter-pretativa da educação tem em mira, não explicar ou descrever a realidade educacional na sua positividade, mas compreender o seu eidos ou essência constitutiva, o autor decide-se, na esteira de Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Duméry, Dufrenne, Levinas e Derrida, pelo método fenomenológico. Para efectuar a exploração filosófica que essa pergunta impõe, o método instituído por Husserl faculta, ao invés dos métodos positivistas e analíticos, uma visão global do fenómeno educativo numa intuição que se atinge depois de realizada uma redução eidética. Além disso, o método fenomenológico é entendido como o mais adequado para desvelar uma realidade cuja textura é tecida por relações intersubjectivas. Todo o texto desenvolve uma sequência argumentativa tendente a mostrar e a demonstrar quer a natureza, quer as potencialidades heurísticas do método fenomenológico aplicado à educação. Só este método poderá evidenciar a estrutura universal e necessária da educação: uma relação violenta entre duas consciências. /// Dans son texte l'auteur cherche une réponse pour la question suivante: "que type de méthode pourra confirmer ou infirmer l'hypothèse selon laquelle l'acte éducatif est en son centre et en son origine confrontation violente entre deux consciences"?

Abstract: Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics rests largely on the concept of the classical. According to Gadamer, the classical stands for the continuity and the truth claim of the tradition, as transmitted by the written word. The normative character of the classical is directed against the neutrality and relativism of historicism: understanding does not occur primarily through distancing or methodological reconstruction but through belongingness to, and participation in, the past. The article shows how, given the central importance of dialogue and otherness in Gadamer's theory, the philosopher does not seem to fully do justice to the critical intention of its own dialogical and philological dimensions. On the other hand, it shows also how Gadamer's hermeneutical practice, notably in his rehabilitation of Plato, stresses the learning from otherness more explicitly than does his own theory, thus correcting, as it were, the latter. The article aims, finally, at demonstrating how, by unduly emphasizing the continuity (and sameness) in the encounter between past and present, Gadamer's theory undermines the importance of reconstructing the otherness and specificity of the classical text. /// A hermenêutica filosófica de Gadamer, entendida como uma defesa das humanidades, assenta essencialmente sobre o conceito de clássico. Segundo Gadamer, o clássico representa a continuidade e a pretensão à verdade da tradição tal como nos é transmitida pela palavra escrita. O carácter normativo do clássico em Gadamer constitui assim uma resposta crítica à neutralidade e ao relativismo do historicismo: a compreensão não acontece primariamente graças a um processo de distanciação ou reconstrução metódica, mas sim pelo facto de, desde logo, reconhecermos que temos pertença activa no passado. O presente artigo demonstra como, dada a importância central do diálogo e da alteridade na teoria de Gadamer, ofilósofo acaba por não fazer inteiramente justiça à intenção crítica inerente à dimensão dialógi~<br>

Abstract: A quebra no que se refere às certezas da fé, a ênfase da própria experiência e os horrores do século XX levaram ao surgimento de uma vaga de (anti-)teodiceias. Aos ataques por parte do ateísmo correspondem do lado dos teólogos ou um certo resentimento em relação a Deus ou a sua desculpa mediante um pôr-em-questão da sua omnipotência. Surgiram desta forma propostas de carácter ora dualistico ora monístico que fizeram com que a resposta clássica ao problema tivesse progressivamente ficado quase reduzida ao âmbito do ininteligível (veja-se o caso da incompreensão das teses ontológicas referentes ao carácter deficitário do mal). Foi sobretudo em confronto com a tonalidade afectiva desta discussão que surgiu a "free-will-defense" da racionalidade, muito embora a questão seja aqui a de saber até que ponto não têve ela por isso de pagar um preço demasiado alto. Em referência à dupla questão de Boécio na obra "Consolação da Filosofia", o autor do presente artigo defende, por um lado, a não solubilidade do problema da teodiceia: "Si Deus est, unde mala?" - Néscio! Por outro lado, no entanto, o autor constata também que a reflexão sobre a experiência de si não só justifica, como até exige, uma abertura à esperança da fé: "Si vero Deus non est, unde bona?" Seio quod nonl Facto é que desta forma, diz o autor, nos confrontamos com a realidade do bem seja isso a propósito da exigência moral que experimentamos ou do protesto que levantamos contra a realidade do mal. Ora é esta auto-revelação do poder da realidade do santo e do bem que não só nos permite, mas também de nós exige a Esperança da sua manifestação final. /// Breakdown in what concerns faith certainties, emphasis on experience of the self, and the horrors of the XX century led to a wave of (anti)-theodicies.

Abstract: Por ocasião do cinquentenário da morte de Freud, ocorrida em 1989, multiplicaram-se as homenagens e as publicaçães que acentuaram não só os aspectos clínicos da sua obra científica, mas também o valor e a significação cultural da Psicanálise. O mesmo haveria de ocorrer uma década mais tarde por ocasião do centenário da publicação de A Interpretação dos Sonhos, obra inaugural da técnica psicanalítica e uma das principais marcas na história da psicologia contemporânea. Com opresente artigo, o autor pretende demonstrar até que ponto a Psicanálise é ainda hoje uma teoria e uma prática tão viva como conflitiva, mostrando, além disso, até que ponto ela assumiu, tal como Freud previra, um carácter de autêntica revolução científica e epistemológica, similar à copernicana ou a darwiniana nos seus respectivos momentos historicos. Neste sentido, para la de analisar diversas posturas culturais em relação à Psicanálise, as quais nos interrogam acerca da sua presumível universalidade, o artigo mostra também até que ponto a descoberta do Inconsciente constitui profundo abalo no estatuto do sujeito humano. /// At the time the fiftieth anniversary of Freud's death occurred, which happened in 1989, many celebrations and publications took place, many of which highlighting not only the clinical aspects of Freud's work, but also the cultural value and meaning of Psychoanalysis. Something similar occurred ten years later on the occasion of the centenary of the publication of the The Interpretation of Dreams, work of fundamental importance for the understanding of the psychoanalytic method and one of the main moments in the history of modern psychology With the present article, the author aims at demonstrating to what extent Psychoanalysis is still a theory and a practice as lively as it is conflictive, showing, among other things how it came to assume, as Freud himself had predicted, a character of an authentic scientific and epistemological revolution, in many ways similar to the Copern~<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo mostra até que ponto a transferência psicanalítica, produto de marca da aliança terapêutica, tem por vocação ser ultrapassada mediante a progressiva tomada de consciência que a pessoa analisada faz do caráeter instrumental da transferência. A transferência, com efeito, está destinada a dissolver-se no final da cura analítica. É verdade que a psicanálise, na sua técnica, contém sérios problemas; o artigo, porém, mostra como o seu "trabalho" essencial consiste em promover a transformação que o próprio sujeito opera mediante a sua palavra criativa, palavra esta que Ihe proporciona o seu próprio nascimento de si. /// This article tries to evince how the psychoanalytical transference, as a regular product of the therapeutic alliance, is meant to be overcome by a progressive consciousness that the patient acquires of its instrumental character. The transference is destined to be dissolved at the end of the analysis. It is true that psychoanalysis, in its technique, harbours serious problems; its essential « travail » , however, is to promote the transformation that a person realizes through his/her own creative word that pushes him/her to give birth to him/herself.<br>

Abstract: After locating postmodern philosophy in terms of its opposition to the quests for certainty in Descartes and Hegel and commenting briefly on its secular character, the article considers Jean-François Lyotard's critique of modernity's metanarratives and Heidegger's critique of onto-theology. The argument is a) that these critiques (and by implication other postmodern critiques) are not conceptually linked to the atheistic contexts in which they are found, b) that they can be read as unintentional commentaries on the Christian doctrines of Creation and the Fall and thus on human finitude and fallenness, and c) that when recontextualized in this way these critiques can serve as guides to personal and corporate self-examination, both theoretical and practical. /// O presente artigo, depois de localizar a Filosofia pós-moderna em termos da sua oposição à busca da certeza em Descartes e em Hegel e de comentar brevemente o seu carácter secular, toma em consideração a crítica de Jean-François Lyotard às metanarrativas da modernidade bem como a crítica que Heidegger faz à onto-teologia. O argumento é o seguinte: a) que estas criticas (e por implicação as outras críticas pósmodernas) não estão conceptualmente ligadas aos contextos de ateísmo em que se encontram; b) que elas podem ser lidas como comentários não intencionais às doutrinas cristãs da Criação e da Queda e, desse modo, à finitude e fragilidade humana; e c) que quando recontextualizadas desta forma estas criticas podem servirde guias para um exame crítico, tanto teorético como prático, a levar a cabo seja a nível pessoal seja ao nível corporativo.<br>

Abstract: Hobbes julgava ter encontrado na ciência e na sua metodologia, especificamente naquelas ciências que eram consideradas como indubitáveis, o modelo que lhe permitiria construir as bases da nova sociedade. Com isto buscava evadir-se das ambiguidades predominantes no seu tempo, as quais não faziam outra coisa senão manter a sociedade num estado bélico. O presente artigo mostra como Hobbes constrói o seu pensamento político de modo geométrico, como uma ciência demonstrativa, comparando o dever-ser da ciência política com a ordem imperante na matemática. O autor mostra ainda até que ponto Hobbes colocou todos os seus esforços na tarefa de dar um carácter científico à política, já que a sua pretensão era fazer dela uma ciência racional Numa palavra, o artigo mostra de que modo Hobbes pretendeu elevar o carácter da filosofia política ao de uma verdadeira ciência política. /// In science - particularly in those sciences that were considered indubitable -and in its methodology, Hobbes thought that he had found the pattern which would allow him to build the bases of a new society. In doing so he was trying to avoid the prevailing ambiguities of his time, which did not go beyond keeping society in an ongoing state of war. Accordingly, he builds his thought around the geometrical mode, as a demonstrative science. Thus he compares the "ought" of political science to the prevailing order of mathematics. Hobbes took great pains to give politics a scientific character, as he tried to make a rational science out of it. By doing this, Hobbes attempted to raise the nature of political philosophy to political science.<br>

Author(s): Welsen Peter<br>
Abstract: The systematic relevance of the arguments Schopenhauer directs against Kant's categorical imperative has hardly been discussed in detail so far. As the difference between Kant's and Schopenhauer's moral philosophy amounts to the opposition between practical reason and sympathy, it is anything but surprising that it is reflected by Schopenhauer's objections. Schopenhauer tries to show that practical reason - be it in its pure or empirical form - is altogether incapable of furnishing a solid basis for ethics. To assess the import of this thesis, a detailed examination of the aspects of practical reason that provoke Schopenhauer's critique is necessary including: 1) the identification of morality and reason; 2) the moral value of maxims; 3) the categorical imperative; 4) the prescriptive character of Kant's approach; and 5) his ethico-theology. Although some of Schopenhauer's arguments are based on misunderstanding, his interpretation of the categorical imperative as an expression of rational egoism seems convincing. /// A relevância sistemática dos argumentos que Schopenhauer dirige contra a doutrina kantiana do Imperativo Categórico quase não tern sido objecto de discussão. O autor do presente artigo considera que tal como a diferença entre a filosofia moral de Kant e de Schopenhauer se reduz à oposição entre razão e simpatia, não é motivo de surpresa verificar que ela está reflectida nas objecções de Schopenhauer. Este, com efeito, tenta mostrar que a razão prática - seja isso na sua forma pura ou na sua forma empírica - é totalmente incapaz de fornecer uma base sólida para a ética. Em ordem a captar a importância desta tese, o artigo propõe um exame detalhado dos aspectos da razão prática que suscitam a crítica de Schopenhauer, entre os quais se inclui necessariamente: 1) a identificação de moralidade e razão; 2) o valor moral das máximas; 3) o imperativo categórico; 4) o carácter prescriptivo da abordagem kantiana; e 5) a sua teologia ética.

Abstract: J. Robert Oppenheimer was among the most important and enigmatic figures in 20th century science. He is best known for successfully directing the Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan at the end of World War II. Subsequently, he became a scientist and statesman who advised the United States government in the areas of atomic weapons development and public policy. He later became subject to an investigation in 1954 into his previous political affiliations and his personal behavior that ended in the revoking of his security clearance. This essay seeks to chronicle Oppenheimer's coming of age as a public intellectual with a view toward his own psychological history and most especially in relationship to the stages of faith development articulated by James Fowler and colleagues. Moreover, though not conventionally religious, Oppenheimer's life and thought were permeated with themes and ideas of a religious and ethical nature that shaped his adult character and informed his view of the world. This essay was originally presented at The Richardson History of Psychiatry Research Seminar at Weill Cornell Medical College.<br>

Abstract: The role of narrative in explanation has received considerable attention in most of the disciplines concerned with questions of historical process, including history, geology, psychoanalysis and palaeo-anthropology. Archaeologists, however, have been curiously reluctant to consider the proposition that their reconstructions of the past are fundamentally narrative in character. An argument is put forward for the serious study of narrative in archaeology, and three case studies from the prehistory of the New Guinea Highlands are presented in support: a brief review of the debate over the impact of sweet potato on Highland society; an analysis of the changing interpretations of the Kuk Swamp agricultural site by Jack Golson; and a summary of the role of indigenous narratives in accounting for the history of wetland drainage amongst Huli speakers in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea.<br>

Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to outline Ricoeur's outlook on the basis of ethics and on the main elements to shape the ethical intention. Although this topic is not to the fore in his thought, Ricoeur has often raised the ethical problematic and delivered most valuable insights into it. We explain how he let a subjective, intersubjective and neutral moment precede the relationship between freedom and law. We also inquire into his vision on values and on the impact and meaning of evil for ethics. The ground of ethical existence is the fact that man basically is original affirmation of being which manifests itself in longing and striving. This dynamic facticity which is only discoverable through a reflection upon the works and creations of man, represents the starting-point for an autonomous ethics having a historical character. In this way, Ricoeur - in the main stream of J. Nabert - turns against I. Kant whose duty ethics misjudges the basic dialectic of human action. Besides, this starting-point allows ethics to meet the Christian kerygma in a more meaningful way than duty ethics is in a position to it. For the kerygma sacralizes no ethical interdiction but situates man into a history of salvation and proclaims healing and fulfilment to man's longing. A second and decisive moment in ethical existence is the appearance of the other. When the other enters into my life, he calls me up to foster mine and his freedom als well. The other becomes a centre of obligation to me, and I am called up to promote the well being of all mankind. Ricoeur also points out that the very norm of morality is man both as an individual and communitarian being. Furthermore, as human freedom is always mediated, we should fully take into account the economic, political and cultural reality which is ethically most relevant. The practice of freedom raises the question of values. Ricoeur rejects any voluntaristic and essentialistic view. Values are immanent requirements of freedom in its effort ~<br>

Abstract: In this article, an overview is given of Ricœur's ontological thinking. Although Ricœur never dedicated a whole book to the theme of ontology, it is present in most of hisarticles. In his study on the will he approached ontology initially through a strictly phenomenological method. After his analysis of the symbols of evil, in which hermeneutics was used as a philosophical instrument, he discovered the importance of linguistics in philosophical questions. Consequently, his thinking underwent a linguistic turn and evolved into a phenomenological hermeneutics. Through his dealings with ontology, it became clear that ontology is influenced by hermeneutics as well. A firm and stable ontology seems no longer conceivable and should be exchanged for a hermeneutical ontology that articulates being within the horizon of language. In this respect, Ricœur develops the concept of metaphor through which the 'seeing as' leads to a 'being as'. Although Ricœur acknowledges the dynamic and contingent character of being, his thinking aims at adimension beyond historical dynamics. However, in trying to clarify the problems of ontology, he discovers that it is not possible to solve the aporias of being. Still, language offers him an alternative opportunity to develop an account of being, namely narrativity, in which being is expressed in respect to its dynamic character and with the awareness that we always try to get a view on the whole from within.<br>

Abstract: Cet article explore les dynamiques de l'échange communicationnel à l'époque de Stalin et son impact sur la formation de l'opinion. Alors que les journaux, qui présentent leurs auteurs dans un état solitaire de monologue intérieur, révèlent souvent des étendues d'ambiguité et de doute, une communication engagée, particulièrement entre personnes se faisant confiance, est beaucoup plus à même de donner naissance à des jugements et des opinions clairs, ce qui est de la plus haute importance sur le plan de la capacité critique. La riche correspondance personnelle de la famille Kravčenko-Spunde, famille de vieux bolcheviks engagés, montre à quel point un échange ouvert peut susciter et renforcer tant le soutien que la critique la plus âpre du système. Ces documents mettent en lumière un changement majeur, le passage d'un soutien quasi inconditionnel au régime stalinien à sa critique de « fossoyeur de la révolution » , condamnation qui émerge du débat politique tenu dans le cercle étroit de la famille. De plus, la défense d'un bien commun à l'encontre du discours public pousse les discutants à transcender leur cercle restreint et à chercher un contre-public indispensable pour lever le soupçon de particularité qui pèse sur les « biens » défendus au sein de ce cercle et pour confirmer ainsi leur caractère de « bien commun ». La tentative d'élargissement du cercle communicationnel mène à une nouvelle activité dans l'écriture mémorielle qui se propose aussi bien de dévoiler les mensonges du système que de révéler un héritage révolutionnaire distinct de la représentation officielle monopolisée par le régime. L'expérience des relations personnelles pendant la révolution joue un rôle essentiel pour cette revendication dissidente d'un héritage révolutionnaire. Camaraderie et confrontation unie face à l'ennemi pendant la guerre civile doivent être distinguées de l'énonciation et de l'élaboration d'opinions lors de débats publics. Seule cette seconde expérience, basée sur la récipro~<br>

Author(s): Zablocki Charles F.<br>
Abstract: This article is about the influence of the work of the German sociologist Max Weber (1864-1920) on English-speaking anthropologists. Although Weber does not figure prominently in the history of anthropology, his work has, nonetheless, had a profound influence on anthropological methodology and theoretical thinking on the relationship between religion and political economy. The "interpretive anthropology" first developed by Geertz has roots in Weber's "interpretive sociology." Bourdieu's "theory of practice" is also strongly Weberian in character. The anthropological study of religion, and particularly the debate over the foundations of this field between Geertz and Asad, is reconsidered in light of Weber's sociology of religion. His comparative study of the ethics of the world's religions and particularly the "Weber thesis" about the relationship between religion and the development of bourgeois capitalism are shown to have been the foundation for a large body of anthropological research on religion and political economy in societies in which the major world religions have been long established. The essay ends with a suggestion that Weber's work on politics and meaning merits reexamination in light of contemporary anthropological interest, derived from Foucault, in power and knowledge.<br>

Author(s): Bostic Heidi<br>
Abstract: Françoise de Graffigny's mid-eighteenth-century play Phaza features a main character who is unknowingly crossed dressed as male. The text provides a rich starting point for exploring questions of gender identity and performance. This article situates Phaza within the fairy-tale tradition in which women authors played a major role. Its analysis draws upon philosophies of narrative identity and theories of gender to show that identity comprises both permanence and performance. Reading Graffigny can make an important difference in our understanding of gender, authorship, and relations between the sexes in Enlightenment France. Phaza's masquerade sheds light on the ways in which women authors of the era approached and assumed various gender identities. Eighteenth-century texts like Phaza reveal a lineage of ideas that continue to influence feminist thought today and will do so in the future.<br>

Publisher: Berghahn Journals<br>
Issue: i40084882<br>
Date: 4 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Mitchell Joshua<br>
Abstract: Because Hobbes is understood to be a proto-liberal thinker, a great deal hinges on how we understand his writings. Does he contribute to the development of a purely secular political self-understanding, as many liberals today claim? And, by extension, does that mean that liberal thought today best stands on a purely secular foundation? What, then, should we make of the extensive theological speculation throughout his Leviathan! Here, I argue that to reconcile the seemingly purely secular claims in Leviathan with the obviously religious claims found there we must move beyond reading him in terms of what I here call 'the fable of liberalism', and comprehend Leviathan as a whole in terms of Reformation era debates between Protestants and Roman Catholics about the limits and purview of reason. Understood in that way we see his claims about 'reason' in a new and important light. Rather than being an inevitable development that comes to supercede honour and glory, as the fable of liberalism suggests, 'reason' is seen to have an historically contingent character, whose parameters are established by wagers about the meaning of religious experience.<br>

Author(s): Wright Barbara B.<br>
Abstract: This paper analyzes the presenter in advertisements by means of a theoretical framework drawn from literary criticism. The paper adapts literary theory to explore the advertising "who" -- the presenter of a message. It turns to dramaturgy and narratology theory to formulate a trichotomy of advertising "points of view" -- first-person narrator, third-person narrator, and dramatic character. The formal and functional properties of each are discussed with advertising examples. Advertising consequences are illustrated with examples taken from Advertising Age's "Best Advertising of 1989" compilation. These are discussed in terms of media patterns, message strategy, and overall communication objectives. The discussion also suggests the need for additional research to understand hybrid and parody forms.<br>

Abstract: This article investigates the role of conversion in character reformation. It begins by exploring the initial formation of character in infancy and childhood, as well as challenges to the initial formation of character in adulthood. It then delineates the role ofconversion in character reformation by showing that an individual's encounter with a selftranscending conceptual universe may alter his or her self-identification. This alteration may be expressed as the individual's capacity to "tell a new story" about him or herself. This article argues that a shift in self-identification and self-narration lies at the heart of a reformation of character.<br>

Abstract: The study ’The meaning of action, the action of meaning’ raises the theoretical question of the relationship between the intent and meaning, the self-referentiality and referentiality of the literary text. It sets out from the hypothesis that a literary text has not only a self-referential, but also a referential character. Unlike non-literary texts whose function is their intent, the referentiality of a literary text is open. The ambiguity and polysemy of the text then results from the non-obviousness of reality itself. The concept that captures this difference between literary texts and texts with other functions is that of meaning. The study uses the concrete example of the thematicisation of the metamorphosis of a puppet, a monster or an animal into a man in Kleist, Collodi and Grass to illustrate the difference between mechanical intent founded upon efficiency and living meaning, founded on ambiguity and non-functional complexity. An analysis of Pavel Vilikovský’s novel Kôn na poschodí, slepec vo Vrábroch (’Horse Upstairs, Blind Man in Vráble’) shows how, in its thematic, ostentatiously self-referential action, meaning is born as an expression of the polysemic re fe re n tia lity of the text. The analy sis shows that behind this self-referentiality the text is also created in the referential action of meaning to such an extent that it is precisely the open action of meaning which becomes the r » on-obvious sense of the action of the text.<br>

Abstract: In view of the pluralism of current exegetical methodologies, constant recourse is had to models for interpretation of texts, be these more ancient stages of the text, as in historical-critical exegesis, or schemes of a logical character as in structural exegesis. What advantages does the use of a model offer to interpretation? With the analysis limited to a narrative text, an examination of the contribution from the philosophy of history (H.-I. Marrou), from epistemology (K. R. Popper), and from philosophical hermeneutics (H.-G. Gadamer,), helps to see in the logical dimension of the different models, the source of their interpretative power. At the hermeneutical level this opens up a perspective of unity in the exegetical methodologies.<br>

Abstract: This paper argues that the analysis of culture and mass communication should be regarded as central concerns of sociology and social theory. It develops a framework for the analysis of culture and shows how this framework can be applied to the study of mass communication. Focusing on the medium of television, the paper highlights some of the distinctive characteristics of mass communication and examines some of the factors involved in the production, construction and reception of media messages. It is argued that this approach enables the analyst to pose questions concerning the ideological character of mass communication in a new and more fruitful way.<br>

Issue: i40108701<br>

Author(s): Adamson Kay<br>
Abstract: In July 2004, a young woman claimed that she had been attacked on the Paris urban railway system by four Maghrebins and two Africans and that the discovery that she might be Jewish had intensified the character of the attack. For a number of days, the French media were dominated by the case and leading politicians condemned it. The events drew attention to a number of issues concerning culture and identity in contemporary France and the role played in constituting this identity of history and memory. However, it also displayed how the constitution of identity is a selective process in which different elements may be dealt with, either in different ways or omitted altogether. This article explores how in attempting to come to terms with the legacies of anti-Semitism, other areas of history and memory have been neglected, including the legacy of France's colonial empire, and, in particular, her relationship with Algeria.<br>

Article Title: What Have Brahmins to Do with Rabbis? Embodied Communities and Paradigms of Religious Tradition<br>
Publisher: University of Nebraska Press<br>
Issue: i40113297<br>

Author(s): Holdrege Barbara A.<br>
Abstract: Up until recently the academic study of religion has been dominated by Protestant Christian paradigms of religious tradition, in which precedence is given to such categories as belief, doctrine, and theology, and tradition-identity is rooted in the missionary character of Christian traditions. The essay argues that rabbinic Judaism and brahmanical Hinduism provide alternative paradigms of religious tradition as "embodied communities" in which priority is given to issues of practice, observance, and law, and tradition-identity is embodied in ethnic and cultural categories that reflect the predominantly nonmissionary character of these traditions. The manner in which the rabbinic and brahmanical traditions construct their respective categories of scripture—Torah and Veda—reflects the more fundamental affinities shared by these traditions as representatives of a distinctive paradigm of religious tradition: as elite textual communities that have codified their respective norms in the form of scriptural canons; as ethnocultural systems concerned with issues of family, ethnic and cultural integrity, blood lineages, and the intergenerational transmission of traditions; and as religions of orthopraxy characterized by elaborate legal systems, sacrificial traditions, purity codes, and dietary laws.<br>

Abstract: Fictionality is an immanent—though not exclusive—quality in literary texts, whatever their mode or genre. However, the property of fictionality is generally not mentioned in connection with lyric literary texts. Possible-worlds semantics helps us to envisage lyric texts as capable of generating fictional worlds: that is, poetic fictional worlds. Such worlds have a special character due to the texture constructing them. Some aspects of this uniqueness may be seen in the poetic world of Martin Codax, a thirteenth-century Galician jongleur.<br>

Abstract: Narratology may be thought of as a complicated system of conceptual filters that enact a severe formalist reduction upon the corpus of what may be thought and said about storytelling. According to Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, this reductiveness needs to be expanded in order to attend more to language. One way of answering to her reformist prescription is a turn to the study of linguistic surface structure organized as a meditation on the metaphor of the filter. For Seymour Chatman this metaphor designates a character through whom a narrator elects to tell a story. For Max Black, "filter" is a trope for metaphoric process. Examining these senses of the filter in Henry James's short story "The Beast in the Jungle" leads to emphasis upon negations and belief qualifiers. In James's story, both turn out to be invaded by the logic of Freudian negation, itself a type of intrapsychic filtration.<br>

Abstract: L étude veut montrer que l'individualité n'appartient ni aux êtres inanimés, ni aux espèces biologiques mais qu'elle est une propriété de chaque être vivant au sens du langage courant. L'ontogenèse de l'individu est analysée sous trois aspects: 1. morphogénétique ou formatif, à partir du moment où le nouveau vivant se distingue de ses procréateurs tant chez les organismes à reproduction végétative que chez les organismes à reproduction sexuée ; 2. immunologique, par lequel l'organisme constitue son « soi » et discrimine entre le « soi » et le « non-soi » ; 3. psychologique, où entre en compte toute l'histoire relationnelle du vivant avec le monde extérieur. Chez tout vivant, de l'unicellulaire à l'homme, l'individualité acquise est complémentaire de l'individualité innée, déterminée par le matériel génétique. Mais la racine même de l'individualité doit être cherchée dans la dimension ontologique de l'être vivant qui est à l'origine des propriétés du système biologique : unité, subsistance dynamique, autonomie, indépendance, capacité d'auto-organisation, etc. L'évolution de l'individualité, coextensible à l'évolution de la vie, elle-même coextensible à l'évolution de l'être et de l'unité, témoigne de son caractère analogique. Définir l'individualité comme l'unicité propre à un système biologique nous paraît respecter son caractère analogique et cerner les éléments fondamentaux qui la constituent. The scope of this study is to show that individuality does not belong either to inanimate bodies or to biological species but is an attribute of the « living being » as commonly understood. The ontogenesis of the individual is analyzed with reference to three aspects : 1. morphogenetic or formative, from the time a new living being becomes distinct from its progenitors, in both cases of vegetative and sexual reproduction ; 2. immunologital, from which an organism establishes its « self » and distinguishes between « self » and « non-self » ; 3. psychological, in which the ent~<br>

Abstract: La phénoménologie de Husserl est tenue pour descriptive dans la mesure où elle montre comment les choses apparaissent. Cela commence avec la visée de toute chose comme quelque chose. Voir et « voir comme », montrer et dire, sont profondément entrelacés. Toutefois, la description indirecte va plus loin. Elle se réfère à quelque chose en renvoyant à quelque chose d'autre – nous le savons depuis le concept de communication indirecte de Kierkegaard et l'analyse bakhtinienne de la parole indirecte et de la citation. Une approche indirecte est requise aussitôt que notre expérience dépasse le royaume du sens et de l'intentionnalité, car nous sommes alors confrontés à quelque chose qui nous affecte et à quoi nous répondons. Les principales figures de l'indirectivité vont au-delà du sens sous la forme de l'excès, de la déviance, ou du retrait. La voie de la description indirecte sera illustrée en référence à quelques phénomènes cruciaux: la dimension passive de l'attention, le caractère responsif de la liberté, le fait de porter témoignage de la violence, et la scission entre le dire et le dit. Husserl's phenomenology turns out to be descriptive as far as it shows how things appear. It starts with taking everything as something. Seeing and seeing as, showing and saying are deeply interconnected. But indirect description goes further. It refers to something by referring to something else, as we know it from Kierkegaard's concept of indirect communication or from Bakhtin's analysis of indirect speech and of quotation. An indirect approach is required as soon as our experience surpasses the realm of meaning and intentionality, being confronted with something we are affected by and with something we respond to. Main figures of indirectness are going beyond by excess, deviating from, or withdrawing from. The way of indirect description will be illustrated by referring to some crucial phenomena: the passive part of attention, the responsive character of liberty, bearing witness of~<br>

Abstract: Selon la philosophie moderne la pensée est une production de la subjectivité, la volonté est une auto-détermination et le temps est une auto-affection. Kierkegaard offre une autre compréhension de la vie volontaire en envisageant une volonté brisée par le prochain, par le temps et par Dieu. La patience n'est pas pour Kierkegaard un accident de notre caractère, mais la condition pour devenir une personne. Cela suppose de laisser de côté toute compréhension purement psychologique de la patience. La vraie persévérance s'oppose totalement à l'obsession de se blinder par rapport au monde. Entre l'endurance stoïcienne et la patience chrétienne comme patience dans l'espérance il n'y a pas d'essence commune. Kierkegaard montre que la patience de l'amour est une passivité qui est la voie du salut. For modem philosophy meaning is a product of subjectivity, will is a self-determination, and time is a self-affection. Kierkegaard gives us another meaning for a voluntary life by considering desire that is broken by the will of another man, time and God. Patience is not for Kierkegaard an accident of character but is the condition to becoming a person. It is necessary to ignore a purely psychological understanding of patience. True perseverance is radically opposed to an obsessive existence blinded to the world. Between the stoic conception of endurance and Christian patience there is no common essence. For Kierkegaard, the patience of love is a form of passivity that can save Mankind.<br>

Author(s): Thiselton Anthony C.<br>
Abstract: A flood of research literature on 1 Corinthians over the last fifteen years suggests an understanding of this epistle and of the ethos of the church in Corinth that resonates closely with issues in our culture today. The ethos of "secular" Corinth still heavily influenced the church in Corinth. It encouraged attitudes that today we associate with consumerism, postmodernism, and social construction, together with an overpreoccupation with autonomy, success, audience-pleasing rhetoric, and a "local" theology. The church sought to choose its own leaders, its own ethics, its own socio-political value-system, and its own criteria of spirituality. However, Paul sets forth a formative understanding of the cross; an understanding of the Church as one, holy, catholic, and apostolic; a Christomorphic re-definition of "spiritual" and of the Holy Spirit; love and respect for "the other"; and the gift-character of grace and resurrection. How does this relate to hermeneutical distance and appropriation?<br>

Abstract: L'article propose de renouveler l'analyse de la mémoire historique française de l'Occupation. Il met en évidence un processus d'institutionnalisation d'une nouvelle figure, celle du Juste parmi les nations devenu progressivement Juste de France. Cette évolution repose notamment sur un rapport complexe entre ce nouveau personnage mémoriel et celui, plus ancien, du Résistant. D'une part, cette mise en place s'appuie sur des modalités symboliques proches de celles utilisées pour les résistants. D'autre part, la figure du Juste de France remplit un rôle fonctionnel autrefois exclusivement dévolu à ces derniers. À travers son incorporation s'opère la réécriture d'une rhétorique dichotomique au sein d'un régime mémoriel renouvelé où une France-patrie des droits de l'homme remplace une France-nation et territoire. Ce constat conduit à l'analyse de la portée réconciliatrice d'une telle mémoire historique et de ses modalités. Celle-ci repose notamment sur les imbrications entre individuel et collectif au cœur des représentations du passé. L'article incite enfin à un retour critique sur les travaux des tenants du « paradigme de la mémoire stratégique ». Ainsi, à travers un cas empirique concret, l'auteur se livre-t-il à une réflexion conceptuelle et méthodologique sur la notion de mémoire et ses implications. Apparaît avec force la nécessité de dépasser les approches courantes des phénomènes de mémoire, souvent trop linéaires et unidimensionnelles. The article aims to throw new light on the analysis of French historical memory of the occupation. There is the institutionalization of a new figure, that of the righteous among nations becoming progressively the righteous of France. This development is based on complex relations between this new memorial character and the older one of the Resistant. On the one hand, this character is built on symbolic processes similar to those used for the Résistants, and on the other hand, the figure of the righteous of France fulfills a functio~<br>

Abstract: In Arendt's interrogations of political modernity, the concepts of history and politics have an ambiguous relation. On the one hand, she insisted that the performative character of politics as action was bound to its narrative aspect as remembrance. She was also a fervent proponent of integrating the historical sense into political understanding. On the other hand, Arendt characterized the modern historical sensibility from the point of view of politics as a "ghastly absurdity," and asserted that the political thought of our times needed to free itself both "from history" and "from thinking in historical terms." This paper explores the different meanings that Arendt granted to "history" as a (anti) political force and to historical sensibility as the basis for political understanding. It argues that not only were Arendt's rejection of the modern concept of history and its politics of history central for her critique, but that it was one of the key concerns that shaped the articulation of her own theory of action. The paper also examines the problem against the background of the intellectual tradition of Arendt's youth and in particular its uncompromising antihistoricism.<br>

Abstract: From the very beginning of his career as a writer, Nikolay Ostrovsky (1904-36) received hostile criticisms of his style, which was described as 'coarse,' and which led some observers to conclude that his success was due more to his prowess as a soldier than to his talents as a writer. But his success was incontrovertible. Readers rushed to buy his book How the Steel Was Tempered, despite the absence of publicity when it appeared. What accounts for the extraordinary success? Readers' letters contained in the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art (RGALI) can help us answer this question. Over the past ten years there have been many studies in which scholars have sought the organizational basis of socialist realism as an esthetic, putting the literariness of the work before its political character. It certainly seems logical, since esthetics is not just a question of production but also of consumption (Jauss, Iser, Lotman), that this program of research should also include the acceptance of the texts, their reception by the readers. Сначала своей писательской карьеры, Николай Островский (1904-1936) получил строгие критики за свой стиль, который был описан как «груб» и некоторые наблюдатели считали, что успех его был обязан больше его подвигам в качестве солдата чем его талантам писателя. Но успех был бесспорен. Читатели устремлялись чтобы покупать книгу, Как закалялась сталь, несмотря на отсутствие рекламной шумихи во время ее публикации. Что может объяснить этот чрезвычайный успех? Письма читателей, содержавшиеся в Государственных архивах искусства и литературы Федерации России (RGALI) могут нам помочь отвечать на этот вопрос. В течение последних десяти лет, многочисленные публикации показали структуру социалистического реализма, как эстетика, помещающая литературность произведения перед его политическим характером. Потому что эстетика не только вопрос продукции а также потребления (Jauss, Iser, Lotman), кажется логическим, чтобы эта исследовательская программа ~<br>

Abstract: This article with various models of relation between science and belief. The first part of paper discusses all theories which affirm an opposition between science and religious belief: some of the speak about a real and durable contradiction (logical empirism, marxism), another speak only about linguistic opposition (fideism, cryptofideism, theory of double truth). All these theories are controversial because they call in question the noetic value of religion or of science. The second part of the paper considers the theories affirming concordance between science and belief. They are following: the distinction of man's existential attitude toward religion and science (so-colled II. Wittgenstein), the theory of concordance, complementary character of science and belief, the theory of methodologie difference and of object's diversity. The author came do the conclusion that the best explication of the relation between science and religion is given by the synthetic-complementary theory.<br>

Abstract: Tamburlaine's insistence on making his audience see his sovereign power is a means by which he can organize and control alterity by fixing himself in specular relation to his objects. As the palpable reflections of his identity, Tamburlaine's sights of power produce effects of dramatic literalization by which he can maintain his unified and stable position as sole emperor: the play orders its field of vision by constructing an imaginary subject in fixed relation to its objects. The play, to the extent that it posits stable links between a subject and its images, and between signifiers and signifieds generally, creates a delusional space in which absolute sovereignty becomes possible. The effects of sovereignty, however, continue to define not only the theatrical space of the play, but the space of interpretation as well: critics have tried to account for the contest between aspiration and limitation in Tamburlaine by invoking concepts of theme, genre, character, and author in order to make sense of and therefore stabilize the play's conflicting gestures. Like Tamburlaine, the critic constructs an imaginary space by creating objects in relation to which he can confirm his own unity and power. Tamburlaine thus becomes a figure for the claims of sovereignty that mark all acts of interpretation.<br>

Author(s): PAYEN Pascal<br>
Abstract: A l'intérieur du corpus des Vies parallèles de Plutarque, la Vie de Sertorius offretrois singularités : elle est la seule qui se déroule presque en totalité en Occident ; elle appartient au seul couple - Sertorius-Eumène — où le Romain est placé en premier ; le récit ne couvre pas la durée d'une vie, mais isole dix années (83/2 à 73 av. J.-C). Comment rendre compte ensemble de ces trois données situées sur des plans différents ? Les Vies parallèles délimitent un espace qui, à la fin du Ier siècle et au début du IIe, correspond au monde dominé par Rome, devenue garante et protectrice d'une histoire commune. Or autant l'Orient a reçu l'empreinte dts Grecs et des Romains, autant l'Occident est resté à l'écart. Ainsi formulera-t-on l'hypothèse que le sujet principal de cette Vie, tout autant que le personnage même de Sertorius, est l'Espagne, ou plus exactement l'extrême Occident, qui fait écho à l'extrême Orient, aussi bien à l'intérieur du récit (avec l'épisode de la troisième guerre de Mithridate) qu'au sein de l'ensemble des Vies. L'objet de cette étude est donc d'étudier en quoi une source grecque, postérieure de deux siècles aux événements qu'elle rapporte, témoigne de la place et de la fonction de l'extrême Occident dans la Méditerranée gréco-romaine, et, en cela, de mettre au jour quelques-unes des contraintes que pose, en tant que source, la Vie de Sertorius pour l'étude de l'Hispanie de la fin de la République. Within the corpus of Plutarch's Parallel Lives, the Life of Sertorius presents three peculiarities: it is the only one to take place almost entirely in the West; it belongs to the only couple -Sertorius-Eumenes- in which the Roman is given precedence; the narrative does not cover a whole lifetime but isolates ten years (83/2 to 73 BC). How then take together and account for those three facts situated at different levels ? The Parallel Lives delimits a space which, by the end of the 1st century and the beginning of the second, corresponds to a world unde~<br>

Abstract: Ethnomethodology captures ordinary events in ways that retain their dynamic and collaborative character. Ethnomethodologists identify people's methods for developing a practical objectivity that can render their local affairs meaningful and orderly, and they closely scrutinize the local details of mundane affairs in order to describe how a local cohort of cooperating parties concert themselves in providing an intelligibility for their social interaction, local work that is naturally occurring and depends upon the reflexive character of any emerging sense.<br>

Abstract: The study deals with the 'story of Fra Angelico', that is with the shaping of this character from the Quattrocento to the present day. Very little can be known about the artists real life, but we do have a powerful image of him: this image is a mirror of perfection, in line with the medieval tradition of the moral speculum. Vasari s "Life of Fra Angelico", which assimilates the monk-painter to the saints and Christ, is analyzed in detail as a literary construction aimed at providing the model of a perfect Christian artist. It is also related to some works by Fra Angelico, especially the Louvre altarpiece and Jesus among the doctors in the armadio degli argenti. In the latter painting, the figure of a Dominican is analyzed as a self-projection of Fra Angelico that perfectly matches Vasari's image of him.<br>

Abstract: Studies of laboratory research in the natural sciences have shown the significance of crossexperimenter dialogue in the determination of scientific facts. Behavioral and social scientists have largely ignored that role in the construction of scientific facts. A dialogic data base differs epistemogically from strict behavioral observations because of its retroductive and dialectic character. Its symbolic nature calls for hermeneutic efforts designed to achieve and assess consensual rather than empirical validation. Its ultimate aim is social organization rather than prediction and control. In view of this distinction, experimental research of human behavior must show the integration of the empirical and dialogic bases of behavioral data so as to more accurately reflect its constructive nature.<br>

Abstract: In spite of its classical framework, the inner directions and the narrative of Bartók's music are unconventional; they are unusual even in the context of twentieth-century music. By inner direction and narrative I mean those features of the music that determine the flow of the musical process, such as: balance between static and dynamic sections, distribution of thematic and transitional materials, proportions, development toward climax and the placing of climaxes, the logic in the sequence of musical character, strategies for opening and ending a composition, and so on. In these aspects, Bartók's forms are deeply alien to Classical and, for the most part, even to Romantic thinking.<br>

Abstract: One of the acute problems of the early church was the tension between the absolute promise of Jesus and the fact that worthy prayers were not answered. Two types of solution developed. The more popular, drawing on Jewish precedent in the Old Testament, took the easy option, and blamed the petitioner for various forms of inadequacy. The other recognized the incarnational character of grace, and thus saw Christians as the hands and ears of God. When they listened to the needs of others and responded God heard and acted. Un des problèmes brûlants qui préoccupaient l'Église primitive était l'extrême tension entre la promesse absolue de Jésus et le fait que des prières apparemment dignes d'être exaucées restaient sans réponse. Deux types de solution se développèrent. L'explication la plus populaire, qui s'inspirait d'un précédent juif attesté dans l'Ancien Testament, choisit la solution facile : c'est l'orant qu'il fallait blâmer : sa prière avait été insuffisante. L'autre solution reconnaissait le caractère incarné de la grâce : les chrétiens étaient les mains et les oreilles de Dieu. Quand ils étaient attentifs aux besoins des autres et y répondaient, Dieu les écoutait et agissait.<br>

Author(s): Haers Jacques<br>
Abstract: The Jesuit Refugee Service contributes in a creative way to the mission of «faith doing justice». Its starting point is the experience of and with the refugees it is called to serve. This article, therefore, has a distinct narrative character. JRS' practice sheds light on some important aspects of justice, which can also be found in solid presentations of Catholic Social Teaching. This contribution highlights how faith, mission (accompaniment, service and advocacy) and institutional capacity are key features of a solid understanding of justice. Il Servizio dei gesuiti per i rifugiati (JRS) contribuisce in modo creativo alla missione della «fede che opera la giustizia». Il suo punto di partenza è l'esperienza dei e con i rifugiati che si è chiamati a serviré. Questo articolo, tuttavia, presenta una diversa peculiarità di discorso. L'esperienza del JRS illumina alcuni aspetti importanti della giustizia che possono anche essere ritrovati in importanti trattazioni della dottrina sociale della Chiesa. Questo contributo chiarisce come la fede, la missione (accogiienza, servizio e tutela) e la capacità di muoversi a livello istituzionale siano chiavi imprescindibili per una comprensione profonda della giustizia.<br>

Abstract: Pour décrire les moyens dont dispose l'individu pour se constituer en personne (partagée entre l'identité du caractère, l'idem, et le soi plus personnel et moral de l 'ipse), Paul Ricœur, dans Soi-même comme un autre (Paris, Seuil 1990), emprunte aux linguistes deux ensembles conceptuels: les références identifiantes (noms propres) et les actes d'autodésignation du je. Mais, par ce double biais, la pragmatique linguistique conduirait, selon lui, à une impasse, éludant finalement la question du qui? C'est oublier que, dans l'énonciation, le je lui-même acquiert une certaine épaisseur sémantique. Une poésie mimétique d'action comme la poésie lyrique grecque montre le rôle que peut jouer dans la constitution du moi une identité énonciative collective, qui inscrit d'emblée la dialectique entre l'idem et l'ipse dans le rapport avec les autres, sans référence ni métaphysique ni théologique. To describe the means the individual has for establishing personhood (between character identity, the idem, and the more personnel and moral self of the ipse), Paul Ricoeur, in Oneself as Another (English translation 1992), borrows two conceptual ensembles from linguistics: the identifying references (proper nouns) and the self-designating acts of the self. But, according to him, by taking this double bias, linguistic pragmatics leads to an impasse by finally eluding the question "who". This is to forget that in enunciation, the very self acquires a certain semantic depth. A mimetic poetry of action, like Greek lyrical poetry, shows the role that can be played in the constitution of the self by a collectively enunciated identity, which automatically sets the dialectic between the idem and the ipse in relation to others, without metaphysical or theological reference.<br>

Abstract: Ritual studies is a new discipline within the field of the study of religion. Liturgical theology is, in the West, a recent development within the Held of systematic theology. The article describes each and indicates ways in which they may contribute to the work of the other while retaining their separate identities. The development of methods for describing and analyzing ritual action may enable liturgical theology to construct its own analyses upon a more broadly phenomenological base. At the same time theology's insight into the history of liturgical action may enable ritual studies to overcome an excessively synchronie perspective and to attend to the normative character of ritual gesture.<br>

Abstract: L'affirmation selon laquelle le mariage chrétien est le signe efficace de l'union du Christ et de l'Église est une donnée de la Tradition. Elle n'en soulève pas moins, au regard des sciences humaines (ethnologie, psychanalyse), de la philosophie, de la théologie enfin, un certain nombre de difficultés théoriques dont plusieurs sont examinées ici. L'effort ensuite tenté pour les lever aboutit à une présentation nouvelle de la sacramentanté du mariage. Le couple uni et fécond aurait à prophétiser la réconciliation des sexes et des générations. Ainsi témoignerait-il, dans l'Esprit, de ce qui est déjà et qui sera, mieux encore: de Celui qui est et vient: Dieu tout en tous. L'étude se termine en évoquant les pratiques externes et internes du couple qui dérivent logiquement de cette prophétie. Asserting that Christian marriage is an effectual sign of Christ's union with the Church is a datum of the Tradition. It nevertheless raises, as far as human sciences (ethnology, psychoanalysis), philosophy and in fine theology are concerned, a certain number of theoretical difficulties, several of which are here examined. The subsequent effort to overcome them leads to a new presentation of the sacramental character of marriage. The united and fruitful couple should prophecies the reconciliation of sexes and generations. Thus would it testify in the Spirit, what already is and shall be, better still: from Him who is and comes, God, the whole power in all men. The essay is concluded by evoking the external and internal experiences of the couple logically resulting from this prophecy.<br>

Abstract: L'étude se propose de montrer le bien-fondé et la fécondité de l'herméneutique du témoignage en philosophie en interrogeant l'un des problèmes fondamentaux que pose cette pratique, celui du rapport entre singularité et universalité, et ce dans trois champs relevant de la littérature : la littérature au sens large, les mythes littéraires et la Bible. L'étude de la notion de témoignage et de ses déplacements sémantiques dans le témoignage littéraire est inspirée de la philosophie de Paul Ricœur. Les exemples analysés sont ceux du mythe de Faust et de la figure de Job. This study endeavours to show that the hermeneutics of witness in philosophy are indeed well grounded and fecund, by inquiring into one of the essential problems of this practice : that of the relation of the singular to the universal. Three areas relating to literature are broached : literature in a wide sense, myth literature, and the Bible. This study of the idea of witness and its semantic fluctuations in witness literature is inspired by Paul Ricceur's philosophy. The examples analysed here are the Faust myth and the character Job.<br>

Abstract: Confrontation de diverses lectures d'un récit, d'une scène, d'une tradition religieuse. À partir de la figure évangélique de la pécheresse (Luc 7), les analyses philosophiques du pardon s'inscrivent chez le jeune Hegel dans une réflexion sur l'opposition de la loi (le châtiment) et de la réconciliation (l'amour). Dans son Esthétique, les traités de l'art romantique et de la peinture voient en la Madeleine la figuration d'une beauté où intériorité et extériorité s'accordent harmonieusement. Dans divers écrits sur la religion, le même personnage, qui évoque les traits de la belle âme, n'est pas étranger aux méditations sur destin de Jésus, le pardon des offenses et l'idée de la grâce. Ces diverses représentations induisent une pensée en rupture avec d'autres approches philosophiques de la grâce et du pardon (Spinoza, Kant). Une deuxième partie évoque la pécheresse, souvent confondue avec d'autres femmes des Évangiles, telle qu'on la retrouve chez des écrivains de la spiritualité française (Bérulle 1627, Charles de Saint Paul 1628, Lacordaire 1859) et chez les peintres de l'époque baroque. L'article se termine par une étude des nombreuses évocations de la pécheresse chez Kierkegaard. À la différence de la spéculation philosophique ou des « élévations » mystiques, c'est dans une méditation toujours au plus près de la lettre même du Nouveau Testament que sont alors développés de manière existentielle les thèmes du repentir et du pardon. A look at diverse readings of a story, a scene, a religious tradition. Taking the gospel figure of the adulterous woman (Luke 7) as a starting point, the youthful Hegel sets his philosophical analysis of forgiveness in a meditation on Law (Punishment) versus Reconciliation (Love). In his Aesthetics, the treatises on the romantic art movement and on paintings see in Mary Magdalen the figuration of a beauty in which interiority and exteriority are harmonised. In various writings on religion, the same character, now the figuration of the bea~<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>

Author(s): Wordsworth Herbert F.<br>
Abstract: The fortunes of epiphany indicate both recent historical disparities within literary criticism and current cultural disparities between academic and popular discourse. The contextualist practice of Wordsworth and Joyce, in contrast to the purist theory that arose with the New Criticism, suggests that epiphany is a narrative device underscoring the historical and cultural construction of character. This conception is borne out by the original Epiphany, in Matthew, which manifests divine personality to human eyes through an episode of cultural difference and accommodation. Robert Browning's historicist poetry uses comparable but secular means of manifesting personality. In his dramatic monologues "Karshish," "My Star," and " 'Transcendentalism,' " epiphanic themes serve as measures of their speakers' cultural construction. In discerning the relative differentiae that characterize such speakers, Browning's readers encounter their own relativity to interpretive conditions. As these examples imply, the modern literary epiphany ultimately effects the hermeneutic manifestation of the reader.<br>

Publisher: American Oriental Society<br>
Issue: i225333<br>
Date: 12 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): Feenberg Sheldon<br>
Abstract: The long-held view concerning the absence of a historical understanding in traditional India merits reconsideration on the basis of recent scholarship on the notion of history as such, the rhetorical foundations of historiography, the nature of narrativity, the character of historiography in classical antiquity, and the actual historical documents that are available from premodern India. Yet the absence of a historical-referential dimension of Sanskrit discourse remains a serious problem, one that Mīmāṃsā views on the referential sphere of the Veda may help us to understand. Mīmāṃsā makes the authority of the Veda dependent on its timelessness, and thus must empty the Veda of its historical referentiality. Since learned discourse (śāstra) in general is subject to a process of "vedicization," it adopts the Veda's putative ahistoricality; and the same set of concerns comes to inform the understanding of the genre itihāsa ("history") and the interpretation of itihāsa texts. History, consequently, seems not so much to be unknown in Sanskritic India as to be denied.<br>

Abstract: In their interpretations of magical acts and utterances, anthropologists frequently argue that magic and technology are informed by two different kinds of logic, the former "expressive" in character, the latter "instrumental." A close analysis of magical hunting songs used by the Aguaruna of Amazonian Peru reveals that the songs are part of a general ordering process that encompasses the strategic use of thoughts, speech, objects, and acts to achieve practical ends. In Aguaruna thought the expressive imagery of magical songs is an instrumental tool that shapes events in the performer's world.

Abstract: This is partly an allusion to Wittgenstein on language games but I am emphasising the sense of play to add to what he says of games, life and travel. On language games, see more in
         Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-religion/ (accessed 18 February 2010): Some properties of language-games can be noticed in Wittgenstein’s several examples and comments. They are, first, a part of a broader context termed by Wittgenstein a form of life (see below). Secondly, the concept of language-games points at the rule-governed character of language. This does not entail strict and definite systems of rules for each and every language-game, but points to the conventional nature of this sort of human activity. Finally, Wittgenstein’s choice of ‘game’ is based on the over-all analogy between language and game, assuming that we have a clearer perception of what games are. Still, just as we cannot give a final, essential definition of ‘game’, so we cannot find ‘what is common to all these activities and what makes them into language or parts of language.’<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the
         sugyain the Babylonian Talmud that includes the story of the Oven of Akhnai, in BTBaba metzi‘‘a58b––59b, expanding earlier studies by Jeffrey Rubenstein and Charlotte Fonrobert. It shows that two scriptural quotations involving, respectively, David and Tamar, situated in the first part of thesugya, anticipate the subsequent story and clarify how it functions as a ““foundation myth”” of the Beit Midrash (Fonrobert), and, therefore, of male identity (Boyarin). I suggest that the entiresugyaconstructs male identity by way of contrast with two ““others,”” the divine and the female realms, which are excluded from the Law-making process. The danger of verbal wrong, however, reveals the necessity of reintroducing the excluded ““others.”” The text achieves this by recognizing the existence of a transcendent justice, and by making Tamar, a foreign and female character with no access to the Law, a model of delicacy in verbal communication.<br>

Abstract: In a similar critique of language and consumerism, in
         Whole Foods, Marie Buck playfully fuses language from the company's website, an anarchist zine, and etymological dictionaries, so that “the hybrid form ofWhole Foodscontrasts with the grocer's rhetoric of uncorrupted organic wholeness and natural unmediated authenticity.”
               Her poems play on culinary exoticism and the branding and marketing of food products to indicate privilege and access: “Cheeses often reflect the character of their country of origin, so experimenting with different cheese can be a kind of exploration of a faraway place” (“Cheese”).118
            
               In one poem titled “Authenticity,” Buck incorporates what appear to be instructions for caring for fruit with intimations about the process of poetic making: “Cutting and exposure to the air darkens the flesh. We stood in unheated squats having tooth and not being limp. We were more art than science. We gently rubbed our skin in a circular motion.”119
            
               The process of slicing and selecting brings about a transformation that is “more art than science” in this self-reflective poem. But more immediately, “Authenticity” also calls to mind the exposé concerning Whole Foods cofounder John P. Mackey, who used a pseudonym to post more than 1,100 entries about his own company on Yahoo! Finance bulletin boards between 1999 and 2006. The food mogul's posts were often self-serving: “I like Mackey's haircut. I think he looks cute,” one 28 April 2000 post read. “You must not patronize any of WFMI's stores. Tattoos, piercings, unusual dress and interesting haircuts are everywhere in the stores. In comparison, Mackey looks like a model for Brooks Brothers!”120
            
               The hypertrophied falseness of the supermarket comes to a head in Mackey's (im)posturing.121<br>

Abstract: These sentiments are cemented in words such as “overripe” (125), “motionless” (138), and “restless” (128); and the sound imagery changes character from a feeling of remembrance to one of forgetfulness: “She turned to me and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn” (131); “hollow, wailing sound” (138); and “I heard a low husky sob” (141). Even the wedding orchestra from the ballroom seems to be playing in a headwind: “From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air” (132).<br>

Abstract: Basic to the entire procedure is the conception that what is in turn eclipsed and neutralized is not merely the human community of a given area and locality but the total corporate unit of all elements animate and inanimate alike, which together constitute its distinctive character and “atmosphere.” To this wider entity we may assign the name topocosm, formed (on the analogy microcosm and macrocosm) from the Greek,
            topos, “place” andcosmos, “world order.” The seasonal ceremonies are the economic regimen of this topocosm…. The essence of the topocosm is that it possesses a two-fold character, at once real and punctual, and ideal and durative, the former aspect being necessarily immerged in the latter, as a moment is immerged in time. It is bodied forth as a real and concrete organism in the present, it exists also as an ideal, timeless entity, embracing but transcending the here and now.

Abstract: But consider the referents when I say, “Come here, I want to show you a gorilla,” “Come here, I want to show you a human being,” “Here look at this beautiful woman,” “Look at this hunk of a man,” and so forth, all of which feature properties. Now consider a quite different display: “Come here, I want to show you a person.” What are we here looking for? How does it differ from an individual human being? Granted that we in fact use
            personas synonymous withhuman being, are we here merely displaying an individual human being or instance of the kind called “human”? Consider the resistance in saying, “Come here, I want to show you a Barak Obama.” We might, of course, have in mind a political style or character and thus refer to a constellation of properties. But we would not be referring to the person, Barak Obama, certainly not to what he refers to when he says “I,” but, for example, to a type, a certain sort of politician.

Abstract: Beginnings: My first experience of the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP) was at Northwestern University; the business meeting was trying to decide whether its name should be “the Society for Existential Philosophy and Phenomenology” or “the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy”—it spent nearly three hours with impassioned speeches made by many now departed mighty dead and others still here. I was a graduate student, just starting a dissertation on Paul Ricoeur, and I sat wondering where all this would lead. And we are now half a century later, with SPEP the second-largest philosophy group in America. The task for me is somehow to condense fifty years around a specific theme entailing technologies and their treatment by “Continental” philosophies. I will do this by doing time slices as related to a cast of characters, both individual and social. “SPEP” will be my corporate character for Continental philosophy; it is where its interests are expressed and indicated. Then as a primary individual character, I will refer to “Heidegger's ghost,” always and still a prominent figure and interpreter of Technology; here his death date, 1976, will stand for a watershed between what I will caricature as the Old Technologies and the New Technologies. I, myself, will be the narrator but also an actor, with my own three-decades-plus history in the philosophy of technology.<br>

Abstract: In
         Time and Narrative, Ricoeur aligns the first stage of the hermeneutic circle, mimesis1, with the function of “prefiguration.” This concept describes the way in which narratives are “emplotted” according to “a preunderstanding of the world of action” (1984, 1:54). Ricoeur explains that preunderstanding has three primary features that affect the composition of a plot: meaningful structures, symbolic resources, and temporal character. The “meaningful structures” to which he refers can also be understood as a “conceptual network” of actions, people, events, stories, and the like. Just as words in a sentence constitute the level of semantic composition, the building blocks of activity in a narrative constitute a “semantics of action.” When writing of mimesis1, Ricoeur concentrates on the resources available within the context in which the text was produced rather than on describing how texts exhibit a semantics of action. It is in this cultural context that he locates the latent possibilities for emplotting action in a narrative. The “symbolic resources” are the ingredients of emplotment in a narrative, much as nouns, verbs, and objects are the ingredients of a sentence. Which types of resources are publicly available for representing human action? What are the various formulations for embedding human action in the unfolding of time? That is, what is the “temporal character” of narratives? How are human beings within a given cultural and historical context predisposed to understand the relation of human beings and human activities to time? How is time itself conceived in the society? Each of these elements—structures, symbols, and temporality—contributes to the prefiguration of the field of understanding wherein a narrative is emplotted (1984, 1:54–64).<br>

Article Title: “Time and History in Blake's<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.22.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: William Blake's poem
         Jerusalem(1804–20), like all Perennial utopias, achieves a dialectical synthesis of the ideal and the actual through the narrative focalization of a religious experience at the level of character, one that is at once transhistorical and universal. By reading the poem through the lens of the Perennial paradigm, we discover that the temporal aspects ofJerusalemare intimately tied to the religious dimensions of Blake's utopian vision. In addition to giving us a new way to understand the well-documented distinctiveness of Blake's religious message, the Perennial paradigm shows Blake's soteriology inJerusalemto be utopian rather than salvationist (that is to say, individual-religious as opposed to collective-political). Because of the ultimately subjective nature of apprehension of the Divine Vision, Blake's utopian thought is not “clearly a forward-directed anticipatory and visionary concept,” as Magnus Ankarsjö has recently argued (15). Blake does not rally the reader towards some “ensuing peaceful millennium” (15) but rather to find enlightenment in the eternal moment. In light of Blake's suspicion of ratiocination, combined with his deliberate use of narrative focalization of Albion's religious vision, readingJerusalemas a Rational utopia grounded in Judeo-Christian of notions of Apocalypse is to miss Blake's core religious message.<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Several aspects of Mannheim's utopia align with classical concepts of rhetoric, and I would like to touch on those here, though a fuller exploration of rhetoric's utopian function will come later. His description of utopia as arising from a social group, rather than an individual, aligns with my description of utopia as a topos of the audience's character stemming from rhetorical ethos. It is essentially a momentary consensus that brings about a new form of society—an entirely classical notion when it appears in rhetorical theory. Mannheim's four types of utopian mentalities are organized based on their relationship to time, in very much the same way that traditional rhetoric is divided into different purposes for persuasion:
         
               
         
                  
               1.
                  Chiliasm aligns with the rhetorical tradition's theory on
               preaching, as I explained it above, with the utopian mind envisioning a new society sprung suddenly from revealed truth.Kairos, the fulfilled moment, is not the only time orientation given to preaching in rhetorical theory, but it certainly figures prominently in Christian millennialism. Moreover, particularly in America, preaching is an important formal ancestor of many types of political rhetoric, from the Puritans to Martin Luther King Jr. Campaign rhetoric especially can fall into this category.
                  
               2.
                  The liberal-humanist idea of utopia focuses on linear progress toward a goal set sometime in the future. This aligns with traditional notions of
               deliberative rhetoric, such as parliamentary models and the gradual process of policy debate.
                  
               3.
                  The conservative utopia reenacts the past. Here there are overtones of
               forensic rhetoric, judging the events of recent history as either good or bad and aiming for a future that is modeled on the “good” constructs.

Abstract: Bloom may be a Utopianist, or at least have moments of idealism or Utopianism, but it might seem eccentric to suggest that he represents a Utopian character or a character embodying Utopian qualities—in the style of one of More's two-dimensional model citizens. For Keohane, however, Bloom represents a “utopian ideal”—one that maintains the possibility of “the utopian moment of openness and the promise of futurity in the uncontrollable adventure of modern democratic life.”
         
               Yet Keohane's equation of the Utopian with openness, futurity, and uncontrollability (indeed, some might add, with65
            democracyitself) is not necessarily self-evident. The Utopian system tends, of course, toward the closed and the controlled—insofar as both are attributes of the perfected; and if Utopia represents a perfected stability, then notions of futurity (in terms at least of dialectical history) no longer seem appropriate: “the Utopian way of life,” writes More, “[is] one which, in all human probability, will last forever.”
               In these terms, Utopias are fixed structures, and often authoritarian ones at that. Utopia is an absolute, an earthly paradise.66<br>

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Another way to clarify what Utopia might be for architecture is to begin with Saint (Sir) Thomas More's (1478–1535) originary coinage of the term in 1516 and the definition that extends from it. First, it is worth considering that
         Utopiais a much older word thandystopia. Nevertheless, because More's Utopia depicts an imaginary island enjoying a putatively perfect social, legal, and political system,Utopiahas primarily come to be associated with all such representations of the same, literary, architectural, and political alike.Utopia, though, contains within itself two senses that when taken together establish something of a paradox: referring to the Greekou(no) andeu(good) plustopos(place),Utopiaconnotes both “a good place” and a “no place.” By beinga good no place, Utopia seems to inscribe within itself the most common criticism of it: impossibility (as a placeless place). Worse still, because no (actual) place can be (or even approximate) an ideal state, the value of Utopia seems dubious at best. Even more troubling, because the ideal state depicted in Utopia requires a degree of coercion, as all social organizations do, Utopia has come to be associated with tyranny and is rejected, which deprives the imagination of a concept for possibilities. In the absence of a crucial habit for thinking about how to achieve the possible-impossible, the culturally dominant conviction that “there is no alternative” has taken on the character of a natural law, leading Fredric Jameson to observe: “Someone once said that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism. We can now revise that and witness the attempt to imagine capitalism by way of imagining the end of the world.”

Issue: sciefictstud.41.issue-1<br>
Date: 3 1, 1973<br>
Abstract: This essay examines the role of agency and metatextuality in Élisabeth Vonarburg's B
         ridgeCycle, comprised mainly of a group of short stories originally published between 1977 and 2002 and then revised in their definitive French versions for the collectionLe Jeu des coquilles de nautilus(2003). The cycle's main storyline involves the uncertain journey between parallel worlds by a series of recurring characters. Three intimately linked narrative components—each closely related to certain protocols of reading fiction and of particular interest to science fiction—form the theoretical and analytical bases of this study: the three recurring topoï of the protagonist-Voyager's travels; character agency that in part drives the sense of these realms and their occupation; and the dénouement which gives a certain meaning and closure to the spaces in their diverse manifestations and to the characters who pursue their quests in these spaces. Vonarburg's narratives place their protagonists in a situation precisely similar to that of the reader as she must negotiate the trans-world context, come to grips with her own relative lack of agency, and at the same time seek some level of control through knowledge. Suchmise en abymeallows the author, through the choice of dénouement, to comment on the manner in which this universe and the real one are imagined, represented, and decoded, and on how meaning is conveyed.<br>
