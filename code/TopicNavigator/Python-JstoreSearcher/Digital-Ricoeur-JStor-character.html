  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w76ttq">Exploring Jesuit Distinctiveness</a><br>
  Author(s) Maryks Robert Aleksander<br>
  Abstract: The following twelve essays are a selection of papers presented at the first International Symposium on Jesuit Studies held at Boston College’s Institute for Advanced Jesuit Studies in June 2015. The symposium theme was the distinctiveness of Jesuits and their ministries. The participants explored the
                  quidditas jesuitica, or the specifically Jesuit way(s) of proceeding in which Jesuits and their colleagues operated from historical, geographical, social, and cultural perspectives. They asked whether there was an essential core of distinctive elements that characterize the way in which Jesuits lived their religious vocation and conducted their various works and how these ways of<br>

  Author(s) Casalini Cristiano<br>
  Abstract: The ability to examine talents is one of the key features that continue to distinguish the Jesuits in a large number of fields today. The mission statements of many educative institutions run by the Society all around the world, such as schools and universities, insist on the cultivation of students’ skills and talents as a hallmark of their excellence. Yet, this characteristic goes beyond the boundaries of the ministry of education, for it involves many other tenets of the Jesuit identity.<br>

  Abstract: FDR understood the dynamics of politics and public policy. Defending the dedicated financing of Social Security, he recounted that “we put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and their unemployment benefits. With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program.”¹ And he was right. Dedicated financing distinguished Old-Age Insurance from most other social policies and provided the program with a compelling basis for support. Old-Age Insurance ostensibly operated independently, and its conspicuous character enabled Americans to develop a proprietary view<br>

  Book Title: Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy-The Living Art of Michael C. Leff<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Henry David<br>
  Abstract: What distinguishes the study of rhetoric from other pursuits in the liberal arts? From what realms of human existence and expression, of human history, does such study draw its defining character? What, in the end, should be the purposes of rhetorical inquiry? And amid so many competing accounts of discourse, power, and judgment in the contemporary world, how might scholars achieve these purposes through the attitudes and strategies that animate their work?
      Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy: The Living Art of Michael C. Leffoffers answers to these questions by introducing the central insights of one of the most innovative and prolific rhetoricians of the twentieth century, Michael C. Leff. This volume charts Leff 's decades-long development as a scholar, revealing both the variety of topics and the approach that marked his oeuvre, as well as his long-standing critique of the disciplinary assumptions of classical, Hellenistic, renaissance, modern, and postmodern rhetoric.Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy includes a synoptic introduction to the evolution of Leff 's thought from his time as a graduate student in the late 1960s to his death in 2010, as well as specific commentary on twenty-four of his most illuminating essays and lectures.<br>

  Abstract: At the moment of his fatal heart attack last November, Jerry Mohrmann was engaged in his normal academic business. He was writing rhetorical criticism. More specifically, he was completing a close analysis of a short but important speech text—John Calhoun’s oration “On the Reception of the Abolition Petitions.” This study had a specific and seemingly narrow focus, but it arose from a number of complex, general issues and incorporated many of Jerry’s characteristic interests. Thus, to recall the history of this project allows us to learn much not only about the man but also about the vocation he pursued.<br>

  PRELUDE. from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt4qt">Intimate Domain</a><br>
  Abstract: Siblings play a critical role in mimetic rivalries that characterize the family romance. As a consequence, our relations with siblings anticipate, for better or worse, later adult relationships. As we grow and our world expands beyond the immediate family to encompass other relationships, we may remain caught in rivalries that have characterized our initial relationship with our siblings. Or, diverging from that scenario, we may experience with our siblings and with others a supportive intimacy that enables us to overcome the effects of trauma and violence in our lives.<br>

  Abstract: The father is dead. On this point, Julia Kristeva and René Girard agree. What then can be said any longer of the paternal function? What legacy of the father persists in ongoing economies of sacrifice? And, if the father is not actually dead but only missing in action within the family romance, site of our earliest mimetic rivalries, what role, if any, could a father play in an intimate domain characterized by positive, nonconflictual mimesis? May a father yet live within intimate spaces? Endeavoring to answer these questions, I turn to literature, for Girard and Kristeva agree that literature is<br>

  Abstract: T

In this book Carr took great pains to situate himself precisely half way between utopianism and realism.¹ Yet the strategy has generally been regarded as little more than a flourish. Carr has consistently been taken for a political realist. A lecture not long ago by William Fox, subtle and knowledgeable in its treatment of Carr, unhesitatingly referred to “Carr’s realist vision” and his “version of realist doctrine,” and Carr certainly exhibited many of the characteristic marks of the realist school.²<br>

  [III Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Abstract: One rewrites in order to improve a text. Sometimes the result is thought to be the better expression of an original meaning; at other times, it extends the idea in a new direction. In any case, textual revision is a process characterized by imperfection, change, negotiation, and fallibility. Traditionally, realism has seemed to be above this process: One identifies the relations of power or suffers the consequences. This attitude is reflected in the standard invocation of the classics of realism, which are seen as equivalent statements of a core doctrine of universal truths. From Thucydides to Machiavelli to Morgenthau, there<br>

  Abstract: The 1996 Israeli election reflected the stasis that characterized Israeli politics for the fifteen years following the war in Lebanon. Labor and Likud existed in a kind of symbolic balance. The pragmatic Labor approach gave the party the advantage on “peace,” while Likud’s ideology and myth gave it the advantage on “security” and commitment to Eretz Israel. In this period, the stasis was broken only once, by the election of Yitzhak Rabin, whose personal credibility and gruff style reassured many Israelis that they could have both peace and security. After the death of Rabin, Shimon Peres was unable to marshal<br>

  Abstract: Hispanos in northern New Mexico commemorate the death of a loved one with a written narrative referred to as a recuerdo (a remembrance). These narratives (or ballads) share many characteristics of the corrido and its forerunner, the Spanish romance. The romance, a popular form of epic poetry, and the corrido depict events in the lives of heroic, historical, and common folk. Both reflect historical events, describe injustices, depict social values, and present moral teachings elicited from catastrophic social events, for example, a tragic murder, a sentence of death, or imprisonment for a heinous act.

  CHAPTER 10  From Tombstones to Star Trek: from:

  Abstract: Joseph Campbell raises an interesting question about the differing views of death in planting cultures, on the one hand, and hunting and forest cultures, on the other. Planting cultures turn to the plant as a metaphor for understanding death. The self-regenerative powers of the plant mean that its nature can be characterized as “continuing inbeingness.” Pruning is helpful to a plant because it stimulates new growth. Out of the rot in a forest comes new life. Cut a branch from a tree, and new suckers appear in profusion. They are the “bright new little children who are part of the<br>

  Abstract: Hispanos in northern New Mexico commemorate the death of a loved one with a written narrative referred to as a recuerdo (a remembrance). These narratives (or ballads) share many characteristics of the corrido and its forerunner, the Spanish romance. The romance, a popular form of epic poetry, and the corrido depict events in the lives of heroic, historical, and common folk. Both reflect historical events, describe injustices, depict social values, and present moral teachings elicited from catastrophic social events, for example, a tragic murder, a sentence of death, or imprisonment for a heinous act. An important and fundamental aspect of<br>

  CHAPTER 10  From Tombstones to Star Trek: from:

  Abstract: Joseph Campbell raises an interesting question about the differing views of death in planting cultures, on the one hand, and hunting and forest cultures, on the other. Planting cultures turn to the plant as a metaphor for understanding death. The self-regenerative powers of the plant mean that its nature can be characterized as “continuing inbeingness.” Pruning is helpful to a plant because it stimulates new growth. Out of the rot in a forest comes new life. Cut a branch from a tree, and new suckers appear in profusion. They are the “bright new little children who are part of the<br>

  1  FIRST (1961) from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt19633fp">Memory Work</a><br>
  Abstract: In 1961, Anne Truitt made a sculpture, about fifty-four inches tall, called First (plate 1). Truitt’s title signaled a critical shift in which the artist broke away from the highly wrought sculptural experimentation characteristic of her style in the late 1950s and began to concentrate on formal simplicity. These concerns are articulated clearly in First, which is pared down to basics: three vertical, white, painted wooden planks cut to resemble the pickets of an iconic American picket fence. The simplicity of design and construction suggest that Truitt was forging connections to minimalism. Yet if we are to properly historicize First<br>

  Book Title: The Thought of Music-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Kramer Lawrence<br>
  Abstract: What, exactly, is knowledge of music? And what does it tell us about humanistic knowledge in general?
      The Thought of Musicgrapples directly with these fundamental questions-questions especially compelling at a time when humanistic knowledge is enmeshed in debates about its character and future. In this third volume in a trilogy on musical understanding that includesInterpreting MusicandExpression and Truth, Lawrence Kramer seeks answers in both thoughtaboutmusic and thoughtinmusic-thinking in tones. He skillfully assesses musical scholarship in the aftermath of critical musicology and musical hermeneutics and in view of more recent concerns with embodiment, affect, and performance. This authoritative and timely work challenges the prevailing conceptions of every topic it addresses: language, context, and culture; pleasure and performance; and, through music, the foundations of understanding in the humanities.<br>

  Author(s): ROSS CHARLES<br>
  Abstract: This new critical volume, the second to appear in the three-volume
      Lectura Dantis,contains expert, focused commentary on thePurgatorioby thirty-three international scholars, each of whom presents to the nonspecialist reader one of the cantos of the transitional middle cantica of Dante's unique Christian epic. The cast of characters is as colorful as before, although this time most of them are headed for salvation. The canto-by-canto commentary allows each contributor his or her individual voice and results in a deeper, richer awareness of Dante's timeless aspirations and achievements.<br>

  Author(s) HOLLANDER ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: The preeminent musicality of Canto II appears to continue the celebrative mood of the preceding canto, which is characterized by motifs such as rebirth, sweetness, delight, and freedom. Yet Canto II, like its number, has a double focus. Each of the three

  Author(s) KIRKPATRICK ROBIN<br>
  Abstract: In the concluding moments of Canto III, a figure appears who, while initially unidentified, is described by Dante with characteristic precision: “he was fair-haired and handsome and his aspect / was noble” (107–108). With an uncanny exactitude of attention, the figure before us is said to carry still on his body the physical scars of the battle in which his time on earth was ended. His brow is cleft: “but one eyebrow had been cleft” (108); and before he names himself the penitent displays a wound “high on his chest” (111). This figure, as one learns at line 112,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn7mj">Lectura Dantis</a><br>
  Author(s) SCAGLIONE ALDO<br>
  Abstract: In Canto V there appears none of those cruxes on which contemporary criticism often fastens as a basis for understanding the poem’s deeper meaning. Nevertheless, this canto contains some of the most vivid episodes of the journey, especially in its second part, which involves the stories of three memorable characters. As is typical of the whole
                  cantica,and especially evident in the first cantos, we find that the three souls we meet here are, by the very definition of their realm, in a liminal state between two forms of existence, the earthly and the celestial. They are gradually shedding the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn7mj">Lectura Dantis</a><br>
  Author(s) Ross Charles<br>
  Abstract: Canto X begins the great cycle of penitence and education that characterizes Purgatory proper. The souls in Purgatory follow the order of the seven mortal sins as defined by Christian doctrine. They traverse the seven circles of the mountain, pausing in each circle, for a time, according to their inclination toward each sin that has remained in them after their life on earth. They are not punished for any specific crimes they may have committed, as happens in Dante’s Hell. Instead, at each stage of Purgatory, penitence regularly consists of a meditation and a

  Author(s) MIGIEL MARILYN<br>
  Abstract: Many readers have been inclined to pass quickly over Canto XVIII, thinking its philosophical discussion of love and free will to be of little importance and finding no particularly significant character or event. To such readers, the philosophical discussion may appear repetitive of Marco Lombardo’s statements on free will and the soul in Canto XVI; moreover, there is nothing in Canto XVIII to match Marco’s engaging image of the

  Author(s) Hyde Sandra Teresa<br>
  Abstract: When this policeman downplays AIDS, he is not ignoring the emergence of the epidemic; rather, he reflects a recurrent discourse around HIV/AIDS that emphasizes policing and surveillance of China’s border regions.¹ Borders here provide a liminal space where many transactions occur and where the spread of HIV in Sipsongpanna, an autonomous minority prefecture bordering Laos and Burma, symbolizes what Arjun Appadurai (1996) characterizes as late-twentieth-century cross-border migrations. These mass migrations of peoples, goods, services, and now viruses color a moving transnational canvas. This chapter focuses on the late-socialist Chinese state and untangles the actions of certain actors, such as the<br>

  Abstract: This piece is a sustained reflection on three types of marginality found in Kilronan, a market town and its environs containing about sixteen hundred people found in the Sligo-Leitrim area of Ireland. The three terms I am investigating—“character,” “unrespectable,” and “mental patient”—all overlap in the life of one of my consultants who has been connected to the mental hospital in Sligo town, about eighteen miles away, for much of his adult life. My main purpose in this piece is to try to think clearly about the implications of the simultaneous presence of these seemingly different forms of subjectivity,<br>

  2  Changing Assumptions in Later Renaissance Culture from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pp5kk">A Usable Past</a><br>
  Abstract: The familiar notion of a “later” Renaissance immediately presents itself as an innocent effort at chronological arrangement, as a convenience for determining relationships in time. But of course it is much more. It calls upon us to distinguish the differing characteristics of successive moments, to trace a process of development from inception to maturity and possibly on to decline; and it introduces the complicated problem of the relations between Italy and the Northern Renaissance.¹ It is thus closely connected with one of the most fruitful tendencies in all aspects of modern Renaissance scholarship: the effort to distinguish stages in a<br>

  Abstract: The elasticity of Christianity, as it has accommodated itself to two thousand years of cultural change, is well known; and it poses special problems for the identification of a peculiarly “Christian” conception of what it means to be an adult. It is also likely to make any attempt at such definition seem arbitrary. I shall nevertheless try to show in this essay that Christianity does contain a characteristic conception of healthy human maturity, but to do so it will be necessary to distinguish between what I shall call
                  historicalandnormativeChristianity. Historical Christianity reflects the composite of those cultural<br>

  Abstract: The contemporary Western philosophical scene can be characterized in terms of divisions and interactions between approaches to philosophy which assume that their task is inextricably linked to the development of the natural sciences and approaches which often regard this assumption with considerable suspicion. Philosophers who adopt the former approach have the obvious advantage that the project of which they see themselves as a part produces more and more results which are in principle—if not in practice—publicly testable and which appear to confirm their underlying assumption that science is converging towards an already constituted reality as it is “in<br>

  Abstract: Yunte Huang takes a most original "ethnographic" approach to more and less well-known American texts as he traces what he calls the transpacific displacement of cultural meanings through twentieth-century America's imaging of Asia. Informed by the politics of linguistic appropriation and disappropriation,
      Transpacific Displacementopens with a radically new reading of Imagism through the work of Ezra Pound and Amy Lowell. Huang relates Imagism to earlier linguistic ethnographies of Asia and to racist representations of Asians in American pop culture, such as the book and movie character Charlie Chan, then shows that Asian American writers subject both literary Orientalism and racial stereotyping to double ventriloquism and countermockery. Going on to offer a provocative critique of some textually and culturally homogenizing tendencies exemplified in Maxine Hong Kingston's work and its reception, Huang ends with a study of American translations of contemporary Chinese poetry, which he views as new ethnographies that maintain linguistic and cultural boundaries.<br>

  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Ouédraogo Ibrahim<br>
  Abstract: The Wherewithal of Lifeengages with current developments in the anthropology of ethics and migration studies to explore in empirical depth and detail the life experiences of three young men - a Ugandan migrant in Copenhagen, a Burkina Faso migrant in Amsterdam, and a Mexican migrant in Boston - in ways that significantly broaden our understanding of the existential situations and ethical dilemmas of those migrating from the global south. Michael Jackson offers the first biographically based phenomenological account of migration and mobility, providing new insights into the various motives, tactics, dilemmas, dreams, and disappointments that characterize contemporary migration. It is argued that the quandaries of African or Mexican migrants are not unique to people moving between 'traditional' and 'modern' worlds. While more intensely felt by the young, seeking to find a way out of a world of limited opportunity and circumscribed values, the experiences of transition are familiar to us all, whatever our age, gender, ethnicity or social status - namely, the impossibility of calculating what one may lose in leaving a settled life or home place; what one may gain by risking oneself in an alien environment; the difficulty of striking a balance between personal fulfillment and the moral claims of kinship; and the struggle to know the difference between 'concrete' and 'abstract' utopias (the first reasonable and worth pursuing; the second hopelessly unattainable).<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.20851/j.ctt1t304sf">Whose History?</a><br>
  Abstract: Alert students will often tell teachers and university lecturers that there is sometimes a significant discrepancy between the same historical characters, settings or incidents in historical fiction and nonfiction. An illustration of this point arises with hugely successful author Bryce Courtenay’s work of historical fiction,
                     The Potato Factory(1995), and a subsequent work of nonfiction, which sought to put the record straight on Isaac (Ikey) Solomon, one of the principal characters in Courtenay’s novel. Judith Sackville-O’Donnell, a Melbourne author, challenged Courtenay’s depiction of Ikey Solomon, who was also believed to be the model for Charles Dickens’s fictional villain Fagin.<br>

  Author(s) West-Sooby John<br>
  Abstract: The link between scientific discovery and empire building was never more evident than in the latter decades of the eighteenth century. During that time, as Mary Louise Pratt has noted, the 'international scientific expedition' became 'one of Europe's proudest and most conspicuous instruments of expansion'.¹ For Pratt, this period coincided with the emergence of a new version of Europe's 'planetary consciousness' — one which was characterised by 'the construction of global-scale meaning through the descriptive apparatuses of natural history'.²<br>

  Author(s) Buglioni Chiara Maria<br>
  Abstract: No other discipline within the humanities has had to struggle with its own interdisciplinary character as much as theater research in Europe. The fathers of the new-born scholarship
                     Theaterwissenschaftwere mainly concerned with distinguishing theater from other forms of art and with asserting its right as an independent field of enquiry. The need to define a specific methodological approach, however, was not taken into account. This initial lack in the creation of the scientific discipline has influenced the controversial development of theater studies and has caused frequent identity crises.<br>

  Abstract: In their seminal paper ‘The Verbal Concordance to the Scriptures’ from 1974, R.H. and M.A. Rouse characterize concordances to the scriptures to be ‘not only one of the earliest but probably the most important [technical aid], because its system of reference, its method of compilation and its successful application of complete alphabetization were used by generations of later tool-makers’.¹ To what extent this holds true for more recent inventions, such search engines, and more specifically web search engines, is the question I shall address in this paper: Can we consider Google & Co. as concordance?<br>

  ONE  Two Figures: from:

  Abstract: I begin with an absolutely arbitrary and unwarranted assertion, namely, that given a distinction between metaphor and metonymy, the tendency to make metaphors is characteristic of the modern attitude, while the tendency to see metonymies is characteristic of the traditional attitude. Any traditional ambience that becomes a cosmos does so because it has been structured into a field for the perception of metonymies, has been organized, we might say, by the metonymizing process. Modernization (or disenchantment) is then the transformation of metonymies into metaphors; to modernize is to de-metonymize, to metaphorize. To re-traditionalize is to demetaphorize, to re-metonymize. The traditional<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287gfz">Figures of a Changing World: Metaphor and the Emergence of Modern Culture</a><br>
  Abstract: My way of formulating the contrast between metaphor and metonymy is indebted to various linguistic, structuralist, and semiotic discussions for some, but not all, of its elements. I have selectively synthesized certain aspects that characteristically emerge in those discussions and rejected others, so as to shift the emphasis of the distinction toward my focus on the problematics of culture change. Ever since Roman Jakobson placed the opposition between metaphor and metonymy at the foundations of language use, the terms have been subject to continuous definitional torquing and distension.¹ And although the privileged status of these tropes has been accepted or<br>

  Abstract: Nietzsche is fundamentally concerned with the circuitous and deceptive character of our relations to things, and with the transcendence of actuality to our representations of it at the level of the signifier. But to a semiotician, the distinction between linguistic activity and extralinguistic reality is naive, and so I turn to Umberto Eco’s more doggedly semiotic approach to this distinction in
                  A Theory of Semiotics. Eco divides semiotics into two parts: the theory of codes or signification and the theory of sign-production or language use.Codedesignates the system of rules that “generate signs as concrete occurrences in communicative intercourse.”¹<br>

  Abstract: When trying to grasp the complex relationships between dance and moving images, during the emergence of the cinematic medium, one can hardly avoid noticing the necessity of investigate, once again, the films dedicated to the famous number of “serpentine” dance developed and started in 1892 by music-hall performer Loïe Fuller. The phenomenal craze created by this original stage spectacle ended up imposing it as one of the motifs characterizing artistic expression at the turn of the twentieth century.

  Abstract: Many of the difficulties modern readers experience with

Consequently, to presume, as the narrator frequently does, that he manifests supreme goodness seems a mockery of truth. Offended, moderns may retort that, far from being supremely good and deserving worship, the Father deserves to be repudiated as evil. Jung's analytical psychology, however, offers a more refined perception, which promotes a more balanced response.<br>

By “decisive identity” I mean a conscious guiding of individuation wherein identity and character are created through moral decisions. Decisive identity does not imply creating what we initially are. Rather, it involves consciously deciding what we become, which requires a troublesome but indispensable element, freedom. Milton develops themes, character, and plot by showing the origins and consequences of identity-forming decisions. These decisions are the foci of moral judgment and meaning. In

  Abstract: "In the Holocaust novel, silence is always a character, and the word is always its subject matter." So writes David Patterson in this profound and original study of more than thirty important writers. Contrary to existing views, he argues, the Holocaust novel is not an attempt to depict an unimaginable reality or an ineffable horror. It is, rather, an endeavor to fetch the word from silence and restore it to meaning, to resurrect the human soul, to regenerate the relation between the self and God, the self and other, the self and itself.<br>

  Abstract: Although Angel González is considered one of the most important Spanish poets of the late 1950s and the 1960s, his work has proved perhaps the most difficult to characterize. This is due in part to its range and variety: even though González published his first book relatively late (in 1956, at the age of thirty-one), he has written a number of volumes of poetry and dealt with a variety of subjects in very different tones. Because of that he has been characterized in different ways as critics have sought to highlight individual aspects of his work.<br>

  Abstract: Jaime Gil de Biedma’s poems come across on first reading as clear and “realistic.” Many of them comprise detailed evocations of specific episodes, narrated by a first-person speaker who gives commentaries and conclusions. Quite often these commentaries offer philosophic insights; at times, especially in the later books, they contain social or political ideas. All of this has led some critics to characterize Gil de Biedma as a realistic poet proccupied with ethical and social issues.¹ The very clarity of his work has caused readers to miss its depth and originality.<br>

We do not find in it the novel use of colloquial expressions that characterizes Angel González and Gloria Fuertes, nor the surprising changes and reappraisals typical of José Angel Valente, nor the alternation of linguistic codes used by Claudio Rodríguez. The language of Sahagún’s verse seems ordinary but never blatantly colloquial; his works often consist of easy-to-understand evocations of past experiences, expressed in a low key.¹ They contain many visual images and make use of some metaphors, but these tend to be<br>

  Book Title: Aspects of Alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the Contemporary Debate-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Every other is truly other, but no other is wholly other.This is the claim that Aspects of Alterity defends. Taking up the question of otherness that so fascinates contemporary continental philosophy, this book asks what it means for something or someone to be other than the self. Levinas and those influenced by him point out that the philosophical tradition of the West has generally favored the self at the expense of the other. Such a self-centered perspective never encounters the other qua other, however. In response, postmodern thought insists on the absolute otherness of the other, epitomized by the deconstructive claim every other is wholly other.But absolute otherness generates problems and aporias of its own. This has led some thinkers to reevaluate the notion of relative otherness in light of the postmodern critique, arguing for a chiastic account that does justice to both the alterity and the similitude of the other. These latter two positions-absolute otherness and a rehabilitated account of relative otherness-are the main contenders in the contemporary debate.The philosophies of Emmanuel Levinas and Gabriel Marcel provide the point of embarkation for coming to understand the two positions on this question. Levinas and Marcel were contemporaries whose philosophies exhibit remarkably similar concern for the other but nevertheless remain fundamentally incompatible. Thus, these two thinkers provide a striking illustration of both the proximity of and the unbridgeable gap between two accounts of otherness.Aspects of Alterity delves into this debate, first in order understand the issues at stake in these two positions and second to determine which description better accounts for the experience of encountering the other.After a thorough assessment and critique of otherness in Levinas's and Marcel's work, including a discussion of the relationship of ethical alterity to theological assumptions, Aspects of Alterity traces the transmission and development of these two conceptions of otherness. Levinas's version of otherness can be seen in the work of Jacques Derrida and John D.

  1  The Question of Otherness from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wzvd0">Aspects of Alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the Contemporary Debate</a><br>
  Abstract: We are told that our postmodern age is characterized by the breakdown of Grand (or “Master”) Narratives, the overarching systems that allow us to make sense of the world as a unified whole, as a cosmos rather than a chaos. In his famous report on knowledge, Jean-François Lyotard asserts that “incredulity toward metanarratives” is the very definition of postmodernity.¹ Without recourse to these guiding narratives, we find ourselves in a situation of paralogy, confronted by a host of “petite narratives.” These petite narratives express diverse perspectives and frequently take part in incommen-surable “language games,” each of which is as (il)legitimate<br>

  Book Title: Aspects of Alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the Contemporary Debate-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Every other is truly other, but no other is wholly other.This is the claim that Aspects of Alterity defends. Taking up the question of otherness that so fascinates contemporary continental philosophy, this book asks what it means for something or someone to be other than the self. Levinas and those influenced by him point out that the philosophical tradition of the West has generally favored the self at the expense of the other. Such a self-centered perspective never encounters the other qua other, however. In response, postmodern thought insists on the absolute otherness of the other, epitomized by the deconstructive claim every other is wholly other.But absolute otherness generates problems and aporias of its own. This has led some thinkers to reevaluate the notion of relative otherness in light of the postmodern critique, arguing for a chiastic account that does justice to both the alterity and the similitude of the other. These latter two positions-absolute otherness and a rehabilitated account of relative otherness-are the main contenders in the contemporary debate.The philosophies of Emmanuel Levinas and Gabriel Marcel provide the point of embarkation for coming to understand the two positions on this question. Levinas and Marcel were contemporaries whose philosophies exhibit remarkably similar concern for the other but nevertheless remain fundamentally incompatible. Thus, these two thinkers provide a striking illustration of both the proximity of and the unbridgeable gap between two accounts of otherness.Aspects of Alterity delves into this debate, first in order understand the issues at stake in these two positions and second to determine which description better accounts for the experience of encountering the other.After a thorough assessment and critique of otherness in Levinas's and Marcel's work, including a discussion of the relationship of ethical alterity to theological assumptions, Aspects of Alterity traces the transmission and development of these two conceptions of otherness. Levinas's version of otherness can be seen in the work of Jacques Derrida and John D. Caputo, while Marcel's understanding of otherness influences the work of Paul Ricoeur and Richard Kearney.Ultimately, Aspects of Alterity makes a case for a hermeneutic account of otherness.

  4  A Dilemma of Feeling from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wzvhj">Tastes of the Divine: Hindu and Christian Theologies of Emotion</a><br>
  Abstract: Like Rūpa Gosvāmin, the medieval Christian theologian Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153) elevates love over all other emotions in the devotional life. He finds ample material for the devotional sentiment of love in the biblical Song of Songs. He writes no fewer than eighty-six sermons on the first chapters of this short book of Hebrew wisdom literature, which consists of a series of poetic exchanges between two lovers. Bernard ranks “reverence” and its attendant emotions of “horror or stupor or fear or wonder” (characteristic of
                  śāntain Rūpa’s system) far below the intimacy of love (Serm. 83.3).¹ For him, nuptial<br>

  Author(s) Murchadha Felix Ó<br>
  Abstract: The terms of the title—glory, idolatry, kairos—are Christian, not Greek, if we understand Greek as the Greek of classical philosophy. Kairos is a Greek word meaning the opportune moment, but prior to Christianity it had little philosophical significance¹; idolatry comes from
                  eidolon, which in Plato means a deceiving image but in Christianity comes to mean false gods; glory—gloria—translatesdōxa, a philosophical term that, however, is used in a new way to translate the Hebrewkabod. Thus, these very terms themselves point to a turning, a movement of thought that characterizes Christianity; one can say of them,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wzwk2">Givenness and God: Questions of Jean-Luc Marion</a><br>
  Author(s) Mackinlay Shane<br>
  Abstract: “The Reason of the Gift”¹ is part of Jean-Luc Marion’s broader phenomenological project, which begins from his critique of the traces of a constituting subject retained by Husserl and Heidegger. While Marion’s phenomenology of givenness (
                  donation) eliminates these traces, it does so only by reducing the subject to a passive recipient on whom phenomena impose themselves. In contrast, Claude Romano (another contemporary French phenomenologist) responds to the same concerns aboutDasein’s subjective character without limiting the subject to pure receptivity.² By comparing these two responses to the issue of a constituting subject, I will draw attention to some of the<br>

  Book Title: Veiled Desires: Intimate Portrayals of Nuns in Postwar Anglo-American Film-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SABINE MAUREEN<br>
  Abstract: A provocative, interdisciplinary study of nuns on the big screen, from The Bells of St. Mary's (1945) to Doubt (2008), that shines fresh light on the cinematic nun as a woman and a religious in the twentieth century. Ingrid Bergman's engaging screen performance as Sister Mary Benedict in The Bells of St. Mary's made the film nun a star and her character a shining standard of comparison. She represented the religious life as the happy and rewarding choice of a modern woman who had a "complete understanding" of both erotic and spiritual desire. How did this vibrant and mature nun figure come to be viewed as girlish and naive? Why have she and her cinematic sisters in postwar popular film so often been stereotyped or selectively analyzed, so seldom been seen as women and religious? In Veiled Desires--a unique full-length, in-depth study of nuns in film--Maureen Sabine explores these questions in a groundbreaking interdisciplinary study covering more than sixty years of cinema. She looks at an impressive breadth of films in which the nun features as an ardent lead character, including The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), Black Narcissus (1947), Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison (1957), Sea Wife (1957), The Nun's Story (1959), The Sound of Music (1965), Change of Habit (1969), In This House of Brede (1975), Agnes of God (1985), Dead Man Walking (1995), and Doubt (2008). Veiled Desires considers how the beautiful and charismatic stars who play chaste nuns, from Ingrid Bergman and Audrey Hepburn to Susan Sarandon and Meryl Streep, call attention to desires that the veil concealed and the habit was thought to stifle. In a theologically and psychoanalytically informed argument, Sabine responds to the critics who have pigeonholed the film nun as the obedient daughter and religious handmaiden of a patriarchal church, and the respectful audience who revered her as an icon of spiritual perfection. She provides a framework for a more complex and holistic picture of nuns on screen by showing how the films dramatize these women's Christian call to serve, sacrifice, and dedicate themselves to God, and their erotic desire for intimacy, agency, achievement, and fulfillment.<br>

  Book Title: The Phenomenology of Prayer-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): WIRZBA NORMAN<br>
  Abstract: This collection of ground-breaking essays considers the many dimensions of prayer: how prayer relates us to the divine; prayer's ability to reveal what is essential about our humanity; the power of prayer to transform human desire and action; and the relation of prayer to cognition. It takes up the meaning of prayer from within a uniquely phenomenological point of view, demonstrating that the phenomenology of prayer is as much about the character and boundaries of phenomenological analysis as it is about the heart of religious life.The contributors: Michael F.

  Book Title: Gazing Through a Prism Darkly: Reflections on Merold Westphal's Hermeneutical Epistemology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): PUTT B. KEITH<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal has been in the foremost ranks of philosophers who proclaim a new postsecular philosophy. By articulating an epistemology sensitive to the realities of cognitive finitude and moral weakness, he defends a wisdom that begins in both humility and commitment, one that always confesses that human beings can encounter meaning and truth only as human beings, never as gods.The present volume focuses on this wisdom of humility that characterizes Westphal's thought and explores how that wisdom, expressed through the redemptive dynamic of doubt, can contribute to developing a postsecular apologetic for faith.This book can function both as an accessible introduction to Westphal for those who have not read him extensively and also as an informed critical appreciation and extension of his work for those who are more experienced readers.<br>

  Abstract: Søren Kierkegaard is widely regarded as an archindividualist with little concern for political and social issues. Furthermore, it is well known that he himself had extremely conservative, even reactionary, political views. He was, for example, not happy about the elimination of absolute monarchy in Denmark in 1848.¹ He also was distinctly unsympathetic with the cause of women’s emancipation, an issue I will discuss in more detail later in this essay.

  Author(s) FERREIRA M. JAMIE<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal’s many insightful comparisons and contrasts between Emmanuel Levinas and Søren Kierkegaard prompt me to reconsider one aspect that continues to intrigue me—namely, Westphal’s characterization of the triadic relation found in each thinker. In “Kierkegaard and Levinas in Dialogue,” Westphal offers the following picture: “Whereas Kierkegaard would repeat Jesus’ summary of the Torah, that the first commandment is to love God and the second to love one’s neighbor as oneself (Mark 12:28–34), Levinas reverses the order. For him ethics is first, then religion, and the neighbor always stands between me and God, while for Kierkegaard religion is<br>

  Abstract: Merold Westphal has been one of the most significant voices in Continental philosophy of religion in recent years. He, along with Paul Ricoeur, has contributed what might be called a specifically Protestant inflection to the ongoing “theological turn in phenomenology,” a movement that otherwise bears the largely Catholic accent of thinkers such as Marion, Henry, and Chrétien. Yet another contributor to this debate, the theologian David Tracy, has made a useful distinction between what he calls the “sacramental” character of the Catholic vision and the “prophetic” character of the Protestant. He sees both as complementary, the former emphasizing the more<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wzzv5">Gazing Through a Prism Darkly: Reflections on Merold Westphal's Hermeneutical Epistemology</a><br>
  Author(s) FERREIRA M. JAMIE<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal’s many insightful comparisons and contrasts between Emmanuel Levinas and Søren Kierkegaard prompt me to reconsider one aspect that continues to intrigue me—namely, Westphal’s characterization of the triadic relation found in each thinker. In “Kierkegaard and Levinas in Dialogue,” Westphal offers the following picture: “Whereas Kierkegaard would repeat Jesus’ summary of the Torah, that the first commandment is to love God and the second to love one’s neighbor as oneself (Mark 12:28–34), Levinas reverses the order. For him ethics is first, then religion, and the neighbor always stands between me and God, while for Kierkegaard religion is<br>

  Abstract: Merold Westphal has been one of the most significant voices in Continental philosophy of religion in recent years. He, along with Paul Ricoeur, has contributed what might be called a specifically Protestant inflection to the ongoing “theological turn in phenomenology,” a movement that otherwise bears the largely Catholic accent of thinkers such as Marion, Henry, and Chrétien.

  Book Title: Gazing Through a Prism Darkly: Reflections on Merold Westphal's Hermeneutical Epistemology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): PUTT B. KEITH<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal has been in the foremost ranks of philosophers who proclaim a new postsecular philosophy. By articulating an epistemology sensitive to the realities of cognitive finitude and moral weakness, he defends a wisdom that begins in both humility and commitment, one that always confesses that human beings can encounter meaning and truth only as human beings, never as gods.The present volume focuses on this wisdom of humility that characterizes Westphal's thought and explores how that wisdom, expressed through the redemptive dynamic of doubt, can contribute to developing a postsecular apologetic for faith.This book can function both as an accessible introduction to Westphal for those who have not read him extensively and also as an informed critical appreciation and extension of his work for those who are more experienced readers.<br>

  Merold Westphal on the Sociopolitical Implications of Kierkegaard’s Thought from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wzzv5">Gazing Through a Prism Darkly: Reflections on Merold Westphal's Hermeneutical Epistemology</a><br>
  Author(s) EVANS C. STEPHEN<br>
  Abstract: Søren Kierkegaard is widely regarded as an archindividualist with little concern for political and social issues. Furthermore, it is well known that he himself had extremely conservative, even reactionary, political views. He was, for example, not happy about the elimination of absolute monarchy in Denmark in 1848.¹ He also was distinctly unsympathetic with the cause of women’s emancipation, an issue I will discuss in more detail later in this essay. Merold Westphal has for many years waged a campaign to show that the textbook characterization of Kierkegaard as an apolitical individualist is mistaken. On Westphal’s view, social and political concerns<br>

  Abstract: Public theology is sometimes defined by the praxis of doing theology for the differing audiences, communities of accountability, or publics of the church, academy, and society that theologians address.¹ At other times, public theology is characterized by the method used to reach those audiences, either by making religious claims more intelligible to wider society via shared norms and practices of rational public discourse or by relying on religious institutions to shape and equip persons with virtues for participating in political discourse.² And, at other times, public theology is determined by the goal of integrating theology and ethics into the discursive<br>

  Abstract: Literary scholars have long been duped by the defensive posture initiated by the ironic Greek philosopher who dismissed poetry from the realm of thought and the ideal Republic. Between the philosopher-guardian and the poet, Plato presents a long list of craftsmen, each providing a specific product for the needs of the community. When he gets to the poet, however, “someone who has the skill to transform himself into all sorts of characters and to represent all sorts of things,” Plato declares that the community will politely send him packing, telling the poet that “he and his kind have no place<br>

  5  Reconsidering Allegory and Symbol: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x00w1">Structures of Appearing: Allegory and the Work of Literature</a><br>
  Abstract: In the “Epistemo-Critical Prologue” to
                  The Origin of the German Tragic Drama, Benjamin establishes allegory in a realm out of the reach of aesthetics and idealism. Allegory is characterized by violence and is not at all beautiful, admittedly lacking “all ‘symbolic’ freedom of expression, all classical proportion, all humanity” (166;Der Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels145). Any time allegory is subjected to the critical palate of philosophical taste, it will seem a bitter alternative to beauty. However, by discrediting the presumed authority of aesthetics (the beautiful) and idealism (the symbolic determination of the object as a reflection of the object<br>

  Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
  Abstract: Overcoming Onto-theology is a stunning collection of essays by Merold Westphal, one of America's leading continental philosophers of religion, in which Westphal carefully explores the nature and the structure of a postmodern Christian philosophy. Written with characteristic clarity and charm, Westphal offers masterful studies of Heidegger's early lectures on Paul and Augustine, the idea of hermeneutics, Schleiermacher, Hegel, Derrida, and Nietzsche, all in the service of building his argument that postmodern thinking offers an indispensable tool for rethinking Christian faith. A must read for every student and professor of continental philosophy and the philosophy of religion, Overcoming Onto-theology is an invaluable collection that brings together in one place fourteen provocative and lucid essays by one of the most important thinkers working in American philosophy today.<br>

  Abstract: One of the complexities presented by
                  Democracy in Americais that Tocqueville continuously intertwines his observations of the American case (including the exceptional factors that distinguish the first “republic in a large country,” as one used to say in that period) with the attempt to define a type (or ideal type) that stands out through the American example. This complexity is particularly felt in the case of Tocqueville’s discussion of religion, a topic where he pursues several related or parallel questions: First, what is the common trait that characterizes all of the sects of American Christianity?

While what is given may not necessarily be a gift, it is already evident from the framing of this definition that the question of the gift will not be irrelevant in this context.

  Abstract: Baudelaire’s work is far from self-evidently autobiographical.
                  Les Fleurs du mal, for instance, cannot be easily compared with a self-declared poetic autobiography like Victor Hugo’sContemplations, whose poems are of decidedly personal inspiration, bear dates that attach them to experience, and lay out a plausible narrative of poetic development. In contrast, Baudelaire’s undated poems appear impersonal and, in their emblematic character, untethered to experience. Although the poet does give the collection the status of an expressive work in one letter to Ancelle: “Do I have to tell you, you who have guessed it no more than the others, that in<br>

A response to another letter, it begins suspensefullyin medias res—in the midst of an epistolary exchange between friends and also in the midst of a charged moment for Evagrius himself. “It was so characteristic of you to get a letter to me just at a time when I was aflame with<br>

  Abstract: Jean-Louis Chrétien’s writings are a powerful example of the character of what I have called a new type of apologetics. In no way does he ever engage in anything like proofs for God’s existence, evidence for the validity of religious experience, or any consideration of the rational coherence of an idea of the divine. And yet his work is imbued and overflows with Christian imagery and references to Christian sources. Even when he is not addressing explicitly religious themes, his poetic language has the flavor and tonality of Christian mysticism. Chrétien (born in 1952) is one of the youngest of<br>

  Book Title: Finding God in All Things: Celebrating Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stagaman David<br>
  Abstract: Three of the most influential Catholic theologians of the twentieth century-Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-were all born in 1904, at the height of the Church's most militant rhetoric against all things modern. In this culture of suspicion, Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner grew in faith to join the Society of Jesus and struggled with the burden of antimodernist policies in their formation. By the time of their mature work in the 1950s and 1960s, they had helped to redefine the critical dialogue between modern thought and contemporary Catholic theology. After the dtente of the Second Vatican Council, they brought Catholic tradition into closer relationship to modern philosophy, history, and politics. Written by leading scholars, friends, and family members, these original essays celebrate the legacies of Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner after a century of theological development. Offering a broad range of perspectives on their lives and works, the essays blend personal and anecdotal accounts with incisive critical appraisals. Together, they offer an accessible introduction to the distinctive character of three great thinkers and how their work shapes the way Catholics think and talk about God, Church, and State.<br>

  Book Title: God's Mirror: Renewal and Engagement in French Catholic Intellectual Culture in the Mid-Twentieth Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Garfitt Toby<br>
  Abstract: Gathering in one place a cohesive selection of articles that deepen our sense of the vitality and controversy within the Catholic renewal of the mid-twentieth century, God's Mirror offers historical analysis of French Catholic intellectuals. This volume highlights the work of writers, thinkers and creative artists who have not always drawn the attention given to such luminaries as Maritain, Mounier, and Marcel. Organized around the typologies of renewal and engagement, editors Katherine Davies and Toby Garfitt provide a revisionist and interdisciplinary reading of the narrative of twentieth-century French Catholicism. Renewal and engagement are both manifestations of how the Catholic intellectual reflects and takes position on the relationship between the Church, personal faith and the world, and on the increasingly problematic relationship between intellectuals and the Magisterium. A majority of the writings are based on extensive research into published texts, with some occasional archival references, and they give critical insights into the tensions that characterized the theological and political concerns of their subjects.<br>

  Author(s) LaCocque André<br>
  Abstract: It is essential that we read Ruth in light of a complex social environment that in many ways the book is reacting
                     against. This means taking into account the status of women in ancient Israel and, more broadly, the ancient Near East. It also means considering the status of foreigners within these same surroundings. Both issues become especially intense in a tale whose title character is both female and foreign.<br>

  Abstract: Erich Auerbach famously characterized the direct discourse of the Hebrew Bible as serving “to indicate thoughts which remain unexpressed,” in contrast to speech in Homer’s
                  Odyssey, which serves “to manifest, to externalize thoughts.”¹ However, when the first speech occurs in the book of Ruth 1:8, Naomi, pausing on the road home back toward Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, addresses her widowed Moabite daughters-in-law in what seems to me a forthright way that makes her thoughts and feelings utterly explicit: “Go, return each of you to her mother’s house; the Lord deal kindly with you as ye have dealt with<br>

  Abstract: If, generally speaking, readers’ and writers’ attitudes toward the autobiographical genre can be characterized as naïve in that they take for granted the sincerity of the author, it is even harder for historians to be professionally effective without taking their products to be authentic reflections of time. There is a sense, however, in which histories of the state, histories of the church, and, indeed, histories of great institutions at large are so many contradictions in terms, at least if state and church are taken—as they are bound to be—to be bodies whose temporal existence transcends the moment, to<br>

  Abstract: In the acceleration of the tempo of historical developments in which we live, two factors, it seems to me, stand out above all others as characteristics of a development that, earlier, began only slowly. The first is the formation of a world society in which individual political, economic, and cultural powers depend, more and more, on each other, and come into contact and permeate each other in their different spheres of life. The other is the development of man’s possibilities, of his power to make and to destroy, possibilities that, exceeding everything to which we have previously been accustomed, raise<br>

  Abstract: In the acceleration of the tempo of historical developments in which we live, two factors, it seems to me, stand out above all others as characteristics of a development that, earlier, began only slowly. The first is the formation of a world society in which individual political, economic, and cultural powers depend, more and more, on each other, and come into contact and permeate each other in their different spheres of life.

  Book Title: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness traces the reflections of the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankelevitch on the conditions and temporality of forgiveness in relation to creation, history, and memory. The author demonstrates the influence of Jewish and Christian thought on Jankelevitch's philosophy and compares his ideas about the gift character of forgiveness, the role of retributive emotions in conceptions of justice, and the limits of reason with those of Aristotle, Butler, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Scheler, Arendt, Derrida, Levinas, and Ricoeur. The Shoah was the pivotal historical event in Jankelevitch's life. As this book shows, Jankelevitch's question "Is forgiveness possible as a response to evil?" remains a potent philosophical conundrum today. Paradoxically, for Jankelevitch, evil is both the impetus and the obstacle to forgiveness.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x08ps">Divine Enticement: Theological Seductions</a><br>
  Abstract: There appears to be a curious incompatibility between seduction and any proper sort of epistemology.
                  Knowledge, with its firm and enduring grasp of true facts and its carefully maintained distance from opinion, seems clearly opposed both to the reserve, mystery, and elusive play of seduction and to theunknowing in the face of the infinite by which even slightly apophatic theology is not inaptly characterized. When we try to think the divine or the sacred, we think that reserve and mystery; perhaps we also think of origin or ground, of joy or ecstasy, or of the world newly revealed as<br>

  Abstract: The very notion of seductive ethics is likely to give us pause, to seem more error than paradox. Ethics is more often than not conceived as the very resistance to seduction, if not in fact to any sort of pleasure (or bliss, which seems to undermine the ethical subject).¹ It is dutiful, we think, a little bit ascetic (provided we don’t overly enjoy our asceticism), rule-bound or abstemiously virtuous. And if seduction is about sustaining the possible, then to prescribe, whether character or behavior, seems contradictory to it. But the prescriptions of ethics are not always a matter of foreclosure;<br>

  Abstract: The imagination is notoriously difficult to define.¹ Indeed, this difficulty may explain the fact that prior to the Enlightenment there was no attempt to develop a unified theory of the imagination. In the history of ancient Greek philosophy, its amorphous character contributed to its being treated in two distinct, albeit related, ways. On the one hand, imagination was defined in terms of inspired artistic expression, outside the realm of explanation and description. On the other, it was described as a mysterious mental faculty that somehow accomplished the impossible, bridging the divide between the world of sensation and the world of<br>

  Abstract: During the 1880s, Peirce employed the triadic nature of thought to ground his budding cosmology. As Karl-Otto Apel suggests, it was during this time (particularly in 1885) that Peirce developed a “metaphysics of evolution.”¹ Peirce’s attempt to expose a continuous relation among the three aspects of human thought becomes a desire to unify three realms of being. He comes to reassert the necessary connection between epistemology and ontology. Just as Kant’s discussion of imagination and reflective judgment in 1792 leads him to speculate on the topics of time and purposive nature, Peirce’s examination of the triadic character of logic and<br>

  Book Title: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Timothy<br>
  Abstract: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics presents a decade of thought about the origins and possibilities of political theory from one of contemporary Italy's most prolific and engaging political theorists, Roberto Esposito. He has coined a number of critical concepts in current debates about the past, present, and future of biopolitics-from his work on the implications of the etymological and philosophical kinship of community (communitas) and immunity (immunitas) to his theorizations of the impolitical and the impersonal. Taking on interlocutors from throughout the Western philosophical tradition, from Aristotle and Augustine to Weil, Arendt, Nancy, Foucault, and Agamben, Esposito announces the eclipse of a modern political lexicon-"freedom," "democracy," "sovereignty," and "law"-that, in its attempt to protect human life, has so often produced its opposite (violence, melancholy, and death). Terms of the Political calls for the opening of political thought toward a resignification of these and other operative terms-such as "community," "immunity," "biopolitics," and "the impersonal"-in ways that affirm rather than negate life. An invaluable introduction to the breadth and rigor of Esposito's thought, the book will also welcome readers already familiar with Esposito's characteristic skill in overturning and breaking open the language of politics.<br>

  Abstract: Because the panegyric discourse of Vatican II strives to embrace such a broad vision of the Church, it tends to laud the social dimension of the faith. Of course, Catholicism has a long and rich tradition of social engagement. Nevertheless, this council emphasized the tradition in new ways. Consider that the Tridentine Profession of Faith in 1564 had characterized the Church as not only “holy, catholic, and apostolic” but also as “mother and teacher.”¹ It had insisted that salvation depended upon “true obedience” to one individual: “the Roman pontiff, successor of the blessed Peter, chief of the apostles, and vicar<br>

  Abstract: At the beginning of the new millennium, Soo-Young Chin, Peter X.

They raised key questions about what characterizes Asian American cultural production and how we understand, experience, and analyze Asian American culture (270). As Chin, Feng, and Lee have broadly defined it, the term “cultural production” refers to “processes by which certain subjects (Asian Americans and others) produce material objects, actions, and interactions; it pertains to the interpretation of<br>

                  American Born Chinese. The book artfully weaves together stories of three characters. The realistic character Jin Wang, of Taiwanese parentage, moves from Chinatown to a predominantly non-Chinese suburb, falls in love with a white American girl, and wrestles throughout the novel with his identity as a Chinese American among non-Chinese American peers.

  Abstract: In recent years, graphic narratives¹ in general and manga in particular have attracted critical attention from a variety of fields, including media and globalization research as well as Japanese, gender, and ethnic studies. This broadening of topic-oriented interest usually leads to two lines of contestation, one pertaining to manga-specific expertise and the other to culturally divergent mediascapes as contexts of productions and use. Taking a typical case of discordance—the ethnic identity of manga characters—opinions differ notoriously as to whether mangaesque faces and physiques are to be regarded as “stateless” (
                  mukokuseki) or “Caucasian.” The latter position may meet manga<br>

An Orientalist reading of character Chin-kee in Gene Yang’sAmerican Born Chinese—a buck-toothed, yellow-faced high school student speaking pidgin English and sporting a queue in a twenty-first-century classroom—is lost on Chinese students in Mainland China. The irony of Chin-kee’s representation is overlooked by these readers in<br>

  Author(s) Dong Lan<br>
  Abstract: At the beginning of the new millennium, Soo-Young Chin, Peter X. Feng, and Josephine Lee discussed the increasing visibility of Asian American culture both inside and outside academia and consequently the growing complexity required to understand and assess Asian American cultural production. They raised key questions about what characterizes Asian American cultural production and how we understand, experience, and analyze Asian American culture (270). As Chin, Feng, and Lee have broadly defined it, the term “cultural production” refers to “processes by which certain subjects (Asian Americans and others) produce material objects, actions, and interactions; it pertains to the interpretation of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0mh1">Drawing New Color Lines</a><br>
  Author(s) Liu Kuilan<br>
  Abstract: Transformation is the key element adding thematic as well as structural unity to Gene Luen Yang’s award-winning coming-of-age graphic novel
                  American Born Chinese. The book artfully weaves together stories of three characters. The realistic character Jin Wang, of Taiwanese parentage, moves from Chinatown to a predominantly non-Chinese suburb, falls in love with a white American girl, and wrestles throughout the novel with his identity as a Chinese American among non-Chinese American peers. The mythological Monkey King, banished from heaven because of his lowly status yet trained to be a deity, finally comes to terms with his simian, not deitic, identity.<br>

  Author(s) Berndt Jaqueline<br>
  Abstract: In recent years, graphic narratives¹ in general and manga in particular have attracted critical attention from a variety of fields, including media and globalization research as well as Japanese, gender, and ethnic studies. This broadening of topic-oriented interest usually leads to two lines of contestation, one pertaining to manga-specific expertise and the other to culturally divergent mediascapes as contexts of productions and use. Taking a typical case of discordance—the ethnic identity of manga characters—opinions differ notoriously as to whether mangaesque faces and physiques are to be regarded as “stateless” (
                  mukokuseki) or “Caucasian.” The latter position may meet manga<br>

  Abstract: All operas have scenes of narration, scenes in which a character tells a story. But what, meanwhile, is being done by and within the music? Put another way: what occurs at this juncture that brings music together with a representation of the scene of narration? Operatic narration must lie at the heart of any speculation about the “voice” of musical narration, yet is often perceived as dull, and literally goes unheard.<br>

This is one of the genre’s most fundamental illusions: we see before us something whose fantastic aspect is obvious, since the scenes we witness pass to music. At the same time, however, opera stages recognizably human situations, and these possess an inherent “realism” that demands a special and complex understanding of the music we hear. We must generally assume, in short, that this music is not produced by or within the stage-world, but emanates<br>

All that might be the subject of a new story, but our present story has come to an end.” Now it is well known that Dostoevsky’s next novel,The Idiot,was to revolve around a “genuinely good,” a “truly beautiful” man.

Silence of madness, silence of suicide—so end novels that take their shape from characters unable to find coherent stories for themselves.

  Author(s) LANCE VICTOR<br>
  Abstract: The essays contained in this volume are contributions to that intense and self-conscious assessment of the perspectives, resources, and terms by which contemporary literary criticism has sought to justify its validity, its function, and its historical legitimacy. If literature itself seems in our time to have lost its innocence, if neither its subjective nor its objective character is self-evident but demands of its readers a sharp awareness of its modality, it has by this challenge called forth a breathtaking variety of systems of critical discourse; indeed, it has created a pre-eminence of theoretical consciousness that may tend, at times, to<br>

  Abstract: In the “General Preface” to the
                  Waverley Novels,Scott reflects on his own situation as narrator. He tries to clarify his intentions, which—unlike those of earlier novelists—are no longer concerned with expounding moral norms. Instead, he takes as his guide his own personal development, as he seeks to explain the curious innovation of history as the subject of fiction. His starting point, he says, is as follows: “I had nourished the ambitious desire of composing a tale of chivalry, which was to be in the style of theCastle of Otranto, with plenty of Border characters and supernatural<br>

  Myth as a Recurrent Theme in Greek Tragedy and Twentieth-Century Drama from:

  Author(s) FUHRMANN MANFRED<br>
  Abstract: 1. The seemingly pedantic title
                     Amphitryon38 points to a phenomenon which is obviously characteristic of dramatizations of Greek myths, i.e., repetition, the assiduous rehandling of well-worn material. Twentieth-century plays are not the first to conform to this principle of repetition, nor are all those “modern” dramas which have adapted ancient legends. Even the authors of Attic tragedies staged the same stories over and over again.<br>

  Author(s) ISER WOLFGANG<br>
  Abstract: Joyce called his novel
                  Ulyssesafter Homer’s hero, though the latter never appears in the book. Instead Joyce deals with eighteen different aspects of a single day in Dublin, mainly following the involvement of two characters—Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus—in events that take place between early morning and late at night. What, then, is the connection between theOdysseyand June 16th, 1904? Most answers to this question try to join these two poles of the novel through the “tried and tested” ideas of the recurrence of archetypes, or the analogy between the ideal and the real.¹ In<br>

Although himself motivated by the desire for a peaceful world, James concedes that “militarism is the great preserver of our ideals of hardihood, and human life with no use for hardihood would be contemptible.”¹ Given the harms that come from war, he argues that we need a “moral equivalent” of war, a nonviolent alternative to<br>

The issues of fairness and justice cannot be separated from our “senses of what is good” and from “how and why we live as we do.” As a characterization of the kind of conversation between economics and ethics that they have in mind, Ames and Hershock suggest the necessity of diversity, inclusiveness, and particularity.

  Author(s) Roy Wendy<br>
  Abstract: The current proliferation of sequels in both literary and cinematic venues suggests an abiding interest in stories that follow up on and expand previously circulated stories. Sequel novels are written, published, and read for many different reasons, the most commonly expressed being a desire by the reader for repetition, but with difference; a wish by the author to explore in more detail a character or situation from a previous book; and a need expressed by the author or publisher, or both, to continue an economically successful venture. One of the most oftquoted commentaries on sequels is Terry Castle’s 1986 study<br>

  Author(s) Life Patricia<br>
  Abstract: Two Canadian novels, published twenty-nine years apart, facilitate an examination of identity and agency in relation to aging. Carol Shields’s 1993 novel
                  The Stone Diariesgestures towards Margaret Laurence’s 1964 novelThe Stone Angelin its recording of the life of an aged central female character, its stone imagery, its depiction of aging as decline and loss, and its enquiry into the themes of late-life recollection and search for selfhood and meaning. Both texts focus on the protagonist’s interior life and on the construction of personal identities more than on the action of an external plot. Both present the protagonist<br>

  “To Be Faithful to the Idea of Being Good”: from:

  Author(s) Steffler Margaret<br>
  Abstract: In her final novel,
                  Unless,and in a number of interviews toward the end of her life, Carol Shields drew attention to the concept of goodness. She told Eleanor Wachtel at the beginning of 2002 that goodness was “the main preoccupation of [Unless]” and that she had been “interested in the idea of goodness for a number of years” (Wachtel 153). An earlier comment on a more contained version of goodness focused on Shields’s fondness as a child for the world and characters of “Dick and Jane readers” and the way in which “everyone was terribly good to everyone else.”<br>

  Shields’s Guerrilla Gardeners: from:

  Abstract: In an interview Carol Shields once stated, “I would never write a war story, I mean

Although Shields rejected war narratives as unfamiliar and unappealing, she was drawn to an alternative form of battle taken up entirely by her female characters—guerrilla gardening. Among the many homeowners who tend their yards in Shields’s fictional worlds is a peculiar cast<br>

  The Clarity of Her Anger from:

  Author(s) Urquhart Jane<br>
  Abstract: Many things could be said, and no doubt have been said, in praise of both Carol Shields and the work she created: her humanity, her ability to record and celebrate what others might see as less than dramatic lives, her skill in character development (evidenced by the veracity of dialogue, eccentricity of action, and sensitive renditions of her character’s inner lives), and her ability to put together beautifully crafted sentences. I loved Carol and loved everything about her work, and, at the end of the day, what I loved more than anything was what I will call the clarity of<br>

  Author(s) Raessens Joost<br>
  Abstract: A playful specter is haunting the world. Since the 1960s, when the use of the word “ludic” became popular in both Europe and the US to designate playful behavior and artifacts, playfulness has become increasingly a mainstream characteristic of modern and postmodern culture. In the first decade of the 21st century we can even speak of the global “ludification of culture” (Raessens 2006; 2014). Perhaps the first thing that comes to mind in this context is the immense popularity of computer games, which, as far as global sales are concerned, have already outstripped Hollywood movies.

  Author(s) Raessens Joost<br>
  Abstract: This part of the book sheds light on how play, as it was described in the introductory chapter, actually manifests itself in present-day culture. The authors in this section examine different contemporary expressions of playfulness, varying from people engaging with games, Do-It-Yourself (DIY) computer technologies, or social networks. The contributions in this section substantiate our earlier claims that play is also culturally determined and has different functions in different cultural settings. So we may speak of the current ludification of culture as evidence that play is mutable, and that what this transformation entails is versatile in scope and character. Together<br>

The increasingly widespread use of the computer and the growing experience of its users have since led to a new kind of interaction. In many cases the computer is no longer seen as a machine with which well-planned, methodical, or repetitive tasks are conducted.

  Abstract: Among his singular characteristics, Gérard Granel presents a singularity more singular than others: that of being one of the very rare contemporary philosophers, if not the only one, to have affirmed, for a time, his belonging to the Catholic confession and Church—this while practicing a philosophy clearly tied, on the one hand, to Heidegger and, on the other, to Marx. Broadly speaking, we could say that he is one of the few, if not the only one, to have held together without confusion a religious faith and his engagement in philosophy (no “Christian philosophy,” here, to the contrary!).

In the 1920s, a second stage commenced with the release of several hundred mainstream films featuring stereotypical ethnics and supposedly<br>

  Abstract: Frank Capra Frank Capra hails from the same social tradition in American film as D. W. Griffith and John Ford. Like them, he explored issues of family, law, decency, and democracy. Yet, Capra’s distinctive ethnic background also made a difference. Though as much a social moralist as Griffith, Capra brought to his characters an Italian sense of gentle compassion; his familial concern for others was an ethnic world apart from Griffith’s Anglo view of greedy human nature. As for a resemblance to Ford’s work, Capra’s films often relied on communal values and family scenes. But whereas Ford wrestled with age-old<br>

  Abstract: “Globalization” is one of the premier buzz words of the early twenty-first century. In its most general usage it refers to the idea of a world increasingly stretched, shrunk, connected, interwoven, integrated, interdependent, or less territorially divided economically and culturally among national states. It is most frequently seen as an economic-technological process of time-space compression, as a social modernization of increased cultural homogeneity previously national in character scaled up to the world as a whole, or as shorthand for the practices of economic liberalism spontaneously adopted by governments the world over.¹ I do not want to deny the truth in<br>

  Abstract: The purpose of this case study is to launch an examination of a posturally significant and behaviorally critical aspect of hominid bipedality that is consistently overlooked in assessments of its evolutionary impact. Hominid bipedality eventuated in a radically different primate bodily appearance: male sexual characters relatively hidden in quadrupedal primates are visibly exposed in bipedal ones. Conversely, female sexual characters normally visible in quadrupedal primates are relatively hidden in bipedal ones. Loss of estrus—physiological and behavioral—can be explained in the light of continuous and direct male genital exposure. Typical primate estrus cycling was replaced not by year-round female<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14bt7sz">Studies in Philosophy for Children</a><br>
  Author(s) Lipman Matthew<br>
  Abstract: ASCERTAINING the age of fictional characters can be treacherous. Take Pixie, after whom one of the Philosophy for Children novels is named. Pixie remarks, at the very beginning of the book, “How old am I? The same age you are.” If she is addressing us, and we are of all ages, then so is she. But can we be sure that she is speaking to us?<br>

  [PART THREE: Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14bt7sz">Studies in Philosophy for Children</a><br>
  Abstract: The first chapter in this part is Ann Margaret Sharp’s “Discovering Yourself a Person.” Here she examines Chapter One of Harry Stottlemeier’s Discovery. In it, Sharp finds that because the first chapter relies heavily on the analysis of concepts like reasoning, reflecting, falsifying, inquiring, and so on, it is an appropriate place for the discovery (or invention, it might be added) of who and what we are. As one watches the characters in Harry begin the process of inquiry and as one watches them stumble toward the formation ofa community, one finds them formulating individual ways or styles of thinking.<br>

  12  A Guided Tour of the Logic in Harry Stottlemeier’s Discovery from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14bt7sz">Studies in Philosophy for Children</a><br>
  Author(s) Splitter Laurance J.<br>
  Abstract: LOGIC FORMS the backbone of the
                     Harrysyllabus, although it is by no means the only philosophical theme that arises there. However, the logical discoveries—exemplified by the persistence and single-mindedness of the central character, Harry—constitute a recurring theme that weaves its way through the overall story, and thereby into the thought and talk of the classroom community of inquiry. For it is logic that holds our thinking together—the rules and principles of logic provide criteria for distinguishing better thinking from worse. It is logic in language that makes reasoning possible.<br>

  Book Title: Meaning and Context in the Thanksgiving Hymns-Linguistic and Rhetorical Perspectives on a Collection of Prayers from Qumran<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Hasselbalch Trine B.<br>
  Abstract: Hasselbalch asserts that current theories about the social background of Thanksgiving Hymns are unable to explain its heterogeneous character. Instead the author suggests a reading strategy that leaves presumptions about the underlying social contexts aside to instead consider the collection's hybridity as a clue to understanding the collection as a whole.<br>

More specifically, I have attempted to reach a meaningful explanation for the heterogeneous character of 1QHodayota. So far, explanations have been based on the notion that differences between the so-called Leader Hymns and the so-called Community Hymns mirror a social dichotomy, and that the one group of hymns was spoken by the community leadership, whereas the other was<br>

  2  Jesus’ Jewish Neighborhood from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155j380">The Homebrewed Christianity Guide to Jesus</a><br>
  Abstract: Jesus was Jewish. I know it seems obvious, but here’s a crazy fact: until fairly recently, scholarship about Jesus didn’t really take his Jewishness into account. Throughout the early church, the Middle Ages, and the Reformation, the experts who studied Jesus in the Bible pretty much ignored the fact that Jesus, his disciples, his opponents, and just about everyone who wrote about him in the New Testament were
                  Jews. That means Augustine, Aquinas, Luther—they all overlooked the fact that Jesus and the whole cast of characters were Jewish. And to make it even crazier, some of them (cough, Luther,<br>

  4.  Stealing the Show: from:

  Abstract: The way of the cross is adversarial, yes, but the embodied expression of that way under conditions of empire is neither violent tactical maneuvering nor passive endurance. Both of these responses may be necessary in certain situations. But the binary of violence/nonviolence is not the most important consideration when weighing how to express an adversarial politics. The greater question is how effective action is possible—action that will, in fact, resist and transform. This chapter turns to the second defining characteristic of Jesus’ way of the cross after its adversarial politics: the forging of dramatic action. It points to the<br>

  Author(s) Bader Günter<br>
  Abstract: Wisdom and foolishness intertwined—the theology of the cross—and consequently speeches in the form of
                  theologica paradoxa, of paradoxical theology: these are all widely known as characteristics of Reformation theology, especially of the Lutheran style. Indeed, it was Luther who furnished this connection and put it under the rubric oftheologica paradoxa. But why look fortheologica paradoxain Erasmus and Cusanus if this rubric is distinctive to Luther? Despite the somewhat strange juxtaposition of these two authors with Luther, it is likely that neither of them would have put their work under a Lutheran heading. Therefore, this discussion<br>

  Abstract: Geoffrey Hill’s poems have often presented us with a series of scenes, livid tableaux, ‘spectacles’: the Jews in Europe, the Battle of Towton, the endurances of some poets, Boethius in his cell, the nailer’s darg, real and fancied martyrdoms like those of his Sebastians.

  Book Title: Conrad's Marlow-Narrative and death in 'Youth', Heart of Darkness, Lord Jim and Chance<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wake Paul<br>
  Abstract: Variously described as ‘the average pilgrim’, a ‘wanderer’, and ‘a Buddha preaching in European clothes’, Charlie Marlow is the voice behind Joseph Conrad’s ‘Youth’ (1898), Heart of Darkness (1899), Lord Jim (1900) and Chance (1912). Conrad’s Marlow offers a comprehensive account and critical analysis of one of Conrad’s most celebrated creations, asking both who and what is Marlow: a character or a narrator, a biographer or an autobiographical screen, a messenger or an interpreter, a bearer of truth or a misguided liar? Reading Conrad’s fiction alongside the work of Walter Benjamin, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida and Martin Heidegger, and offering an investigation into the connection between narrative and death, this book argues that Marlow’s essence is located in his liminality – in his constantly shifting position – and that the emergence of meaning in his stories is at all points bound up with the process of his storytelling.<br>

  Abstract: Traditionally post-colonialism has read Irish culture through its inherited dichotomy of colonised/coloniser and empowered/disempowered thereby replicating imperialist power structures of old; the reading of the two primary strands within the representative discourse explored here points rather to the atypicality, the nomadic qualities, of Ireland’s postcolonial configurations and the subaltern histories of social groupings which Gramsci characterised as ‘fragmented and episodic’ (Gramsci, 1971: 55). My discussion seeks to underscore the importance of rethinking and re-interpreting nationalist ideology and praxis within the Irish (post-) colonial context. Emphasised in the narratives explored here however is the ‘radically undecidable nature of the text’ and<br>

  Book Title: Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kempshall Matthew<br>
  Abstract: This book provides an analytical overview of the vast range of historiography which was produced in western Europe over a thousand-year period between c.400 and c.1500. Concentrating on the general principles of classical rhetoric central to the language of this writing, alongside the more familiar traditions of ancient history, biblical exegesis and patristic theology, this survey introduces the conceptual sophistication and semantic rigour with which medieval authors could approach their narratives of past and present events, and the diversity of ends to which this history could then be put. By providing a close reading of some of the historians who put these linguistic principles and strategies into practice (from Augustine and Orosius through Otto of Freising and William of Malmesbury to Machiavelli and Guicciardini), it traces and questions some of the key methodological changes that characterise the function and purpose of the western historiographical tradition in this formative period of its development.<br>

  3  INVENTION AND NARRATIVE from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jhjx">Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500</a><br>
  Abstract: The categorisation of classical rhetoric into its demonstrative, judicial and deliberative forms reveals significant differences in emphasis, but also significant similarities in approach, in the way in which the relationship between an individual’s character (
                  mores) and deeds (res gestae) could, and should, be described by a speaker or writer. The principles which these three categories of rhetoric shared as common ground, however, exerted an impact on medieval historiography that went well beyond engineering the specific didactic, legal or political goals of particular works of history. This influence can be gauged by means of the two standard schemes according to which<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jhjx">Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500</a><br>
  Abstract: The influence of classical rhetoric on the writing of history in the Middle Ages centred on the relationship between the depiction of character (attributes of person) and the description of deeds (attributes of events), on the invention of arguments (causation, testimony and proof), and on the construction of a brief, lucid and, above all, verisimilar narrative. This does not mean, of course, that all the principles involved in each one of these areas were applied either simultaneously or consistently across the broad range of writings which the single term

  CONCLUSION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jhjx">Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500</a><br>
  Abstract: Medieval historiography was neither crude nor credulous nor conceptually unsophisticated. Such characterisations would be no more, and no less, applicable to the writing of history in the early modern and modern periods and, if only on this basis, medieval historians deserve better than to suffer the methodological condescension of posterity. The present study has been designed accordingly as an introduction to a set of interpretative criteria on which works of medieval historiography might be assessed, primarily through examining principles of classical rhetoric which would have been second-nature to writers who had been brought up, directly or indirectly, on the precepts<br>

  Author(s) Smith Aine<br>
  Abstract: The body of writing produced by Marie Redonnet between 1985 and 2000 is an unusually coherent one. Settings and characters drawn up in one text are echoed in later works; certain stories and motifs figure again and again; the style of writing rarely changes from one text to the next. This is not to suggest, however, that the work does not evolve over the period. Indeed, while there is a large degree of overlap between the works published in the 1980s and more recent texts, there are also significant differences, of which the most obvious is increased realism in characterisation<br>

  Abstract: In the first three of the four novels Agnès Desarthe has published at the time of writing –
                  Quelques minutes de bonheur absolu(1993),Un secret sans importance(1996),Cinq photos de ma femme(1998) andLes Bonnes Intentions(2000) – the binary opposition understanding–misunderstanding stands out as a central issue, particularly with regard to identity. What emerges is a relentless impulse on the part of the characters to be understood and to understand, or, more precisely, to be defined by, and to define, the other in absolutist terms.

  Abstract: Of mixed Franco-Algerian parentage, Leïla Sebbar spans a variety of genres in her writing, including short stories, journalism, essays, children’s writing and contributions to collaborative works, including collections of visual material. She also has a number of major novels to her credit. In its thematic content, Sebbar’s work straddles the Mediterranean, focusing attention on the dynamics between the generations. She is not engaged in any mission of nostalgia for lost youth, however. Her writing is resolutely orientated towards the youth of today. This focus is evident not only in her characters, but also in the young audience that she targets.<br>

  Abstract: What do you get if you cross detection and science fiction? What happens when you stage a sci-fi picaresque inside an animal’s body? And what happens when a kangaroo develops the power of speech and starts wielding a gun? The punchlines are all to be found in Jonathan Lethem’s writing, and they are only partially comic. This book proceeds from the broad and frequently rehearsed observation that Jonathan Lethem’s novels and short stories subvert established fictional genres in some way, and that the frequent intermingling and clashing of genres is reflected in the bizarre characteristics displayed by many of the<br>

He is ‘so devoted to the traditional means’ of ‘scenes and characters and dialogue and paragraph and plot’ and although he sometimes makes ‘intertextual jokes’, he believes there is nothing in his work to ‘threaten anyone short of the mandarins who just don’t want the Fantastic Four ever to be mentioned inside a novel’ (Personal Interview, 2009).

  Author(s) Franke John R.<br>
  Abstract: The Christian tradition has been characterized by its commitment to the significance of the Bible for life and thought. Indeed, Christian communal identity has largely been formed around a set of literary texts that together form canonical scripture. As David Kelsey remarks, acknowledging the Bible as scripture lies at the very heart of participating in the community of Jesus Christ, and the decision to adopt the texts of Christian scripture as “canon” is not “a separate decision over and above a decision to become a Christian.”¹ Yet the past two centuries have seen considerable change in the nature and function<br>

  Abstract: Postmodernism—the arrival of the “future now”—is already past. It is history. The postmodern may be what comes after (
                  post) the present, the now (modus), but people are already seeking what comes after the postmodern, while others who once used the term have given up on it because it is so unhelpful. At one level, of course, talk of the postmodern was just a way of indicating the “up to date,” the newer than new. But at a more serious level it indicated something about modern times, about those characteristics of modernity that have become so intense that they<br>

  Abstract: What is a parable? It is a short story characterized by verisimilitude and conveying a lesson, usually moral. A parable is, in Hebrew terms, a haggadic or midrashic
                  mashal. The whole of Jewish tradition is bidimensional; it is built into the halakah (legal dispositions) and the haggadah (paradigmatic stories illustrating the meaning, impact, and relevance of a biblical theme or text). Historically, it must be said that preference has been given by Jewish readers to the halakic side of the tradition because of its obvious bearing on ways of life according to the divine order.

  Abstract: Were I writing my book in the nineteenth century, I could have come with a typically explicit title such as “The Retrospectively Set Birth Stories in the Beginning of Jesus’s Ministry by Matthew and Luke.” As I said earlier, the gospels are written from the perspective of the death and resurrection of their main character, so that the end is the beginning and the beginning is the end. In other words, for the evangelists, Jesus’s death was no ordinary death, and so his birth was no ordinary birth.¹<br>

  Author(s) Singerman Diane<br>
  Abstract: A negative, pejorative characterization of informal housing areas,
                  manatiq al‘ashwayi’at, became a common refrain in Egyptian public discourse in the 1990s. These unplanned, lower-income, and poorly serviced areas came to be defined as a deviant phenomenon and, by association, the residents of those areas as deviants. Yet, estimates suggest that between 4.7 and 7 million Cairenes lived in informal housing areas in this decade.¹ What drives the labeling of a third or half of the residents of Cairo as deviants? This chapter examines how and why such a large share of Cairo’s residents have been deviantized and stigmatized. An answer<br>

  Book Title: The Secret Life of Stories-From Don Quixote to Harry Potter, How Understanding Intellectual Disability Transforms the Way We Read<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Bérubé Michael<br>
  Abstract: In
      The Secret Life of Stories, Michael Bérubé tells a dramatically different tale, in a compelling account of how an understanding of intellectual disability can transform our understanding of narrative. Instead of focusing on characters with disabilities, he shows how ideas about intellectual disability inform an astonishingly wide array of narrative strategies, providing a new and startling way of thinking through questions of time, self-reflexivity, and motive in the experience of reading. Interweaving his own stories with readings of such texts as Faulkner'sThe Sound and the Fury, Haddon'sThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, Kingston'sThe Woman Warrior, and Philip K. Dick'sMartian Time-Slip, Bérubé puts his theory into practice, stretching the purview of the study of literature and the role of disability studies within it. Armed only with the tools of close reading, Bérubé demonstrates the immensely generative possibilities in the ways disability is deployed within fiction, finding in them powerful meditations on what it means to be a social being, a sentient creature with an awareness of mortality and causality-and sentience itself. Persuasive and witty, Michael Bérubé engages Harry Potter fans and scholars of literature alike. For all readers,The Secret Life of Storieswill fundamentally change the way we think about the way we read.<br>

  Abstract: ‘The living Tradition is essential for enabling the Church to grow through time in the understanding of the truth revealed in the Scriptures.’¹ These words from the Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation of Benedict XVI throw light on the relationship between Scripture and Tradition as understood by the Roman Catholic Church. It speaks of the revelatory character of the Scriptures, and of the Tradition as being living and dynamic as it opens the Church to the revelation of God. However, within the broader Christian Church, the relationship between Scripture and Tradition has been a source of contention and, despite the strides that<br>

  Abstract: In-Between God' explores three important areas for contemporary Christianity: theology, community and discipleship. Part One inquires into the rhythms of faith as it interacts with themes of uncertainty and doubt, the nature of theological discourse, the task of systematic theology, evangelism and the various ways in which theology is done. Part Two discusses the importance of place in relation to the church, and themes of innovation, undecideability and new forms of monastic community. Part Three addresses themes in discipleship: simplicity, mysticism, the passions and pilgrimage. A red thread connecting these essays is the character of the triune God who is the energy and life in between all things.<br>

Nevertheless, I propose that the second section of the initial divine speech (Job 38:39–39:30, some thirty-three verses), may invite us or allow us to move ‘the problem’ to a quite different context. The experience of God is still crucial, but the context is radically other than generally allowed for in the book<br>

  Abstract: Black athletes from the French colonies began to appear in metropolitan France in the early twenties.¹ They were represented in the media according to two models: black American champion-athletes, who had become popular in France toward the end of the nineteenth century, and black colonial subjects. The image of the colonial black athlete was elaborated at the intersection of these two imaginaries. However, the progressive stereotyping of these black athletes cannot be reduced exclusively to race. Instead, given the varying contexts in which these stereotypes were produced, their reversible and ever-evolving character, we would do well to consider the different<br>

  Abstract: This foreword is based on a 2005 interview conducted with the historian Marc Ferro, a specialist on the issue of colonization and the reception of this past in French society, namely in books such as
                  L’Histoire des colonisations(1994),Les tabous de l’Histoire(2002), andLe Livre noir du colonialisme(2003).¹ He has described the current situation—a situation in which the French public has turned its back on the work of historians—as a form of “self-censorship by citizens,” paired with a “censorship by the governing authorities.” This sort of postcolonial posture, which characterizes France at the beginning of<br>

  Author(s) Blanchard Pascal<br>
  Abstract: The Other is a recurring anthropological figure in every field of social science. On the one hand, because figures of exteriority are the mirrors through which the substance and borders of collective identities are formed, transformed, firmed up, and reaffirmed.¹ The Other is endowed with “characteristics” that vary with the times, but that always fall between two poles: stigmatization and desire. On the other hand, figures of the Other play an invaluable part since they are the motors of all forms of social mobilization and are called upon and instrumentalized to inaugurate or consolidate networks of sociability, to structure or<br>

  Abstract: In Morocco I tend—like many American anthropologists—to seek rapport with a smile. Retailers in Fes refer to American tourists by the code word
                  miska—chewing gum—meaning they are all teeth and lips. (British tourists, in contrast, aread-dam al-barid, which means cold blood.) Yet a Moroccan acquaintance of mine characterized Americans as tragically sad friends. The United States is so enormous, he said, and everyone so mobile, that “you Americans are always ready to drop a friend.” He’s right, in my experience. The friendly first steps of rapport are, if not the opposite of friendship, a firm<br>

  Author(s) AZAK UMUT<br>
  Abstract: As elsewhere, Islamism in Turkey has been a political and cultural project that challenges the dominant dichotomies of traditional/modern, public/private, and Islamic/non-Islamic.¹ Studies of the cultural transformation and the emergence of new subjectivities brought by Islamism demonstrate the high significance of “visibility” to the Islamist project,² which has altered the public sphere to emphasize the “Islamic” difference—often through dress codes for women. According to Nilüfer Göle, since 1990 Islamism has experienced a second phase, in which its cultural program has become more apparent. The movement’s first phase was characterized by militant and revolutionary politics. In this second phase of<br>

  Abstract: Marion uses the term “event” in two different but closely connected senses in his work, especially in his presentation in
                  Being Given.On the one hand, he speaks of the event as a characteristic of all given phenomena: phenomena give themselves as events, they are “being given.” He develops this in §17 ofBeing Givenas the fifth characteristic ofallphenomena alongside anamorphosis, arrival, incident, and fait accompli. Most prominently, however, the event isone typeof saturated phenomenon, namely the phenomenon saturated according to quantity.

  FOUR  Love and Violence from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz4t7">Degrees of Givenness</a><br>
  Abstract: The lover “declares his love as one declares war” (EP, 79; PE, 129). So insists Marion repeatedly in his investigation into the nature of the erotic phenomenon. War, of course, is here “only” a metaphor illustrating the absolute commitment of the lover. Yet the fact that this analogy is used several times throughout
                  The Erotic Phenomenonseems to indicate that it is not insignificant. Rather, it points to a problematic aspect of Marion’s treatment of eros, namely the extreme—if not almost militant—character of this love. And the careful reader finds the connotations of absoluteness exacerbated by another subtheme,<br>

  Abstract: Perhaps nothing in Kierkegaard’s writings has proven quite as polarizing as

  Author(s) Wells Paul<br>
  Abstract: The work of Jan Svankmajer, celebrated Czechoslovakian animator and avant-garde filmmaker, demonstrates an ongoing pre-occupation with the codes and conditions of bodily function and identity. His fictions are characterised by the recognition of transience in the body and the place of the body as a defining instrument in socio-cultural mechanisms and indeed, as a socio-cultural mechanism. Svankmajer uses the unique vocabulary of animation in expressing these principles and essentially re-defines the conditions by which the body might be represented and re-defined aesthetically and politically.<br>

  Abstract: Sergei Eisenstein loved the cartoon figure Mickey Mouse. The Soviet film director not only admired Walt Disney’s films but also made them part of the subject matter of his theoretical studies. With his characteristic ambition, these theoretical explorations of Disney’s animation were intended to serve as the bases for understanding animation and developing questions alluding to the nature of art itself.¹ Most of these writings are from the early 1940s, some years after his return from Hollywood where he had met Disney in 1937.² He was also reconsidering or at least reformulating his theoretical ideas, especially that of montage.

  Abstract: Paracelsus (1493–1541) experienced the natural world as a complex order of sympathies, resonances, magnetic attractions, and analogies (Pagel 52).¹ Though Paracelsus is variously categorized as physician, philosopher, alchemist, herbalist, I like to think of him as a plant physiognomist, as, that is, a practitioner of the art of discovering temperament and character from outward appearance. Each natural object bore for him a divine “signature” encoded in the thing’s shape, smell, texture, color, posture. This equivocal sign served as a spur to the human perceiver to engage in the artistry—the speculative thinking and practical experimentation—that would give determinacy<br>

  Abstract: The most contested affirmation regarding Jesus of Nazareth pertains to his divinity. It is the case, however, that the traditional affirmation of the perfect humanity of Jesus is also utterly controversial in modern theology. In one sense, this is simply because it is inherently controversial to affirm that there exists a real “essence” of human nature that God could assume. The subjacent question is philosophical: can we speak about perennial natures present in things in general and in human beings in particular down through time, and if so, how is it the case?

  Abstract: Is it an irony of modern theology that in the age in which Rudolph Bultmann should raise the question of the fundamentally mythological character of many New Testament ideas, Hans Urs von Balthasar should seek to reinvigorate the theological meaning of the descent of Christ into hell on Holy Saturday? Perhaps not. By offering a distinctive and in many ways innovative reading of this teaching of the Apostles’ Creed, Balthasar sought to challenge an age of overly reductive scientistic rationality, underscoring in Catholic theology the permanently valid interplay of literary symbolism, metaphysics, dramatic beauty, and Trinitarian mystery.

  Abstract: The environment in which the New Testament was written was both oral and rhetorical in character. Texts, especially religious texts, function differently in oral cultures that are 90 percent illiterate and in which even the texts that exist are oral texts, meant to be read aloud. These important insights, when coupled with the realization that orally delivered and rhetorically adept discourse and storytelling was at the heart of first-century culture, should long ago have led us to a new way of reading the Gospels themselves.<br>

  Author(s) Labahn Michael<br>
  Abstract: John 21 may seem to be a surprising point of departure for a discussion about John and the historical Jesus.¹ Historical-critical scholarship, though challenged by conservative exegesis and/or by scholars using linguistic and narrative methods (e.g., Thyen 2005), still interprets John 21 as a later addition to the Gospel (e.g., Schnelle 2007a, 523–24). The judgment that John 21 has a secondary character is evident even in the more text-centered approaches of Francis Moloney (1998b, 545–47, 562–65) and Manfred Lang (1999, 294–95 n. 918).² So why take that chapter as a point of departure for raising the<br>

  Abstract: In reflecting upon the above treatments of aspects of historicity in the Fourth Gospel, a multiplicity of approaches and disciplines is here employed in getting at a common interest: the historical character of the Johannine tradition and ways in which it casts light upon the Jesus of history—his intentions, doings, teachings, travels, and receptions, as well as impressions, memories, interpretations, narrations, and writings about him in later settings. The division of the Gospel of John into three sections involving chapters 1–4, 5–12, and 13–21 works well as a means of dividing up the ministry of Jesus<br>

  Abstract: The thought and practice of sixteenth-century Anabaptism seem peculiar to many moderns precisely because modernity has no conceptual framework capable of correctly understanding the movement. Recent philosophical trends within postmodernity, however, provide fresh models for reassessing Anabaptism in terms more attuned to Anabaptism’s unique character. Some working within the Anglo-American strains of postmodernity have addressed and advanced post-Enlightenment thought in a remarkably successful manner, especially in regard to theology.¹ In this idiom, George Lindbeck is prominent among recent scholars using postmodern philosophy to help us imagine new ways of thinking about theology, particularly regarding the nature of religion, doctrine, and<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1729w4d">The Renaissance of emotion</a><br>
  Author(s) Rawnsley Ciara<br>
  Abstract: Emotions-based commentary on early modern literature, and Shakespeare in particular, may suffer from a reductiveness due to reluctance to reflect multiple emotional states present simultaneously, either within an individual as ‘mixed emotions’, or between different characters often listening ‘at cross purposes’, or between characters and the audience (‘dramatic irony’). This perceived deficiency arguably stems from three basic assumptions that can be challenged. First, there has been recently an emphasis on the physiological approach to emotions, which suggests that early modern theory analysed feelings as primarily stemming from the body.¹ In general terms this approach is clearly justifiable in the light<br>

  Abstract: The link between rural Wales and notions of authentic Welshness has been a long-standing theme in both the academic literature and in popular representations. The Welsh countryside and its imagined characteristics hold a very privileged place in dominant constructions of national identity. Myths of a peaceable and tolerant nation, deeply embedded in the national imaginary are rooted in an idealized Welsh rural community life that summons the trope of the gwerin, a particular form of localized communitarianism to express the values of egalitarianism, classlessness and internationalism.

  Abstract: Musicology has always been puzzled with semantic questions: does music have meaning? The difficulty lies in music’s inability to function referentially. One might say that literature suffers from the opposite problem: verbal texts contain a centrifugal tendency to direct the recipient’s attention away from their artwork character (form) in favor of their referential message (content) (Kyndrup, 2011, p. 87). However, the specific case of poetry (as opposed to prose) often displays a certain quality that maneuvers attention toward the form of the message itself; a move notably termed

  Abstract: Tonality is understood by musicologists and musicians in many different, often mutually exclusive senses. Sometimes it is regarded as a distinctive characteristic of solely Western music (e.g. Dahlhaus, 1988), but sometimes this understanding is applied to the features of non-Western music too (e.g. Krumhansl, 1990). Even as a term restricted to the features of Western music it is assigned a variety of meanings such as an aspect of melodic relations (Thomson, 1999) or an exclusive trait of harmonic organization (Lowinsky, 1990).

  Book Title: Mestizaje and Globalization-Transformations of Identity and Power<br>
  Publisher: University of Arizona Press<br>
  Author(s): YOUNG PHILIP D.<br>
  Abstract: The Spanish word
      mestizajedoes not easily translate into English. Its meaning and significance have been debated for centuries since colonization by European powers began. Its simplest definition is "mixing." As long as the term has been employed, norms and ideas about racial and cultural relations in the Americas have been imagined, imposed, questioned, rejected, and given new meaning.Mestizaje and Globalizationpresents perspectives on the underlying transformation of identity and power associated with the term during times of great change in the Americas. The volume offers a comprehensive and empirically diverse collection of insights concerning mestizaje's complex relationship with indigeneity, the politics of ethnic identity, transnational social movements, the aesthetic of cultural production, development policies, and capitalist globalization, with particular attention to cases in Latin America and the United States.Beyond the narrow and often inadequate meaning of mestizaje as biological and racial mixing, the concept deserves an innovative theoretical consideration due to its multidimensional, multifaceted character and its resilience as an ideological construct. The contributors argue that historical analyses of mestizaje do not sufficiently understand contemporary ways that racism, ethnic discrimination, and social injustice intermingle with current discourse and practice of cultural recognition and multiculturalism in the Americas.Mestizaje and Globalizationcontributes to an emerging multidisciplinary effort to explore how identities are imposed, negotiated, and reconstructed. The chapter authors clearly set forth the issues and obstacles that Indigenous peoples and subjugated minorities face, as well as the strategies they have employed to gain empowerment in the face of globalization.<br>

  Book Title: Religion Without Redemption-Social Contradictions and Awakened Dreams in Latin America<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Löwy Michael<br>
  Abstract: The world’s eyes are on Latin America as a place of radical political inspiration and as an alternative to the neoliberal model. Each country in the region deals differently in its method of government, yet there are common cultural themes that tie the continent’s trajectory together. Religion without Redemption looks at the sociology of religion, political philosophy and the history of ideas of the continent, in an attempt to show how Western understanding fails to come close to a correct analysis of how and why political and economic characteristics work as they do. Luis Martínez Andrade focuses on how the centrality of religion for the people of Latin America has influenced how they interact with the changes in the modern economic system. Capitalism, for example, has taken on religious characteristics: it has sacred places of worship (the shopping mall) as well as its own prophets. Martínez Andrade discusses how this form of ‘cultural religion’ accompanies many aspects of life in a contradictory manner: not only does it fulfil the role of legitimating oppression, it also can be a powerful source of rebellion, unveiling thus a subversive side to the status quo. Religion Without Redemption advances the ideas of liberation theory into the 21st century, and challenges the provincialism to which many Latin American thinkers are usually consigned.<br>

The characteristic human experience concerned ‘co-present dualisms’: public and private, rule and practice, antagonism and solidarity, freedom and constraint, rebelliousness and compliance, creativeness and structure.

  6.  MAD GOAT IN THE ATTIC: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183q3bk">Cities of Affluence and Anger</a><br>
  Abstract: Most academics read
                  The Satanic Verses(1988) as an extended meditation on cultural hybridity. As Gayatri Spivak argues, its mode of representation is “citation, reinscription, re-routing the historical,“epitomizing postcoloniality because it systematically dislodges “every metropolitan definition” (104). The novel is predicated on this trope of postcolonial disruption, foregrounding the political and cultural fallout of imperial contraction and the immigration of former colonial subjects to the metropole. InThe Location of Culture,Homi Bhabha famously reads Rushdie’s novel as a testament to “culture’s [inherent]hybridity” and the “indeterminacy of diasporic identity” (38, 225).

  Abstract: Like the man who wrote them, the novels, stories and poems of Pierre Louӱs (1870–1925) overflow with an irrepressible and childlike
                  joie de vivreand, in the case of both man and work, the dominant trait is excess. The extreme emotions of a romantic adolescence, the practical jokes of a young poet and, later, an extravagant self-indulgence, whether in the consumption of cigarettes or in the socially less acceptable tastes of the libertine, all of these excesses in Louӱs’s life and character are reflected in his writing, both in the critically acclaimed published canon and in the erotic works<br>

  Abstract: Since its emergence as an academic subject in the 1960s, Irish Studies in Canada has evinced some of the tendencies characteristic of the discipline in general, while also moving in directions that can offer instructive critical models for further development both at home and abroad. Despite Canada’s relatively small academic population, the accomplishments of the founding generation of Irish Studies scholars over the past four decades constitute an impressive body of work. However specific their original areas of research, many of these scholars embraced and contributed to the international trend to expand both the objects of their scrutiny and the<br>

  Abstract: The events of 28 July 2005 alter our perspective. If we are to believe the statements of intent, and all concerned pass this high test of character, the announcement by the Irish Republican Army that it will decommission its arms marks an end of the Troubles and, albeit less significantly, a defining moment in the Irish culture wars of the last 40 years. Perhaps this sanguine vision is deceptive and the protracted peace process will persist in being characterised by sporadic slides into crisis. If so, then this vision of an end to the culture wars will also deceive; but<br>

  Book Title: The Literatures of the French Pacific-Reconfiguring Hybridity<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): FORSDICK CHARLES<br>
  Abstract: Hybridity theory, the creative dissemination and restless to-and-fro of Homi Bhabha’s Third Space or of Stuart Hall’s politics of difference, for example, has opened up understandings of what may be produced in the spaces of cultural contact. This book argues that the particularity of the forms of mixing in the literatures of the French Pacific country of New Caledonia contest and complexify the characterisations of hybrid cultural exchange. From the accounts of European discovery by the first explorers and translations of the stories of oral tradition, to the writings of settler, déporté, convict, indentured labourer and their descendants, and contemporary indigenous (Kanak) literatures, these texts inscribe Oceanian or Pacific difference within and against colonial contexts. In a context of present strategic positioning around a unique postcolonial proposal of common destiny, however, mutual cultural transformation is not unbounded. The local cannot escape coexistence with the global, yet Oceanian literatures maintain and foreground a powerful sense of ancestral origins, of an original engendering. The spiral going forward continually remembers and cycles back distinctively to an enduring core. In their turn, the Pacific stories of unjust deportation or heroic settlement are founded on exile and loss. On the other hand, both the desire for, and fears of, cultural return reflected in such hybrid literary figures as Déwé Gorodé’s graveyard of ancestral canoes and Pierre Gope’s chefferie internally corrupted in response to the solicitations of Western commodity culture, or Claudine Jacques’ lizard of irrational violence, will need to be addressed in any working out of a common destiny for Kanaky-New Caledonia.<br>

  8  Writing Métissage in New Caledonian Non-Kanak Literatures: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt18kr78q">The Literatures of the French Pacific</a><br>
  Abstract: In the nineteenth-century novels set in New Caledonia,
                  métissage, as the process and outcome of racial mixing, was most particularly associated with women characters, and largely characterized by sexual permissiveness and biological degeneration. The earliest written literature in New Caledonia was, for the most part, produced by Metropolitan French people passing through. Louise Michel, considered in Chapters 1 and 2, spent eight years in the country’s penitentiary system, leaving New Caledonia after the general amnesty to rejoin her ailing mother in France. Jacques and Marie Nervat came to the colony a decade later, where they lived from 1898 to 1902.<br>

  Abstract: The task of this book is to think through how Caribbean textual representations of performance broaden understandings of personhood. To explore how the genre of performance specifically can intercede in definitions of personhood, this chapter offers a performance analysis of Marissa Chibas’s 2007 one-woman play
                  Daughter of a Cuban Revolutionary. Throughout the play, Chibas performs much of the “backstage” work—such as establishing the scene’s time and place, or getting in and out of character—and exposes otherwise unseen labor. In so doing,Daughterdemonstrates how the means of creating theater give us a point of entry into redefining personhood.<br>

They merely recount how the Lover, having gazed into Narcissus’s “perilous fountain” in the Jardin de Déduit and been wounded by Cupid’s arrow, first sees and fixes upon what would be the object of his amorous passion, the rosebud. Yet, the undeniable indeterminacy with respect to the object of our lover-protagonist’s passion underscores a certain emptiness that appears to characterize this object, at least at this juncture in Guillaume’s poem.

In acknowledging this dissemination, we are not forgetting what this allusion to the title of Jacques Derrida’s book (which appeared in 1972) connotes:¹ threads become woven with more specialized research and with Heidegger’s most difficult, ambitious, and inapparent themes; one should<br>

  Author(s) Pihlström Sami<br>
  Abstract: This chapter will examine the relation between religion and morality from a pragmatist point of view, focusing on the fundamental importance of a certain kind of attitude toward the reality of evil and suffering based on Jamesian pragmatism. My discussion differs from many other treatments of pragmatist philosophy of religion and moral philosophy due to what might be called its “via negativa” methodology. I am not trying to positively characterize, or to interpret James’s characterizations of, such notions as the “good life,” the “goods,” or “fruits” of religious life and religious experiences—even though I do regard (Jamesian) pragmatism as<br>

  Author(s) Proudfoot Wayne<br>
  Abstract: The word “naturalism” is used in many different ways in contemporary philosophy. For some, it has required that a properly naturalistic account appeal only to what is countenanced by the natural sciences, but there have been a number of recent attempts to formulate more liberal approaches to naturalism that allow for natural accounts that recognize the normative character of beliefs, practices, actions, and institutions.¹ A certain priority is rightly given to the sciences in the sense that, as Huw Price has put it, science tells us that humans are natural creatures, and any naturalistic approach should honor that.² But that<br>

  Abstract: The pragmatist theory of religion has two very different roots. One of them indubitably lies in the foundation of an empirical psychology of religion developed by William James in his 1902 masterpiece

  Author(s) Pensado Jaime M.<br>
  Abstract: The 1950s saw the rise of a new generation of leftist, conservative, and Catholic students in Latin America that began calling for a unique form of hemispheric solidarity. Their efforts reflected concerns about momentous contemporary events that had a profound impact at their universities, like the anticolonial war in Algeria, the rise of military dictatorships in Guatemala, and the “ iron fist” following the Hungarian insurrection. But these students also harkened back to the “arielista” language that characterized the first two decades of the twentieth century.¹ Asserting their ideological positions during the incipient cold war, they participated throughout the 1950s<br>

  Book Title: Exodus and Resurrection-The God of Israel in the Theology of Robert W. Jenson<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Nicol Andrew W.<br>
  Abstract: Exodus and Resurrection establishes the important place God’s identity as the “God of Israel" has in the systematic theology of Robert W. Jenson. The work demonstrates that the identification of the God of Israel as the agent of Jesus’ resurrection functions as a foundational premise in Jenson’s Trinitarian theology. Andrew W. Nicol argues that a central characteristic of Jenson’s work is not merely his recognition that the same God who rescued Israel from Egypt raised Jesus from the dead, or the related yet distinct step of renovating his theology in a nonsupersessionist fashion, but also his attempt to conceive of the full implications for doing so in Christian theology, in the church’s self-understanding, and in the church’s relation to Israel and continuing Judaism. In this, Exodus and Resurrection provides a clear and critically appreciative account of Robert W. Jenson’s work and offers a new vital architectonic map of Jenson’s systematic vision.<br>

  3  God in Israel’s Life from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b3t751">Exodus and Resurrection</a><br>
  Abstract: In biblical Israel’s narrative, there is a telling of God’s identity that is not finally reducible to a mere expression of “normal” religion’s apprehension of deity. This chapter further explicates Jenson’s understanding of this “telling,” of Israel’s history, and the manner in which this drama makes and shapes the gospel promise. In addition, while aspects of Jenson’s account of the God of Israel’s intimate dealings with this people are relatively conventional, others have attracted considerable criticism. This extrapolation seeks to draw attention to innovation and locate Jenson’s characteristic moves within the conceptual nexus that integrates his system, highlighting their significance<br>

  9  Conceiving God from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b3t7k7">Theology in the Flesh</a><br>
  Abstract: Do we have to think of God using human categories? If we do, which characteristics should be attributed to God? Is God more like a person or more like a force, such as gravity? Can we escape anthropomorphism? Is all of our thinking about God metaphorical or is any of it literal? This chapter examines these questions from a cognitive linguistics approach and argues that humans have to use anthropogenic (human originating) and species-specific concepts for God. The real debate is about which concepts various religious communities believe are appropriate for God. The concept of God is a graded category<br>

  Abstract: That which human being faces is neither an already-completed world nor primordial beings in-themselves.¹ From human being’s perspective, the world is incomplete by nature and in appearance. By “the world” we mean actual beings relative to the being of humans. Beings in-themselves are indeed really there, but they might not be actual for human beings. To be actual, beings must become objects of human being’s cognition and practice, and consequently, present actual meaning to human being. In this sense, actuality is characterized by becoming. The transformation of beings in-themselves into actuality is thus a historical interaction. In ancient Chinese, this<br>

  Abstract: Fredric Jameson’s assertion that utopia’s deepest subject is its own inconceivability—its own failure of imagination, in a sense—baldly contravenes a positivist utopian tradition characterized precisely as the full-fledged blueprint of an alternative, more perfect society. Jameson’s negative utopianism embraces this aspect of failure, but it is important to understand that this failure is not simply the commonplace fatality of a compromised individual or authorial imagination. It is, instead, what Jameson calls “the systemic, cultural, and ideological closure of which we are all in one way or another prisoners.”¹ Despite Thomas More’s inspiration for, and association with, utopianism of<br>

  Abstract: In various places in Benjamin’s writing the divine is identified in the total passing away and disappearance of the phenomenal. Probably the most famous case for such annihilative characterization of the divine occurs in the essay “Critique of Violence.” Yet, the account of divine violence in that essay, with its intimation of active destruction, tempts one to construe the moment of disappearance in terms of catastrophic effects wrought by God on the physical world, on the model of a force that makes visible changes in reality.

Or in early trade press attempts “to classify the film product of the world”, such asNew York Dramatic Mirror’s 1908 compilation of the “distinguishing characteristics” or “infallible ear marks” of films produced by different countries.¹ Or in early histories of the cinema’s aesthetic development, such as Léon Moussinac’sNaissance du cinéma<br>

  Abstract: Despite the seemingly uncanny pithiness of Al Jolson’s famous lines, “Wait a minute! Wait a minute! You ain’t heard nothin’ yet”, in 1927, speech was not new to the cinema. In fact, speech had played a substantial role in silent films for nearly two decades. Dialogue intertitles and character-written inserts allowed cinematic representations to extend beyond the pictorial exterior and into the linguistic consciousness of characters. Silent film dialogue, however, brought more than a symbolic image of individual consciousness to the cinema. Reflecting a broader social matrix of language and power, written dialogue gave voice to the cultural politics endemic<br>

  Abstract: In the early 20th century, movie stars often seemed to offer everything that real men did not. This essay explores how the female cinema audience in Imperial Germany responded to male movie stars and how their emerging movie fandom was linked to the contemporary discourse about nationality, national identity and patriotism during World War I. A telling example for this discussion is the German fan magazine debate about whether or not it was acceptable to “adore” the Norwegian actor Gunnar Tolnaes, who played characters as “foreign” as an Indian maharaja, instead of the German supreme commander, Paul von Hindenburg.<br>

To what extent does it really make sense to talk about French exceptionalism in foreign and defence policy?

It is one of the manifestations of the famous French exception, which is embedded in a historic continuity that begins in the years following the war of 1870 and continues through the Popular Front, the Vichy regime and the Republics since 1947. What began as material and financial support has come to define sport as the state’s field of competence.

  Author(s): Straub Jürgen<br>
  Abstract: A generally acknowledged characteristic of modern life, namely the temporalization of experience, inextricable from our intensified experience of contingency and difference, has until now remained largely outside psychology's purview. Wherever questions about the development, structure, and function of the concept of time have been posed - for example by Piaget and other founders of genetic structuralism - they have been concerned predominantly with concepts of "physical", chronometrical time, and related concepts (e.g., "velocity"). All the contributions to the present volume attempt to close this gap. A larger number are especially interested in the narration of stories. Overviews of the relevant literature, as well as empirical case studies, appear alongside theoretical and methodological reflections. Most contributions refer to specifically historical phenomena and meaning-constructions. Some touch on the subjects of biographical memory and biographical constructions of reality. Of all the various affinities between the contributions collected here, the most important is their consistent attention to issues of the constitution and representation of temporal experience.<br>

  Abstract: Many formalised discourses of the human sciences—such as law, liberal political philosophy and neo-classical economics—work with a notion of the singular human being as a unit that is characterised by its indivisibility, for those reasons also called the individual. An additional assumption about the guiding orientation or behaviour of these units then needs to be introduced to arrive at ways of conceptualising stable collectivities. In the discourses mentioned above, this assumption is basically one of rationality, with specific variations. In liberal political theory, their capacity for rationality leads the individuals to enter into a social contract for their<br>

  Abstract: The cosmologies implicated in sorcery practice are human-centric.

This is particularly true of white liberals who condition their behavior toward blacks on beliefs that strongly condemn traditional discrimination. Second, whites use ostensibly nonracial factors to justify any behavior that may have a disproportionate impact on blacks or could be perceived as being racist. Third, whites harbor attitudes of ambivalence toward blacks resulting in extreme positive or negative reactions. These attitudes<br>

In fact, whites appear to pursue that option so habitually that it may be a defining characteristic of whiteness: to be white is not to think about it.¹ I label the tendency for whiteness to vanish from whites’ self-perception the transparency phenomenon.² Because transparency is such a pervasive fact of whites’ conceptualization of ourselves, we have reason to be skeptical of ostensibly race-neutral decisionmaking by white decisionmakers. I propose that white decisionmakers adopt that deliberate skepticism as well regarding their<br>

  Abstract: A character in Chester Himes’ 1945 novel,
                     If He Hollers Let Him Go, has a “funny thought.” He begins to “wonder when white people started to get white—or rather, when they started losing it.” The narrower question of when new immigrants “started to get white” and of what they lost in doing it has received passionate and varied treatment within African-American thought. That treatment provides the best points of entry to the question of white identity among new immigrants to date.<br>

  Abstract: We Americans have been talking about race for a long time. It is a constant theme in our lives and in our common language.

  Author(s) POLESKY JOELLE E.<br>
  Abstract: Copious news coverage of Ruby Ridge,¹ Waco,² and the Oklahoma City bombing³ has prompted a growing concern with the proliferation of paramilitary organizations and paramilitary activity.⁴ The public’s anxiety is fueled by the belief that private militia pose a threat to society. Private militia are commonly misunderstood and mischaracterized as organizations comprised solely of right-wing militants adhering to Aryan, racist ideology. Although many militia members subscribe to these views, allegiance to the far right is not a prerequisite to membership in a private militia.⁵ Instead, ardent belief in the need to protect individual rights from encroachment by the federal government<br>

  Author(s) FLAGG BARBARA J.<br>
  Abstract: Racial identity is not a central life experience for most white people, because it does not have to be.¹ Like members of any socially dominant group, white people have the option to set aside consciousness of the characteristic that defines the dominant class—in this case, race. Thus whiteness is experienced as racelessness, and personal identity is conceived in a race-neutral manner. However, race plays quite a different role in the lives of people of color in this society. It is, again as a consequence of existing social structures that define and give meaning to racial identity, a central facet<br>

  Author(s) FLAGG BARBARA J.<br>
  Abstract: The most striking characteristic of whites’ consciousness of whiteness is that most of the time we don’t have any. I call this the
                  transparencyphenomenon: the tendency of whites not to think about whiteness, or about norms, behaviors, experiences, or perspectives that are white-specific. Transparency often is the mechanism through which white decisionmakers who disavow white supremacy impose white norms on blacks. [See also Chapters 15, 35, and 97. Ed.] Transparency operates to require black assimilation even when pluralism is the articulated goal; it affords substantial advantages to whites over blacks even when decisionmakers intend to effect substantive racial justice.<br>

  Abstract: It is not a rare phenomenon today to find a concert hall—that bourgeois temple of the cult of Art—filled with religious music. This may not seem surprising, since soon after its invention in the eighteenth century the concert hall became a location for the performance of religious repertoires. The times have changed, however, and the position of religion today can hardly be compared with the one it occupied centuries ago. The presence of religion in classical music performances today is mostly historical in character, such as, for instance, when Handel’s oratorios are played, or Mozart’s

  Book Title: Death's Following: Mediocrity, Dirtiness, Adulthood, Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): LIMON JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Almost all twentieth-century philosophy stresses the immanence of death in human life-as drive (Freud), as the context of Being (Heidegger), as the essence of our defining ethics (Levinas), or as language (de Man, Blanchot). In Death's Following, John Limon makes use of literary analysis (of Sebald, Bernhard, and Stoppard), cultural analysis, and autobiography to argue that death is best conceived as always transcendentally beyond ourselves, neither immanent nor imminent. Adapting Kierkegaard's variations on the theme of Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac while refocusing the emphasis onto Isaac, Limon argues that death should be imagined as if hiding at the end of an inexplicable journey to Moriah. The point is not to evade or ignore death but to conceive it more truly, repulsively, and pervasively in its camouflage: for example, in jokes, in logical puzzles, in bowdlerized folk songs. The first of Limon's two key concepts is adulthood: the prolonged anti-ritual for experiencing the full distance on the look of death. His second is dirtiness, as theorized in a Jewish joke, a logical exemplum, and T. S. Eliot's "Ash Wednesday": In each case, unseen dirt on foreheads suggests the invisibility of inferred death. Not recognizing death immediately or admitting its immanence and imminence is for Heidegger the defining characteristic of the "they," humanity in its inauthentic social escapism. But Limon vouches throughout for the mediocrity of the "they" in its dirty and ludicrous adulthood. Mediocrity is the privileged position for previewing death, in Limon's opinion: practice for being forgotten. In refusing the call of twentieth-century philosophy to face death courageously, Limon urges the ethical and aesthetic value of mediocre anti-heroism.<br>

  Author(s) KATE LAURENS ten<br>
  Abstract: The central characteristic of monotheism may be, not the exclusive acknowledgement of a single God, but something that Jan Assmann recently named the “Mosaic distinction.”¹ This distinction is twofold. According to Assmann, it primarily designates the discordant difference between true and false religion, and between a true and a false God.² Assmann demonstrates how this distinction turned the natural and obvious presence of religion itself into a
                  problem. Religion had to interrogate its truth instead of simply coinciding with it—“being” its own truth—and in this way its presence was no longer guaranteed, nor was that of its God:<br>

  Abstract: Michel Henry pursued throughout his career a remarkable, and remarkably consistent, account of disclosive mood. As a phenomenologist of affectivity, it is no surprise that Henry focused his attention on specific tonalities that reveal a privileged truth. Early in his career Henry emphasized despair as the privileged tonality, but later he dispensed with despair and instead preferred to speak of anxiety. Despite the change in vocabulary, however, in each case his interpretation of what the disclosive mood discloses is the same.¹ Beyond the sort of disclosure characteristic of any ordinary feeling, a disclosive mood, according to Henry, reveals the self<br>

  Book Title: On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy-A Guide for the Unruly<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything,even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.<br>

  Abstract: The Play of the Artwork. Possibly there is a no more unlikely, or maybe even unwanted, commentator on modernism than Hans-Georg Gadamer, a classical philologist, distinguished Plato scholar, and author ofWahrheit und Methode(Truth and Method) (1960), the monumental articulation of philosophical hermeneutics, one of whose central chapters concerns the normative character of the “classical” or “eminent” text. (WM. 269–75/TM. 285–90). Nevertheless, it happens that Gadamer is also an accomplished art historian who thinks that the claim of the modernist work (one of Duchamp’s Readymades, for example) is every bit as compelling as that of the classical<br>

  8  The Concepts of Art and Poetry in Emmanuel Levinas’s Writings from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c84gmm">On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Emmanuel Levinas’s writings are rich in comments and reflections on art, poetry, and the relations between poetry and ethical theory.¹ Of particular importance is the question of language, because there appears to be a kind of symmetry between language as an ethical relation and the language of poetry, both of which expose us to regions of subjectivity or existence on the hither (anarchic) side of cognition and being. The ethical and the poetic are evidently species of saying (
                  le Dire) in contrast to the propositional character of the said (le Dit), yet neither one is translatable into the other, and<br>

                  History of the Rebellion.¹ Reflecting on the struggle for power between Cromwell and the Presbyterians in 1647, after the imprisonment of Charles I in Carisbrooke Castle, Clarendon described Cromwell with a characteristic mixture of appreciation and biting irony. In Clarendon’s judgment, Cromwell was a true Machiavellian: a brilliant tactician who was governed by considerations of necessity rather than morality, and who did not hesitate to use force and fraud to serve his purposes.

That earlier landscape in turn bore the traces of yet earlier peoples’ ways of shaping and using the land.

  Abstract: With the preponderance of visual imagery in our late modern period, why is it the literary Satan keeps emerging? And what can the literary figure of Satan contribute to the understanding of evil? Eva Marta Baillie argues that the literary is the only means by which Satan can survive, and that as a result of the changing literary (and cultural, philosophical, and theological) landscape and our changing perceptions of evil as we move into the twenty-first century, the satanic character must also change.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4ks4">Facing the Fiend</a><br>
  Abstract: The character of Satan is problematic; he is the “weak place of the popular religion, the vulnerable belly of the crocodile.”¹ Current popular culture makes Satan a subject of its attention. Films featuring the devil are successful blockbusters, books on the occult sell well, and Satan appears in various music genres, ranging from American folk to heavy metal. Outside popular culture, however, and in particular in the theological discourse, there is little “Sympathy for the Devil.”² The idea of Satan cannot be adequately expressed and discussed in terms of theology. The Christian system of monotheism does not allow a systematic<br>

  one  Is Satan Evil? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4ks4">Facing the Fiend</a><br>
  Abstract: Understanding Satan as a character requires the introduction of a
                  contextin which the character operates. Our search for Satan’s dwelling place takes us to different areas of definition and interpretation, but the most fundamental question at this point is the relationship between Satan and evil. The question of whether the character of Satan is evil or not cannot be answered readily, since the problem is twofold: like any character, Satan has many layers and describing him as evil is an over-simplification. At the same time, the abstract concept of evil depends on contextual circumstances. The best approach seems the<br>

  Abstract: As we have seen in the discussion of his biography, Satan is a paradoxical figure, showing contradictory characteristics and constantly evading definition. In this section, I explore how different satanic characters in literature represent manifestations of evil, in conjunction with the theological concepts of theodicy and theological discussions of evil. I refer to it as a literary exploration of postmodern or contemporary thoughts on evil in philosophy and theology. We have seen now how Satan is a literary figure and finds his

  Abstract: The story of the possessed from Gadara is popular in art and fiction, in particular the demon’s claim, “for we are many.”² It implies not only the possible diversity of the satanic character, but also the power that stands behind him. The different characters discussed in this work are only a very small aspect of the satanic figure, but they were chosen to highlight the ambiguity of Satan’s nature and to express the diversity of his appearance in the story. The origins of Satan lay, as we have seen, in his function as the stumbling block and the adversary, he<br>

  Abstract: Charles Wesley (1707–1788), John’s younger brother, was Methodism’s unofficial poet laureate. By the most conservative reckoning, Charles penned some 6,500 hymns, perhaps hundreds more sacred poems,¹ many of which propelled Methodist worship and evangelism in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. More controversial is whether Wesley’s hymns² are “theological works” as such.³ Less debated—only for being more neglected—are the character and quality of biblical exegesis in Wesley’s poetry. This chapter attempts some soundings of that subject.<br>

  Book Title: The Scarlet Woman and the Red Hand-Evangelical Apocalyptic Belief in the Northern Ireland Troubles<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Searle Joshua T.<br>
  Abstract: This book provides a comprehensive description of how evangelicals in Northern Ireland interpreted the "Troubles" (1966-2007) in the light of how they read the Bible. The rich and diverse landscape of Northern Irish evangelicalism during the "Troubles" is ideally suited to this study of both the light and dark sides of apocalyptic eschatology. Searle demonstrates how the notion of apocalypse shaped evangelical and fundamentalist interpretations of the turbulent events that characterized this dark yet fascinating period in the history of Northern Ireland. The book uses this case study to offer a timely reflection on some of the most pressing issues in contemporary negotiations between culture and religion. Given the current resurgence of religious fundamentalism in the wake of 9/11, together with popular conceptions of a "clash of civilizations" and the so-called War on Terror, this book is not only an engaging academic study; it also resonates with some of the defining cultural issues of our time.<br>

  Book Title: Life in the Spirit-A Post-Constantinian and Trinitarian Account of the Christian Life<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): snavely Andréa D.<br>
  Abstract: Christians are united in saying that the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. But the unity breaks down when explaining how the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. Life in the Spirit is the first book to engage the post-Constantinian critique of the church with the field of Spirit Christology. Building upon the work of post-Constantinians John Howard Yoder and Stanley Hauerwas and upon the Trinitarian Spirit-Christology of Leopoldo Sánchez, this account provides a framework for seeing one’s Christian life as one transformed by the Spirit. Snavely rejects the characterisation of life in the Spirit as bringing sinners to faith, and instead proposes that as Jesus lived as the Son of the Father in the Spirit, the Spirit also makes other sons of the father in the image of Jesus. This Trinitarian interpretation shows the Christian life as being one of total trust in God with one’s own life, and after death living in Jesus’ resurrected life in the Spirit. Snavely’s account calls for a reimagining of the church and the Christian life in terms of ecclesial structure, Christian discipleship and the Christian view of marriage. Life in the Spirit will not only help Christians to have a better understanding of the place of vocation in the world as witnesses to the lordship of Jesus Christ, but it will also promote unity in the body of Christ based on the actual unity that all his adopted sons and daughters already have by belonging to Jesus Christ’s life in the Spirit.<br>

  5  Consuming: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf2fr">The Scandal of Sacramentality</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter, we examined the traces of sacramentality in the broken, fractured body of Christ and the bodies of characters in contemporary literature. In this chapter, we will focus on the

  8  Lutheran Spiritual Theology in a Post-Christian Society from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf32j">Justification in a Post-Christian Society</a><br>
  Author(s) JOHANNESSON KARIN<br>
  Abstract: Many scholars studying how religious faith develops around the world today emphasize one important transition. Linda Woodhead and Paul Heelas, following the philosopher Charles Taylor, characterize this ongoing transformation as a spiritual revolution.¹ It reveals itself,
                     inter alia, as a growing interest in a multifaceted variety of activities associated with various religious traditions that have one important thing in common. They have traditionally been conceptualized as spiritual training since they have been assumed to contribute to a more flourishing relationship with God or a deeper contact with a spiritual reality. Yoga, pilgrimages, and meditation are examples of such undertakings.<br>

  Book Title: Reading Daniel as a Text in Theological Hermeneutics-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hebbard Aaron B.<br>
  Abstract: Reading Daniel as a Text in Theological Hermeneutics sets out to read the book of Daniel as a narrative textbook in the field of theological hermeneutics. Employing such disciplines as historical criticism, literary criticism, narrative theology, and hermeneutics, this work seeks to maintain an interdisciplinary outlook on the book of Daniel. Two inherently linked perspectives are utilized in this reading of Daniel. First is the perception that the character of Daniel is the paradigm of the good theological hermeneut; theology and hermeneutics are inseparable and converge in the character of Daniel. Readers must recognize in Daniel certain qualities, attitudes, abilities, and convictions well worth emulating. Essentially, readers must aspire to become a Daniel. Second is the standpoint that the book of Daniel on the whole should be read as a hermeneutics textbook. Readers are led through a series of theories and exercises meant to be instilled into their theological, intellectual, and practical lives. Attention to readers is a constant endeavor throughout this thesis. The concern is fundamentally upon contemporary readers and their communities, yet with sensible consideration given to the historical readerly community with which contemporary readers find continuity. Greater concentration is placed on what the book of Daniel means for contemporary readers than on what the book of Daniel meant in its historical setting. In the end, readers are left with difficult challenges, a sobering awareness of the volatility of the business of hermeneutics, and serious implications for readers to implement both theologically and hermeneutically.<br>

  Abstract: Chapter 1 Described The distinctive characteristics of Moltmann’s theology of hope and the subsequent construction of Moltmannian hope. Chapter 2 examined some of the costs of an exclusive reliance on a Moltmannian theology of hope. This chapter considers the theology of hope presented by Aquinas that Moltmannian hope misunderstands and dismisses,¹ in order to recover some resources for contemporary theological hope. Chapter 4 will investigate resources from discourses not often considered in conversations about theological hope.<br>

  Chapter Two  Challenging the Holy Marriage: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf395">Translating the English Bible</a><br>
  Abstract: Relevance Theory is a development of communication theory springing from Paul Grice’s notion that there must be a ‘Co-operative Principle’ at work in conversation. This principle underwrites Maxims of Conversation underlying our ability to communicate. One of these, the so-called Maxim of Relation, simply specifies this: Be Relevant. Grice observed that speakers in conversation seem to observe this maxim, both in speaking and in interpreting, and that it is this ‘unspoken agreement’ which allows communication to take place, despite the indeterminacy of reference which is characteristic of language. Two linguists, Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson picked up this ball in<br>

  Book Title: The Fate of Saul's Progeny in the Reign of David-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Longman Tremper<br>
  Abstract: Cephas Tushima provides a thorough analysis of the fate of Saul's heirs, focussing on whether their tragedies were due to continuing divine retribution, coincidence, or Davidic orchestration. He concludes that David was unjust and calculating in his dealings with the Saulides and, like other Near Eastern usurpers, perpetrated heinous injustices against the vanquished house of Saul. Traditionally readers saw Saul as evil and David as a hero; but more recently scholars have written about Saul as a tragic character and David as a villain, turning the book of Samuel into deeply contested interpretive territory. Tushima provides analysis of the critical literature surrounding this contentious issue and contributes his own study that will prove important to the continuing debate. He assesses David's character by analysing how he treats the surviving children of his predecessor, drawing upon the provisions for justice in the covenant community in the book of Deuteronomy. He demonstrates a connection between Samuel and the Torah through themes and motifs, and develops theological conclusions from them on such issues as the impact of human conduct on the environment, marriage, monarchy and Zion theology.<br>

  Foreword from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf3qc">The Fate of Saul's Progeny in the Reign of David</a><br>
  Author(s) Gundry Robert H.<br>
  Abstract: The story of Saul and David is vivid and compelling drawing the reader into a narrative of gripping action and complex characters. Typical of the best hebrew narrative, the narrator of the Saul and David story rarely reveals the motivations of characters and even more sparingly provides moral evaluation of its characters’ actions, preferring a strategy of showing rather than telling the story. Readers are expected to enter into the story with their imagination and to do their own evaluations.<br>

  Book Title: Onslaught against Innocence-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): LaCocque André<br>
  Abstract: While in Genesis 2-11 the Yahwist confronts the issue of evil through a sequence of stories on the progressive deterioration of the divine-human relationship, in Genesis 4 he describes the initial slaughter of one human being by another as fratricidal. This book provides a close reading of J's story by using literary criticism and psychological criticism, and shows that the biblical author has more than an "archaeological" design. His characters - including God, Adam, Eve, Cain, and Abel, plus minor character - are paradigmatic, as they allow J to proceed with a fine analytical feel for the nature of evil as performed by "homo" as "homini lupus." No imaginative "mimesis" of evil has ever been recounted with such an economy of means and such depth of psychological insight.<br>

  Abstract: Christian theology, which is discourse about God and things related to God, and divine revelation, which is discourse about God’s self-disclosures from individuals and communities that have come to believe them, possess two distinguishing characteristics: 1) both discourses, almost without exception, are proclamatory and certain, made in the assertive mode;² and 2) both discourses tend to become systematic in nature, due to a joining of faith assertions with philosophic inquiry.<br>

It was because of its contamination by various intellectual heresies, old and new, that often this justificatory practice rather than letting the discourse flow beyond itself, tended to lead it into the fortress of a regulatory concept, practice or institution or a contingent or illusory foundation.

  Abstract: When I am in the company of New Testament colleagues they ask what I, as a patrologist, think of Douglas Campbell’s invocation of Athanasius and Arius to characterize the difference between his and previous readings of Romans. In their voice I detect a hint of skepticism. After all, they think of “Athanasian” and “Arian” as theological categories—markers for competing views of the trinity or Christology. What do Arius and Athanasius have to do with issues of theological method or participatory Soteriology that are at the heart of Campbell’s assessment of Romans? This skepticism is understandable given the way the<br>

This short chapter will argue that righteousness, faith, and loyalty are three central aspects of the Matthean Jesus’ teaching in relation to discipleship. It is therefore significant that these themes first appear in the stories of Tamar (righteousness), Rahab (faith and loyalty), and Ruth (loyalty). The naming of Tamar, Rahab, and Ruth in the genealogy highlights and anticipates the importance of these<br>

By no means do I pretend, with my identification of these formal characteristics, exhaustively to analyze this occasion for divine suffering. I only examine here the broad contours of the factors that structure the beloved human’s infidelity, those structural characteristics of human sin that figure most prominently as features of the occasion for the first divine wound.

  Abstract: Human life as
                  cupiditas, or human sin as the creaturely occasion for divine grief, also exhibits several material characteristics. The disruption among, and the re-ordering of, both the dimensions of human love and the sequentiality of the subjects in the love-relationships determine the material characteristics of sin. When the human lives ascupiditas, or when the human falsely actualizes theimitatio Dei, then the human disorders both the dimensions and the subjects of its love. As I stated in the first volume of this study, the sequentiality of human love refers to the order among the subjects of love, while<br>

  Abstract: In Christian attestations to
                  divine self-sacrifice, the predicament of the beloved human occasions this second mode of divine suffering as well. Strictly considered, however, both the beloved human’s infidelity (human sin) and the misery of the beloved human’s infidelity (the consequences of human sin) comprise the occasion for divine selfsacrifice. Neither sin nor its consequences ever appear isolated from one another, cannot even occur apart from one another. For this reason, previously, I examined as one formal characteristic of human sin the indissoluble bond between sin and its consequences. Nevertheless, the Christian symbol of divine suffering distinguishes these two aspects<br>

When the human lives ascupiditas, or when the human falsely actualizes theimitatio Dei, then the human disorders both the dimensions and the subjects of its love. As I stated in the first volume of this study, the sequentiality of human love refers to the order among the subjects of love, while<br>

  3  Divine Sorrow: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf8fn">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter identifies and examines the formal characteristics that structure divine sorrow.¹ Several questions immediately arise concerning the interaction among the characteristics of this symbol’s two presuppositions² with reference to the characteristics of human sin in division one of the present volume of studies. (1) What is the relationship between divine vulnerability and this passive stage of divine grief? (2) To which operation or role of the Christian God does the symbol of divine sorrow refer? (3) Toward which subjects does divine sorrow direct itself or with which subjects does God concern the divine self in God’s sorrow? (4) What<br>

  4  Divine Sorrow: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf8fn">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: Throughout my previous analysis of the formal characteristics of divine sorrow, various aspects of divine
                  caritashave repeatedly surfaced. In this chapter, then, I will draw together the major strands of those dimensions in divinecaritasthat have emerged in divine sorrow. The three dimensions (philial, agapic, and erotic) of divine love, as expressed in the passive stage of divine grief, constitute the material characteristics of divine sorrow. While all three dimensions of divinecaritasoperate in divine sorrow, the erotic dimension predominates in this mode of divine suffering. Moreover, for this symbol, God actualizes each material characteristic of divine<br>

  Abstract: I will inquire into the formal characteristics of the second stage in divine grief through questions that resemble those questions with which I have already examined the first, more passive, stage of this symbol. Again, these questions will also reappear in the following studies of this symbol. (1) What is the relationship between divine vulnerability and the active stage of divine grief? (2) To which divine role or operation does the symbol of divine anguish primarily refer? (3) Toward which subjects does divine anguish direct itself or which subjects concern God in divine anguish?

  Introduction to Division Four: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf8fn">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: In Christian attestations to
                  divine self-sacrifice, the predicament of the beloved human occasions this second mode of divine suffering as well. Strictly considered, however, both the beloved human’s infidelity (human sin) and the misery of the beloved human’s infidelity (the consequences of human sin) comprise the occasion for divine selfsacrifice. Neither sin nor its consequences ever appear isolated from one another, cannot even occur apart from one another. For this reason, previously, I examined as one formal characteristic of human sin the indissoluble bond between sin and its consequences. Nevertheless, the Christian symbol of divine suffering distinguishes these two aspects<br>

  7  Misery of Human Cupiditas: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf8fn">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: The formal characteristics of human misery certainly include those initial consequences of human infidelity to God that I briefly described in chapter 1: guilt (
                  culpa), self-enslavement to selfdeification or life against God (servum arbitrium), and sinful social fatedness or subjugation to a world of sin (peccatum originale). For the purposes of this chapter, however, first, I will more fully develop from chapter 1 only my interpretation of the second consequence, since it forms the taproot from which the other formal characteristics of human misery grow. Nonetheless, the second formal characteristic of human misery, human self-destruction, also stems from the central<br>

  8  Misery of Human Cupiditas: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf8fn">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: Just as the formal characteristics of human misery depended upon and extended the formal characteristics of human sin from chapter 1, so too the material characteristics of human misery depend upon and extend the basic quality of the material characteristics of the beloved human’s infidelity that I analyzed in chapter 2. The inescapability and conflicts that constitute the misery of human infidelity, however, intensify the disruption and re-ordering of human life as
                  cupiditas, both in the dimensions of human love and in the sequentiality of subjects within the relationships of love. In the exposition that follows, I will not repeat<br>

  Abstract: In my study of the first stage of divine self-sacrifice, or divine travail, I commence with an analysis of the formal characteristics in this moment of divine suffering as I have done previously. Those questions with which I formerly isolated and examined the principal formal characteristics of the first divine wound function similarly here with respect to divine travail. (1) What is the relationship between divine vulnerability and activity in the first stage of divine self-sacrifice? (2) To which divine role or operation does the symbol of divine travail refer?

  10  Divine Travail: from:

  Abstract: In divine travail, the operations and interactions of the three dimensions of divine
                  caritasproduce divine travail’s material character, but involve even greater complexity than in the two stages of the previous divine wound, principally due to the self-externalization or self-concentration of the divine presence within the creation, through God’s becoming-human as Jesus of Nazareth. Strictly speaking, then, I should examine divine travail by combining analyses that followboththe pattern of my analyses of human life as love in terms ofcaritasandcupiditas andthe pattern of my previous analyses of divine life as love.¹ While aspects of<br>

  Abstract: I initiate this analysis of divine agony, as I have in each interpretation of the previous stages in divine suffering, with an exposition of the formal character of divine agony. Furthermore, once again, I submit the same four principal questions to this stage in the Christian symbol of divine suffering, the answers to which yield the formal character or structure of divine agony. (1) What is the relationship between divine vulnerability and this more passive stage of divine self-sacrifice? (2) To which operation or role in the divine life does the symbol of divine agony refer? (3) Toward which subjects<br>

  12  Divine Agony: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf8fn">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: As the second stage of divine self-sacrifice, the material character of divine agony closely resembles the material character of divine travail. God has lost the equilibrium between the agapic and erotic dimensions of divine love in divine travail, however, as divine travail progressed into divine agony. Although God’s erotic
                  caritascontinues to motivate divine agapiccaritastoward the divine philial goal, during the human’s victimization of the divine lover, the human disequilibrates the operations between these two dimensions of love in divine life. Consequently, the agapic dimension of divine love, with its predominantly self-sacrifi-cial character, assumes the leading role in<br>

  Abstract: What shapes and characterizes Luther’s ecclesiology is his theology of Word and Sacraments. In this chapter we meet Luther’s eucharistic theology in relation to Roman Catholic teaching. Luther’s theology of the Lord’s Supper, when seen in a time-related and eschatological dimension, will engage the spirituality of ancestral rites that has been controversial until the present in Asian churches and theologies. Would it be possible to deepen Luther’s theology of the Lord’s Supper in terms of his keen insight into Jesus’ descent into hell?

  Afterword: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf98j">Martin Luther and Buddhism</a><br>
  Abstract: Luther’s theological aesthetics of God’s glory in Christ’s suffering love lays a basis for reshaping and redirecting motives of Asian post-confessional theology toward a different understanding and transformation of Luther. When Luther encounters a postmodern context, he can best be understood by challenging and transcending him. His doctrine of justification, theology of the cross, Trinity, law and gospel, eucharistic theology, and two kingdoms theory among others are seen at the point of the death, resurrection and reconciliation of the crucified Christ, the scope and reach of which is of inclusive, universal character allowing and tolerating other ways.

  CHAPTER ONE  Theological Ethics in Transition from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf9s9">Christian Ethics as Witness</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter looks at the conversation between theology and ethics in its historical transition from modernity to postmodernity. The first part of the chapter discusses how the relationship of theology and ethics leads to an inherent tension within the strategies of theological and Christian ethics. The second part provides a general summary of the characteristics of modernity and its affect on modern theological ethics, with particular references to Rene Descartes, Immanuel Kant, and Friedrich Schleiermacher. Two of the most important characteristics of modern theology and ethics are the emphasis on

  CHAPTER FIVE  From Modern to Postmodern Ethics from:

  Abstract: This chapter shifts our focus from social theory to ethical philosophy, showing how it too has been shaped by the transition from modernity to postmodernity. In chapters 1–2, we introduced this theological transition by looking at the shift from Kant and Schleiermacher to Barth. In the last chapter, we discussed characteristics of postmodernity as understood within current social theory, and concluded that social theory, by itself, cannot provide an answer to the problem of moral epistemology in social ethics. Although social theory makes positive contributions to our understanding of the social world we inhabit, it fails to provide a<br>

  VI.  Gift’s Unifying Memory from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf9tt">Gift and the Unity of Being</a><br>
  Abstract: Our attempt to understand the unity of being in terms of gift so far has brought to light the primal character of gift. Gift is a primal, a principle, inasmuch as it is a permanent source. The positivity of concrete singular beings suggested by originary experience rests on the permanent, personal principle of originating and ordering, a Father whose face we are invited to see in his beloved, Incarnate Son. Gift is also a primal because it indicates “first-ness.” According to this second sense of “primal,” being’s primordial unity is an ever-new beginning. Each concrete singular being is created; it<br>

  Author(s) Zimmermann Jens<br>
  Abstract: John de Gruchy’s work, both in his essay in this volume and in previous publications,¹ already suggests that Bonhoeffer’s theology is best characterized as a Christian humanism. De Gruchy seeks to recover Christian humanism as an alternative cultural stance to scientific fundamentalism on the one hand and to religious fundamentalism on the other,² especially when the latter conflates religion and nationalism.³ Let me say from the outset that I fundamentally agree with de Gruchy’s desire to affirm a humanist identity for Christians and that Bonhoeffer is indeed a rich resource for doing so.

  Author(s) Green Clifford J.<br>
  Abstract: A striking phenomenon of the vast secondary literature about Dietrich Bonhoeffer is that so little of it tries to address his theology as a whole. What are its fundamental patterns of thought? What are their enduring characteristics? What are new developments? What drives its movement? When we look at Bonhoeffer’s older contemporaries in Protestant theology in the twentieth century—Barth and Tillich, for example—there is a fairly broad consensus about their work read as a whole. There is no such consensus about Bonhoeffer. Indeed, while early interpreters were bold to advance theses about the nature of Bonhoeffer’s theology as<br>

  3  Hypothetical Structure of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbxv">God's Wounds</a><br>
  Abstract: On the basis of my previous preparatory steps, this chapter supplies a third, briefer, and final orientation for interaction with the Christian symbol of divine suffering. In one sense, this chapter initiates that interaction, since it provides a hypothetical overview of the symbol’s structure.

  Abstract: This chapter constitutes the first stage in my analyses of the first presupposition of the Christian symbol of divine suffering. I repeat my formulation of this presupposition:
                  The God whose life is love limits the divine self in God’s creative activity; or, as the creator who is love, God limits the divine self as God creates. This first stage of my analysis works on the basis of an abstraction of divine life or being from divine activity, in order to clarify the characteristic ways in which this symbol envisions the actualization of divine love in divine creative activity.

  5  Sociocritical Dialectics in the Shift from Alienation to Emancipation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbzc">Church and Ethical Responsibility in the Midst of World Economy</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter is a study of the limitations and contributions of Karl Marx in the economic field. I shall deal with basic elements in Marx’s political economy and his method of historical materialism in reference to Hegel, because Marx’s thought cannot be properly understood without Hegel’s concept of labor and alienation in civil society. Marx’s critique of religion implies his negative evaluation of the role of church mission in the domestic-economic context, as well as in the colonial context. As we have previously seen, Marx’s critique of mission and colonialism and his analysis of the Christian character of capital accumulation<br>

  Abstract: Mentoring is generally understood as a relationship between two people aimed at enabling a wide range of learning, experimentation, and development. Although mentoring is becoming increasingly recognized as a significant aspect of both personal and professional development today, the mentoring-type relationship has existed in all of human history. This is well exemplified in the characters of Mentor and his mentee, Telemachus, in the ancient Greek story of
                  The Odyssey(Daloz, 1999, p. 17). In the past 25 years, there has been an increase in the use of formal mentoring programs in the workplace as well as in academic and professional<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ch7988">Red, White, and Blue</a><br>
  Abstract: Many of the criticisms developed in Part I are familiar to constitutional scholars. The presentation here is distinctive only because it accepts
                  allthe familiar criticisms. This skepticism about “the rule of law” characterizes Legal Realism, a school of thought from which my arguments are descended. The first section of this chapter describes Legal Realism’s attack on the theory of the rule of law at the heart of the liberal tradition and introduces a discussion of some jurisprudential responses to the Realist challenge. The second section examines a recent development in constitutional theory—structural review—that is another heir to<br>

  Abstract: The aim of this book is to present the main ideas of
                  Being and Time,Heidegger’s most important philosophical work, in a clear and accessible manner. In so doing, the book also strives to correct certain fundamental misconceptions of Heidegger’s thought, including the mischaracterization of Heidegger as an “existentialist.” No one could plausibly deny thatBeing and Timeis a dense and difficult philosophical treatise. Its stylistic flaws, even in the original German, are too obvious to excuse. Nevertheless it is equally undeniable thatBeing and Timeis an original, systematic, and epoch-making philosophical work. Without a doubt it was<br>

  Abstract: It is an old Canadian political impulse to seek reconciliation between apparent opposites both at the levels of political philosophy and practice. Perhaps a legacy of the historic agreement that brought together in a single nation cultures as diverse as the English, the French, and an assortment of aboriginal peoples, the practice of seeking political consensus through compromise—sometimes at the expense of principle—has long been the norm in Canadian political culture. Conciliation, accommodation, and

  Abstract: When Simon Darcourt calls Francis Cornish a “true son of Hermes” early in
                  What’s Bred in the Bone, he provides a hermeneutic “skeleton key” both to meaning in the novel and to a comprehension of Davies’ sense of self as moral fictionist.¹ The figure of Hermes organizes and gives meaning to the novel’s many uses of artifice and invention, even as the hermeneutic notion of “horizon(s) of expectation” enables a recognition of the didactic component of Davies’ fiction. Reference to devices such as retouched photos, player pianos, stories and lies that characters tell each other, and, especially, art restoration help<br>

  Abstract: Arguably one of the most difficult tasks of philosophy is to grasp where we are today. While undoubtedly this has something to do with the usual biases of the day, in that philosophers are as surely bound by mundane prejudices as everyone else, it also seems to derive from a factor peculiar to philosophy. It is no accident that philosophers have long dealt with the question of the good life. Philosophers have always wanted to leave the cave. Whether or not one fashions the departure in grand metaphysical terms, one can maintain, with fairly adequate justification, that a defining characteristic<br>

  Abstract: Berry’s first interest was cultural history, a designation he gave his own work and which remained significant. While on occasion he showed his awareness of political and social influences on the topic under discussion, it is clear throughout his work that his predominant focus was the influence of ideas and intellectual/spiritual movements in history.

  Author(s) North Wendy E. S.<br>
  Abstract: We may never know who the Fourth Evangelist was, but there is no mistaking the distinctiveness of his contribution to the New Testament witness to the life of Jesus of Nazareth. From the slow-moving, authoritarian Greek style, the cosmic scale of the setting, and the theological self-awareness of the central character, to the layering of irony, the often blistering polemic, and the ever-present parentheses to guide his readers, we know him well enough, do we not? In other words, we are aware that what dominates this account from beginning to end is the powerful and creative mind of its author.<br>

  Abstract: In November 2009, somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean on a flight to Dallas International Airport, I found myself having a conversation with a fellow passenger. She was returning home from Northern Sudan, where she had been working for an aid organization. She told me about the profound restrictions on the freedom of women to participate in any form of public life that for her characterized life in Sudan. She also, without noting the irony, told me about her work, which involved leading project teams and advocacy, including liaising with local political leaders.

  Author(s) Anderson Paul N.<br>
  Abstract: The words of Jesus pose the greatest challenge to scholars seeking to identify the message of Jesus within his ministry. If the historical Jesus indeed spoke in parables about the kingdom of God—a near-certain likelihood—why does John’s narrative include no Synoptic-like parables, and why is the kingdom of God mentioned only in John 3:3,5? There Jesus declares access to the kingdom requires being born from above, and in John 18:36–37 he describes the character of his kingdom as one of truth; but unlike the teachings of the Synoptic Jesus, John’s kingdom sayings are contrastive statements (the kingdom<br>

  Author(s) Borgen Peder<br>
  Abstract: The Gospel of John is the product of expository activity. The most important components are the life of Jesus and the scriptures, transmitted as traditions and subject to applications and other forms of interpretation. The expository activity followed certain methods. Thus a dynamic process was at work, so that the metaphor of “biology” seems more adequate than the metaphor of “anatomy” (Culpepper 1983) as a descriptor for the Fourth Gospel’s character and structure.<br>

The issues include: (1) whether the lateninteenth century judgment that John’s Gospel was too different from the Synoptic Gospels to be counted as a historical source for Jesus should be wholly discounted or discounted in significant degree; and (2) whether, despite these differences, the character and details regarding Jesus of Nazareth still shine through John’s Gospel with sufficient clarity to substantiate, qualify, or add to whatever picture of Jesus is<br>

  CHAPTER FIFTEEN  Moderating the Magnanimous Man: from:

  Author(s) GUERRA MARC D.<br>
  Abstract: In a still-influential book published sixty-three years ago, Harry Jaffa argued that St. Thomas Aquinas “mistakes Aristotle’s intention,” and for that reason Thomas endeavors to “save” the character of the
                  Nicomachean Ethic’s magnanimous man “in accordance with what Thomas evidently considers a higher standard of perfection.”¹ The higher standard of perfection Jaffa has in mind is “Christian ethics,” as revealed in an epigram from Winston Churchill that Jaffa uses to open his book: “It is baffling to reflect that what men call honor does not correspond always to Christian ethics.” Jaffa’s argument is not simply that Aristotle’s account of the<br>

  VAMPIROS MEXICANOS from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1d2dq9t">Vampires and Zombies</a><br>
  Author(s) BORGIA DANIELLE<br>
  Abstract: Since the early nineteenth century, vampire literature has been an accepted way to introduce transgressive representations of sexualities into the cultural imagination of the Western world. The earliest English-language vampire tales expand on the folk legend of the
                  vardoulachafrom Eastern Europe (specifically Romania, Hungary, and Greece), starting with John Polidori’s “The Vampyre” of 1819 featuring the malevolent Lord Ruthven. These sexual transgressions are symbolized by the heightened emotion of fear and disgust with which the human characters regard the vampire protagonists’ pleasure in the murders of their victims. As Nina Auerbach, Talia Schaffer, and others have demonstrated, the fictional<br>

  Abstract: Rory Block, the great blues singer, poses the question of evil in her wonderful song, “Faithless World.”¹ In her characteristic way, she evokes the poignancy of suffering, leaving the question of meaning visceral and open. She identifies us as “travelers” in this place of “many wonders” and “tears.” Her hard road has taught her that suffering is not punishment but rather a task given to the “enlightened,” a “lesson to be learned,” which each individual must learn for themselves.

  Abstract: Rowner offers a new method of thinking about the particular characteristics of the event within literary works and defines the creative value of literature as the aspiration toward
      the un-happening within the happening. In this study the experience of literature-as an act of both writing and reading-becomes the struggle to capture the excessive movement of the event while also revealing the creative energy within that work of literature.<br>

  Book Title: Ethos and Narrative Interpretation-The Negotiation of Values in Fiction<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): Herman David<br>
  Abstract: Ethos and Narrative Interpretationexamines the fruitfulness of the concept of ethos for the theory and analysis of literary narrative. The notion of ethos refers to the broadly persuasive effects of the image one may have of a speaker's psychology, world view, and emotional or ethical stance. How and why do readers attribute an ethos (of, for example, sincerity, reliability, authority, or irony) to literary characters, narrators, and even to authors? Are there particular conditions under which it is more appropriate for interpreters to attribute an ethos to authors, rather than to narrators? In the answer Liesbeth Korthals Altes proposes to such questions, ethos attributions are deeply implicated in the process of interpreting and evaluating narrative texts.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1d9nmkj">Anthropologists and Their Traditions across National Borders</a><br>
  Author(s) DARNELL REGNA<br>
  Abstract: Structuralism, whatever that term may mean over a decade into the twenty-first century, is overdue for reassessment. The death of Claude Lévi-Strauss in 2009 provides the obligation as well as the opportunity to engage in such an exercise of historical retrospect. Lévi-Strauss moved with characteristic creative aplomb across a remarkable range of potential disciplinary homes, but anthropology remained his home base, the place of comfort from which to discomfit other disciplines. The history of anthropology therefore has a particular claim to the movement he founded and popularized beyond its origins in Saussurean linguistics despite the fact that French structuralism has<br>

  Abstract: By examining how some of our best fiction writers have taken up the challenge of film, television, video games, and hypertext, Daniel Punday offers an enlightening look into the current status of such fundamental narrative concepts as character, plot, and setting. He considers well-known postmodernists like Thomas Pynchon and Robert Coover, more-accessible authors like Maxine Hong Kingston and Oscar Hijuelos, and unjustly overlooked writers like Susan Daitch and Kenneth Gangemi, and asks how their works investigate the nature and limits of print as a medium for storytelling.<br>

  Abstract: In this book, I have offered an unlikely image of the novel within the contemporary media ecology. We would expect that media would create a sense of connection to social and cultural forms by reaching out to describe larger media systems directly. Instead, what we have seen is that the contemporary media novel emphasizes quite the opposite: the limits of writing. Instead of isolating novelists, characters, and readers, those limits are precisely what allow them to be aware of the world beyond themselves. In emphasizing media limits, these writers are able to embrace an agency that comes from being an<br>

  Abstract: Applying a cognitive approach to reading comics in all their narrative richness and intricacy,
      Contemporary Comics Storytellingopens an intriguing perspective on how these works engage the legacy of postmodernism-its subversion, self-reflexivity, and moral contingency. Its three case studies trace how contemporary comics tie into deep traditions of visual and verbal storytelling, how they reevaluate their own status as fiction, and how the fictional minds of their characters generate complex ethical thought experiments. At a time when the medium is taken more and more seriously as intricate and compelling literary art, this book lays the groundwork for an analysis of the ways in which comics challenge and engage readers' minds. It brings together comics studies with narratology and literary criticism and, in so doing, provides a new set of tools for evaluating the graphic novel as an emergent literary form.<br>

Born in 1953 in German-speaking Nitzkydorf—a Banat-Swabian village in southwestern Romania—Müller grew up as part of a linguistic and ethnic minority in a Communist state. Her writing career began with a fictionalized portrayal of the village of her childhood, an isolated backward community deeply influenced by National Socialism and characterized by narrow-minded ethnocentrism.

Müller is without question a political author whose writing describes and indicts the mechanisms of surveillance and oppression and their effects on people. Harassment and surveillance by the authorities and secret police of the Romanian dictatorship frequently mark the day-to-day life of her protagonists.

  Abstract: Cuban slavery impacted early American capitalism through Russia. In the early nineteenth century, as the U.S.–West Indies trade increasingly centered on the Spanish colony of Cuba, a small nexus of elite Americans—particularly New Englanders—became owners of Cuban plantations.¹ Intensive American participation in the Cuban slave regime both reinforces and complicates scholars’ recognition of slavery as a national rather than sectional bedrock of U.S. state formation. When convenient or profitable, the character of U.S. slavery was also transnational.² At the very moment of the continued expansion of the North American plantation frontier and the formation of the U.S.<br>

Hans in Schnockeloch has all that he wants.”¹ A pro-German, pro-Nazi folklorist, Karl Roos, popularized this piece of doggerel during the 1920s as part of an anti-French movement.² The expression of ambivalence—simultaneously desiring inclusion and chafing at external control—aptly characterizes Alsatian identity throughout the 1920s, 1930s, and into World War II.<br>

  Book Title: Writing and Materiality in China-Essays in Honor of Patrick Hanan<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Widmer Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Speaking about Chinese writing entails thinking about how writing speaks through various media. In the guises of the written character and its imprints, traces, or ruins, writing is more than textuality. The goal of this volume is to consider the relationship of writing to materiality in China’s literary history and to ponder the physical aspects of the production and circulation of writing. To speak of the thing-ness of writing is to understand it as a thing in constant motion, transported from one place or time to another, one genre or medium to another, one person or public to another. Thinking about writing as the material product of a culture shifts the emphasis from the author as the creator and ultimate arbiter of a text’s meaning to the editors, publishers, collectors, and readers through whose hands a text is reshaped, disseminated, and given new meanings. By yoking writing and materiality, the contributors to this volume aim to bypass the tendency to oppose form and content, words and things, documents and artifacts, to rethink key issues in the interpretation of Chinese literary and visual culture.<br>

  Abstract: Speaking about writing, especially Chinese writing, entails thinking about the ways in which writing speaks to us through a variety of media and forms. Whether it be a consideration of the written character or its imprints, traces, or ruins, writing always appears in its multifarious guises to be much more than an embodiment of textuality.

  Book Title: Lydia Ginzburg's Prose-Reality in Search of Literature<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Van Buskirk Emily<br>
  Abstract: The Russian writer Lydia Ginzburg (1902-90) is best known for her
         Notes from the Leningrad Blockadeand for influential critical studies, such asOn Psychological Prose, investigating the problem of literary character in French and Russian novels and memoirs. Yet she viewed her most vital work to be the extensive prose fragments, composed for the desk drawer, in which she analyzed herself and other members of the Russian intelligentsia through seven traumatic decades of Soviet history. In this book, the first full-length English-language study of the writer, Emily Van Buskirk presents Ginzburg as a figure of previously unrecognized innovation and importance in the literary landscape of the twentieth century.<br>

  CHAPTER 2  The Poetics of Desk-Drawer Notebooks from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1dr36q1">Lydia Ginzburg's Prose</a><br>
  Abstract: At a private gathering sometime in the early 1930s, after Ginzburg had begun experimenting with longer narratives, she read a draft of “The Return Home” (“Vozvrashchenie domoi”)¹ to a group consisting of Anna Akhmatova, Nikolai Punin, Nikolai Oleinikov, Grigory Gukovsky, Boris Engelgardt, and at least six others.² After the reading, she recorded (in an unpublished note) her listeners’ opinions and characterizations of her narrative’s theme, style, and genre.³ Grigory Gukovsky chose to describe the genre of the innovative piece as a “novel” (
                  roman) whose material was “human thought” rather than experience. (It was Gukovsky who proceeded to spread the rumor<br>

  Abstract: In her book
                  On Psychological Prose, first published in 1971, Ginzburg articulates the realm in which life and literature dynamically interact as we model our personalities: in daily life, people understand themselves and others through “creative constructs,” carrying out the aesthetic work of “selection, correlation, and symbolic interpretation of psychic elements.” The processes through which we compose and project our self-images resemble the creative acts authors perform when designing literary characters or lyric personae. Not only are these processes similar, they are symbiotic, since a personality “shapes itself, both internally and externally, by means of images, many of which have<br>

  Book Title: Forms of Life-Character and Moral Imagination in the Novel<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): PRICE MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Martin Price writes here about ways in which character has been conceived and presented in the novels of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Beginning with chapters that cogently argue the artistic value of character, Price then deals with the different forms character has taken in individual novels. His first discussions center on authors-Jane Austen, Stendhal, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, and Leo Tolstoy-who define individuals by their adherence or opposition to social norms. The next chapters deal with novelists for whom the moral world is largely internalized. The characters of Henry James, Joseph Conrad, D.H. Lawrence, and E.M. Forster live in society and act upon it, but the authors are particularly concerned with the confusions, terrors, and heroism that lie within consciousness. The last chapter uses novels about the artist by James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Thomas Mann in order to apprehend the process by which experience is transformed into art.<br>

  Introduction from:

  Abstract: This is a book about ways in which character has been imagined and presented in some novels of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is not an historical survey of the idea of character but rather an exploration of how much of the spectrum of attitudes and feelings we loosely call human is used by different writers, and to what ends.<br>

  3  The Other Self: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1dr37p0">Forms of Life</a><br>
  Abstract: If characters exist for the sake of novels, they exist only as much as and in the way that the novel needs them. Jane Austen’s world is a strikingly limited one. It is a world of visits and conversations, which usually take place in houses and gardens. We do not see people at work; we do not directly encounter violent action or violent passion. The limits of what may be said are fairly narrow. We are given, in effect, a shallow and well-lighted stage where we can see the comedy of manners played out with great attention to speech and<br>

  5  Stendhal: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1dr37p0">Forms of Life</a><br>
  Abstract: Stendhal’s irony is more radical than Jane Austen’s. His characters tend to be unstable compounds, and they demand a shifting and flexible response from the reader. That response is enacted for us by the narrator, who regards his hero from constantly varying distances and directions. Stendhal’s rhetoric recalls, in its shifts and dodges, the example of Byron’s
                  Don Juan. That poem, like Stendhal’s novels, is a work of an age of reaction and political repression, of institutionalized banality. Behind both lie the French Revolution and the remarkable career of Napoleon. The vitality of the revolution and of the young Napoleon<br>

  9  James: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1dr37p0">Forms of Life</a><br>
  Abstract: In his later novels, Henry James leaves some crucial portion of his action, and of his characters, indeterminate. He does this, in part, by giving us characters’ conscious responses—at a somewhat shallow level of awareness—without accounting for their deeper motives or even, in some cases, indicating whether the surface awareness is consistent with what lies below. By a shallow level I mean only that the principal action of his novels takes place close enough to the surface of consciousness to alert us to meanings that are almost evident and therefore the more frustrating for their elusiveness. We are<br>

  Author(s) Wood Juliette<br>
  Abstract: The numerous tales brought together by the Brothers Grimm and other collectors provide a seemingly endless selection of folk narratives. Although early scholarship sought to situate the folktale within theoretical frameworks that could explain the evolution of culture, it also recognized the characteristically patterned nature of such tales and produced indexes concerned with mapping out the components of oral tales. The most notable and comprehensive indexes were undoubtedly those of Stith Thompson and Antti Aarne, which are still in use today (Aarne and Thompson 1961).<br>

  Abstract: TeachIng undergraduate courses In German StudIes I have had the opportunity to prepare several courses and smaller teaching units on the Grimms’ folk and fairy tales, but each time I find myself facing the same question: How should I structure my material? There are some obvious choices—chronological, regional, thematic—each with its own advantages and limitations. Structuring principles based on thematic similarities and related plot elements—the folklorists’ tale types—can provide a basic infrastructure, along with specific character constellations, motifs, and topoi. Thus your groups may include tales about family conflict and gender relationships (“child victims,” “bad dads,”<br>

  Author(s) KAREM JEFF<br>
  Abstract: Critical discussions of authenticity in
                  The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Manhave been curiously bounded by either the text’s complex provenance or the putative cultural (in)authenticity of the title character. The novel’s initial reception as a genuine autobiography has made the text a touchstone for debates about African American authorship, genre, and social change at the dawn of the twentieth century. Robert Stepto and William Andrews were among the first to note that Johnson’s text appears to join the historical tradition of African American self-authorship, only to break from it by constructing a “false” self and a “false” text in<br>

  Abstract: God has died, at least in science and philosophy. He is agonizing in religious study, perhaps even in some divinity schools. Atheism and a careful sequestration of God from current business are the two main forms in which academia deals with the long history of religion, which, notwithstanding academic reservations, goes on. For scholarship, faith, God, and religion have become curiosa. The theoretical intention has separated itself from religious commitments; it abhors edifying language and has forgotten or rejected the long history of its association with contemplation.

Since Jesus is the protagonist of the story, we are given access to a tremendous amount of information about his background and identity (1:1–18), and we are occasionally told what he thinks,<br>

  Abstract: Images in literary works are words that appeal to the senses to conjure up a corresponding picture in the mind of the reader. By definition, such images appeal to the reader’s imagination, which has the capacity both to visualize and to interpret. The Gospel of John uses a remarkable number of sensory images to tell its story and express its unique perspective on faith. Many of these images, through the course of the Johannine narrative, take on the character of religious symbols: vehicles of the divine world. Appealing to the imagination, image and symbol make it possible for the implied<br>

  Abstract: As even the casual reader knows, there is something different about John’s Gospel. No, there are lots of things about it that are different. Many of the literary traits that help make John’s Gospel what it is and which serve to differentiate it from other books and even from other gospels have been identified and explored in the present volume. Genre, style, time and space, imagery, characterization, protagonist, plot, point of view, use of Scripture, rhetoric, persuasion, closure, audience: each plays a part in shaping the story of the gospel, helping to reveal “how John works.”<br>

  Book Title: How John Works-Storytelling in the Fourth Gospel<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Sheridan Ruth<br>
  Abstract: In this book, a group of international scholars go in detail to explain how the author of the Gospel of John uses a variety of narrative strategies to best tell his story. More than a commentary, this book offers a glimpse at the way an ancient author created and used narrative features such as genre, character, style, persuasion, and even time and space to shape a dramatic story of the life of Jesus.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1g69w8s">How John Works</a><br>
  Author(s) Luther Susanne<br>
  Abstract: Space in the Gospel of John denotes narrative space, which is all the topographical and topological information given in the text that serves to create the setting for the narrative action as well as a narrative world in the reader’s mind.¹ Narrative space can be created through reference to geographical spaces like “Jerusalem” or “Galilee”; through the naming of concrete spaces like “synagogue,” “praetorium,” or “Jacob’s well”; or through descriptive (“inside,” “outside”) or deictic (“here,” “there”) expressions. However, only fragments of the narrated world are provided through the words of the narrator and the characters of the story. The reader<br>

  Abstract: Point of view “signifies the way a story gets told.”¹ It elaborates the relationship between the storyteller and the story and the reception of the story by developing the way the author or narrator presents the reader with the characters, dialogue, actions, setting, and events of the story.² It is a multifaceted concept that biblical critics avoid—perhaps because it seems confusing or even irrelevant to the text’s meaning—yet nothing could be more important to the study of a biblical narrative text than the way the story gets told and the mode or modes by which the reader receives<br>

  Author(s) Skinner Christopher W.<br>
  Abstract: Understanding John’s characters and the ways the Fourth Gospel employs characterization is crucial to appreciating both its story and Christology.¹ Studies of Johannine characterization have proliferated in recent years, and the result is that much helpful light has been shed on a previously overlooked topic.² This chapter is devoted to helping the reader come to terms with the function and significance of Johannine characters other than Jesus. Since Jesus is the protagonist of the story, we are given access to a tremendous amount of information about his background and identity (1:1–18), and we are occasionally told what he thinks,<br>

  Abstract: John’s portrayal of Jesus is notable for many reasons, but one of the most intriguing is the fact that Jesus knows what is going on in other characters’ minds and hearts, while these same characters have no grasp of what is going on in his. This means that the Johannine Jesus appears elusive throughout the story John tells, just as he has done throughout history.<br>

  Abstract: A phenomenological description of dialectical criticism? The contradiction is not so great as it might at first glance appear. The peculiar difficulty of dialectical writing lies indeed in its holistic, “totalizing” character: as though you could not say any one thing until you had first said everything; as though with each new idea you were bound to recapitulate the entire system. So it is that the attempt to do justice to the most random observation of Hegel ends up drawing the whole tangled, dripping mass of the Hegelian sequence of forms out into the light with it.

  Book Title: The Muses on Their Lunch Hour-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Garber Marjorie<br>
  Abstract: As a break from their ordained labors, what might the Muses today do on their lunch hour? This collection of witty, shrewd, and imaginative essays addresses interdisciplinary topics that range widely from Shakespeare, to psychoanalysis, to the practice of higher education today. With the ease born of deep knowledge, Marjorie Garber moves from comical journalistic quirks (GÇ£Fig LeavesGÇ¥) to the curious return of myth and ritual in the theories of evolutionary psychologists (GÇ£Ovid, Now and ThenGÇ¥)._x000D_ Two themes emerge consistently in GarberGÇÖs latest exploration of symptoms of culture. The first is that to predict the GÇ£next big thingGÇ¥ in literary studies we should look back at ideas and practices set aside by a previous generation of critics. In the past several decades we have seen the reemergence ofGÇöfor exampleGÇötextual editing, biography, character criticism, aesthetics, and philology as GÇ£hotGÇ¥ new areas for critical intervention. The second theme expands on this observation, making the case for GÇ£cultural forgettingGÇ¥ as the way the arts and humanities renew themselves, both within fields and across them. Although she is never represented in traditional paintings or poetry, a missing MuseGÇöwe can call her AmnesiaGÇöturns out to be a key figure for the creation of theory and criticism in the arts.<br>

One supremely gifted in the creation of memorable dramatic characters, the other skilled in free indirect discourse, and in the first person narrative. One expansive, making the world a stage and the stage a world, the other a visionary claustrophobe, master of minimal spaces, the trial, the burrow, the animal-slave ship, the hunger artist’s cage.

  Book Title: Science Fiction Double Feature-The Science Fiction Film as Cult Text<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): DUCHOVNAY GERALD<br>
  Abstract: Critical discussion of cult cinema has often noted its tendency to straddle or ignore boundaries, to pull together different sets of conventions, narrative formulas, or character types for the almost surreal pleasure to be found in their sudden juxtapositions or narrative combination. With its own boundary-blurring nature—as both science and fiction, reality and fantasy—science fiction has played a key role in such cinematic cult formation. This volume examines that largely unexplored relationship, looking at how the sf film’s own double nature neatly matches up with a persistent double vision common to the cult film. It does so by bringing together an international array of scholars to address key questions about the intersections of sf and cult cinema: how different genre elements, directors, and stars contribute to cult formation; what role fan activities, including “con" participation, play in cult development; and how the occulted or “bad" sf cult film works. The volume pursues these questions by addressing a variety of such sf cult works, including Robot Monster (1953), Zardoz (1974), A Boy and His Dog (1975), Tetsuo: The Iron Man (1989), Space Truckers (1996), Ghost in the Shell 2 (2004), and Iron Sky (2012). What these essays afford is a revealing vision of both the sf aspects of much cult film activity and the cultish aspects of the whole sf genre.<br>

  2.  The Coy Cult Text: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gn6btc">Science Fiction Double Feature</a><br>
  Author(s) Bould Mark<br>
  Abstract: Many attempts to define cult movies and to describe their appeal are characterized by notions of doubleness, contradiction, and introjection. For example, J. P. Telotte finds in the “etymological underpinnings of ‘cult’” (14) a complex of potential meanings pointing to a dialectical impulse to possess and to be possessed, to express selfhood through surrendering to an external other. Thus, he suggests, the cult movie transgresses norms, enabling the cultist “to fashion a statement of difference” (14), even as it establishes “a stable ground from which to make that assertion, a ground
                  withinthe very boundaries” that are being transgressed (15).<br>

  Abstract: While histories of cinema, especially US cinema, typically discuss the development of the star system, only in recent decades has much attention been paid to actors as performers, and still less attention is given to actors as cult performers. As Wade Jennings observes, compared to regular stardom, “Cult stardom is a relatively recent phenomenon,” and one that, “over time … can emerge as a quite different phenomenon” (90). Exploring the discourses related to this “different phenomenon,” Matt Hills notes how, “across their lifetime, some cult stars become hemmed in by their most famous roles (where a specific character has taken<br>

  Author(s): KAWAKAMI AKANE<br>
  Abstract: Conceived as a second edition to Kawakami's acclaimed A Self-Conscious Art, which was the first full-length study in English of Patrick Modiano’s work, this book has been comprehensively updated with two new chapters, notably discussing the author's recent work and his Nobel Prize win. Kawakami shows how by parodying precursors such as Proust or the nouveau romanciers, Modiano's narratives are built around a profound lack of faith in the ability of writing to retrieve the past through memory, and this failure is acknowledged in the discreet playfulness that characterises his novels. This welcome update on the work of one of the most successful modern French novelists will be essential reading for scholars working on contemporary French writing.<br>

Many of these facts, moreover, have been discovered to be real; they are precise locations in Paris, or a particular brand of cigarette commonly smoked in France. Their authenticity has convinced some readers that the narrative which contains them must be a mimetic one.

They were often a little, at times much, older than him, and their lives subordinate to that of the male narrator, both in narrative terms—that is to say, they were never narrators—and in terms of sheer content.

  Book Title: Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fiction-Explorations in Readers' Engagement with Characters<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): CARACCIOLO MARCO<br>
  Abstract: A storyteller's craft can often be judged by how convincingly the narrative captures the identity and personality of its characters. In this book, the characters who take center stage are "strange" first-person narrators: they are fascinating because of how they are at odds with what the reader would wish or expect to hear-while remaining reassuringly familiar in voice, interactions, and conversations. Combining literary analysis with research in cognitive and social psychology, Marco Caracciolo focuses on readers' encounters with the "strange" narrators of ten contemporary novels, including Bret Easton Ellis's
      American Psycho, Haruki Murakami'sHard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, and Mark Haddon'sThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. Caracciolo explores readers' responses to narrators who suffer from neurocognitive or developmental disorders, who are mentally disturbed due to multiple personality disorder or psychopathy, whose consciousness is split between two parallel dimensions or is disembodied, who are animals, or who lose their sanity.A foray into current work on reception, reader-response, cognitive literary study, and narratology,Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fictionillustrates why any encounter with a fictional text is a complex negotiation of interlaced feelings, thoughts, experiences, and interpretations.<br>

  Abstract: I stressed in the prologue that defamiliarization is far from being a purely cognitive process of belief change, since it is always accompanied by an emotional “feel,” which may span a wide affective gamut of curiosity, puzzlement, hesitation, and unease. This chapter focuses on the feelings of strangeness that underlie readers’ engagements with characters by using as case studies two novels, Haruki Murakami’s
                  Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World(2011; originally published in Japanese in 1985) and Martin Amis’sTime’s Arrow(2003; first edition 1991). Both texts play on a triangulation between the reader and two narrators (Murakami)<br>

Zunshine’s argument is well known: we feel attracted to fiction because it affords opportunities for exercising our “theory of mind” (our capacity to attribute mental states to other subjects), thus functioning as some sort of cognitive “weightlifting” (124–25). In discussing this gymnastic metaphor, Zunshine is careful to uncouple the pleasure provided by reading fictional characters’ minds from its real-world consequences, adding that “[just] as<br>

Caracciolo explores readers' responses to narrators who suffer from neurocognitive or developmental disorders, who are mentally disturbed due to multiple personality disorder or psychopathy, whose consciousness is split between two parallel dimensions or is disembodied, who are animals, or who lose their sanity.A foray into current work on reception, reader-response, cognitive literary study, and narratology,Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fictionillustrates why any encounter with a fictional text is a complex negotiation of interlaced feelings, thoughts, experiences, and interpretations.<br>

  2  Two Child Narrators from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gr7dkd">Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fiction</a><br>
  Abstract: Homing in on two contemporary novels featuring “strange” narrators, Mark Haddon’s
                     The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time(2004) and Emma Donoghue’sRoom(2010), this chapter begins illustrating the theoretical arguments discussed over the previous pages. It fleshes out my model of defamiliarization in readers’ interactions with characters, giving a degree of empirical reality to concepts such as character-centered illusion, cognitive strangeness, and the oscillation between empathy and imaginative resistance.<br>

  4  A Strange Mood from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gr7dkd">Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fiction</a><br>
  Abstract: I stressed in the prologue that defamiliarization is far from being a purely cognitive process of belief change, since it is always accompanied by an emotional “feel,” which may span a wide affective gamut of curiosity, puzzlement, hesitation, and unease. This chapter focuses on the feelings of strangeness that underlie readers’ engagements with characters by using as case studies two novels, Haruki Murakami’s
                  Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World(2011; originally published in Japanese in 1985) and Martin Amis’sTime’s Arrow(2003; first edition 1991). Both texts play on a triangulation between the reader and two narrators (Murakami)<br>

  Abstract: In the concluding lines of
                  Why We Read Fiction, Lisa Zunshine writes, “I can say that I personally read fiction because it offers a pleasurable and intensive workout for my Theory of Mind” (2006, 164). Zunshine’s argument is well known: we feel attracted to fiction because it affords opportunities for exercising our “theory of mind” (our capacity to attribute mental states to other subjects), thus functioning as some sort of cognitive “weightlifting” (124–25). In discussing this gymnastic metaphor, Zunshine is careful to uncouple the pleasure provided by reading fictional characters’ minds from its real-world consequences, adding that “[just] as<br>

  Author(s) Früchtl Josef<br>
  Abstract: “Enlightenment as Mass Deception”. This is the subtitle of the chapter “The Culture Industry” in Adorno and Horkheimer’s
                  Dialectic of Enlightenment. Their theory is as follows: while culture in bourgeois society cannot be free from the contradictions which characterise this society in accordance with Hegel and Marx, nevertheless at the same time, capturing the moment of the negative and critical in its “affirmative character”, as Hork-heimer and then Herbert Marcuse put it, industrially produced culture loses even this last element of the critical and becomes completely affirmative. Thus, culture industry loses its immanent dialectic. However, the culture industry still claims<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gr7dw2">Theodor W. Adorno: Truth and Dialectical Experience / Verità ed esperienza dialettica</a><br>
  Author(s) Huhn Tom<br>
  Abstract: The enigma of the work of modern art is also the name for its constitutive character. The character of this self-contradicting existence is what makes the work of art into the occasion for a baffling and befuddling encounter. The complement to enigma in the work of art is its truth content. Key to engaging the work of art’s enigma and truth content is the mimetic relation between experience and the work of art. The misalignment between the work of art and human experience is an opportunity for encountering what exists as objective contradiction. The ongoing dance between the mimetic misalignments<br>

  Author(s) O’Donnell Mike<br>
  Abstract: The purpose of this chapter is to explain the rise, character and trajectory of radicalism in the United States during ‘the long nineteen sixties’ and to comment on its significance to some of today’s related issues. For comparative purposes, I will also refer to nineteen sixties radicalism in Britain. My already smouldering interest in American radicalism was ignited in 1968 when as a student I attended the ‘alternative’ democratic convention in Chicago, if ‘attended’ is the right word to describe the heavily policed gatherings of assorted radicals in the parks and streets outside the official Convention Hall. Since then I<br>

  Author(s) Schlapbach Florian<br>
  Abstract: This chapter will focus, from a quantitative and longitudinal perspective, on the cohorts who experienced and were involved in those sixties events often symbolized by reference to the climactic year 1968. It looks in particular at the connection between education and values and unconventional political participation. As education has been a major characteristic of the active sixties generation, educational level and educational expansion will be theorised to analyse social mechanisms behind the sixties movement and its development. We will compare the sixties generation – the birth cohorts 1946–53 at the core – to other earlier and later cohorts regarding<br>

  Abstract: A radical transformation in the theatrical representation of the tragic occurred in the late twentieth century, beginning in the sixties and growing out of the performance scene and avant-garde experiments. It launched a new course of the “living art” that characterized the last decades of the century and pioneered performative theatre, the modern version of the

  Abstract: The classical indian traditions had a different conception of both rule and law as compared to modern western traditions. While the constraining power of legality is central to modern western traditions, in India it is moral authority which is at the core of the rule of law (lingat 1973). The classical law of india is characterized not by positive law and legality but by moral authority and duty which is called

  Abstract: Much water has flown down the Jordan, Jhelum, ganges, Cauvery, Mahanadi, thames, rhines and Mississippi rivers since the dawn of humanity and the independence of india, and in recent years much discussion has taken place over the nature of secularism in india, including its uses and abuses. Broadly speaking, we can classify the various contending positions on secularism in india into three approaches: a) those who defend the secular character of the Indian Republic as enshrined in the Constitution of India; b) those who oppose it on the grounds that the practice of Indian state-led secularism has been a pseudo-secularism;<br>

  Abstract: Bourdieu’s work was deeply moulded by the national intellectual milieu in which it developed, that of France in the late 1940s and 1950s, a milieu characterised by disputes between phenomenologists and structuralists. But it is not this national and cultural dimension that distinguishes Bourdieu’s writings from those of other ‘grand theorists’. Habermas and Giddens, for example, owed as much to the academic or political context of their home countries. What set Bourdieu’s approach apart from that of his German and British ‘rivals’ was a significantly stronger linkage of theoretical and empirical knowledge. Bourdieu was first and foremost an empirical sociologist,<br>

  Author(s) Poser Ruth<br>
  Abstract: The book of Ezekiel strikes us as strange. Readers find the enormous amount of violence contained in the text disturbing or even shy away from reading it altogether. The characters in the narrative appear only as people wounded, tortured, or devastated by acts of war; the catastrophe seems to have broken them all: the prophet himself, the people of Israel, the populations of surrounding nations. Even YHWH is portrayed as affected by the violence and brutality.<br>

  Daughter Babylon Raped and Bereaved (Isaiah 47): from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1h1htfd">Bible through the Lens of Trauma</a><br>
  Author(s) Frechette Christopher G.<br>
  Abstract: In Isa 47 YHWH declares that violence shall befall Babylon, which is characterized as “virgin Daughter Babylon” and “daughter Chaldea”¹ and referred to in this essay simply as “Daughter Babylon.” In the Hebrew Bible, cities are in many cases anthropomorphized as female within discourse that represents interaction between the city and YHWH, and such interaction may be either favorable or unfavorable for the city.² In Isa 47:3 YHWH declares to Daughter Babylon, “Your nakedness shall be uncovered, and your shame shall be seen. I will take vengeance”; 47:9 adds, “both these things shall come upon you in a moment, in<br>

  Book Title: The Resounding Soul-Reflections on the Metaphysics and Vivacity of the Human Person<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Kimbriel Samuel<br>
  Abstract: It is surely not coincidental that the term “soul" should mean not only the centre of a creature’s life and consciousness, but also a thing or action characterized by intense vivacity (“that bike’s got soul!"). It also seems far from coincidental that the same contemporary academic discussions that have largely cast aside the language of “soul" in their quest to define the character of human mental life should themselves be so – how to say it? – bloodless, so lacking in soul. This volume arises from the opposite premise, namely that the task of understanding human nature is bound up with and in important respects dependent upon the more critical task of learning to be fully human, of learning to have soul. The papers collected here are derived from a conference in Oxford sponsored by the Centre of Theology and Philosophy and together explore the often surprising landscape that emerges when human consciousness is approached from this angle. Drawing upon literary, philosophical, theological, historical, and musical modes of analysis, the essays of this volume vividly remind the reader of the power of the ancient language of soul over against contemporary impulses to reduce, fragment, and overly determine human selfhood.<br>

  7  Transcending the Body/Soul Distinction through the Perspective of Maximus the Confessor’s Anthropology from:

  Abstract: Does the question of the soul

And, if we do accept the existence of immortal souls and the prevalence of free will, how can these two coincide? How can the soul of a human person possessing a truly free will becompulsorilyeternal? In this article I will address these two different but interconnected questions through examination of selected passages from Maximus the Confessor’s writings, in an attempt to trace possible answers.<br>

  Author(s) Wilson L. C.<br>
  Abstract: Separated by centuries, but united by their faith, and a certain kind of idiosyncratic genius, both Evagrius of Pontus and Søren Kierkegaard developed the traditional concept of “the soul” within anthropologies grounded in their dynamic metaphysics. Each posited a tripartite composition of the human being, consisting of body, mind/soul, and soul/spirit. Despite the variable terminology used by the thinkers (and their translators), both employed a “third term” to designate the relation between the person’s corporeal and incorporeal aspects: a relation that is, itself, constitutive of the character of one’s being and a litmus test for one’s moral and spiritual health.<br>

  Abstract: In the texts from the caribbean included here, the generative themes of African philosophy find expression in the context of the black diaspora forced by the Atlantic slave trade. The ontological emphasis on a relational con ception of reality plays a particularly important role in helping define the black community as something distinct from the European community of slaveholders. In turn, the Caribbean philosophical tradition presented here devotes much attention to the issues of constructing notions both of identity and self-determination and of culture and ethos within the framework of the black community. Thus the relational humanism so characteristic of<br>

  The General Character of Afro-Caribbean Philosophy (2000) from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1hd18x6">I Am Because We Are</a><br>
  Author(s) HENRY PAGET<br>
  Abstract: There are idealist views of philosophy that see it as an affirmation of the autonomy of a thinking subject. As the primary instrument of this absolute subject, philosophy shares in its autonomy and therefore is a discipline that rises above the determinations of history and everyday life. The distinguishing characteristics of Afro-Caribbean philosophy do not support this view. Here we find a tradition of philosophy so indelibly marked by the forces of an imperial history, and by its intertextual relations with neighboring discourses, that it is necessary to begin with a general characterization of philosophy that is more appropriate to<br>

  Author(s) Aradau Claudia<br>
  Abstract: Invocations of fear, attacks, and adversaries have long been characterized as security imaginaries. More recently, the prospect of catastrophic disruption has led security professionals across the Western world to draw up new scenarios of the worst still to come and to prepare exercises for inhabiting the catastrophic futures they have imagined. More established threats insidiously morph into unexpected, unknowable, and unpredictable catastrophic events that can erupt anytime, anywhere. Over the past few decades, security has come to be appended to almost everything: human security, food security, water security, energy security, climate security, GENDER security, cyber security, data security, and so<br>

  Author(s) Pendakis Andrew<br>
  Abstract: An ambiguity has clouded our understanding of the corporation ever since Stewart Kyd’s 1793 treatise distinguished between the corporation as a stable juridico-material entity and the process (of incorporation) by which the corporation gains its unique legal prerogative. Incorporation, however, is never mechanically anterior to the corporate form, per se, but instead its very essence: a dynamic, precarious activity characterized by a desire for what Kyd called “perpetual succession,” an existence projected aggressively onto a temporal horizon limited only by the criterion of profit (Kyd 1793, 6). The corporation is a “living being” that combines Spinoza’s

  Author(s) Colebrook Claire<br>
  Abstract: Disaster films frame life and death situations in such a way as to sharpen the meaning of life. In small-scale films such as
                  The Poseidon Adventure(1972),The Towering Inferno(1974), or evenJaws(1975), a local threat drives characters into familial or tribal collectives, all focused on an exit strategy, with key characters playing out both romance and villain plots. In more recent end-of-the-world films like the viral pandemics 28Days Later(2002), 28Weeks Later(2007), orContagion(2011), the very survival of humanity and civilization is at stake.

  Abstract: Modern culture valorizes ENERGY, vitality, and expansive potency. In biopolitical terms, we may say that
                     energolatria—the worship of energy—is another name for modernity. The defining characteristic of modern bourgeois economy is the imperative of growth, which shapes aesthetics, ethics, and political strategies. Expansion is the immanent dynamic of modern capitalism. The lack of growth, by contrast, is associated with exhaustion and all of its negative connotations.<br>

  Abstract: In his 1964 film, Red Desert, Michelangelo Antonioni depicts a terrifying conundrum of late modernity: a world of technological marvels, whose price is local culture and the environment. The film is set in an Italian industrial town, where Monica Vitti plays the increasingly distraught wife of a petrochemical executive. The film veers from an examination of Italian industrial design—the beautiful sculptural forms enabled by PLASTICS, steel, and glass that constitute a radical break with local craft traditions grounded in organic materials—to the natural landscape destroyed by industrial production. The characters inhabit spectacular high modernist living spaces but traverse<br>

  Abstract: Like the first law of thermodynamics, literary fiction requires momentum. Fiction relies on propulsive devices: basic units of charge that power action, event, and consciousness, calibrated by laws of narrative motion and physical, material impressions of kinetic and potential energy transference. (These need not involve tales of actual motion or much, if any, movement—consider Beckett’s minimalism or the generic predicates for entropy in naturalist writing.) Fiction requires and is measured through potential—what fuels its psychosocial dynamics, the impetus of plot and character development, and its chronotopic ability to traverse multiple times and spaces.

  Abstract: The history of solar power invites us to consider the difference between a form of ENERGY that shapes cultural exchange and a resource that merely fuels production. In the past century, solar power has been touted as a clean alternative to oil and COAL. It has also inspired visions of new social, ecological, and economic systems it might generate. Solar energy is imagined as fundamentally heterogeneous, characterized by how it precipitates complex transactions and conversions that nonetheless preserve homeostatic LIMITS. Indeed, this aspect of solar energy is often touted by critics of the industrial capitalist model that seeks to accumulate<br>

Essentially at first a narrative to explain the gloriousness of the Glorious Revolution of 1688—that is, the triumph of Protestantism and parliamentarianism over Catholicism and monarchy—the narrative has been quite adaptive and has been a carrier of a tale of progress built around the desirability of commerce, money-making, science, technology, and democracy.

  Abstract: That Travellers and other “outsiders” have never felt “at home” in the literature and visual culture of the Irish mainstream is, by now, an acknowledged truism. The long-established quintessential “outsider,” the figure of the Traveller has held a fascination for Irish writers, a fascination that flourished in English from the nineteenth century onward. Writers as well-known and diverse as J. M. Synge, W. B. Yeats, Pádraic Ó Conaire, James Stephens, Liam O’Flaherty, John B.

  Abstract: The celebration of Hephaestus, his craft, his cunning, his ability, as well as the deification of his disability are means of challenging held perceptions about the mythical character, but also about all of us—defined as we all are by concepts of ability, by rhetorics of normalcy.

                  Being and Time, his thought has focused on the notion of Being, but the method of his approach was phenomenology, the method characterizing my own introduction. Heidegger’s approach falls in the line of his teacher, Edmund Husserl, the founder of Phenomenology. Husserl understood Phenomenology to be comprehensive philosophy; it is at least permanent prolegomenon, acknowledged or not, to any philosophy. Phenomenology comes from two Greek terms,phainomenon, appearance, andlogos, essence. Phenomenology is a comprehensive descriptive inventory of all the essential ways in which appearance—that is, presence to consciousness—occurs: direct evidence in<br>

  Abstract: James O’Donnell has characterized Book 10 of the

The whole character of Augustine’s ethics as presented in this book is put in question for O’Donnell by the sudden transition from the luminous to the meticulous.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1kgqw6k">Postclassical Narratology</a><br>
  Author(s) MARCUS AMIT<br>
  Abstract: Girard’s thesis of mimetic desire (also called “triangular” or “metaphysical” desire)¹ has aroused much theoretical interest among literary scholars, who have expanded and expounded his theory, while at the same time criticizing its universal pretensions and its blurring of differences between different types of desire (e.g., male vs. female, heterosexual vs. homosexual).² Literary interpretations that apply Girard’s ideas from his work
                     Deceit, Desire, and the Novel(1965) to fictional narratives focus on the dynamics of mimetic desire and rivalry between two (or more) characters on the story level: the desiring subject, the mediator (or rival), and the desired object.<br>

  CHAPTER 1  Revelation in History: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1kk665x">Revelation and Convergence</a><br>
  Author(s) Schloesser Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Although it has been twenty-five years since Linda Schlafer investigated the seminal importance of Flannery O’Connor’s encounter with the work of Léon Bloy (1846–1917), scholars have been slow to follow her lead.² Yet Bloy’s literary style, indelibly marked by rhetorical violence and vitriolic humor, sounds much like characterizations of O’Connor’s own “language of apocalypse” and “imagination of extremity.”³ Moreover, Bloy’s privileging of “suffering” as redemption apparently responded to O’Connor’s felt need for what Ralph Wood has called a “darker reading of human misery, a more startling revelation of transcendent hope.”⁴ Perhaps most important, Bloy’s symbolist vision of history—the<br>

  CHAPTER 6  The “All-Demanding Eyes”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1kk665x">Revelation and Convergence</a><br>
  Author(s) Garavel Andrew J.<br>
  Abstract: “Parker’s Back,” which Flannery O’Connor wrote as she was dying at the age of thirty-nine, is a story of conversion in which God’s grace overwhelms the title character, O. E. Parker, after years of wandering, denial, and dissatisfaction. The present reading points out significant affinities between this narrative and the conversion of St. Augustine of Hippo (354–430) recounted in his
                  Confessions, a text that exerts a considerable influence on O’Connor’s story.¹ “Parker’s Back,” in its author’s words, “dramatiz[es] a heresy” that figures importantly in Augustine’s work.² In addition, the theory of illumination set forth inThe Confessionscan help<br>

  Book Title: The Algerian New Novel-The Poetics of a Modern Nation, 1950-1979<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): ORLANDO VALÉRIE K.<br>
  Abstract: Disputing the claim that Algerian writing during the struggle against French colonial rule dealt almost exclusively with revolutionary themes,
         The Algerian New Novelshows how Algerian authors writing in French actively contributed to the experimental forms of the period, expressing a new age literarily as well as politically and culturally. Looking at canonical Algerian literature as part of the larger literary production in French during decolonization, Valérie K. Orlando considers how novels by Rachid Boudjedra, Mohammed Dib, Assia Djebar, Nabile Farès, Yamina Mechakra, and Kateb Yacine both influenced and were reflectors of the sociopolitical and cultural transformation that took place during this period in Algeria. Although their themes were rooted in Algeria, the avant-garde writing styles of these authors were influenced by early twentieth-century American modernists, the New Novelists of 1940s-50s France, and African American authors of the 1950s-60s. This complex mix of influences led Algerian writers to develop a unique modern literary aesthetic to express their world, a tradition of experimentation and fragmentation that still characterizes the work of contemporary Algerian francophone writers.<br>

  Abstract: Through labyrinths of eternal returns, flashbacks and flash-forwards, anonymous characters, and places with no designations, Claude Ollier and Kateb Yacine stand on either side of a narrative abyss that is fragile and dark, offering few answers to the unsettling questions that were associated with Algeria during the revolutionary period. Claude Ollier’s novel

  TWO  Imagery and the Landscape of Desire from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1m3nxp7">Language and Desire in Seneca's "Phaedra"</a><br>
  Abstract: In all of Seneca’s plays the psychological atmosphere depends heavily on imagery. In the Phaedra images of fire, enclosure, and heaviness and the contrasting imagery of interior and exterior space depict the stifling emotional world in which the characters seem entrapped. Against this mood of constriction, however, Seneca sets elaborate rhetorical descriptions of sky, forest, or sea. The concentrated energy of such descriptions sets into sharp relief the protagonists’ ineffectiveness or helplessness in the face of the emotional violence within and around them.<br>

  THREE  The Forest World from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1m3nxp7">Language and Desire in Seneca's "Phaedra"</a><br>
  Abstract: The emotional violence that Phaedra releases from Hippolytus’ ostensibly peaceful landscape reveals the contradictions in his character and the precariousness of a personality that uses violence as a defense against sexuality. Seneca owes the basic structure of the situation to Euripides, but he develops it with a density and consistency of imagery that produce an entirely new way of presenting character.¹<br>

                  Nihil ex nihilo fitapplies to effective drama as well as to physics. If a character is to interest us, the events for which he is responsible have to appear as more than arbitrary, detached, isolated gestures. They must in some way express what the novelist George Eliot called “that inexorable law of human souls, that we prepare ourselves for sudden deeds by the reiterated choice of good and evil which gradually determines character.”¹<br>

  Abstract: Ireland in the Celtic Tiger years saw an unprecedented influx of ethnically diverse migrants to a nation formerly perceived as comparatively monocultural. Sketching the two dominant representations of post-Celtic Tiger multiculturalism, Amanda Tucker notes that the first of these ‘emphasizes that fear and hostility continue to characterize Irish responses to inward migration since the Gaelic Catholic monolith remains’ at the heart of twenty-first-century Irish identity, thus reinforcing ‘the idea of Ireland as a monocultural rather than multicultural society’ (Tucker, 2010: 107).¹ The second type of response claims that, despite the legal situation of immigrants, Ireland is a country traditionally open<br>

  Author(s) James Sarah<br>
  Abstract: To characterise John Capgrave as a writer of ‘literature’ has been, until recently, to court controversy, if not outright dissent. In his foreword to the Early English Text Society’s edition of Capgrave’s
                  Life of St Katherine, Frederick Furnivall spares no time to consider what, if any, literary merit might attach to the work, being instead concerned to provide a rather patronising author portrait before launching into an embittered attack upon Carl Horstmann’s editorial decision-making; the text, it seems, is of no more than antiquarian concern.¹ More recently M.

The route connecting Maître François’s illuminated rendering of the flight from Sodom to Blanchot’s and Levinas’s guarded turns to the Sodom archive has no historical warranty. Blanchot and Levinas’s mutual interest in the question of art charted a wide-ranging interrogation of the enigmatic fact of the artwork’s existence and the unquiet character of art’s aesthetic and ethical open-endedness, conducted across several genres and historical environments.² Their expedition, however, did not pause at the late-medieval scene of manuscript illumination.<br>

Most obviously, they conform to the genre of tourist photography commonly found in the postcards and guidebooks designed to satisfy interest in well-known landmarks of the Dead Sea region. To this end, the photographs also display a characteristic negotiation of the documentary impulse and the taste for the picturesque’s “accidental beauty.”² No more than the illuminated image from Maître François’s studio do the photographs pretend to supply historically accurate information about the destroyed city of Sodom, though the reasons for the photographs’ agnosticism<br>

  Book Title: Sin and Evil-Moral Values in Literature<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): PAULSON RONALD<br>
  Abstract: The confusion of sin and evil, or religious and moral transgression, is the subject of Ronald Paulson's latest book. He calls attention to the important distinction between sin and Evil (with a capital E) that in our times is largely ignored, and to the further confusion caused by the term "moral values." Ranging widely through the history of Western literature, Paulson focuses particularly on American and English works of the eighteenth through twentieth centuries to discover how questions of evil and sin-and evil and sinful behavior-have been discussed and represented.The breadth of Paulson's discussion is enormous, taking the reader from Greek and Roman tragedy, to Christian satire in the work of Swift and Hogarth, to Hawthorne's and Melville's novels, and finally to twentieth-century studies of good and evil by such authors as James, Conrad, Faulkner, Greene, Heller, Vonnegut, and O'Brien. Where does evil come from? What are "moral values"? If evil is a cultural construct, what does that imply? Paulson's literary tour of sin and evil over the past two hundred years provides not only a historical perspective but also new ways of thinking about important issues that characterize our own era of violence, intolerance, and war.<br>

There is not even consensus about whether fascism is a strictly limited historical term, something that happened to Italians (or rather was perpetrated by Italians) between 1922 and 1945, or a universal phenomenon. The disputes surrounding fascism are not just a result of academic nitpicking; they point to what appear to be characteristics of the thing itself.

  Abstract: In this characteristically concise, witty, and lucid book, Terry Eagleton turns his attention to the questions we should ask about literature, but rarely do. What is literature? Can we even speak of "literature" at all? What do different literary theories tell us about what texts mean and do? In throwing new light on these and other questions he has raised in previous best-sellers, Eagleton offers a new theory of what we mean by literature. He also shows what it is that a great many different literary theories have in common.<br>

  Abstract: The theory of fiction is perhaps the most difficult aspect of the philosophy of literature, as well as the one that has attracted the most sustained scholarly attention. For some curious reason, commentary on the subject has produced not only some penetrating insights but also more than its fair share of embarrassing banalities.

The first groups that emerge clearly into what little light is cast by our surviving sources are the communities to which Paul wrote his letters. Because those letters are primarily instruments intended for moral instruction and formation, they are particularly precious sources for questions about the scope of moral perceptions and obligations in the Christian movement, at<br>

Placing these essences within the characteristic features of the human brain's neuronal organization, the author addresses unsolved questions in neuroscience today. With imagination and deep insight, Changeux illuminates the evolution of the brain and deciphers what new developments in neuroscience may portend for the future of humanity.<br>

  Abstract: Recent progress in neuroscience and its integration in dynamic evolutionary processes, which include culture and its history, prompt us to rethink certain central philosophical questions, such as the significance of death. Death is an essential biological phenomenon directly related to the evolution of species. It has taken on a special dimension in the history of humanity. Buff on rightly said that “death is as natural as life.” Many philosophical and religious fundamentals, which emphasize the sacred character of life, maintain the balance by doing the same for its interruption by death. I feel it is opportune today more than ever<br>

  Six  REASON OVER TIME from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npqs8">Freedom and Time</a><br>
  Abstract: The first time Arrow’s name appeared in this book, the subject was the reappearance, within contemporary economic thought, of Jefferson’s proposition that the earth belongs to the living. (Rational economic policy, Arrow suggests, would take into account the interests of future citizens only to the extent that there is a present preference among living individuals to do so.)¹ A similar observation applies to Arrow’s famous Impossibility Theorem. It relies on an understanding of rationality that, while characteristic of modern economic thought and much analytic philosophy, is untenably compressed in its temporality—compressed into the present.<br>

  Chapter 10  Photographic Traces and Documentary Films: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nps8x">Engaging the Moving Image</a><br>
  Abstract: In his characteristically stimulating and carefully crafted article “Visible Traces: Documentary Film and the Contents of Photographs,” Gregory Currie introduces a sophisticated theory of the documentary film.¹ For Currie, a documentary film is one comprised of a preponderance of photographic images that function in the context of the relevant film as traces of the objects and events that causally produced them. An image of Gregory Peck in a documentary film is a representation of Gregory Peck, a photographic trace of the actor at a certain time and place. And a documentary about Gregory Peck is constructed mostly of such images.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nps8x">Engaging the Moving Image</a><br>
  Abstract: Almost since the inception of moving pictures, those pictures have often featured dance. The obvious reason for this is that the natural subject of moving pictures is movement. And dances—along with hurtling locomotives, car chases, cattle stampedes, tennis matches, intergalactic dog-fights, and the like—move. Thus, a significant portion of the history of moving pictures involves dance movement. Many moving-picture makers have devoted admirable amounts of effort and imagination to portraying dance in or through media as diverse as film, video, and computer animation. The purpose of this essay is to attempt to offer a philosophical characterization of this<br>

  Abstract: There aren’t many novels in which the main character dies in the first few paragraphs. There are even fewer in which this is the only character in the book. We would be bemused if Jane Austen’s Emma Woodhouse were to break her neck in the first chapter of

So what goes wrong as we get older and why is it so hard to hold on to the promise of childhood spirituality? One helpful way to begin to think about it is to understand that as we grow as children we become increasingly compliant and then turn away from the vivid feelings we knew as children.

This chapter explores why this might be and focuses on the characteristics of the language of poetry. For as a form of expression poetry usually communicates authenticity. Poets speak and write of a way of looking at the everyday with a sensitivity that can take the hearer and reader beyond that everyday into another level of consciousness. Perhaps there are ways that some poetry can tap directly into the unconscious of the reader or hearer<br>

As all these are stripped away the light begins to return and the image of God returns as a small child ready to play. Play, creativity, and the imagination are not only aspects of childhood but are characteristics of the spirit of the child that remain still potentially available in the adult. In absorbed play and concentrated creativity self-consciousness can be forgotten and the disguise or the false self is left behind. Play can also be a way to integrate the shadow and all<br>

  Abstract: This paper aims to understand the meaning and role that Jaspers attributes to worldviews. By analysing the nature of the
                  Weltanschauungen, the paper shows how Jaspers, inspired by Dilthey, alludes to a fundamental stratum of the Weltanschauung that goes beyond every objective construction, every shell (Gehäuse) and every doctrine, and which is identified with the process of the existential experience. The antinomicity of the lived process and the ambiguity that characterises the worldviews becomes clearer where Jaspers introduces the notion of limit situation. By analysing the relationship between theWeltanschauungenand the philosophical faith, the paper shows that theWeltanschauungen<br>

  Author(s) Staiti Andrea<br>
  Abstract: In this paper I discuss Jaspers’ theory of worldviews with regard to the contemporary problem of naturalism. In particular, I consider the frequent characterization of naturalism as a worldview. First, I situate Jaspers’ conception of worldviews in the context of the philosophical debate of his time. I then turn to Jaspers’ distinction between substantial worldviews and derivative shapes of worldviews and present his construal of naturalism as a derivative shape of what he calls the sensoryspatial
                  Weltbild. I then argue that contemporary naturalism still fits Jaspers’ description and can thus be considered a derivative shape, rather than a genuine worldview<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1p5f306">Karl Jaspers e la molteplicità delle visioni del mondo</a><br>
  Author(s) Ciglenečki Jan<br>
  Abstract: Prodromal and pre-psychotic states are characterized by pervasive instabilities on all levels of experience and could lead to what Karl Jaspers calls limit-situations (
                  Grenzsituationen). In the process of defending against such existential instabilities or limit-situations, different strategies and mechanisms are employed to provide a shelter or enclosure (Gehäuse). In this article, we explore the transition from the limitsituations to enclosures in psychotic and mystical states. In both we can differentiate multiple orientations. Many individuals, who experience psychotic and mystical states, have in fact experiences of both, at least to some extent. Together with everyday, common-sense level of experience we can<br>

  Book Title: The Cruft of Fiction-Mega-Novels and the Science of Paying Attention<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): LETZLER DAVID<br>
  Abstract: While mega-novel text is often intricately meaningful or experimental, sometimes it is just excessive and pointless. On the other hand, mega-novels also contain text that, though appearing to be cruft, turns out to be quite important. Letzler posits that this cruft requires readers to develop a sophisticated method of attentional modulation, allowing one to subtly distinguish between text requiring focused attention and text that must be skimmed or even skipped to avoid processing failures.
      The Cruft of Fictionshows how the attentional maturation prompted by reading mega-novels can help manage the information overload that increasingly characterizes contemporary life.<br>

  Abstract: Unique among the generic categories structuring this book, the term

Dictionaries, after all, especially those in English, have long been used to increase their users’ linguistic aptitudes. The original English dictionaries were bilingual translating references, and the first ones written entirely in English were designed mainly to enlarge readers’ vocabularies with “hard” words, a function that can still<br>

  Abstract: Though the previous chapters have used mega-novels’ relationships to several nonfictional genres to examine how their detailed accumulation of the facts of real life can overload readers’ attention capacities and subsequently prompt them to modulate their methods of text processing, cruft is not limited to the small-scale cases of the incoherent word, the irrelevant datum, the passing moment of consciousness. The following three chapters will examine how mega-novels’ incorporation of elements from other literary genres produces more extensive but equally pointless cruft, inducing the same characteristic frustration and boredom to provoke a similar reorientation of attention.

  Abstract: The principal point of this study is that all forms of displacement – exile, émigré, expatriate, travel, nomadism, emigration, and diaspora – are not isolated and may overlap. This pluralistic approach may reveal the dominance of one form of displacement over another or their collisions in shaping the identity of displaced writers, alongside other undercurrents of influence such as historical time, geographical place, and the writer’s own personal characteristics. Viewing different forms of displacement in the historical continuum, we can see how they change with the social progress of civilization. “A hundred years ago,” says Czeslaw Milosz, “average people not familiar with<br>

  Book Title: Textual Silence-Unreadability and the Holocaust<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): LANG JESSICA<br>
  Abstract: There are thousands of books that represent the Holocaust, but can, and should, the act of reading these works convey the events of genocide to those who did not experience it? In
      Textual Silence, literary scholar Jessica Lang asserts that language itself is a barrier between the author and the reader in Holocaust texts-and that this barrier is not a lack of substance, but a defining characteristic of the genre.Holocaust texts, which encompass works as diverse as memoirs, novels, poems, and diaries, are traditionally characterized by silences the authors place throughout the text, both deliberately and unconsciously. While a reader may have the desire and will to comprehend the Holocaust, the presence of "textual silence" is a force that removes the experience of genocide from the reader's analysis and imaginative recourse. Lang defines silences as omissions that take many forms, including the use of italics and quotation marks, ellipses and blank pages in poetry, and the presence of unreliable narrators in fiction. While this limits the reader's ability to read in any conventional sense, these silences are not flaws. They are instead a critical presence that forces readers to acknowledge how words and meaning can diverge in the face of events as unimaginable as those of the Holocaust.<br>

  Abstract: Fieldwork, the distinctive procedural hallmark of the anthropological enterprise, became an unquestioned professional requirement during the decades of sociocultural anthropology’s “classical period,” roughly 1925 to 1960. for our purposes, the major consequence of this is a presentism characteristic of much ethnographic reporting: the society as observed at the time of the fieldworker’s interaction with it.

  Author(s) Wacker Marie-Theres<br>
  Abstract: The figures of Adam and Eve both frequently appear in early Jewish writings from Hellenistic-Roman times but with different significance and characteristics. While Adam emerges in numerous passages (2 En. 30–32; 42; 58; 4 Ezra 3.4–27; 4.30–32; 7; 2 Bar. 4.17–19; 23; 48.42–50; 54; 56; 3 Bar. 9; sib. or. 3.24–28; apoc. sedr. 4–8), Eve appears mainly in association with her companion (Jub. 2–4; 1 En. 32; 2 En. 31; 2 Bar. 48.42–43; apoc. ab. 23–24; 3 Bar. 4; apoc.

  Author(s) DOWDESWELL TRACEY LEIGH<br>
  Abstract: The ideology of scientific motherhood began to gain ground in Canada in the late nineteenth century, and came to rationalize mothering for Mennonite women along expert and scientific lines. Scientific motherhood was a widespread cultural movement that sought to reproduce the conditions of industrialization and regulate the modes of women’s labour inside the “factory” home. Scientific motherhood is closely associated with urbanization, industrialization, the medicalization of childbirth, and the increasing popularity of artificial formula that characterized its rise during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (see Apple), a time of significant Mennonite resettlement in Canada. For Canadian mothers, including<br>

  An Evangelical Reorientation: from:

  Author(s) ANDERSON CORY<br>
  Abstract: When the beachy amish-mennonites withdrew from the Old Order Amish,¹ they not only loosened restrictions on dress and technology usage, but adopted evangelical Christian theology, that is, a preoccupation with the sudden, dramatic salvation of individual souls (Cronk; Geiger). Yet, Beachy Amish-Mennonites have sought to retain Amish characteristics, including an emphasis on lifelong redemption through separatist community life, defined gender roles, and distinct practices. This hybridization of evangelical and Old Order reorganized their society in nuanced ways, including how women contributed to community and family formation. Among the Amish, women are responsible for having and raising children, that is, perpetuating<br>

  Abstract: This paper emerged from my work for a Ph.D. in Creative Writing. Motivated by a desire to analyse women’s life stories, and informed by many years as a midwife, I took on the task of retelling a life story revolving around the centrality of the character’s bodily experience of womanhood, manifested through her experiences of rape, intimate violence, birth, and mothering. This enterprise opened the door to a critical understanding of the nature of subjectivity as represented and re-presented in fiction and non-fiction in the form of birth narratives. As a midwife and a feminist, I had long been aware<br>

  Author(s) SAYED ASMA<br>
  Abstract: Since the advent of silent film, motherhood has been represented on the big screen across the globe. Mother characters populating the backdrops of cinematic narratives are noteworthy both for what they reflect about culture and for the ways that they affect cultural attitudes and ideas about the roles, relationships, and potentialities of women and mothers. The screen often echoes unrealistic expectations that too often become the model to which women hold themselves and to which their societies likewise measure them. Films are both a product and replication of socio-cultural and political shifts. Examining films from a range of countries and<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1rrd9dn">Screening Motherhood in Contemporary World Cinema</a><br>
  Author(s) DAVIDSON RACHEL D.<br>
  Abstract: Instead of feeling excitement or joy upon hearing she is pregnant, Jenna Hunterson, the protagonist of Adrienne Shelly’s 2007 independent film,
                  Waitress, resents her unborn child. In the above internal narration, Jenna expresses anger towards her child after her abusive husband finds the pile of cash that she had hoped to use to run away and start a new life; he uses it to purchase a crib. Jenna’s character inWaitressstands in stark contrast to the prevailing cultural ideal of “the good mother” stereotype because she is unapologetically anti-motherhood.

  Author(s) HAWKES TERRI<br>
  Abstract: From my standpoint as an academic, cinema and theatre practitioner, and mother, I am disturbed by what I perceive to be a lack of representation of mothers as central characters in cinema and theatre. In “The Invisibility of Motherhood in Toronto Theatre: The Triple Threat,” I looked at the employment experiences of seven “mother-actors” in the Greater Toronto Area and identified their uniquely inherent challenges in maintaining acting careers within the patriarchal institutions of motherhood (Rich 13), theatre, film, and television (Hawkes 247-269).

  Author(s) JHAMTANI RAMITA<br>
  Abstract: For over a hundred years, Bollywood—India’s Hindi language cinema—has cradled and nurtured the dreams, hopes, and fantasies of its growing audiences. Amid the glorious, larger than life portrayals of human relationships, mighty heroes, complex plots, perfect endings, myriad of traditions, and the glitter and glamour, stands the quintessential
                  maa—the venerated mother figure, who has come a long way in the past hundred years.

  ONE  Retiring to the Costas: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1t896fb">Retiring to Spain</a><br>
  Abstract: This book focuses on the lives of a group of women from the UK who moved to the Costa Blanca¹ in Spain in retirement. We follow their journeys as they seek ‘community’ and belonging in a world characterised by rapid social change. Imbued with nostalgic yearning, community is hailed as a panacea to the ills of modernity and as a representation of social continuity. Nostalgia denotes the mourning of a lost home or place and a lost time – and in this way – the search for community and belonging can also be understood as a quest for another epoch.<br>

  Abstract: Throughout this book we have followed women’s migration journeys across space and time as they spanned and reconstituted boundaries. Beginning with their pre-migration lives – characterised for many by fractured belonging in the UK – upper and more proximate structures enabled and facilitated their agency in moving to Spain in retirement. We have also seen that women’s positionalities and unique biographies are also significant in shaping migration choices, decision-making processes and their post-migration lives. I framed divergent migration trajectories in relation to two plot typologies: the quest and voyage and return. Those women who ultimately chose to remain in Spain<br>

  Abstract: If frailty has come to signify the vulnerability of older people, abjection reveals the distaste associated with such frailty. In the past, as long as charity was in part a matter of conferring spiritual benefits onto potential donors, the cause and character of the recipients’ impoverishment was largely irrelevant. When poverty and dependency represented the collective fate of so many of the common population, the presence of so many poor provided a ready means by which elites could add spiritual value to their existing material resources (Himmelfarb, 1984; Fraser and Gordon, 1994; Jütte, 1994).

  Abstract: The structural crisis experienced generally in post-industrial society since the last third of the 20th century has been characterised by the continuous dismantling of jobs and workplaces, with no compensation in sight.

  Abstract: It may seem obvious to say that biographical research differs from all other sociological research. The differences apply to research techniques, procedures of analysing biographical material and something that can be called a ‘style of work’, which covers the very time-consuming research stages of material collection and analysis. These and many other specific features of biographical research are grounded in theoretical and methodological assumptions which vary for particular types of biographical work. However, the outstanding characteristic of this kind of work is that the research material is biography.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter situates neighbourhood planning within the context of the evolution of community-led planning, citizen engagement and the shifting scales of spatial planning at the national and international levels. It critically examines neighbourhood planning as a key element of the localism that has evolved in England since 2010, outlining the contradictory propositions and powers at its heart. The chapter is in three parts. The first explores international trends in planning policy and governance and ways of characterising and understanding these, arguing that we have to move away from dichotomies to look at the complexities of the social, spatial and political<br>

  Book Title: The Qing Formation in World-Historical Time-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Struve Lynn A.<br>
  Abstract: For many years, the Ming and Qing dynasties have been grouped as “late imperial China," a temporal framework that allows scholars to identify and evaluate indigenous patterns of social, economic, and cultural change initiated in the last century of Ming rule that imparted a particular character to state and society throughout the Qing and into the twentieth century. This paradigm asserts the autonomous character of social change in China and has allowed historians to create a “China-centered history." Recently, however, many scholars have begun emphasizing the singular qualities of the Qing. Among the eight contributors to this volume on the formation of the Qing, those who emphasize the Manchu ethos of the Qing tend to see it as part of an early modernity and stress parallel and sometimes mutually reinforcing patterns of political consolidation and cultural integration across Eurasia. Other contributors who examine the Qing formation from the perspective of those who lived through the dynastic transition see the advent of Qing rule as prompting attempts by the Chinese subjects of the new empire to make sense of what they perceived as a historical disjuncture and to rework these understandings into an accommodation to foreign rule. In contrast to the late imperial paradigm, the new ways of configuring the Qing in historical time in both groups of essays assert the singular qualities of the Qing formation.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter deals with a specific type of ghost story, “the historical ghost tale.” By historical ghost tale, I mean a ghost story about a traumatic historical event rather than a problem of individual mortality. The event is usually of a political nature, especially dynastic fall and conquest. I am inspired here by Paul Ricoeur’s concept of “historical time,” which mediates between the lived time of the individual and the cosmic time of the universe.¹ Although the ghost story about history is most effective when it centers on one or more individualized ghost characters as “sufferers” or victims of history,²<br>

It is well adapted for the narration of events involving a limited cast of characters and a single set of consequences, but when a narrative involves many characters or groups, with varying motivations, acting in different times and places, the anecdote falls short. For more complex chains of events, the historiographers of the

It is also marked by an utter departure from the conviction that Jesus’s person and work is constitutively key to the relationship between God and the world. The chapter will also evaluate Panikkar’s later christological development based upon priorities and principles earlier drawn from “Meditaciόn sobre Melquisedec” andLe mystère du culte, as well as various systematic theologians.

The process of suppression results from the claim that postmodern writing blurs genres, transgresses them, or unfixes boundaries that conceal domination or authority, and that “genre” is an anachronistic term and concept. When critics offer examples of postmodern novels, for example, they cite omniscient authors who are parodied or undermined. They point to selfconscious addresses to the reader in

  Abstract: Since a centennial is an opportunity to look backward and forward, I have chosen a subject that I feel is appropriate to the occasion: the generation of conceptual changes in literary study. The kind of changes I refer to are what Foucault called epistemic changes, what Meyer Abrams has characterized as a change from a pragmatic to an organic orientation, what the anthropologist Clifford Geertz calls “an alteration of the principles of mapping. Something is happening to the way we think about the way we think.”¹ The conceptual change I refer to is what Brian McHale and other postmodern critics<br>

  Abstract: The real college experiences of veterans, rural Midwesterners, and trade unionists show that what it means to be working class is not obvious or easily definable. Resisting outdated characterizations of these students as underprepared and dispensing with a one-size-fits-all pedagogical approach, contributors address how region and education impact students, explore working-class pedagogy and the ways in which it can reify social class in teaching settings, and give voice to students' lived experiences.<br>

  Book Title: Narrative Concepts in the Study of Eighteenth-Century Literature-  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mäkikalli Aino<br>
  Abstract: This collection of essays studies the encounter between allegedly ahistorical concepts of narratology and eighteenth-century literature. It questions whether the general concepts of narratology are as such applicable to historically specific fields, or whether they need further specification. Furthermore, at issue is the question whether the theoretical concepts actually are, despite their appearance of ahistorical generality, derived from the historical study of a particular period and type of literature. In the essays such concepts as genre, plot, character, event, tellability, perspective, temporality, description, reading, metadiegetic narration, and paratext are scrutinized in the context of eighteenth-century texts. The writers include some of the leading theorists of both narratology and eighteenth-century literature.<br>

Upon my word, I think theOedipus Tyrannus, theAlchemist, andTom Jones, the three most perfect plots ever planned’ (Coleridge, 1856, p. 521). The novel’s justly-celebrated plot with its twists and turns and surprises seems to involve for readers a series of uncertainties about the ultimate fates of its characters. And yet Fielding’s plot is distinct from what we now think of as ‘plot’. For one thing, the narrative unfolds in a supremely leisurely and digressive<br>

  Author(s) Birke Dorothee<br>
  Abstract: From a narratological point of view, one of the most controversial legacies the eighteenth-century novel has bestowed onto its inheritors is the technique of authorial narration. Described by Franz K. Stanzel as one of three typical narrative situations, authorial narration as defined in the
                  Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theoryis ‘characterized by a highly audible and visible narrator’ who ‘sees the story from the ontological position of an outsider, that is, a position of absolute authority which allows her/him to know everything about events and characters, including their thoughts and unconscious motives’ (Jahn, 2005, p. 364).

  Author(s) Nitschke Claudia<br>
  Abstract: Systematic narratological classification helps identify ‘trans-historical’ phenomena which share defining characteristics, but can still change over time in terms of form or function. In the eighteenth century, seminal, longterm social and political shifts (even before the French Revolution) became widely tangible. With society undergoing massive structural changes, literature formed no exception: writers began taking stock and started rigorously to probe and investigate the semantic potential of emergent genres such as the novel, but also the narrative medium itself.<br>

  Abstract: In depicting the character and personality of their deceased subject, English Protestant ministers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries employ features of writing strikingly comparable to contemporary works of fictional narrative. Such features include not only the selective inclusion of biographical details from the subject’s life and death, but a spectrum of seemingly ‘literary’ devices such as the portrayal of multiple points of view through eyewitness ‘testimonials’, direct quotation of correspondence, poetry, diary entries, and vividly-realized deathbed scenes (some of which include dialogue).<br>

  Author(s) Rogers Pat<br>
  Abstract: Why Curll, of all people? A natural reaction to the title of this essay might be to wonder what the rascally publisher Edmund Curll has to do with narratology, the theme of this volume. It might be thought that Curll (1683-1747) was an interesting fellow, no doubt, but scarcely a pioneer of writerly innovation. The case I shall try to make here is that Curll’s most characteristic productions, above all the instant biographies he brought out in the late 1720s and early 1730s, do tell us something about paratext – specifically on the way it constitutes a type of narrative statement<br>

At the age of twenty-three he emigrated to the United States, but only became legally resident there in 1989, after winning his green card in a lottery.

  1.  THE TROUBLE WITH LYING: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wvwdtb">Rethinking Sincerity and Authenticity</a><br>
  Abstract: Immanuel Kant’s preoccupation with self-congruence reveals itself most famously—or infamously, depending on your point of view—in his absolute prohibition against lying. However, as this first chapter demonstrates, Kant mounts a passionate, repeated, and multidimensional endorsement of self-congruence that encompasses more than the conformity between what I think and what I say. Reading through Kant’s practical philosophy—from the early ethics lectures (1762) through
                  The Metaphysics of Morals(1797) and beyond—one finds Kant’s repeated affirmation of (1) truthfulness, (2) sincerity, (3) autonomy, and (4) character.¹ To clarify Kant’s views, the following discussion focuses on these specific forms of<br>

  Abstract: Immanuel Kant’s commitment to the self-congruence of character, with its pervasive impact on his moral thought in particular, may surprise some readers. Much more surprising, however, is his belief that the cultivation of character also requires incongruence. Despite his well-known prohibition against lying and a related distaste for hypocrisy, Kant often recommends something strikingly similar to both. Specifically, he recommends both
                  dissimulation(concealing one’s thoughts and feelings) andsimulation(pretending to be something one is not). Just as surprising—and just as revealing of his ambivalence toward self-congruence—is the subject of this chapter’s latter half: Kant’s occasional recommendation of<br>

  Abstract: To give my students a sense of the incomplete and elusive character of interpretive anthropology, I use two images drawn from Clifford Geertz’s
                  The Interpretation of Cultures.¹ One is the “Indian story,” which is “about an Englishman who, having been told that the world rested on a platform which rested on the back of an elephant which rested in turn on the back of a turtle, asked … what did the turtle rest on? Another turtle. And that turtle? ‘Ah, Sahib, after that is turtles all the way down.’”² The other comes from Geertz’s assertion that “the culture of a<br>

  Author(s) Bernasconi Robert<br>
  Abstract: The account that Levinas gives in
                  Totality and Infinityof the face-to-face relation with the Other (in the sense of the other human being) has now achieved classic status. Its basic characteristics are familiar. First, the face-to-face is not a relation, if that means that it forms a totality. Hence Levinas prefers to use the word “relation” only with some qualification, as when he calls the face-to-face a relationsui generisor a “relation without relation” (Tel52 and 271/TI80 and 295). The terms of the face-to-face absolve themselves from the relation insofar as they are both absolute within<br>

  Abstract: Even if the relation with the Other is supposed to be unmediated, and thereby to have a traumatic character, as Emmanuel Levinas claims (
                  AE179–85/OB141–45), that would not by itself be enough to derive from it an ethical responsibility.¹ There are many kinds of trauma which do not make any kind of ethical claim, which therefore cannot be derived from the structure per se of trauma, unless one were to suppose that the only real trauma were the trauma of the otherperson, of a personal Other rather than a non-personal alterity.

  Abstract: It might seem that the path traced thus far in Arendt’s thought can best be characterized as the squaring of a circle, as the forging of a lineal solution for the antinomic relation between originality and duration, deconstruction and constitution, violence and power. But things are more complex than they appear to be at first sight. If we take a closer look at the hinge that conjoins and absorbs the “before” and the “after,” we can see that it does not develop without gaps or remainders.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xhr6c5">The Origin of the Political</a><br>
  Abstract: With Simone Weil, we confront a different scenario. For her, origin does not collapse under the weight of historical catastrophe. But this is not so because history—in particular, modern history—is conceived in more positive terms. On the contrary, we could say that in many ways Weil emphasizes origin’s negative characteristics. It is merely that, unlike Arendt, the negative in Weil does not affect origin from the outside principally because it is already embroiled in it. The modern therefore is not ailing because it betrays origin, but precisely because it fulfills it in all its unbearably antinomic features. Origin<br>

  Book Title: Norms of Rhetorical Culture-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Farrell Thomas B.<br>
  Abstract: Rhetoric is widely regarded by both its detractors and advocates as a kind of antithesis to reason. In this book Thomas B. Farrell restores rhetoric as an art of practical reason and enlightened civic participation, grounding it in its classical tradition-particularly in the rhetoric of Aristotle. And, because prevailing modernist world views bear principal responsibility for the disparagement of rhetorical tradition, Farrell also offers a critique of the dominant currents of modern humanist thought.Farrell argues that rhetoric is not antithetical to reason but is a manner of posing and answering questions that is distinct from the approaches of analytic and dialectical reason. He develops this position in a number of ways: through a series of bold reinterpretations of Aristotle's
      Rhetoric; through a detailed appraisal of traditional rhetorical concepts as seen in modern texts from the Army-McCarthy hearings to Edward Kennedy's memorial for his brother, Mario Cuomo's address on abortion, Betty Friedan'sFeminine Mystique, and Vaclav Havel's inaugural address; and through a fresh appraisal of theories on the character of language and discourse found in contemporary philosophy, literary criticism, anthropology, deconstructionism, Marxism, and especially in Habermas's critical theory of communicative action.<br>

  Abstract: In der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus wurden 130.000 bis 150.000 ÖsterreicherInnen aus „rassischen“ oder politischen Gründen zur Emigration gezwungen, die überwiegende Mehrheit davon Juden (Stadler, „Emigration“ 17). Schon lange vor der Machtübernahme des Nationalsozialismus hatten viele junge ForscherInnen jüdischer Herkunft und/oder linker politischer Gesinnung Österreich verlassen, da ihnen seit Anfang der 1920er Jahre Berufslaufbahnen an den Universitäten zusehends verwehrt wurden (Feichtinger, „Braindrain“ 286-98; Taschwer 99-132).

  Abstract: This book focuses on women congregations’ encounter with modernity during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. These three decades represent an era when social contentions revealed that paradigms no longer held and that new responses to both historical and emerging problems were required. The Western world was entering postmodernity, characterized by its fractured and liquid quality,¹ aptly characterized as an age of fracture, with the construct of woman being profoundly affected. A notion of identity common to all women was quickly problematized to a conception of womanhood that disaggregated along lines of race, gender, and sexuality. At the same time, the<br>

  Book Title: The Ambiguous Allure of the West-Traces of the Colonial in Thailand<br>
  Publisher: Hong Kong University Press, HKU<br>
  Author(s): Chakrabarty Dipesh<br>
  Abstract: The book brings studies of modern Thai history and culture into dialogue with debates in comparative intellectual history, Asian cultural studies, and postcolonial studies. It takes Thai Studies in new directions through case studies of the cultural hybridity and ambivalences that have emerged from the manifold interactions between Siam/Thailand and the West from 1850 to the present day. Central aims of The Ambiguous Allure of the West are to critique notions of Thai "uniqueness" or "exceptionalism" and locate Thai Studies in a broader, comparative perspective by arguing that modern Siam/Thailand needs to be understood as a semicolonial society. In contrast to conservative nationalist and royalist accounts of Thai history and culture, which resist comparing the country to its once-colonized Asian neighbours, this book's contributors highlight the value of postcolonial analysis in understanding the complexly ambiguous, interstitial, liminal and hybrid character of Thai/Western cultural interrelationships. At the same time, by pointing to the distinctive position of semicolonial societies in the Western-dominated world order, the chapters in this book make significant contributions to developing the critical theoretical perspectives of international cultural studies. The contributors demonstrate how the disciplines of history, anthropology, political science, film and cultural studies all enhance these contestations in intersecting ways, and across different historical moments. Each of the chapters raises manifold themes and questions regarding the nature of intercultural exchange, interrogated through theoretically critical lenses. This book directs its discussions at those studying not only in the fields of Thai and Southeast Asian studies but also in colonial and postcolonial studies, Asian cultural studies, film studies and comparative critical theory.<br>

  Publisher: Utah State University Press<br>
  Author(s): JAMIESON SANDRA<br>
  Abstract: Points of Departureencourages a return to empirical research about writing, presenting a wealth of transparent, reproducible studies of student sources. The volume shows how to develop methods for coding and characterizing student texts, their choice of source material, and the resources used to teach information literacy. In so doing, the volume advances our understanding of how students actually write.The contributors offer methodologies, techniques, and suggestions for research that move beyond decontextualized guides to grapple with the messiness of research-in-process, as well as design, development, and expansion. Serviss and Jamieson's model of RAD writing studies research is transcontextual and based on hybridized or mixed methods. Among these methods are citation context analysis, research-aloud protocols, textual and genre analysis, surveys, interviews, and focus groups, with an emphasis on process and knowledge as contingent. Chapters report on research projects at different stages and across institution types-from pilot to multi-site, from community college to research university-focusing on the methods and artifacts employed.A rich mosaic of research about research,Points of Departureadvances knowledge about student writing and serves as a guide for both new and experienced researchers in writing studies.Contributors: Crystal Benedicks, Katt Blackwell-Starnes, Lee-Ann Kastman Breuch, Kristi Murray Costello, Anne Diekema, Rebecca Moore Howard, Sandra Jamieson, Elizabeth Kleinfeld, Brian N.

The book’s title might be rendered in English as “Beginning to Do Theology.” Still in print, the volumes—entitled Introduction, Dogmatics 1, Dogmatics 2, Ethics, and Practice—are meant for an academic setting, especially for the Catholic seminary context in which most of Congar’s teaching career was spent.

The story, he wrote, would reflect the “contemporary moment (as far as possible, of course) of our inner life.” The central character would be “a certain type of Russian abroad”: Dostoevsky’s comparison of this story with hisNotes from theHouse of the Deadis of particular interest.

We shall not encounter a single binding concept of reality in Dostoevsky’s thought; rather, his notion of reality is a syncretism.³ Reality for him embraces concrete, historical reality with its classes, its immediate problems and conflicts, and its social and national types which give expression to the<br>

Peirce (1839–1914), who developed a graphic formalism for evaluating the logical precision of scientific concepts, continues to be an important inspiration for the development of approaches to language that move beyond the synchronic, descriptive, and generative perspectives characteristic of the mainstream of linguistics scholarship. Many students of language first encountered Peirce’s semiotic ideas in the early 1920s in the ten pages of excerpts printed as an appendix to Ogden and Richards’s

  Abstract: According to the editors at the Peirce Edition Project, in 1903 Peirce composed a detailed “syllabus” in several sections for the eight lectures he delivered at the Lowell Institute in Boston. The fifth section of that syllabus, titled “Nomenclature and Divisions of Triadic Relations, as Far as They Are Determined” (
                  EP2, 289–99;CP2.233–72), presents a detailed and systematic account of the 10 classes of signs generated by the intersection of three trichotomies and contains the famous (if perplexing) triangular table exhibiting the relations among these sign classes depending on the degree of shared characteristics.

  Book Title: A Theory of Musical Narrative-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALMÉN BYRON<br>
  Abstract: Byron Almén proposes an original synthesis of approaches to musical narrative from literary criticism, semiotics, historiography, musicology, and music theory, resulting in a significant critical reorientation of the field. This volume includes an extensive survey of traditional approaches to musical narrative illustrated by a wide variety of musical examples that highlight the range and applicability of the theoretical apparatus. Almén provides a careful delineation of the essential elements and preconditions of musical narrative organization, an eclectic analytical model applicable to a wide range of musical styles and repertoires, a classification scheme of narrative types and subtypes reflecting conceptually distinct narrative strategies, a wide array of interpretive categories, and a sensitivity to the dependence of narrative interpretation on the cultural milieu of the work, its various audiences, and the analyst.
      A Theory of Musical Narrativeprovides both an excellent introduction to an increasingly important conceptual domain and a complex reassessment of its possibilities and characteristics.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005szf">A Theory of Musical Narrative</a><br>
  Abstract: Musical narrative resists simple formulation, its complex identity emerging through a confluence of factors. First, the essential characteristics of narrative are partly obscured by the distinct inflections given it by the different media through which it manifests itself. Dramatic narrative is phenomenally immediate, realized by characters and settings both visually and audibly present. Literary narrative is likewise relatively specific with respect to character and setting, but is constructed through verbal description and dialogue. Mythic narrative invokes characters, settings, and/or themes with numinous cultural significance, situating these elements in an idealized, hyper-real manner. Historical narrative ostensibly employs real events and characters<br>

  Abstract: Musical representations of tragedy are sites of potential confusion between narrative and topical signification. This is largely due to the relative ubiquity of tragic
                  topoiin music literature, in combination with a degree of familiarity on the part of the scholarly community about what characterizes a tragictopos. Certain stylistic and paradigmatic conventions of various historical durations—minor mode, slow tempo, sigh figures, descending gestures, chromaticism, expressive dissonances, funeral march, low register, exact repetition—easily call to our minds pieces that are tragic in a topical sense: the “Crucifixus” in Bach’s Mass in B minor, the first movement of Beethoven’s<br>

  Abstract: Televised history has become the focus of growing academic research, which examines its uniqueness compared to the tradition of written history, and emphasizes its significant role in shaping collective memory. Film and television became central mechanisms of memory construction during the second half of the twentieth century and Western scholarship has long been emphasizing the power of fictional as well as documentary film in the representation of history¹ and defending television’s capabilities to “mediate” history successfully against those who doubt it.² According to Edgerton, televisual characteristics such as immediacy, dramatization, personalization, and intimacy, all shape the medium’s interaction with the<br>

In this, art mirrors life itself. Nevertheless, in spite of the admitted plurality, he issues a call for an “open aesthetics” and an “aesthetic pluralism” and asks, “Is there really an aesthetics that cuts across all human<br>

  Book Title: Novelas españolas ambientadas en Italia-Fra Filippo Lippi de Emilio Castelar; Bomarzo de Manuel Mujica Lainez<br>
  Publisher: Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca<br>
  Author(s): SANTOS M.ª ALMUDENA MATEOS<br>
  Abstract: Las fuentes en las que se fundamenta la novela histórica proporcionan, además de una ambientación correcta de la acción, la veracidad necesaria para que el lector reconozca el trabajo llevado a cabo por el autor. Este estudio se centra en descubrir las fuentes históricas, literarias, artísticas, religiosas y culturales de dos novelas muy diferentes que comparten un marco común, el Renacimiento Italiano. Mientras que en Fra Filippo Lippi de Emilio Castelar (1877-1879) la exactitud histórica se presenta sólo en determinados capítulos que parecen ralentizar la acción, en Bomarzo de Manuel Mujica Lainez (1962), lo histórico está tan integrado que es difícil detectar qué parte se corresponde con la historia y cuál con la ficción. Las fuentes consultadas por los autores e incorporadas al texto narrativo proporcionan laexhaustividad necesaria para que el ambiente histórico recreado sea preciso. Al confrontar dichas fuentes con el texto literario se observa cómo, además, el marco creado ayuda a delimitarla psicología de los protagonistas, pues, aunque son personajes históricos, los autores crean una vida de ficción a partir de los hechos históricos. Por otro lado, las referencias literarias (correspondientes a un periodo que va desde los siglos XV y XVI hasta el presente de los autores) aportan el marco necesario para que los protagonistas sean portadores de una nueva inmortalidad. La exactitud de las descripciones, la configuración de los caracteres tanto renacentistas como contemporáneos, las perspectivas artísticas o religiosas, configuran estas dos obras en una serie de coincidencias difíciles de obviar.The sources, which the historical novel is based on, provide the correct setting of the action and the necessary truthfulness for the reader to recognise the work carried out by the author. This research focuses on discovering the historical, literary, artistic, religious and cultural sources of two very different novels that share common framework of the Italian Renaissance. In Fra Filippo Lippi by Emilio Catelar (1877-1879) the historical accuracy is presented only incertain chapters, and slow down the action, whereas in Bomarzo by Manuel Mujica Lainez (1962), historical facts are integrated in such a way that it is difficult to detect which parts belong to fiction or non-fiction. The sources consulted by the authors and which are incorporated into the narrative text provide the necessary detail for the recreated historical environment to be accurate. Additionally, when comparing these historical sources with the literary text, it is obvious how the historical facts help to demonstrate the psychology of the main characters because, although they are historical characters, the authors create a living fiction based on historical events. The literary references, belonging to a period that covers the fifteenth and sixteenth century to the present of authors contribute the necessary details so that the main characters are bearers o fa new immortality. The accuracy of descriptions, the representation of both Renaissance and Contemporary characters and artistic and religious perspectives present us with a series of coincidences too obvious to ignore.<br>

This meta-analysis of the resilience findings inductively identifies resources that make some difference in resilience outcomes.

Previously, we saw that resilience research offers anthropological insights about extreme cases of adversity, as well as more typical challenges to growth. In this chapter, I widen the focus, by addressing how these studies relate to ethical principles and moral reflection. Aquinas’ virtue anthropology and moral theology offer a qualitative vision of human<br>

  Author(s) Shannon Daniel E.<br>
  Abstract: Kenneth Schmitz has written on a great number of philosophical subjects, often dealing with questions of humanity and its relation to the transcendentals: being, truth, unity, beauty, and goodness. In some of his writings he has focused not just on the metaphysics, but also on the aesthetics of this relationship. For instance, in a recent essay, “The Lustrous Power of Beauty,” he holds that “To claim that being is itself beautiful is a statement about the fundamental character of reality. It is an affirmation of the positive character of existence” (“Lustrous,” 237).¹ Later in the same lecture, he ties the<br>

  Author(s) Dougherty Jude P.<br>
  Abstract: Cultural historians necessarily deal in broad generalizations. Whatever is affirmed of a period, a people, or a nation, no matter how well-grounded by factual study and reflection, is subject to qualification. Exceptions to broad characterizations may always be found without mitigating the value of the broader insight. We grasp something when an author refers to the Greeks, to Roman civilization, to the Hellenic period, to Christendom, to the Benedictines, to the Renaissance, or to the Enlightenment. These designations, all generalizations formed by an examination of a host of particulars, indeed refer to something intelligible, something quite apart from the mind.¹<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2851kc">A Sacred Kingdom</a><br>
  Abstract: This book is an examination of the interaction between bishops and kings from the Gallic period of the fourth century to the breakup of the Carolingian Empire in about 850. We will see that kings and bishops powerfully influenced one another, and that the character of kingship was transformed in the course of the creation of the Carolingian Empire by the ideas, law, and ritual activities of bishops. Indeed, the building of the Empire and the sense of religious mission that inspired it can, to a significant extent, be attributed to the royal adoption of an episcopal platform. Royal power<br>

  Author(s) Sudo Ken-ichi<br>
  Abstract: The traditional political communities of the central Caroline Islands, from Ulithi to Namonuito Atoll, are characteristically small. A politically autonomous community may consist of a single village, a district or a small island, each composed of matrilineal descent groups. The total population of an island or an atoll is, on average, less than 800 persons and its land area is at most five square kilometres in extent. Some scholars have suggested that institutionalized chieftainship in Micronesia, as a form of suprafamilial authority, is directly related to surplus food production (e.g. Mason 1968). Therefore, due to their meagre resource base, the<br>

  Author(s) Sather Clifford<br>
  Abstract: The characterization of societies as ʺegalitarianʺ — in Borneo as elsewhere in the non-Western world — has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years (Boehm 1993; Flanagan and Rayner 1988; Flanagan 1989; Woodburn 1982). Even so, despite this newfound interest, compared to ʺhierarchyʺ, notions of equality have been far less explored in the anthropological literature. Part of the reason is almost certainly as Flanagan (1989:261) suggests: that equality tends to be ʺnaturalizedʺ in the social sciences and so regarded as the proto-cultural condition out of which structures of inequality are presumed to have developed by evolutionary differentiation (cf. Fried 1967).<br>

  Author(s) DALFERTH INGOLF U.<br>
  Abstract: The idea of an Axial Age has many facets. However, in Karl Jaspers’ thought its decisive feature “is man’s reaching out beyond himself by growing aware of himself within the whole of Being.”¹ “In some way or other man becomes certain of transcendence,” and thereby becomes human in a new and decisive sense: “It is impossible for man to lose transcendence, without ceasing to be man.”² Reference to transcendence is the defining characteristic of Axial man.³ Its correlate in human life is “faith”—not the faith of a particular religious tradition but what Jaspers calls “philosophic faith,”⁴ a faith that<br>

  Abstract: The theory of the Axial Age is the creation of philosophers and sociologists, not of historians and philologists on whose research the theory is based. It is the answer to the question for the roots of modernity. When and where did the modern world begin as we know and inhabit it? The historian investigates the past for the sake of the past. The quest for the roots of modernity, however, is not interested in the past as such but only as the beginning of something held to be characteristic of the present. These are two categorically different approaches that must<br>

  Abstract: A common perception associated with the classic western suggests characters welded to their notions of right judgment, characters who will not deviate from their code of honor, regardless of consequences. The honor implied in such deliberate devotion to duty is characteristically celebrated, at least on the surface, in the acts and speeches of typical heroes. It follows that the unyielding posture of the hero suggests a certain understanding of ethics. A strong hero is committed to his course of action because he sees the necessity to choose in a particular way, as the right thing to do, regardless of public<br>

  Abstract: The “Wild West,” as depicted in the cinematic genre of the western, is “wild” not only in the sense that it is portrayed as an untamed land of lawlessness, but also in the sense that the films present us with a variety of “wild” but colorful characters, some of whom are considered notorious, while others are treated as role models. From charismatic individuals and brave groups of pioneers who sharply depict moral dispositions in their pursuit of law and order to villains, bandits, and gangs of outlaws who seek to challenge such order, the western ethos is built on stories<br>

  Abstract: A defining feature of science fiction is that such works of imaginative realism (a potent stylistic brew of perhaps irreconcilable elements) speculate about some future age or alternative, extraterrestrial world. That imagined place and time is characterized essentially by “advancements” in science that plausibly explore the consequences of what is now known and actively researched (in such areas as artificial intelligence, genetic manipulation, space travel, pharmacology, and so forth). The difference between the reader’s implied present and the postulated alternative results from the technological manipulation of the natural environment and human experience that such acquired knowledge makes possible.<br>

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Neo-Noir-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Conard Mark T.<br>
  Abstract: Film noir is a classic genre characterized by visual elements such as tilted camera angles, skewed scene compositions, and an interplay between darkness and light. Common motifs include crime and punishment, the upheaval of traditional moral values, and a pessimistic stance on the meaning of life and on the place of humankind in the universe. Spanning the 1940s and 1950s, the classic film noir era saw the release of many of Hollywood's best-loved studies of shady characters and shadowy underworlds, including Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, Touch of Evil, and The Maltese Falcon. Neo-noir is a somewhat loosely defined genre of films produced after the classic noir era that display the visual or thematic hallmarks of the noir sensibility. The essays collected in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir explore the philosophical implications of neo-noir touchstones such as Blade Runner, Chinatown, Reservoir Dogs, Memento, and the films of the Coen brothers. Through the lens of philosophy, Mark T. Conard and the contributors examine previously obscure layers of meaning in these challenging films. The contributors also consider these neo-noir films as a means of addressing philosophical questions about guilt, redemption, the essence of human nature, and problems of knowledge, memory and identity. In the neo-noir universe, the lines between right and wrong and good and evil are blurred, and the detective and the criminal frequently mirror each other's most debilitating personality traits. The neo-noir detective -- more antihero than hero -- is frequently a morally compromised and spiritually shaken individual whose pursuit of a criminal masks the search for lost or unattainable aspects of the self. Conard argues that the films discussed in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir convey ambiguity, disillusionment, and disorientation more effectively than even the most iconic films of the classic noir era. Able to self-consciously draw upon noir conventions and simultaneously subvert them, neo-noir directors push beyond the earlier genre's limitations and open new paths of cinematic and philosophical exploration.<br>

  Problems of Memory and Identity in Neo-Noir’s Existentialist Antihero from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jcts3">The Philosophy of Neo-Noir</a><br>
  Author(s) Spicer Andrew<br>
  Abstract: One of the most arresting traits of film noir is its depiction of male protagonists who lack the qualities (courage, incorruptibility, tenacity, and dynamism) that characterize the archetypal American hero and who therefore function as antiheroes. Typical noir male protagonists are weak, confused, unstable, and ineffectual, damaged men who suffer from a range of psychological neuroses and who are unable to resolve the problems they face. Noir’s depiction of its male protagonists—what Frank Krutnik calls its “pervasive problematising of masculine identity”—is expressive of a fundamentally existentialist view of life.¹ As Robert Porfirio argues, noir’s “nonheroic hero” is such<br>

                     Hard Eight(1996), the first-time writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson offers a distinctly modern interpretation of a character type familiar from the original era of noir. In his contemporary rendering, which is neither reverential homage nor postmodern deconstruction, Anderson offers an elegant, rigorous character study as well as a provocative reexamination of some of noir’s central philosophical, thematic, and visual motifs. Confronting universal moral issues—guilt and innocence, crime and punishment—raised by earlier crime dramas, the film investigates the possibilities of salvation within a traditionally treacherous cinematic realm.<br>

Historians naturally participated both in the summing up and in the more tentative forecasts. Not surprisingly, historians are much better qualified to analyze the events of yesteryear than to predict what might happen tomorrow. But they—or I should say we—do work under the assumption that by detecting some trends, undercurrents, structures, evolutionary predilections, or revolutionary preconditions, which characterized past events, we might be better prepared for them in the future as well.

  Abstract: THE TWO TERMS in the title of this chapter, “truth” and “authorship,” have long been central topics in narrative research. They remain ineludible because they are not only core elements of narrativity but also raise key questions about the roles of narrative in social life. The chapter seeks to show how truth and authorship are shaped by the path taken by witnesses’ depositions within the institutional meanders of the justice system. It does so by focusing on the multilateral character of storytelling in institutions and the complex processes of entextualization, decontextualization, and recontextualization.<br>

  14  Truth and Authorship in Textual Trajectories from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt629">Telling Stories</a><br>
  Author(s) CARRANZA ISOLDA E.<br>
  Abstract: THE TWO TERMS in the title of this chapter, “truth” and “authorship,” have long been central topics in narrative research. They remain ineludible because they are not only core elements of narrativity but also raise key questions about the roles of narrative in social life. The chapter seeks to show how truth and authorship are shaped by the path taken by witnesses’ depositions within the institutional meanders of the justice system. It does so by focusing on the multilateral character of storytelling in institutions and the complex processes of entextualization, decontextualization, and recontextualization.<br>

  Author(s) NAZIKIAN FUMIKO<br>
  Abstract: ANIME IS A STYLE OF ANIMATION, commonly referred to as Japanese animation, that is popular not only in Japan but around the world. This popularity is in part due to the intriguing stories and the interesting roles played by anime characters. Using a discourse-based microanalysis, this chapter examines the role of speech styles in the context of storytelling, especially focusing on the role of style shifting in Japanese. Using anime as data, I attempt to show how people choose certain linguistic resources to present various images of themselves or others to fulfill various communicative goals. More specifically, I investigate a<br>

  Abstract: Freud’s colossal prejudices, in Wittgenstein’s view, all stem from three underlying assumptions of Freudian theory which he implicitly or explicitly contests. The first of these is psychic determinism, which Freud himself regularly presented as a constitutive preconception that could not be questioned. As Sulloway writes: “Freud’s entire life’s work in science was characterized by an abiding faith in the notion that all vital phenomena, including psychical ones, are rigidly and lawfully determined by the principle of cause and effect” (

  8.  A Secular Age? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tv6pd">Being in the World</a><br>
  Abstract: At least in the Western context, our age is commonly referred to as that of “modernity”—a term sometimes qualified as “late modernity” or “post-modernity.” Taken by itself, the term is nondescript; in its literal sense, it simply means a time of novelty or innovation. Hence, something needs to be added to capture the kind of novelty involved. To pinpoint this innovation, modernity is also referred to as the “age of reason” or the age of enlightenment and science—in order to demarcate the period from a prior age presumably characterized by unreason, metaphysical speculation, and intellectual obscurantism or darkness.<br>

  PRAGMATIC ETHICS IN CHARLES JOHNSON’S FICTION from:

  Author(s) STORHOFF GARY<br>
  Abstract: Charles Johnson is an extraordinarily innovative American writer whose work revolves around profound ethical issues. Because his ethics emerge from the philosophy he studied in graduate school, his ethical outlook is complex and difficult to discern—primarily because his is a dissenting voice from current philosophical schools of ethics.¹ Contemporary Western philosophy usually treats ethics as primarily the moral evaluation of specific actions.² However, such an approach is insufficient for a novelist with Johnson’s convictions. Johnson’s philosophical inclination is the evaluation of the whole person, in evaluating character traits that make an individual good and that lead to a worthwhile<br>

  Abstract: This book explores the strong presence of West African drumming and dance at North American universities, an ongoing process since 1964 that I describe as a resurrection. To offer a better understanding and appreciation of the reasons for calling West African drumming in the American academy a novelty, presence, and resurrection of a genre, it is crucial to situate this discussion by first evoking the broader a priori historical context that characterized the absence, disruption, and suppression of a symbolic musical tradition. Accordingly, I subsume this chapter under two historical phases: (1) Slavery (1619–1863), and (2) After Slavery until<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapters I have implicitly shown that the phenomenal changes that characterized the transformation of a genre from a state of neglect to that of serious embrace in the universities cannot be attributed to happenstance or only to broad changes in cultural landscapes and policies of American universities. Certainly, collective actions by groups toward change in any social, cultural, and academic context need to be acknowledged. However, this chapter provides an explicit discussion of categories of individuals who have significantly contributed and continue to contribute in establishing the presence of West African drumming and dance in their respective<br>

  Abstract: John 6 offers a unique view of Jesus Christ. It begins with a miracle of the loaves and fishes, continues with a miracle of Jesus walking on water, and then culminates with the bread of life discourse. Almost all biblical scholars and theologians recognize some connection between the miraculous multiplication of physical bread and the subsequent discourse on the bread of life. But what is the character of that living bread come down from heaven? Is the bread of life simply equivalent to Jesus’ wisdom from on high, or is it the Eucharistic flesh of Jesus?

  Author(s) Kitanaka Junko<br>
  Abstract: Depression has long been represented in the West as a quintessential female malady, where women are said to be twice as likely as men to become depressed. This gender ratio has been used by some feminists to argue that depression epitomizes women’s suffering (Jack 1991). Japan poses a challenge to this characterization, however, because, until recently, rates of male depression had been as high as – sometimes even higher than – those of women. Throughout the twentieth century, numerous Japanese psychiatrists have commented on this statistical anomaly (e.g., Hirasawa 1966; Naka 1932; Nakane et al. 2004). As Margaret Lock called to our<br>

  Abstract: In the 1940s, a disabling syndrome was identified in France. This disorder, spasmophilia, which literally means “to like spasms,” was characterized by a range of symptoms including muscular spasms and hyperventilation, as well as cramps, convulsions, loss of memory, insomnia, migraines, stress, anxiety, the “neurotic triad” of hypochondriasis, depression, and hysteria, and other personalized symptoms (Durlach and Bara 2000, 98–9 and 129).

  Abstract: The challenge of the Truth Matters conference call to “reclaim truthfulness for the academic enterprise” underscores that a commitment to truth is not an abstract principle but a concrete action.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b8xg">Configuring Community</a><br>
  Abstract: As the preceding chapters show, this study of community must remain in the interrogative. Attempts to draw clear-cut conclusions on community would result in a discursive stasis, whereby the larger context of modernity and postmodernity—as late modernity or an intensification of the tensions between discourse and practice that characterise modernity—would be lost. The notion of community in postmodern Spain can be seen to be foregrounded in political and cultural contexts over emphases on nation or state. Nevertheless, community is itself a problematic concept: necessarily fluid in order to survive in current contexts, yet loaded with the fixed structures<br>

It marks the moment when Mann realized that he could imaginatively expand his identity to the extent that he could identify with persons and characters far removed from his own experience and disposition. I will seek to show that Felix Krull offers a creatively adaptable model of identity, and that it presents art and aesthetics as being central to the development of the individual subject.<br>

  Abstract: For Milton’s seventeenth-century readers this passage, introducing one of the more prominent of the fallen angels, would have been immediately recognizable as a brief but trenchant essay on the art and character of the rhetorician. Indeed in these few lines Milton has managed to gather and restate with great rhetorical force (a paradox of which more later) all of the traditional arguments against rhetoric. Even Belial’s gesture of rising is to the (negative) point: he catches the eye even before he begins to speak, just as Satan will in Book IX when he too raises himself and moves so that<br>

  Author(s) Roberts Patricia<br>
  Abstract: A recurrent issue in the study of public discourse is whether a public sphere might be so constituted as to be both free and liberatory: free in the sense that it would be perfectly inclusive; liberatory in that it would enable participants to identify and critique coercion in institutions. Jürgen Habermas’s lifelong project might best be understood as an attempt to define the characteristics of a sphere with both such qualities, as well as to argue the feasibility of attaining it. The recent translation of Habermas’s early book,

Yet it is more useful to think of humans first as symbolic animals, rather than cultural animals, for symbolic abilities underlie the existence of both cultures and societies. The species, at the same time that its brain physically evolved, adding a cerebral cortex to its limbic core, increasingly replaced immediate, instinctual responses with delayed, thoughtful actions, mediated through symbols.

Recently some attention has focused on how Abstract Expressionism came to critical prominence and on the political and cultural implications of this new avant-garde, due to the apparent congruence between an aesthetic that stressed individuality and vigour and the Cold War liberal ideology of the postwar Truman era, which equated these two characteristics with Western (American)<br>

The ideal of self-governing citizenship guided the development of the Greek city and survived its decline. That early ideal, however, had been political rather than individual. It aimed at enabling a select group of citizens to live in conditions of communal equality andautarkeia.

Thus it is reasonable to assert that the primary function of a healer is to ease a patient’s suffering, while striving to cure a disease or ameliorate its effects.

This claim is central to Levinas’s thought and indeed, as will be made clear, figures importantly in relation to problems of rhetoric, ideology, and idolatry within discourse.

  Chapter 10  Freedom and Reason from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bsjw">Metaphysics in Ordinary Language</a><br>
  Abstract: I begin with an informal statement of three different theses concerning the relation between freedom and reason. According to the first thesis, freedom is a consequence of the subordination of the intellect to independent formal structure. One finds a version of this thesis, for example, in Plato’s
                     Sophistat 253c6ff, where dialectic, or the science of the combination and separation of forms—also referred to as division in accordance with kinds—is identified by the Eleatic Stranger and the young mathematician Theaetetus as the science that characterizes the free man.<br>

  Beyond Hays’s Echoes of Scripture in the Letters of Paul: from:

  Author(s) Bates Matthew W.<br>
  Abstract: The vocabulary and cadences of Scripture—particularly of the LXX—are imprinted deeply on Paul’s mind, and the great stories of Israel continue to serve for him as a fund of symbols and metaphors that condition his perception of the world, of God’s promised deliverance of his people, and of his own identity and calling. His faith, in short, is one whose articulation is inevitably intertextual in character, and Israel’s Scripture is the “determinate subtext that plays a constitutive role” in shaping his literary production.¹<br>

  Book Title: The Politics of Pessimism in Ecclesiastes-  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Sneed Mark R.<br>
  Abstract: Scholars attempt to resolve the problem of the book of Ecclesiastes’ heterodox character in one of two ways, either explaining away the book’s disturbing qualities or radicalizing and championing it as a precursor of modern existentialism. This volume offers an interpretation of Ecclesiastes that both acknowledges the unorthodox nature of Qoheleth’s words and accounts for its acceptance among the canonical books of the Hebrew Bible. It argues that, instead of being the most secular and modern of biblical books, Ecclesiastes is perhaps one of the most religious and primitive. Bringing a Weberian approach to Ecclesiastes, it represents a paradigm of the application of a social-science methodology.<br>

  1  Qohelet’s Heterodox Character: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bzwz">The Politics of Pessimism in Ecclesiastes</a><br>
  Abstract: What one can call ideational approaches typically explain Qohelet’s heterodox character as a strictly mental accomplishment or natural development of ideas, without much attention to sociohistorical factors. This way of explaining Qohelet’s dissidence has certainly been the dominant one throughout the centuries. It represents the typically theological approach of an older generation of scholars, before the advent of the now popular sociological approach.¹ With the ideational perspective, the book is often depicted as a polemic against traditional wisdom (as represented by Proverbs and the friends of Job) and its unwarranted optimism and dogmatism, without considering the sociological dimensions to these<br>

  Abstract: The following are more sophisticated analyses of Qohelet’s heterodox character that incorporate social theory and insights from the social sciences into the interpretation. Marxist approaches will be discussed first. As will be seen, almost all biblical scholars who have taken a Marxist approach to Qohelet are rather “vulgar,” seeing his worldview as merely a direct reflection of his social position, the superstructure merely mirroring the infrastructure.<br>

  Abstract: Deep in the

The issue, very extensively discussed in medieval Trinitarian theology from the twelfth century on, is whether the divine essence generates, or is generated—whether the essence itself, and not merely one or another of the divine Persons, can rightly be said to generate or beget anything, or to be generated or begotten by anything. The answer is an emphatic no: “The essence does not generate the essence.”¹ Generating and being generated are each characteristics which are proper or<br>

The late medieval and premodern period of this sojourn, dating approximately between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries, occurred during formative centuries in Iranian history, characterized primarily by the struggle to define and consolidate the borders and character of the future state of Iran.

  The Case of Lebanon: from:

  Author(s) Schulze Kirsten E.<br>
  Abstract: Jewish-Muslim relations in Lebanon before the twentieth century on the whole were characterized by amicability. Jews lived among Sunnis, Shi‘a, and Druze, and had well-functioning trade and communal relations with all of them. The nature of Jewish-Muslim relations, however, changed with the emergence of the Palestine conflict. The first strains in Sunni-Jewish relations appeared with the 1936–39 Arab Revolt. This set the pattern for sporadic violence against Lebanon’s Jews, which was motivated by solidarity with the Palestinians from the 1930s onward. The rise of pan-Arabism further underlined these sentiments, particularly among Sunni politicians. Shi‘a-Jewish relations did not become strained<br>

  Abstract: The term “Semite” gained scientific justification in the nineteenth century, in the opposition between a different family of languages and the one that comparative grammar had brought to light and circumscribed under the name “Indo-European.” This name, developed outside of the people it designated, and after it had been extended to an anthropological characterization in terms of races, was exploited in order to justify colonial domination by the European powers in the Mediterranean region. The exacerbation of nationalism and the biologization of politics led to its application against European Jewish communities at the very moment when the works of Saussure<br>

  Author(s) Barry Michael<br>
  Abstract: Texts by Islam’s greatest mystics dealing with Jews, directly or through allusion, generally dismay—at least at first glance. Contrary to usual perceptions of medieval Sufism as somehow more “tolerant,” Jewish figures in actual Classical Sufi texts appear no less devilishly caricatural as any in medieval Christian literature or art. In fact, prevailing views of Jews in either dominant medieval culture—Christian or Islamic—appear luridly similar, with Jews depicted as spiritually blind creatures who rejected Divine Truth’s light as revealed through Jesus or Muhammad. Scorn and sarcasm characterize allegorical depictions of Jews by medieval Muslim poets and also manuscript<br>

  Author(s) VENUTI LAWRENCE<br>
  Abstract: These comments are drawn from Victor Hugo’s 1865 preface to his son François-Victor’s version of Shakespeare’s works. They are worth examining, not simply because Hugo uses translation as the basis for a critique of nationalism, but because his critique at once exposes and is itself riddled with contradictions that have characterized the relations between translation and national identities, regardless of the language and culture in which the translating is performed. Formulating the contradictory implications of Hugo’s comments, then, will be a useful way to introduce my reflections on nationalist agendas in translation.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fh8vr">Shattered Voices</a><br>
  Abstract: The rapid emergence of truth commissions and their collection and creation of narratives reflects, in part, the “return to narrative” that is prominent in diverse disciplines. Historians, philosophers, theologians, moralists, anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, psychoanalysts, artists, and even legal scholars¹ have newly and increasingly embraced narrative as a valid and powerful mode of explanation and representation of reality.² This change is characterized as a “return to narrative” because narrative, once the primary mode of discourse, has been long devalued. From the time of the classical Greeks until recently, narrative was regarded as an inferior mode of discourse, frivolous and fanciful compared<br>

  Abstract: Readers of detective fiction typically admire the interpretive skill of the detective, who, in the midst of mysterious, misleading, and disparate clues, is able to discern logical and necessary connections leading invariably to the solution of the mystery. Part of the strong appeal of detective fiction, critics have suggested, is that readers can identify with the detective and achieve interpretive victory alongside him, or closely on his heels.

  Prologue: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhrv1">Dreams of Fiery Stars</a><br>
  Abstract: In Linda Hogan’s novel, 
                  Mean Spirit (1990), a character dreams of “fiery stars” that fall to earth and terminate more than five hundred years of Euro-American domination. Other contemporary Indian authors, perhaps most notably Leslie Marmon Silko in Almanac of the Dead (1991), refer frequently to various tribal prophecies predicting the restoration of the “old world.”² I borrow Hogan’s phrase for the title of this study—Dreams of Fiery Stars: The Transformations of Native American Fiction—because it concerns the counter-colonial, world-transformative efforts of writers such as Hogan. Over the past three decades, an ever-increasing number of American Indian authors<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhrv1">Dreams of Fiery Stars</a><br>
  Abstract: Contemporary fiction by Native Americans frequently traces crises of self-transformation.² Unique complications in the transformational process arise for Indian characters, sometimes on account of their half-blood or mixed-blood status, sometimes owing to their efforts to sustain tribal values in a white world, and other times due to their attempts to live by the rules of the dominant society. In the end, such characters usually shape themselves less according to traditional models drawn exclusively from a particular culture than to models that they half-invent and half-discover through bicultural experience. Thus, in their patterns of character development, American Indian narratives emphasize flexibility<br>

  Abstract: In 1935, Roman Jakobson noted that all art is influenced by an overarching principle, what the Russian Formalists called the “dominant” (1971 : 82), a structuring orientation characterizing a work or even an entire epoch. Although a narrative may have many functions and embody several forms, an internal hierarchy exists which determines the relative value of its components. The dominant of poetic language is the aesthetic function—its form. Poetry is oriented toward the sign, while prose narrative is directed toward the referent.¹ “Poetic evolution,” says Jakobson, “is a shift in this hierarchy.”<br>

  Abstract: Avicenna possessed an extraordinarily systematic vision of the structure of the cosmos—and of how it should be studied. Appreciating this fact is crucial if we are to understand his intellectual accomplishments; but it must also be kept in perspective. His passion for cohesiveness and completion led to the preoccupation with detail and demonstration that characterizes his logos writings: everything must fit, everything must hang together logically.¹ This being the case, it is not surprising that many later students of Avicenna, attracted by these very attributes of system, detail, and logical coherence, tend to view his philosophy through the prism<br>

  Abstract: At the close of the first century C.E., the early Christian text 
                  1 Clement (c.93–97) opens with a greeting from one group of Christian aliens to another: “The church of God residing as aliens (paroikousa) in Rome to the church of God residing as aliens (paroikousē) in Corinth.”¹ This was not the first text to characterize Christians in terms of their status as aliens or sojourners. But as the first century came to a close and the second century progressed, the trope proved to be an increasingly useful one. Other Christian writers made use of it in epistolary prescripts<br>

  Abstract: In an important article, Rowan Greer characterizes early Christianity in terms of what he calls “the marvelous paradox of Christians as alien citizens.”¹ That is, Christians are paradoxically “both involved in and disengaged from society.”² Greer surveys the practical outworking of this paradox in both pre-Nicene writers (
                  Diognetus, Tertullian of Carthage, Clement of Alexandria) and later authors of the fourth-century imperial church (Eusebius of Caesarea, Lactantius, John Chrysostom, Augustine). His conclusion is that, in each instance, “the paradox of alien citizenship can never be put into practice on a social scale. All the figures I have discussed state the paradox<br>

  Abstract: A trend that I will characterize as the “post-

Novels of the first phase of the nouveau roman, particularly Alain Robbe-Grillet’s The Erasers (Les Gommes, 1953), Michel Butor’s L’Emploi du temps (1957), and Claude Ollier’s La Mise en scène (1958), as well as a nouveau nouveau roman like Jean Ricardou’s Les Lieux-dits (1969), used detective-story structures.² Although they played with some traits of mystery fiction, they did not<br>

  Author(s) Ramsay Raylene<br>
  Abstract: Since the early 1950s, Alain Robbe-Grillet’s writings and films have influenced that body of French literary investigative work which reflects the “suspicion” (in Nathalie Sarraute’s sense) that the real world and natural language might be arbitrary constructions. Despite the metafictional character of his de-naturing of traditional narratives, his ex-posing of the ideologies concealed behind Western myths, and his interrogation of the hidden structures of thought and feeling (Logos and Eros) in which writer and reader are enmeshed, Robbe-Grillet’s detecting project can itself be generated only from within the traditional frames of language, myth, and feeling.<br>

  Abstract: Among contemporary novelists concerned with a problematics of time, the names of Patrick Modiano and Antonio Tabucchi figure prominently. They have made their reputation on the French and Italian literary scenes as authors of a distinctive and consistent body of work, characterized by unfathomable pasts and irretrievable identities. As a consequence, their protagonists are often detective-philosophers hot on the trail of existential and metaphysical conundrums, new Sherlock Holmeses who have turned the magnifying lens on themselves.<br>

He was fêted by all and sundry, among others by the Austrian minister who organized a masquerade ball in his honour on the theme of the Waverley novels.

  Abstract: Many authors have noticed the symbolic deficit that affects the European institutions. European citizens do not feel attached to them. For some this is the inevitable result of a process of integration that is the spill-over effect of economic integration, while for others it is the consequence of the quasisupranational character of the European Union. The current European context is a very interesting case for the study of memory building, both because it is characterized by a complex process of pooling and sharing of sovereignty between nation-states and supranational institutions and because it is a process

  Abstract: The proverb ‘You are who you know’ is the title of a scientific article on social networks (Smith-Lovin & McPherson 1993) that concisely illustrates the worldview of network researchers. The basic premise of network analysts is that the social embeddedness of actors in a web of specific relationships says a lot about their position in society. In contrast to current approaches, especially in sociology, which concentrate primarily on examining certain categorical variables like age, gender or level of educational, network researchers do not regard social systems as a collection of isolated actors with certain characteristics.

  Author(s) Bastos Susana<br>
  Abstract: In two texts written 50 years apart, Erikson (1972: 274) and Bauman (2003) both attribute the relatively recent preoccupation with identity processes to the great economic and social transformations which destroyed community life, made subjects and families culturally vulnerable and created mounting internal and international migratory fluxes which temporarily increased tolerance to uncertainties (Appadurai 1998). Erikson developed his cluster of identity concepts within a relatively closed community, based on intergenerational recognition, and characterised by an antagonistic exteriority that conveniently sanctioned its relative closure. On the other hand, Bauman (2003: 16) theorises on community fixation, in line with Fromm (1941), less<br>

  Abstract: Raymond Bellour once characterized Christian Metz’s
                  Grande Syntagmatiqueas an “opérateur théorique,” a theoretical operator, because to him this widely discussed model of a cinematic code actualized the possibility of a semiotics of cinema “by bringing its virtualness onto a material level.”¹ In a similar, though obviously different manner, the concept of “cinema of attractions” has become such a theoretical operator by creating a framework thanks to which early cinema could be seen as an object different from classical narrative cinema, as something which was not justearlycinema, that is an earlier form of what cinema was to become,<br>

They invited passers-by to come to experience a “state of shock.” This expression is appropriate to portray the first film spectator because the views represented the quintessence of what art historians have named the distraction, which characterized modernity, and that cinema historians have named “cinema of attractions.”<br>

  Abstract: In the ceaseless interplay of disorder and order in our daily lives, it is possible (and important) to imagine that there are certain situations where this unstable interaction can be held for a moment in steady state. One such suspended moment is the poem, which freeze-frames the interplay as language so that we can contemplate it, feel it, and concentrate on it. Robert Frost once characterized poetry as “a momentary stay against confusion,” and his phrase articulates with eloquent simplicity a poem’s power to lift moments of clarified drama out of the ceaseless, discombobulating flow of experience and, by doing<br>

  Abstract: Each culture has its own preferences or rules as to what constitutes the formal orderings of a lyric. For much of the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries, poetry in English was felt to be most properly constituted by accentual syllabic meter and rhyme. On the other hand, Chinese lyric poetry of the T’ang dynasty (700–950 A.D.) was defined by a whole different set of formal concepts. It not only had to have a set number of characters per line and a set number of lines (eight), but also had to exhibit an elaborate syntactical patterning: the four lines in the<br>

  Abstract: The line between the idea of cultural region, generally delineated according to human criteria, and ecological region and bioregion, defined by natural factors, would seem to be fairly sharp and clear. Sometimes, though, that line becomes blurred in ways that force closer examination of these spatial concepts and the ways that they relate to each other. For example, northern New England can be seen as a distinct literary subregion distinguished by the differences that writers more or less self-consciously draw between dominant tropes of New England regional identity as a whole and the ways of life that they feel characterize<br>

Bioregional literary criticism, Robertson continues, is characterized by the drive “to identify and understand the niche of writers in their bioregional habitat” (1017).<br>

  Book Title: Seasons of Misery-Catastrophe and Colonial Settlement in Early America<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DONEGAN KATHLEEN<br>
  Abstract: The stories we tell of American beginnings typically emphasize colonial triumph in the face of adversity. But the early years of English settlement in America were characterized by catastrophe: starvation, disease, extreme violence, ruinous ignorance, and serial abandonment.
      Seasons of Miseryoffers a provocative reexamination of the British colonies' chaotic and profoundly unstable early days, placing crisis-both experiential and existential-at the center of the story. At the outposts of a fledgling empire and disconnected from the social order of their home society, English settlers were both physically and psychologically estranged from their European identities. They could not control, or often even survive, the world they had intended to possess. According to Kathleen Donegan, it was in this cauldron of uncertainty that colonial identity was formed. Studying the English settlements at Roanoke, Jamestown, Plymouth, and Barbados, Donegan argues that catastrophe marked the threshold between an old European identity and a new colonial identity, a state of instability in which only fragments of Englishness could survive amid the upheavals of the New World. This constant state of crisis also produced the first distinctively colonial literature as settlers attempted to process events that they could neither fully absorb nor understand. Bringing a critical eye to settlers' first-person accounts, Donegan applies a unique combination of narrative history and literary analysis to trace how settlers used a language of catastrophe to describe unprecedented circumstances, witness unrecognizable selves, and report unaccountable events.Seasons of Miseryaddresses both the stories that colonists told about themselves and the stories that we have constructed in hindsight about them. In doing so, it offers a new account of the meaning of settlement history and the creation of colonial identity.<br>

  Abstract: There are many ways to understand children’s work as translators and interpreters for their families. We can focus on the burdens it sometimes places on youth and on how stress affects children’s growth and development. Turning this perspective around, we can highlight the cognitive, social, emotional, and linguistic benefits these experiences may offer to youth. We can either reject children’s involvement as a form of youth exploitation or applaud youths’ contributions to homes, schools, communities and society. We can talk about character formation, skills acquisition, and the pathways that are opened or closed through engagement in these activities, or we<br>

  Author(s) OLAJUBU OYERONKE<br>
  Abstract: Indigenous religions are often characterized by plurality, but the term “plurality” is an inadequate descriptor of people’s lived experience. Rather than plurality, in this essay, I emphasize mutuality, accommodation, and balance. The Yoruba religion is one of such indigenous religions that prioritize balance and mutuality in relationships between God and humans, humans and nature, and in interpersonal relationships. Dividends of this stance can be discerned in power relations, gender relations, and power utilization among adherents of Yoruba religion.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjbhp">Thinking About Dementia</a><br>
  Author(s) BALLENGER JESSE F.<br>
  Abstract: This oft-quoted characterization of the seventh and final stage of a person’s life has usually been taken as a commonplace of old age: this period has always been stigmatized. In particular, the mental losses associated with age, “second childishness and mere oblivion,” have been among the most deeply stigmatized conditions. In its frightening totality—effacing the memories and abilities that are widely seen as the very essence of personhood—senile dementia seems to taint the entire experience of aging. In its relentless inevitability, deeply associated with aging and the mere passage of time, it makes a mockery of the achievement<br>

  Author(s) KONTOS PIA C.<br>
  Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease is regarded as the most bewildering and frightening condition facing the aging population in the twenty-first century (Schroeder et al. 1990) and represents a much feared stigmatizing label that carries with it the force of a sentence of social death (Robertson 1991). As Herskovitz notes, senility is characterized as “monstrosity” by the lay media with “clichéd metaphors and representations in which Alzheimer’s is characteristically drawn in colourfully dramatic terms that paint vividly disturbing images” (1995, 152–153). Alzheimer’s is described as a living death, a never ending funeral, and a private hell of devastation.<br>

  Abstract: THIS BOOK is intended for the practicing social scientist or social science student. It is concerned with actual research, and focuses on three main questions: (1) What are the actual goals of the various current research methods? Call the goals “truth” or “knowledge”; then what characteristics does achieved truth have in the various methods? (2) What social, cognitive, and personality processes occur or should occur during research, and how do they contribute to the outcome? (3) What persistent weaknesses and dangers appear in research, and what can we do about them?<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjq68">Dancing Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: Traditionally, metaphysics searches for essences, but the post-metaphysical quest leans more toward potentials. Martin Heidegger puts it this way: “Higher than actuality lies
                  possibility.” Metaphysics as a branch of philosophy studies the nature of being and beings, existence, time, space, movement, and causality. It also involves underlying principles and theories that form the basis of a particular field of knowledge. Heidegger conceived the primary task of metaphysics as the clarification ofbeingin his book on phenomenological metaphysics,Being and Time. In the analysis of being, he holds that phenomenology and ontology characterize philosophy itself, and that we can best<br>

  INTRODUCTION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjqxd">A Counter-History of Composition</a><br>
  Abstract: Composition has been haunted by an unseen ghost. Since the 1970s, its disciplinary discourse has been operating on assumptions that have gone unquestioned. Coded under the umbrella of romanticism—a category often used in the discipline for identifying and excluding particular rhetorical practices—vitalism has been mischaracterized and left out of most scholarship in the field. So in order to bring vitalism as a distinct theoretical body to light, this book literally begins from the margins, from two footnotes in Paul Kameen’s “Rewording the Rhetoric of Composition” and one footnote in Victor Vitanza’s “Three Countertheses.” Kameen points out that Richard<br>

  Abstract: Because he was teaching at the University of Pittsburgh at the time, Paul Kameen was a part of the academic milieu surrounding Richard Young’s NEH seminar at Carnegie Mellon University in 1978. William Coles and Otis Walter, also from the University of Pittsburgh, were guests at the seminar, and Kameen was very much aware of their work regarding the composing process and rhetorical invention. Like James Berlin, Kameen was wary of the dubious connection between Coleridge and the characterization of vitalism that Young was putting forward in the seminar. Kameen also published a key article in 1980 that put forward<br>

  Book Title: A Self-Conscious Art-Patrick Modiano’s Postmodern Fictions<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAWAKAMI AKANE<br>
  Abstract: A Self-Conscious Art is the first full-length study in English to attempt to deal with the formal complexities of Modiano’s work, by reading ‘against the grain’ of his self-professed ingenuousness. A detailed examination of his narratives shows the deeply postmodern nature of his writing. Parodying precursors such as Proust or the nouveau romanciers, his narratives are built around a profound lack of faith in the ability of writing to retrieve the past through memory, and this failure is acknowledged in the discreet playfulness that characterises his novels. This book is a timely introduction to the work of one of the most successful modern French novelists.<br>

  Abstract: It is often assumed that Modiano is a ‘realist’. One reason for this is that his prose is representational, full of small and precise details in the manner of the Barthesian ‘effet de réel’. Many of these facts, moreover, have been discovered to be real; they are precise locations in Paris, or a particular brand of cigarette commonly smoked in France. Their authenticity has convinced some readers that the narrative which contains them must be a mimetic one. Another commonly held reason for considering Modiano a ‘realist’ is the combination of readability and alleged non-experimentation which characterises his novels; in<br>

The Turkish politician’s disparaging reference to a ‘Christian club’ was certainly somewhat unfortunate; and the chair of the former Central Council of Muslims in Germany, Nadeem Elyas, was also rather careless when he adopted the same term.

  Abstract: When studying values empirically, social researchers apply a methodological perspective which differs substantially from that characteristic of philosophers, social anthropologists, or historians of ideas. In empirical research, values are treated as something ‘measurable’, measurable, above all, with the instrument of systematic surveys. This is a persistent source of irritation, and not just among non-sociologists; I shall therefore deal briefly with this methodology by way of introduction. The first thing to bear in mind is that we constantly produce rough-and-ready ‘measurements’ of values in everyday conversation.

  Author(s) Rice Alison<br>
  Abstract: Born in El Jadida, Morocco in 1938, Abdelkébir Khatibi is the author of a diverse and complex oeuvre that creatively engages with the thought of European philosophers to address the specific challenges facing postcolonial subjects from the French-speaking world. After receiving a French education in his native country while it was still a protectorate of France,¹ Khatibi pursued university studies in sociology at the Sorbonne in Paris. When questioned about this period, the writer affirmed that the years he spent in the French capital, from 1958 to 1964, were characterized by ‘great intellectual and political effervescence’ (1999: 74).

  Abstract: The Bicentenary of the French Revolution in 1989 heralded the series of commemorations by which late twentieth-century France now appears to have been increasingly characterized. In the 1990s, literature, cinema and intellectual debate all began to reflect an increasing focus on memory, a tendency also apparent in popular culture and public life. The historian Pierre Nora, inaugurating in 1984
                  Les Lieux de mémoire, a monumental collection of essays on key ‘sites’ of the French historical experience understood as having had an impact on national self-identity, presented the lack of shared post-war national memory as a rationale for alternative manifestations of<br>

  Abstract: France provides a particularly complex and fascinating object of analysis for any investigation into the impact of war on modern and contemporary cultural production and cultural history, having been at war for almost fifty years of the twentieth century. This impact is characterised by radically different experiences and memories of the two world wars, and further complicated by enduring legacies of those wars, and of subsequent, brutal colonial wars. An understanding of the impact that the experiences of these different types of war have made on French cultural, social and political identity is essential for the broader analysis of developments<br>

  Abstract: Margaret Mulvihill is one of the few Irish women writers to have written consistently about the experiences of the post-war Irish in Britain. Her three novels are all period pieces set in London in the 1980s and early 1990s and her characterizations of young Irish migrants from this time mirror some of the satirical observations in earlier work by Anthony Cronin and Donall Mac Amhlaigh. However, for Mulvihill, who was born in Dublin in 1954 and came to London in her twenties, her perspective on the subject of migration was also imbued with a pronounced feminist sensibility.

  Abstract: The novels, short stories and auto/biographical texts I have examined in this book are written and peopled by men and women who, as well as making journeys from one country to another, have embarked upon narrative journeys of the mind. Unlike the geographical journey of migration, however, narrative is not a linear process. Instead, it possesses an inherent temporal elasticity that often enables writers to deploy inventive methods and modes of storytelling and characterization. Rather than simply providing a series of period snapshots, these texts reveal how identities are configured over time as well as space. In other words, they<br>

The context I suggest is not biographical, but social and therefore, ultimately, historical; that is, I seek to locate the various affirmations and debunkings that characterize these poems in the wider, class-marked discursive economy of the Restoration. But I attempt this act of location by attention to the tone of voice and shifts of register within the poetry, and to its differing rhetorical appeals.

However, the demise of the Soviet Union and the increase in the volume, scope and speed of transnational interactions challenged this traditional assumption of anarchy and non-co-operation.

  Book Title: Heidegger and the Thinking of Place-Explorations in the Topology of Being<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Malpas Jeff<br>
  Abstract: The idea of place--topos--runs through Martin Heidegger's thinking almost from the very start. It can be seen not only in his attachment to the famous hut in Todtnauberg but in his constant deployment of topological terms and images and in the situated, "placed" character of his thought and of its major themes and motifs. Heidegger's work, argues Jeff Malpas, exemplifies the practice of "philosophical topology." In Heidegger and the Thinking of Place, Malpas examines the topological aspects of Heidegger's thought and offers a broader elaboration of the philosophical significance of place. Doing so, he provides a distinct and productive approach to Heidegger as well as a new reading of other key figures--notably Kant, Aristotle, Gadamer, and Davidson, but also Benjamin, Arendt, and Camus. Malpas, expanding arguments he made in his earlier book Heidegger's Topology (MIT Press, 2007), discusses such topics as the role of place in philosophical thinking, the topological character of the transcendental, the convergence of Heideggerian topology with Davidsonian triangulation, the necessity of mortality in the possibility of human life, the role of materiality in the working of art, the significance of nostalgia, and the nature of philosophy as beginning in wonder. Philosophy, Malpas argues, begins in wonder and begins in place and the experience of place. The place of wonder, of philosophy, of questioning, he writes, is the very topos of thinking.<br>

  Abstract: The idea of place—of
                  topos—runs through the thinking of Martin Heidegger almost from the very start. Although not always directly thematized—sometimes apparently obscured, displaced even, by other concepts—and expressed through many different terms (Ort, Ortschaft, Stätte, Gegend, Dasein, Lichtung, Ereignis),¹ it is impossible to think with Heidegger unless one attunes oneself to Heidegger’s own attunement to place. This is something not only to be observed in Heidegger’s attachment to the famous hut at Todtnauberg;² it is also found, more significantly, in his constant deployment of topological terms and images, and in the situated, “placed,” character of<br>

  Abstract: If Heidegger’s thinking is, as he himself says, a “topology of being” (
                  Topologie des Seyns)¹—a saying of the place of being—then what is the place that appears here? What is the place of being, and in what place does this thinking take place? These questions direct our attention not only to the role oftoposor place as that which is the object of Heidegger’s thinking, and so as that toward which it is directed, but to the verytoposor place within which Heidegger’s thinking emerges, and the character of that thinking as itself determined bytopos,<br>

  Abstract: According to late Heidegger, the contemporary world is suffering from an “oblivion of being”—we live, he says, in a “desolate time,” a time of destitution, a time of the “world’s night.”¹ He sees this desolation and destitution as most accurately diagnosed by two key thinkers, one of whom is the poet Friedrich Hölderlin and the other the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. It is Nietzsche who provides Heidegger with much that is foundational to his analysis of the nihilism that he takes to be characteristic of modernity, yet it is Hölderlin who provides him with a way of thinking that is<br>

                  Being and Time, of the essence of human being,Dasein, as being-in-the-world. Here the nature of “being in” is as much at issue as is the nature of “world,” and although Heidegger himself moves fairly quickly to assert, in §12 ofBeing and Time, that “being in” as it figures in relation to world is not a matter of spatialcontainment, but of activeinvolvement,¹ the analysis that follows constantly invokes the spatial at the same time<br>

How and why has it come to be the case, as it surely has, that to say of a philosophical position that it is “nostalgic” is already to indicate its inadequacy?¹ In this chapter I want to examine nostalgia both as a mood or disposition in general, and as a mood or disposition that is characteristic of philosophical reflection. Part of this inquiry will involve a rethinking of the mood of nostalgia and what that mood encompasses.

  Author(s) Greenstein Edward L.<br>
  Abstract: The book of Job, particularly its poetic core, appears to contain more unique words and linguistic usages than any comparable work from the ancient Near East. The distinctive language of Job has been attributed to a number of literary factors. For one thing, the characters and events are set in a much earlier, legendary period—the time of the patriarchs.¹ Not only does Job enjoy a lifestyle that is reminiscent of the rural, sheep-and-goat-herding Hebrew patriarchs, but the description of Job and his situation in the narrative framework of the book features language and allusions to the stories of Genesis.²<br>

On the face of it, the matter seems rather trivial: when the participants in the dialogue are unknown to the reader, they are to be mentioned by name and/or title, for the sake of clarity; but when it is clear whose move it is, no explicit indication is necessary.

                  Messiah) and the other of a more dramatic character (e.g., Mendelssohn’sElijah).² Old Testament narratives were particularly suited to the dramatic variety, although the book of Job, unusually, provided both—action from the dramatic events recounted in the prologue and epilogue, and meditation from the dialogue, notably Job’s own speeches and God’s reply.

  Abstract: One of the chief characteristics of contemporary philosophy of mind consists in the orientation toward the sciences of the mind. This feature stands in marked contrast to traditional philosophy of mind whose primary allegiance was to philosophy of language. Linguistic analysis was supposed to clarify what could sensibly be meant by the ascription of mental states. The issue was what sort of talk about the mental has a clear meaning and what, by contrast, is to be considered meaningless. This type of philosophical approach to the mind has now gone out of fashion. It was replaced by a science-based approach<br>

Whether crafting an offbeat animated feature, a box-office hit, a collection of short fiction, or an art exhibition, Burton pushes the envelope, and he has emerged as a powerful force in contemporary popular culture.<br>

  Abstract: Tim Burton’s films always contain a cast of interesting characters. Primarily, his character construction and interaction with the plot revolve around a critique of the normal. Normalcy, by whatever yardstick the viewer measures it, never goes unconsidered in a Tim Burton film. We see this in movies as diverse in setting and storytelling as
                  Edward Scissorhands(1990) andSleepy Hollow(1999). Often Burton portrays the normal people, the powerful people, and the conventionally beautiful people as possessing deep character flaws, and the entrenched systems of discourse in which they participate as pervasively corrupt.

  Abstract: In his classic study
                  Love and Death in the American Novel(1960), literary critic Leslie Fiedler famously describes Washington Irving’s “Rip Van Winkle” (1819) as the foundational text of American literature because the civilization-shunning character it celebrates is the “typical male protagonist of our fiction.” That protagonist, Fiedler claims, is typically “a man on the run, harried into the forest and out to sea, down the river or into combat—anywhere to avoid ‘civilization.’ ”¹ As Fiedler points out, civilization-scorners like Irving’s Rip have long evoked sympathy in American readers because we are suspicious of intellectuals and other fancy-pants civilizers.<br>

  Abstract: For a quarter of a century, Tim Burton has captivated audiences with his offbeat creations. Known for his macabre style and predisposition for the fantastic, Burton consistently delights viewers with his strange settings and peculiar characters. As anyone acquainted with Burton’s corpus is aware, his work is often characterized as macabre because it features death so prominently. Whether blatantly, through the presence of characters that personify death, or merely through a character’s encounter with mortality, Burton consistently reminds audiences of their finitude.

  2  An Author of Absence from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkwn0">Leo Tolstoy and the Alibi of Narrative</a><br>
  Abstract: All authors confront an empty page that needs to be filled with words, just as all struggle from paragraph to paragraph in deciding how much information the reader requires to understand settings, plots, and characters. Tolstoy was different from most in his extensive use of that which cannot be said or written as the negative space against which his fiction takes shape. For example, in
                  War and Peacehe asserts so often and so fervently that one can neither plan a battle nor describe it accurately that one wonders how the story grew to the length of four or five<br>

  5  Family Histories from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkwn0">Leo Tolstoy and the Alibi of Narrative</a><br>
  Abstract: Tolstoy intended Natasha Rostova to be an authentic character. She was unique for Tolstoy, and represents a turning point. “Natasha, in her freshness and vitality, is absolutely unprecedented in previous writings,” as Kathryn Feuer puts it, “which makes it all the more astonishing that Tolstoy seems to have created her so effortlessly.”¹ Whereas Nikolai and Andrei dramatize the metafictional debate about boundaries between fiction and reality, the novel and history, Natasha lives along the boundary of art and life. Readers might at first assume that no such boundary can be distinguished in Natasha’s life, since she is, of all characters,<br>

  Abstract: Most readers of Tolstoy will recognize the tragic and angry meditation here as characteristic of Anna’s final hours. Everything seems “dreadful” and “incomprehensible” to her as she loses herself in feelings of loneliness and estrangement. Anna’s thoughts reveal her isolation from the rest of the world and lead her to believe that “to tell another what one feels,” to foster genuine communication would be a sort of miracle.¹<br>

  Abstract: For the conclusion of this book, I would like to treat Tolstoy’s narrative alibi within the tradition of primarily western theories of authorial intent and identity. Narrative alibi is the term I have been using throughout this study to describe, first, Tolstoy’s exculpatory fictions, works like “Father Sergius,” where the author looks back at his previous sinful life and creates a narrative arc that leads toward conversion and repentance.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wp6n0">Contemporary Culture</a><br>
  Author(s) Raessens Joost<br>
  Abstract: A spectre is haunting the world – the spectre of playfulness. We are witnessing a global “ludification of culture”. Since the 1960s, in which the word “ludic” became popular in Europe and the United States to designate playful behaviour and artefacts, playfulness has increasingly become a mainstream characteristic of our culture. Perhaps the first thing that comes to mind in this context is the immense popularity of computer games, which, as far as global sales are concerned, have already outstripped Hollywood. According to a recent study in the United States, 8 to 18 year olds play computer games on average<br>

  Abstract: Since all the cultural materials discussed in this book are resolutely Occidental, I should perhaps say something about how I’ve tried to engage with the global issues facing anyone interested in these things. For my argument holds that digital technology has realized the idea of a new Library of Alexandria. That institution’s dark reciprocal, however, is the global character of the threat to memory, epitomized in the crisis of our languages. Linguists expect that by the end of this century some half of the 7,000 currently recognized languages will be extinct. In a narrow Western view, those losses occur at<br>

  Abstract: Multiplicityis a narrative structure characterized by the presentation of conflicting views within a given community about an event, an object, or a person. Corresponding to a “both/and” rhetoric that precludes an objective truth, multiplicity presents several acts of interpretation, but no one view is privileged as correct. Literary multiplicity is widespread and, according to the Russian narrative theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, it derives from the multiplicity endemic to all language, which describes a world that is “overlain with qualifications, open to dispute, charged with value, already enveloped in an obscuring mist—or, on the contrary, by the ‘light’ of alien<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wpr8v">The Economics of Creativity</a><br>
  Abstract: Action analysis in both sociology and economics faces a persistent tension. To understand how individuals differ in their behavior, we may need to define each individual’s characteristics, preferences, and resources at the onset of the course of action. This essentially leads to a long-term, propelling view of the causal determination of individual action. However, as action unfolds sequentially, within an environment of interactions, people learn from each other and about themselves in ways that cannot be fully anticipated. Can we, simultaneously, fully define the identities of social actors and the situations that bring those actors together? My view is that<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wq1rm">Signs of Science</a><br>
  Abstract: Cajal’s studies of the nervous system trace the limits of scientific realism. The workings of the cellular world obviously have global effects on the body, but the greater the detail of Cajal’s descriptions, the more difficult it becomes for him to explain human behavior in terms of cells. What is it about the branches of neurons that makes individuals think the way they do? Literary realism has similar limits. It may be obvious that environmental factors like alcoholism or poverty have dramatic effects on a person’s (and a character’s) identity, but the realist process of amassing minute observations is often<br>

  Chapter One  Sentimental Postmodernism, Identification, and the Feeling Audience from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wq429">Postmodern Texts and Emotional Audiences</a><br>
  Abstract: Postmodern literature and film have often been characterized by a thematic obsession with the disintegration of families, communities, and larger socio-political ties. Rather than painting such dark themes with the brush of tragedy, postmodern texts often adopt a tone of mocking irony or disaffected nihilism. Kathy Acker’s parodic avant-garde fiction, for example, is a complex meditation on contemporary nihilism, on the “nothingness everybody now seems to want” (
                  In Memoriam to Identity263). The hipness of postmodern disaffection was cemented with the popularity of Quentin Tarantino’s filmPulp Fiction(1994), which turns an absence of morality into fodder for black comedy.<br>

  Abstract: Why speak of Kabbalah, and then link that to Jesus? The “Kabbalah,” as that term in commonly used, refers to a movement of Jewish mysticism from the twelfth century through the Renaissance (in its initial flowering).¹ Its focus was on the mystical union with God, in a way analogous to the paths advocated by Christian mystics such as Julian of Norwich and Johannes Eckhart.

In the reflections that follow, I explore this question, particularly as it is refracted through artist Samuel Bak’s iconic image of the Warsaw Ghetto Boy² and Elie Wiesel’s character, Michael, from

  The Holocaust as a Paradigm for Ethical Thinking and Representation from:

  Author(s) Kisantal Tamás<br>
  Abstract: Representations of the Holocaust in literature raise some problems that do not emerge when dealing with other historical events—at least not so obviously. On the one hand, we are faced with problems of methods and the cultural consequences of historical representation; on the other hand, there are questions related to certain claims made by scholars of contemporary philosophy of history, asserting the relative character of historical representation. According to this relativist perspective—expressed most clearly in Hayden White's "metahistory"—any kind of historical narrative is legitimate, or more precisely, there is no external viewpoint from which any of these<br>

  About Antisemitism in Post-1989 Hungary from:

  Abstract: What is antisemitism in post-1989 Hungary? I begin with a taxonomical definition: following Fabian Virchow, I use the term "antisemitism" instead of "anti-Semitism" in order to avoid the notion that there is any kind of given "Semitism" with certain characteristics against which the antisemite holds his or her beliefs or acts. Instead, it is the antisemite who constructs the notion of the "Jew" and "Semitism" in a contingent manner (Virchow 162). The standard understanding of the notion is that of "being against Jews." If, however, we regard those definitions by which antisemitism is a "cultural code" (see Volkov), a "worldview"<br>

Kertész created a fictional character in a novel of autofiction and had his protagonist, as well as other characters in the novel, talk and act in a ways similar to those described by Arendt about Eichmann.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wq6nd">Comparative Central European Holocaust Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) Kisantal Tamás<br>
  Abstract: Representations of the Holocaust in literature raise some problems that do not emerge when dealing with other historical events—at least not so obviously. On the one hand, we are faced with problems of methods and the cultural consequences of historical representation; on the other hand, there are questions related to certain claims made by scholars of contemporary philosophy of history, asserting the relative character of historical representation. According to this relativist perspective—expressed most clearly in Hayden White's "metahistory"—any kind of historical narrative is legitimate, or more precisely, there is no external viewpoint from which any of these<br>

  About Antisemitism in Post-1989 Hungary from:

  Author(s) Hargitai Peter<br>
  Abstract: What is antisemitism in post-1989 Hungary? I begin with a taxonomical definition: following Fabian Virchow, I use the term "antisemitism" instead of "anti-Semitism" in order to avoid the notion that there is any kind of given "Semitism" with certain characteristics against which the antisemite holds his or her beliefs or acts. Instead, it is the antisemite who constructs the notion of the "Jew" and "Semitism" in a contingent manner (Virchow 162). The standard understanding of the notion is that of "being against Jews." If, however, we regard those definitions by which antisemitism is a "cultural code" (see Volkov), a "worldview"<br>

  Arendt and Kertész on the Banality of Evil from:

  Abstract: In his novel

Arendt defined a particular moral phenomenon as the "banality of evil," which she illustrated with Eichmann's own words and deeds during World War II. Kertész created a fictional character in a novel of autofiction and had his protagonist, as well as other characters in the novel, talk and act in a ways similar to those described by Arendt about Eichmann.

  Abstract: Ever since Socrates accepted the Delphic oracle’s challenge to “know thyself,” the issue of personal identity has been part of the western philosophical repertoire. That issue typically broke down into two fundamental questions. The first was one of individual identity: who am I? The second was one of universal identity: what characterizes our humanity? Only in recent history has the West added questions of cultural, linguistic, and ethnic identity: for example, what does it mean to be French Canadian? Three circumstances have supported this rather new enterprise. The first is the rise of the social sciences, especially cultural anthropology, sociology,<br>

  Book Title: The Subject in Crisis in Contemporary Chinese Literature-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Cai Rong<br>
  Abstract: Post-Mao China produced two parallel discourses on the human subject in the New Era (1976–1989). One was an autonomous, Enlightenment humanist self aimed at replacing the revolutionary paragon that had dominated under Mao. The other was a more problematic subject suffering from either a symbolic physical deformity or some kind of spiritual paralysis that undermines its apparent normalcy. How do we explain the stubborn presence, in the literature of the 1980s and 1990s, of this crippled agent who fails to realize the humanist autonomy envisioned by post-Mao theorists? What are the anxieties and tensions embedded in this incongruity and what do they reveal? This illuminating and original critical study of the crippled subject in post-Mao literature offers a detailed textual analysis of the work of five well-known contemporary writers: Han Shaogong, Can Xue, Yu Hua, Mo Yan, and Jia Pingwa. The author investigates not only the literary characters within the texts, but also their creators—real subjects in history, Chinese writers whose own agency was being tested and established in the search for a new subjectivity. She argues that, reenacting the Maoist legacy, the literary search failed to provide a viable model for a postrevolutionary China. In addition, the deficiency and inadequacy of the subject cannot always be contained in the Communist past—a history to be transcended in the design of modernity after Mao. The representation of the problematic subject thus punctured post-Mao optimism and foreshadowed the eventual abandonment of the move to rethink subjectivity in the 1990s. By diving beneath the euphoria of the 1980s and the confusion and frustration of the 1990s, these critical readings offer a unique perspective with which to gauge the complexity of China’s quest for modernity and a fuller understanding of the self’s multifaceted experience in the post-Mao era.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, I contextualize the search for a new subject in post- Mao literature. I approach the task by concentrating on two areas pivotal to the unfolding of the historical project: theory and literary practice. First, I discuss the efforts made on the theoretical front, focusing in greater detail on the aesthetic theory of what China’s well-known literary theorist in the 1980s Liu Zaifu called “subjectivity in literature.” Second, I give an overview of post-Mao representation of the subject in the New Era, examining the literary, cultural, and ideological characteristics of three models of the subject: as a sociopolitical<br>

  Abstract: The fictional characters’ lack of subjective powers I have discussed so far unquestionably contradicts the humanist model of individual worth, rationality, and self-autonomy. But this should not lead to a simplistic denial of the recovery of the writers’ own creative agency. As Lacan would tell us, the attempt to represent absence is the first step toward replacing the void, opening up possibilities for signification. The breadth and depth of the postrevolutionary inquiry into the Chinese soul in literature attest to the autonomy the writers have reclaimed from Mao’s dictatorial cultural policy. Behind the variegated representations of the subject, there is<br>

  Book Title: Out of the Margins-The Rise of Chinese Vernacular Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Ge Liangyan<br>
  Abstract: The novel Water Margin (Shuihu zhuan), China's earliest full-length narrative in vernacular prose, first appeared in print in the sixteenth century. The tale of one hundred and eight bandit heroes evolved from a long oral tradition; in its novelized form, it played a pivotal role in the rise of Chinese vernacular fiction, which flourished during the late Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) periods. Liangyan Ge's multidimensional study considers the evolution of Water Margin and the rise of vernacular fiction against the background of the vernacularization of premodern Chinese literature as a whole. This gradual and arduous process, as the book convincingly shows, was driven by sustained contact and interaction between written culture and popular orality. Ge examines the stylistic and linguistic features of the novel against those of other works of early Chinese vernacular literature (stories, in particular), revealing an accretion of features typical of different historical periods and a prolonged and cumulative process of textualization. In addition to providing a meticulous philological study, his work offers a new reading of the novel that interprets some of its salient characteristics in terms of the interplay between audience, storytellers, and men of letters associated with popular orality.<br>

The discussion, I hope, helps elucidate the fact that much of the narrative discourse indeed took shape in an oral milieu, with many elements characteristic of oral literature intact or discernible in its present textual form. Of course, the voice of the storyteller is gone forever, and it is only in the form of the printed text that the narrative exists today.

  Abstract: Considerations of center and periphery in Heian Japan involve at the highest level the relationship between the central political apparatus and the hinterlands, the sixty-six provinces and two islands (Iki and Tsushima) that constituted the conceptualized polity. Indeed, the very existence of a state presupposes control over the human and material resources of the space thought to constitute the geographical area of that conceptualized state. This was never an easy task for Japanese rulers, despite the insular character of Japan that seems to lend itself to simple mapping of a discrete geopolitical entity.

  Abstract: The Heian period has often been characterized as a golden age of Japanese religious culture, one in which the Buddhist literature, painting, sculpture, and architecture produced at court are considered to have reached unprecedented heights. It is thus all the more surprising that in this time of cultural florescence many Buddhists, monastics and aristocrats alike, understood themselves to be living in an age of decay. According to their interpretation of Buddhist chronologies, the eleventh century marked the beginning of the end: the onset of

  Abstract: On the back cover of the English edition of

The novel’s form and content, the wild proliferation of unpredictable characters, and what was perceived as a deep-seated pessimism were all difficult to reconcile with the image of Arguedas as a major cultural icon of progressive Peruvian culture.

  Book Title: Religion after Religion-Gershom Scholem, Mircea Eliade, and Henry Corbin at Eranos<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wasserstrom Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: By the end of World War II, religion appeared to be on the decline throughout the United States and Europe. Recent world events had cast doubt on the relevance of religious belief, and modernizing trends made religious rituals look out of place. It was in this atmosphere that the careers of Scholem, Eliade, and Corbin--the twentieth century's legendary scholars in the respective fields of Judaism, History of Religions, and Islam--converged and ultimately revolutionized how people thought about religion. Between 1949 and 1978, all three lectured to Carl Jung's famous Eranos circle in Ascona, Switzerland, where each in his own way came to identify the symbolism of mystical experience as a central element of his monotheistic tradition. In this, the first book ever to compare the paths taken by these thinkers, Steven Wasserstrom explores how they overturned traditional approaches to studying religion by de-emphasizing law, ritual, and social history and by extolling the role of myth and mysticism. The most controversial aspect of their theory of religion, Wasserstrom argues, is that it minimized the binding character of moral law associated with monotheism.<br>

Opposing his characterization of Judaism as the religion definitively opposed to myth—Judaism as virtually identical with a demythologized Enlightenment rationality—these post-Cohenian thinkers turned to a view of myth as a creative and living force. At least three Cohen students, Franz Rosenzweig, Ernst Bloch, and Ernst Cassirer, wrote revolutionary works that innovatively reassessed the relations between myth, the History of Religions, and Judaism.

  Abstract: A stumbling block often encountered by new readers of Mircea Eliade is the discovery that the History of Religions oddly is defined by its opposition to history. Gershom Scholem’s version of History of Religions seemed to obviate this dilemma, inasmuch as he championed historical research and the historical method. Henry Corbin used a variety of terms, such as “imaginal” and “prophetic,” to characterize his stridently antihistoricist Islamic studies. But all three shared a developed interest in metahistory. Both Scholem and Corbin thus spoke of “historiosophy.” They also spoke of their own work in terms of a kind of “counter-history.”¹ Corbin<br>

  Abstract: The book is divided into sections that address three broad subjects: the relationship between Bruno and the new science, the history of his reception in English culture, and the principal characteristics of his natural philosophy. A final essay examines why this advocate of a "tranquil universal philosophy" ended up being burned at the stake as a heretic by the Roman Inquisition. While the essays take many different approaches, they are united by a number of assumptions: that, although well versed in magic, Bruno cannot be defined primarily as a Renaissance Magus; that his aim was to articulate a new philosophy of nature; and that his thought, while based on ancient and medieval sources, represented a radical rupture with the philosophical schools of the past, helping forge a path toward a new modernity.<br>

As already briefly mentioned, during his early university days Freud explicitly rejected philosophy, because of its “speculative” character. He struggled with balancing the intellectual appeal of philosophy with the “certainty” he hoped to find in positivist science. That move heralded the series of clinical studies that would eventually emerge in the therapeutic system of psychoanalysis, a psychiatry he would consistently call a “science.” Freud never abandoned his commitment to scientific knowledge and perhaps more importantly, scientific reason.

  Abstract: What are the philosophical antecedents of Freud’s attempt to establish a science of the mind? As already briefly mentioned, during his early university days Freud explicitly rejected philosophy, because of its “speculative” character. He struggled with balancing the intellectual appeal of philosophy with the “certainty” he hoped to find in positivist science. That move heralded the series of clinical studies that would eventually emerge in the therapeutic system of psychoanalysis, a psychiatry he would consistently call a “science.” Freud never abandoned his commitment to scientific knowledge and perhaps more importantly, scientific reason. As he wrote late in his life, “Our<br>

  Book Title: The Satanic Epic-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): FORSYTH NEIL<br>
  Abstract: Satan emerges as the main challenge to Christian belief. It is Satan who questions and wonders and denounces. He is the great doubter who gives voice to many of the arguments that Christianity has provoked from within and without. And by rooting his Satanic reading of
      Paradise Lostin Biblical and other sources, Forsyth retrieves not only an attractive and heroic Satan but a Milton whose heretical energies are embodied in a Satanic character with a life of his own.<br>

  Discovering Brahms (1862–72) from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rxmx">Brahms and His World</a><br>
  Author(s) KARNES KEVIN C.<br>
  Abstract: Johannes Brahms has now presented himself as composer and virtuoso before the public in a concert of his own.⁶ Brahms’s compositions do not number among those immediately understandable and captivating works that carry one along in their flight. Their esoteric character, nobly disavowing every sort of popular effect, combined with their significant technical difficulties, assures that a broad embrace of these works will be much longer in coming than Schumann delightedly prophesized for his darling as a parting blessing.ᦍ In Vienna, none of Brahms’s larger compositions had previously been performed, and among his smaller works we had heard only a<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7s9fm">Plato's Fable</a><br>
  Abstract: The prevailing opinion about the character of reason renders this Platonic paradox quite unthinkable today. Philosophers, we learn in Plato’s fable, are ruled by reason; yet in what sense could it possibly be true that reason is necessary to
                     save us? As a fantastic arti-fice we may perhaps be entertained by this bald assertion, but to understand it as something more useful requires resources that we scarcely possess. Why this is so, and what those resources might be, is the question that concerns me here.<br>

The idea that the people are the sole legitimate source of power has come to be taken for granted. No one would dream of contesting or even questioning it. “Sovereignty cannot be divided,” as a great French republican of the nineteenth century put it. “One must choose between the elective principle and the hereditary principle.

  Abstract: In Alfred Hitchcock’s film,
                  Spellbound(1944), Gregory Peck plays the victim of a traumatic neurosis similar to PTSD. He is tormented by a memory he cannot recall but is certain that it concerns an act of terrible violence. He also suffers from a mysterious phobic horror of objects decorated with parallel lines. By the film’s end, it is discovered that the phobia mirrors a visual element of his traumatic experience, which involved attempted homicide and accidental death on a downhill ski slope. Like many of the patients who speak on the following pages, the Gregory Peck character is chronically angry<br>

  Book Title: Anthropos Today-Reflections on Modern Equipment<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rabinow Paul<br>
  Abstract: The discipline of anthropology is, at its best, characterized by turbulence, self-examination, and inventiveness. In recent decades, new thinking and practice within the field has certainly reflected this pattern, as shown for example by numerous fruitful ventures into the "politics and poetics" of anthropology. Surprisingly little attention, however, has been given to the simple insight that anthropology is composed of claims, whether tacit or explicit, about anthropos and about logos--and the myriad ways in which these two Greek nouns have been, might be, and should be, connected.
         Anthropos Todayrepresents a pathbreaking effort to fill this gap.<br>

  Abstract: The anthropology that concerns me is one that is practically and essentially mediated by a form of actual experience. There have been different names given to the practice that grounds anthropology in empirical work. The names from the past—fieldwork, participant observation—are no longer adequate to the practice I am seeking to conceptualize. Regardless of how one might best characterize this practice (a topic to which I return below), it eventually passes through one or another form of figuration, especially writing. The traditional name for that practice of figuration is ethnography, but that term is inadequate and misleading, at<br>

Cicero may have dubbed Herodotus the Father of History, but Thucydides repudiated entirely Herodotusʹs approach to the past, accusing him of fabrication and telling tall tales.² In the wake of Thucydidesʹ damning verdict, impugning Herodotusʹs reliability became, for a time, a veritable cottage industry.

  Abstract: This book began with the problem of modern wartime, that is, the problem of coordinating an awareness of violence elsewhere with everyday movements here, at a distance from the fighting. The book ends with the problem of cosmopolitanism. Another way of characterizing this trajectory would be to say it looks from the familiar scene at hearth and home to the more foreign scene of a suspension bridge set in a distant land—then looks back again. Holding together these two scenes is difficult: in one you might sit as a violent world comes to you; in the other you might<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7tbz4">Circles Disturbed</a><br>
  Author(s) LA NAVE FEDERICA<br>
  Abstract: The story of a mathematical discovery is often presented as a linear succession of events corresponding to a series of logical steps leading up to the moment of discovery by proof. The discovery itself takes on the character of a “truth revelation.” Such an accounting is cathartic. It makes us feel good about ourselves; it gives us confidence in the power of our mind. But is a sequence of logical steps all there is behind proving something in mathematics? When telling a story, one naturally lapses into a linear mode. But when trying to locate the history of a discovery,<br>

  Abstract: Mathematics has been and still is commonly viewed as independent, at least essentially or constitutively independent, of narrative or other purportedly literary or rhetorical elements, such as metaphor.¹ Indeed, this independence has been deemed to be especially characteristic of mathematics as against other sciences or philosophy, which also aspire and claim to be able, sometimes on the model of mathematics, to dispense with the constitutive role of such elements. Their auxiliary, such as pedagogical, role has always been acknowledged and, more recently, investigated in historical and sociological studies of mathematics and science, for example, in considering how narrative is used<br>

  Abstract: The narrative of the love story is traditionally structured as an ordeal of abandonment prolonged by the promise of return and resolved through metaphors of seduction, the configurations of language that release the particular from its burden of meaning. Amorous discourse is characterized by the variety of narratives that follow in the wake of this abandonment. As devotees of the genre may observe, the “story” is already over by the time Heloise composes her first passionate epistle to Abelard, or, in a more contemporary example, when the narrator of “The Tennessee Waltz” begins his plaintive hurting song.

  Abstract: In the Wednesday catecheses, John Paul II describes and analyzes the human body according to the principles of an adequate anthropology. As shown in the previous chapter, the pope explains the concept of an adequate anthropology as “an understanding and interpretation of man in what is essentially human.”¹ Through a phenomenological concentration on what is characteristic to man—subjectivity, an experience of self, and self-reflection—an adequate anthropology opposes empiricist anthropological reductionism that “reduces man to ‘the world’” and understands man only “with the categories taken from the ‘world,’ that is, from the visible totality of bodies.”²<br>

  Abstract: In his essay “Criticising the judges,”⁵ Robert Martin characterized the writing of the late justices of the Supreme Court of Canada Rand J. and Laskin C.J.C. as “abysmal,” On the other hand, he points to the “grace and felicity” of the judgments of such jurists as Lords Mansfield, Atkin, Reid, and Denning.⁶ And, in a reversal of the accustomed pattern of academics criticising judges, we find a judge commenting on the style of an academician’s writing in the Honourable Samuel Freedman’s observation that “every page” of a book introducing the Canadian legal system “is written in clear, simple, translucent prose.”⁷<br>

  CHAPTER FOUR  Science, Ideology, and the Structure of Meta-utopian Narrative from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztgwq">Russian Experimental Fiction</a><br>
  Abstract: The modern Western tradition of utopian writing, rooted in More’s
                  Utopia, is very much the product of a “scientific” mentality that has emerged over the last five hundred years. Although this mentality has been variously characterized, one of its firm bases is the epistemological concern for verifiable ways of knowing and measuring reality. Tracing the beginnings of this way of thinking in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, the comparatist Timothy J. Reiss defines an “analytico-referential” discourse founded on repeatable acts of mediated perception of the world, enabled by some invented instrument or mechanism.¹ Reiss draws particular attention to<br>

  CHAPTER FIVE  The Meta-utopian Language Problem, or Utopia as a Bump on a -log- from:

  Abstract: That language and consciousness are intimately bound up with one another is a commonplace. How they interact is harder to ascertain. Post-Saussurian literary theorists claim perhaps too much for the priority of language over consciousness.¹ Philosophers concerned with this issue, such as Nietzsche or Wittgenstein, also acknowledge the impact of language on consciousness but stress the restrictions that linguistic structures and functions put on thinking. For example, in

  CHAPTER SIX  Meta-utopian Consciousness from:

  Abstract: A consideration of consciousness provides an appropriate end point for understanding the interaction between aesthetic experiment and ideological critique in meta-utopian fiction. In its challenge to exclusivist modes of social imagination and practice there emerges in this art a different mentality characterized by an insistence on balancing public and private modes of discourse, a love of ideological play, and an acknowledgment of the thinking, discerning person. The meta-utopian consciousness is built on a distinction between apparent ideological differences (for example, the looking-glass war between modes of realism) and significant valuative oppositions and choices (for example, between didactic and ludic art,<br>

  Book Title: Milton's Epics and the Book of Psalms-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): RADZINOWICZ MARY ANN<br>
  Abstract: The Psalms were of intense interest to Milton, who read them not only as impassioned voices conveying significant moments in life's journey, but also as examples of various genres, each containing rhetorical and poetical conventions appropriate to the expressive intent of the speaker. In this book Mary Ann Radzinowicz describes the pervasive influence of these biblical works on Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained. She shows that the dramatic moments when Milton's characters respond to the numinous are shaped by his appreciation of the lyricism of the Psalms and by his studies of their thematic relationships.<br>

  Author(s) Burkhardt Richard W.<br>
  Abstract: In an obituary notice of 1882 examining the causes of Darwin’s success and the importance of Darwin’s works, the Genevan botanist and pioneer of the history of science Alphonse de Candolle identified two characteristics in particular that had made Darwin such an exceptional thinker. One was Darwin’s ability to occupy himself simultaneously with both the smallest details and the broadest theoretical considerations. The other was the extraordinary
                     rangeof Darwin’s researches and the way that each of Darwin’s separate studies, however specialized, contributed to the whole of Darwin’soeuvre(Candolle 1882).<br>

  Abstract: ‘Letters’ (
                  grammata) can mean ‘letters of the alphabet’ and also ‘epistles’ in Greek as in English. Novels contain letters of both kinds, and offer two different perspectives on the blind point of desire. Letters in the broad sense, that is to say the floating ruse of the novel as a written text, provide erotic tension on the level of the reading experience. There is a triangular circuit running from the writer to the reader to the characters in the story; when its circuit-points connect, the difficult pleasure of paradox can be felt like an electrification.

  TWO  The Body of the Sign from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv1rc">Shakespeare</a><br>
  Abstract: All shifts in modern sympathies notwithstanding, the perplexing thing about late medieval theater is still its radical union of drama with doctrine. I do not mean that there is trouble believing in the orthodoxy of the nonliturgical religious stage: despite a resurgence of Marxist criticism, and our increasing awareness of the dialogic character of all texts, I would not want to claim that the plays embody a dialectical tension between official teaching and popular expression or entertainment.¹ The difficulty, rather, is the absence of such a contradiction, and of any other obvious opposition in these texts between earnest and game,<br>

Of major interest in these first responses to the book was the behavior of its central character, the princess. A telling example is the poll organized byLe Mercure Galantthat asked its readers whether Mme. de Clèves was right to tell her husband about her love for the due de Nemours. The majority thought not.

  Abstract: When one thinks of medieval attempts to stage political power, the first image that comes to mind is the ranting Herod, and it is instructive to realize that Shakespeare’s few overt references to medieval drama include two allusions to this character. True, Shakespeare’s portraits of tyranny far surpass their medieval forbear in complexity and psychological subtlety, and both his allusions to Herod are derisive—one in Hamlet’s advice to the players, the other in Mistress Page’s characterization of Falstaff’s rhetoric. Nonetheless, Herod’s impressive theatricality is what both allusions register, and if Shakespeare saw the Coventry mystery plays—as he could<br>

  Abstract: Shakespeare’s response to the Tudor separation of styles is deeply ambivalent. On one hand, as his career ripened, he perfected what Marlowe had begun, producing a supple and evocative blank verse after a remarkably short time and creating a decorous stratification of style that mirrors the social standing of its speakers, with particularly brilliant effect in
                  Midsummer Night’s Dream.

The precisely described historical settings, the distinct characters with their clearly determined social identities, and the classical third person omniscient narration employed by Dinesen in her tales are cited in evidence. But, as Robert Langbaum observes, this surface traditionalism is principally dedicated not to the unfolding of a conventional diachronic plot, but to the construction of a synchronic thematic structure.

In this way, we have begun to recover some invisible “transitions” like those which John Scotus Eriugena considered as providing a hidden framing structure in some parables (see Preface, n. 2).

  Book Title: Neverending Stories-Toward a Critical Narratology<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tatar Maria<br>
  Abstract: In these compelling new essays, leading critics sharpen our understanding of the narrative structures that convey meaning in fiction, taking as their point of departure the narratological positions of Dorrit Cohn, Grard Genette, and Franz Stanzel. This collection demonstrates how narratology, with its attention to the modalities of presenting consciousness, offers a point of entry for scholars investigating the socio-cultural dimensions of literary representations. Drawing from a wide range of literary texts, the essays explore the borderline between fiction and history; explain how characters are constructed by both author and reader through the narration of consciousness; show how gender shapes narrative strategies ranging from the depiction of consciousness through intertextuality to the representation of the body; address issues of contingency in narrative; and present a debate on the crucial function of person in the literary text. The contributors are Stanley Corngold, Gail Finney, Kte Hamburger, Paul Michael Ltzeler, David Mickelsen, John Neubauer, Thomas Pavel, Jens Rieckmann, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, Judith Ryan, Franz Stanzel, Susan Suleiman, Maria Tatar, David Wellbery, and Larry Wolff.<br>

  ELEVEN  CROSSING THE GENDER WALL: from:

  Author(s) Finney Gail<br>
  Abstract: While the collection
                  Bolt from the Blue (Blitz aus heiterm Himmel)as a whole has not received great critical attention in the West, it aroused considerable interest and controversy in East Germany.¹ Published in 1975 as the result of Edith Anderson’s call to a number of GDR writers to create tales about sexual transformation, the anthology is a far cry from socialist realism. Indeed, if socialist realism can be somewhat simplistically characterized as “boy meets tractor” literature, as I have occasionally done in teaching it, the plot of these fantastic stories might whimsically be summarized as “boy meets self as<br>

  Author(s) Wellbery David E.<br>
  Abstract: What sorts of issues does the concept of contingency introduce into the enterprise of literacy criticism, in its broadest sense? Is there a sense in which the objects literary critics study are characterized by an element of contingency? And, if such is the case, are they indeed “objects” that could be constituted within a rigorous theoretical program? Or is contingency one of those points where the enterprise of literary criticism touches on its limits, where it takes shape, precisely, as a reflection on the limits of its own epistemological intention? Such are the questions that the following remarks, essayistically and<br>

  Abstract: The language world of Bal1 is one of remarkable richness and diversity in all its spoken, written, sung, and chanted manifestations. So various are the different linguistic forms employed, so complex the interweaving of vocal styles and literary genres, that both language and literature seem a tangled confusion that escapes characterization and conceals both sources and structures. Yet this linguistic proliferation is indeed like a richly woven fabric, no matter how complex the design, a discemable warp and weft underlie its form and provide essential unity.<br>

  Abstract: The late Shlomo Dov (Fritz) Goitcin (1900–1985) characterized the central relationship of Jews with Muslims in the first centuries of Islam as one of “creative symbiosis.” This usage has been institutionalized in the study of Judeo-Arabica, and shows no immediate signs of being dislodged from its preeminence.¹ The concept

  Abstract: This study explores the changing relation between desire and value, as they affect the protagonists’ identity, in English novels between 1850 and 1928. I examine the imaginative predilections of two mid-Victorians, two late-Victorians, and two Modernists. Each chapter seeks to identify the novelist’s characteristic stance toward desire by interrogating in detail a pair of is novels.¹ The study moves from narratives of repression and disguise in Dickens and Eliot to narratives of release and celebration in Lawrence and Joyce.<br>

  [PART ONE Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvwf7">The Semantics of Desire</a><br>
  Abstract: The chapters on Dickens and Eliot move, in their respective ways, laterally and downward. They seek to convey the imaginative geography of each writer’s world—its norms of characterization, plot sequence, and setting—as well as to identify within each world, beneath the surface, a cluster of latent confusions. I attend to Dickens and Eliot in the measure that their work reveals an internal resistance to its own premises. Indeed, one formulation of Dickens’ more capacious achievement is that his work manages (as Eliot’s does not) to assimilate—by out-maneuvering, by disguising, by blinking—its own fissures.<br>

  Abstract: The act of narrating the Genesis story is constantly frustrated; even the angelic historian finds the task daunting:“Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift / Than time or motion, but to human ears / Cannot without process of speech be told” (7.176—8). As the subject of a critical and self-conscious text, the original account of earth’s creation is fragmented;¹ and because the account competes with creation stories presented by the different characters in the poem, it is also decentred. The official historical and epic narratives are constantly intercepted by the multiple narrators in

As to why such a venture should find immediate experience so seductive, poststructuralist critiques of presence in general and of immediate experience in particular tell us little that has not already been told by Adorno, if not by Hegel: “In schools of philosophy that make emphatic use of the concept of experience, in the tradition of Hume, the character of immediacy – immediacy in relation to the<br>

The current level of vulgarization of Nietzsche’s thought is not perhaps as easily seen as what is all around us. What is all around us, in turn, is not so easy to characterize as to see.

As we have seen, poems like “Sunday Morning,” “Le Monocle de Mon Oncle,” and “The Comedian as the Letter C” express a disbelief characteristic of Humanism. The nearest thing to an admission that he was once attracted to Humanism is Stevens’ remark on his disaffection with Arnold in the letter of June 1953 to Barbara Church, cited above. Referring to Arnold’s Humanism, he remarked: “Anyhow, it may be that I don’t belong to that church anymore, or that I don’t<br>

  Abstract: Tropes and Territories demonstrates how current debates in postcolonial criticism bear on the reading, writing, and status of short fiction. These debates, which hinge on competing definitions of "trope" (motif vs rhetorical turn) and "territory" (political or aesthetic), lead to studies of space, place, influence, and writing and reading practices across cultural divides. The essays also explore the character of diasporic writing, the cultural significance of oral tale-telling, and interconnections between socio/political issues and strategies of style.<br>

  Abstract: Métis stories are something like the Rigoureau, the shape-changing wolf-man character which often appears in those stories. The Rigoureau is an amalgam of European werewolf legendry and Oji-Cree shape-changer narratives, and perhaps because of this it is a creature of liminality, a dangerous passe-partout, a trickster, a traitor, a folk hero, an outsider. In other words, it is the perfect metaphor for the slipperiness of Métis identity itself. I grew up hearing Rigoureau stories, and I was even told once that my Uncle Vic

  Abstract: Among the tropes most frequently used in postcolonial fiction, the allegory looms large. According to Fredric Jameson in “Third-World Literature in the Era of Multinational Capitalism,” all Third-World cultural constructions are national allegories and serve to contest colonialist representations. Mythic elements have been used for allegorical purposes by major writers from Kenyan novelist Ngugi wa Thiong’o to Maori novelist Witi Ihimaera. In his novel
                  Weep Not Child(1964), Ngugi notably includes the story of Mumbi and Gikuyu, the primordial Gikuyu parents, anchoring his characters in a primordial setting where divine sanction guaranteed the people’s secure possession of their land (later<br>

  Book Title: Tropes and Territories-Short Fiction, Postcolonial Readings, Canadian Writings in Context<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): NEW W.H.<br>
  Abstract: Tropes and Territories demonstrates how current debates in postcolonial criticism bear on the reading, writing, and status of short fiction. These debates, which hinge on competing definitions of "trope" (motif vs rhetorical turn) and "territory" (political or aesthetic), lead to studies of space, place, influence, and writing and reading practices across cultural divides. The essays also explore the character of diasporic writing, the cultural significance of oral tale-telling, and interconnections between socio/political issues and strategies of style.<br>

  “We Use Dah Membering”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt80b6h">Tropes and Territories</a><br>
  Author(s) CARIOU WARREN<br>
  Abstract: Métis stories are something like the Rigoureau, the shape-changing wolf-man character which often appears in those stories. The Rigoureau is an amalgam of European werewolf legendry and Oji-Cree shape-changer narratives, and perhaps because of this it is a creature of liminality, a dangerous passe-partout, a trickster, a traitor, a folk hero, an outsider. In other words, it is the perfect metaphor for the slipperiness of Métis identity itself. I grew up hearing Rigoureau stories, and I was even told once that my Uncle Vic
                  wasa Rigoureau, but I was never certain that I would know a Rigoureau if I<br>

  Abstract: Among the tropes most frequently used in postcolonial fiction, the allegory looms large. According to Fredric Jameson in “Third-World Literature in the Era of Multinational Capitalism,” all Third-World cultural constructions are national allegories and serve to contest colonialist representations. Mythic elements have been used for allegorical purposes by major writers from Kenyan novelist Ngugi wa Thiong’o to Maori novelist Witi Ihimaera. In his novel

  Abstract: One consequence of Humphries’ first autobiography,
                  More Please(1992), was the 1993 J.R. Ackerley Prize for Autobiography. As Janet Frame says in her story “Prizes” (1963), “Life is hell, but at least there are prizes.”¹ She should know: winning the Hubert Church Award for her story collectionThe Lagoon(1951) saved her from a forced leucotomy. For Frame the prize had a consequence, whereas for Humphries the prize was a consequence, yet each prize was a take in an Aristotelian absurdity of cause and effect. Whether Humphries’ life is hell, only Humphries can say; but if Jean-Paul Sartre’s character Garcin<br>

It is also, along withMy Gorgeous Life: An Adventure(1989),More Please(1992), andMy Life as Me(2002), one of the very finest of his finery of books, a wonderfully comic narrative in which Humphries stands back of all his characters, even the backgrounded women.

  Author(s) O’CONNOR DANIEL<br>
  Abstract: The purpose of this chapter is to analyze morality and ethics in cinema. This analysis is based on the assumption that morality and ethics are discourses of conduct and character. Moral discourse concerns itself with the appropriateness of conduct and action relative to situations. Rather than prevent changes in conduct and character, morality (at least in its cinematic forms) aims to control their flow and regulate their transformation (see Deleuze 1992 on control). The extent and effectiveness of these efforts can be recognized in the regularities of movement they produce. Ethics also involves movement and change, but it is concerned<br>

  Abstract: The previous chapters explored the ways in which
                  HeadhunterandThe English Patientinvoke a host of characteristic apocalyptic features. Rather than mobilize these features to recreate a full-blown apocalypse, however, both fictions rely on familiar apocalyptic topoi to launch a critique of apocalyptic eschatology.Headhunterchallenges the apocalyptic narrative by blurring the boundary between the elect and the non-elect, thereby calling into question apocalyptic notions of perfection as well as the category of the Saints of God. WhileThe English Patientmaintains the latter category, it subverts the logic of apocalypse by adopting and adapting allegory, another of its key tropes.<br>

  Abstract: There may be different ways of contrasting the Catholic and Protestant traditions. Discussing Catholic ethics first allows us to respect the chronological order in which the two appeared, and to underline the Protestant departure from orthodoxy. Since my purpose here is merely to demonstrate the opposing characteristics of the two traditions, I prefer to steer clear of any considerations of precedence. Instead I will emphasize the political consequences that can be derived from their contrary positions. I shall treat the Catholic perspective first in order to delineate a basic paradigm that will subsequently be used as a point of reference<br>

  Book Title: Aphorism in the Francophone Novel of the Twentieth Century-  Publisher: MQUP<br>

  Abstract: Aphorism in the Francophone Novel of the Twentieth Century includes critical readings of Terre des hommes by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Alexandre Chenevert by Gabrielle Roy, Gouverneurs de la rosée by Jacques Roumain, Pluie et vent sur Télumée miracle by Simone Schwarz-Bart, La route des Flandres by Claude Simon, Présence de la mort by C.F. Ramuz, and Neige noire by Hubert Aquin. Bell addresses the problems inherent in the term aphorism, the narrative and discourse function of aphorism within the genre of the novel, the interrelation between the structure of aphorism and the epistemological and hermeneutical functions this sub-genre may perform as a component part of the narrative fabric, the "national" character of aphoristics, and the problems that arise from "anthologizing" a novel's aphorisms.<br>

  Abstract: Of the seven novels under consideration in this study, Simone Schwarz-Bart’s
                     Pluie et venthas generated the smallest amount of secondary literature. For example, no thoroughgoing analysis exists of the novel’s lingual or narratological features. A recent introduction to five francophone Caribbean authors by Beverly Ormerod may contain the most complete piece of criticism published thus far onPluie et vent.However, like the few other extant studies, it sets out mainly to summarize the plot, introduce characters, and detect recurring themes and motifs in the novel.<br>

  Author(s) Verdon John<br>
  Abstract: That higher life forms exist in the two physical categories of female and male is universally self-evident and is not of itself a problem. Beyond this basic understanding, however, the two sexes become associated with a vast panorama of cultural phenomena, including categorical ascriptions of social roles, behavioural expectations, and personality characteristics. How does the simple, incontrovertible, and universal fact of biological dimorphism generate the staggering complexity of cultural, social, and psychological dynamics of the human condition? It is the translation of the biological into social/cultural experience that is the heart of an epistemology of gender. An elaboration of the<br>

  Abstract: Though Timothy Findley’s
                  The Telling of Lies(1986) announces itself as a “mystery,” the preferred British term for detective fiction, it subverts as well as continues many of the classic characteristics of the genre. Following the established conventions of its predecessors, from Poe’s “Murders in the Rue Morgue” onward, it employs a sleuth outside the regulatory powers of the state, in pursuit of a murderer whose motive and means are out of the ordinary. There is a body, a setting which unites all the suspects under one roof, and an Aristotelian structure ofperipeteia(Porter 1983, 331). Like all detective<br>

  Author(s) Godard Barbara<br>
  Abstract: The border/play characteristic of contemporary women’s parodic re/- writing of fictional genres reveals engagement with narrative as a critical strategy designed to expose the positioning of woman as
                  silent other, on whose mutilated body narrative is constructed in dominant (patriarchal) discourse, and to posit alternate positionings for women as subjects producing themselves in/by language. What feminist theory has shown is that strategies of writing and reading are forms of cultural resistance. They work to turn dominant discourses inside out and challenge theory in its own terms, the terms of a semiotic space constructed in language. They do so by unfixing<br>

  5  Munrovian Melancholy from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt818sp">Figuring Grief</a><br>
  Abstract: I have been arguing that Munro’s fiction, with its emphasis on loss and on the importance of story-telling as a method of gaining knowledge of the past, reveals and enacts a poetics of elegy. Munro, like Gallant, insists that the past must be evaluated and re-evaluated and that memory — though not equivalent to truth — is the most important source of knowledge, of a necessarily fictional truth. Gallant’s characters often learn very little of the lessons she urges her readers to learn; we acquire insights about memory, history, truth, and writing by interpreting the ironic narrative stance employed in her fiction.<br>

  6  Forms of Loss: from:

  Abstract: In this study I have argued that Mavis Gallant and Alice Munro have adapted conventions of elegy within fictional frameworks, a practice refined by modernist fiction-elegists such as Virginia Woolf and James Joyce. A digressive structure, the focus on the self (on the narrator-elegist or character-elegist as survivor), and a tendency towards selfreflexivity are characteristics of both modern and late modern fiction-elegies. But where Woolf and Joyce employ self-reflexivity as a trope of consolation and suggest that the work of art is an immortal and idealized product achieved at the end of the work of mourning, Gallant and Munro use<br>

Munro, like Gallant, insists that the past must be evaluated and re-evaluated and that memory — though not equivalent to truth — is the most important source of knowledge, of a necessarily fictional truth. Gallant’s characters often learn very little of the lessons she urges her readers to learn; we acquire insights about memory, history, truth, and writing by interpreting the ironic narrative stance employed in her fiction.<br>

  6  Forms of Loss: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt818sp">Figuring Grief</a><br>
  Abstract: In this study I have argued that Mavis Gallant and Alice Munro have adapted conventions of elegy within fictional frameworks, a practice refined by modernist fiction-elegists such as Virginia Woolf and James Joyce. A digressive structure, the focus on the self (on the narrator-elegist or character-elegist as survivor), and a tendency towards selfreflexivity are characteristics of both modern and late modern fiction-elegies. But where Woolf and Joyce employ self-reflexivity as a trope of consolation and suggest that the work of art is an immortal and idealized product achieved at the end of the work of mourning, Gallant and Munro use<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt818sp">Figuring Grief</a><br>
  Abstract: Though Mavis Gallant’s fiction has received a great deal of critical attention in the last ten or twelve years, much of that criticism has been limited to noting Gallant’s main themes: W.J. Keith states that “the concept of abandonment or betrayal” is central,¹ and Janice Kulyk Keefer and Neil K. Besner focus on the role that memory plays in her characters’ and narrators’ worlds. But few have attempted to relate the form of Gallant’s fictions to their content. A special issue of

  Book Title: Walking with the Mud Flower Collective-God's Fierce Whimsy and Dialogic Theological Method<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Jost Stina Busman<br>
  Abstract: Arguing for a retrieval of the landmark work, God’s Fierce Whimsy, Stina Busman Jost establishes the critical importance of this volume for the construction of a dialogic theological method. This is accomplished through a close reading of God’s Fierce Whimsy in which the author identifies key methodological characteristics informing the volume’s formation. Critical importance also is established through interviews with the volume’s authors, the Mud Flower Collective—which included Katie G. Cannon, Beverly W. Harrison, Carter Heyward, Ada María Isasi-Díaz, Bess B. Johnson (Delores Williams), Mary D. Pellauer, and Nancy D. Richardson. Undergirding this endeavor is a recognition of the theoretical importance of difference to the project of theological construction and the vital form of the dialogic as constitutive of theological practice; this is carried forward through engagement with the pivotal theorists Martin Buber and Mikhail Bakhtin, who helped pioneer the philosophical and literary critical importance of otherness, difference, and dialogue. Finally, the author constructively engages recent developments in feminist theologies and postcolonial theories—ultimately making the argument that a dialogic theological method is relevant for the doing of theology today.<br>

  Book Title: Constructing Charisma-Celebrity, Fame, and Power in Nineteenth-Century Europe<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): GILOI EVA<br>
  Abstract: Railroads, telegraphs, lithographs, photographs, and mass periodicals-the major technological advances of the 19th century seemed to diminish the space separating people from one another, creating new and apparently closer, albeit highly mediated, social relationships. Nowhere was this phenomenon more evident than in the relationship between celebrity and fan, leader and follower, the famous and the unknown. By mid-century, heroes and celebrities constituted a new and powerful social force, as innovations in print and visual media made it possible for ordinary people to identify with the famous; to feel they knew the hero, leader, or "star"; to imagine that public figures belonged to their private lives. This volume examines the origins and nature of modern mass media and the culture of celebrity and fame they helped to create. Crossing disciplines and national boundaries, the book focuses on arts celebrities (Sarah Bernhardt, Byron and Liszt); charismatic political figures (Napoleon and Wilhelm II); famous explorers (Stanley and Brazza); and celebrated fictional characters (Cyrano de Bergerac).<br>

  Book Title: The Rhetorical Emergence of Culture-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Girke Felix<br>
  Abstract: "Just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric" - the first half of this central statement from the International Rhetoric Culture Project is abundantly evidenced. It is the latter half that this volume explores: how does culture emerge out of rhetorical action, out of seemingly dispersed individual actions and interactions? The contributors do not rely on rhetorical "text" alone but engage the situational, bodily, and often antagonistic character of cultural and communicative practices. The social situation itself is argued to be the fundamental site of cultural creation, as will-driven social processes are shaped by cognitive dispositions and shape them in turn. Drawing on expertise in a variety of disciplines and regions, the contributors critically engage dialogical approaches in their emphasis on how a view from rhetoric changes our perception of people's intersubjective and conjoint creation of culture.<br>

Between the late 1800s and early 1900s, America welcomed more immigrants to its shores than at any other period in its history. As the nation incorporated the new groups, artists and writers responded in ways to help the nation address the changing character and identity of the country. To the present day, the<br>

  Book Title: Stardom in Postwar France-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Holmes Diana<br>
  Abstract: The 1950s and 1960s were a key moment in the development of postwar France. The period was one of rapid change, derived from post-World War II economic and social modernization; yet many traditional characteristics were retained. By analyzing the eruption of the new postwar world in the context of a France that was both modern and traditional, we can see how these worlds met and interacted, and how they set the scene for the turbulent 1960s and 70s. The examination of the development of mass culture in post-war France, undertaken in this volume, offers a valuable insight into the shifts that took place. By exploring stardom from the domain of cinema and other fields, represented here by famous figures such as Brigitte Bardot, Johnny Hallyday or Jean-Luc Godard, and less conventionally treated areas of enquiry (politics [de Gaulle], literary [Francoise Sagan], and intellectual culture [Levi-Strauss]) the reader is provided with a broad understanding of the mechanisms of popularity and success, and their cultural, social, and political roles. The picture that emerges shows that many cultural articulations remained or became identifiably "French," in spite of the American mass-culture origins of these social, economic, and cultural transformations.<br>

  Abstract: For France, the quarter-century between the end of World War II and the early 1970s was a period of extremely rapid social change – economic, political and demographic – which informed the lived experience of millions of individuals. These years were characterised particularly by the strong pull of a new modernity, in difficult and often acute tension with the past. The new emerged, but strongly informed by the old, as well as by the progressive and oppressive possibilities of a new, fast-moving, consumerised culture that expanded in the context of a remarkable and sustained economic boom.

  Abstract: As a social science, it is characteristic of anthropology to examine the particularities of human cultures through detailed and nuanced ethnographic investigation (Crapanzano 2004; Abu Lughod 1993). In so doing, a choice is made by anthropologists as to whether or not to deploy etic distinctions between culture and nature and between human and animal – the former with the capacity ‘to produce’ in order to live (Godelier 1986) – or to work from emic constructions of like divisions and the ways in which people locally live by them, or to challenge and contest all such divisions as anthropocentric (Bateson 1999;<br>

This movement is characterized by an emphasis on the continuous manifestations and gifts of the Holy Spirit (the charismata),¹ on personal salvation, the immanent return of Christ, and not least by high degrees of ritual activity.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter entertains a special relationship with the Rhetoric Culture project as a whole in as much as the dynamic at the heart of this project is itself chiastic. One of the characteristics of Rhetoric Culture theory is the reversibility of its “critical moments” (see the introduction to this volume). In as much as all social and cultural practices are linguistically mediated, they are at least in part tributary to rhetoric. One may therefore turn to rhetoric to make sense of these practices and shed light on the dynamics that underpin them. The need to interrelate anthropology and rhetoric arises,<br>

  Abstract: Nations might exist in many forms but they certainly, perhaps even primarily, exist as narrative constructs. Nations share that characteristic with other identities with which they coexist, for instance, gender, regional or transnational identities.¹ All these forms of social identity can be further understood, according to the classic definition of Henri Tajfel, ‘as that part of the individual’s self-concept which derives from his knowledge of his membership of a social group (or groups) together with the value and emotional significance attached to that membership’.²<br>

  Author(s) Horne John<br>
  Abstract: The first half of the twentieth century was the most violent period in modern European history. War, revolution, civil war, and the deliberate displacement or destruction of entire ethnic and cultural communities characterized much of the continent from 1914 to the early 1950s. Thereafter, conflict was frozen in less lethal and more institutionalized forms until the final decade of the century, when the end of the Cold War was followed by the extraordinarily peaceful integration of Europe—a process that continues today. The exception has been the violent implosion of Yugoslavia.<br>

  Abstract: It is all too easy for historians to allow the Cold War division process of 1947–1948 to retroactively overshadow the tentative character of the apprehensions, projects, and choices guiding different political actors during the postwar planning period that spanned from the final phase of the Second World War and the immediate transition to conditions of peace. It is all too easy to forget the weight of history felt by European postwar planners at that time, realized primarily as fear: of a repetition of the economic chaos after the First World War, and of renewed German aspirations to avenge and<br>

  Abstract: My starting point is a deceptively simple query. What happens when transgressors of cultural norms, which camouflage class and gender inequalities, prove themselves worthy of admission to a pantheon of national heroes? The cult of national heroes, of course, has been indispensable in promoting national unity and pride. Instilling the people with properly national characteristics, modeled after national heroes, has been a central preoccupation for educators, artists, and scholars. Transgressive candidates for national heroes make this task harder but not impossible. Hence it is necessary to rephrase the question. How does the admission of transgressors to a patriotic canon work<br>

  Book Title: Between Educationalization and Appropriation-Selected Writings on the History of Modern Educational Systems<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vervenne Marc<br>
  Abstract: Advanced reader on the history of education Developments in educational systems worldwide have largely contributed to the modernization and globalization of present-day society. However, in order to fully understand their impact, educational systems must be interpreted against a background of particular situations and contexts. This textbook brings together more than twenty (collaborative) contributions focusing on the two key themes in the work of Marc Depaepe: educationalization and appropriation. Compiled for his international master classes, these selected writings provide not only a thorough introduction to the history of modern educational systems, but also a twenty-five year overview of the work of a well-known pioneer in the field of history of education. Covering the modernization of schooling in Western history, the characteristics and origins of educationalization, the colonial experience in education and the process of appropriation, Between Educationalization and Appropriation will be of great interest to a larger audience of scholars in the social sciences.<br>

  Abstract: This paper concerns what Freud called the ‘special characteristics’ of the unconscious. According to his metapsychological writings, unconscious mental states differ from conscious ones not just in not being conscious, but in having what he calls ‘systematic’ features, such as exemption from mutual contradiction, imperviousness to the influence of external reality, and so forth. Yet he still wants to characterise them as mental states. He is often explicit in his use of psychological language to describe them. Even when he is not, he makes it clear that the mechanistic-sounding language he sometimes uses is to be understood metaphorically. The movements<br>

  Abstract: Lievrouw and Livingstone have defined (or redefined) new media as “information and communication technologies
                     and their social contexts” (see Lievrouw 2011, 7; our italics). In doing so, they emphasize that new media are interesting and important inasmuch as they combine three main elements: artifacts or devices, practices, and the arrangements and social forms built around practices. “Today, a lively and contentious cycle of capture, cooptation and subversion of information, content, personal interaction, and system architecture characterizes the relationship between the institutionalized, mainstream center and the increasingly interactive, participatory and expanding edges of media culture” (Lievrouw 2011, 2).<br>

Although the principle of toleration is generally taken for granted by most Americans in an almost ritualistic fashion, they tend to ignore the controversial character of the principle itself: what it means, how it is to be applied, what its limitations are, and, in general, how it is grounded in moral and political philosophy. When asked about the moral basis of toleration the general answer is that toleration comes from pluralism, and ours is a pluralistic society. Q.E.D. It<br>

  Abstract: In the late 1970s, a powerful new theory of jurisprudence also emerged offering a distinctively feminist perspective on law and adjudication. Feminist jurisprudence grew out of the feminist liberation movement of the 1960s, as feminists critiqued law and society from a woman’s perspective. There are a number of stereotypes and misconceptions about what it means to be a
                  feminist. As Leslie Bender explained: “Feminists are portrayed as bra-burners, man-haters, sexists, and castrators. . . .

  Author(s) Mechling Jay<br>
  Abstract: The concept of character has two uses in children’s literature discourse. One use belongs to literary criticism, as the critic and reader observe the people in a story or novel as “characters,” that is, as agents or actors (Burke 1973 ) whose actions move a story through time. The other use refers to the moral qualities of a person. These uses of “character” are related, as the root of the English word lies in a Greek word for a tool used to mark or engrave a material (

  Abstract: Depending on the speaker (children’s author, literary critic, art historian, advertising designer, painter) and the venue (bookstore, literature conference, gallery, marketing meeting), the term “image” implies an array of connotations, purposes, and audiences (Mitchell 1986). In the hybrid contexts of the twenty-first century—where visual culture, visual studies, and visual literacy are related but contested terms—“image” crosses disciplinary boundaries and characterizes multimodal activities in classrooms and communication. For children’s literature, an interdisciplinary field drawing upon many scholarly discourses, pedagogical approaches, and modes of creative expression, “image” is a complex and provisional term, always at play and in flux.<br>

  Abstract: Although the rise of feminism and the advent of queer theory make tomboyism seem like a relatively contemporary phenomenon, the concept originated in the sixteenth century. Interestingly, the term “tomboy” initially referred to rowdy gentlemen courtiers rather than boisterous young women. The first listing in the
                  Oxford English Dictionary(OED), from 1533, defines “tomboy” as a “rude, boisterous or forward boy.” Several decades later, in the 1570s, the term shifted from characterizing a spirited young man to a like-minded young woman. In so doing, it also acquired newfound sexual associations and age coordinates. “Tomboy” lost the innocently playful connotations it<br>

Some of those who practice TM do not enter into a guru-disciple relationship with Maharishi, but many do. With SRF and Siddha Yoga, the guru-disciple relationship is foundational.

  Abstract: Language is integral to our social being. But what is the status of those who stand outside of language? The mentally disabled, wild children, people with autism and other neurological disorders, as well as animals, infants, angels, and artificial intelligences, have all engaged with language from a position at its borders. In the intricate verbal constructions of modern literature, the 'disarticulate' - those at the edges of language - have, paradoxically, played essential, defining roles.Drawing on the disarticulate figures in modern fictional works such asBilly Budd, The Sound and the Fury, Nightwood, White Noise,andThe Echo Maker,among others, James Berger shows in this intellectually bracing study how these characters mark sites at which aesthetic, philosophical, ethical, political, medical, and scientific discourses converge. It is also the place of the greatest ethical tension, as society confronts the needs and desires of the least of its brothers. Berger argues that the disarticulate is that which is unaccountable in the discourses of modernity and thus stands as an alternative to the prevailing social order. Using literary history and theory, as well as disability and trauma theory, he examines how these disarticulate figures reveal modernity's anxieties in terms of how it constructs its others.<br>

  Abstract: Because Barrett Browning’s connection to Congregationalism in her adult life has been under-recognized to date, this chapter necessarily begins with remapping the poet’s postmarriage religious commitments. Though somewhat preliminary to the main argument of the chapter, the opening pages resituate Barrett Browning within—or at least close to—a church group that has mistakenly been judged in its midcentury character by the theology and practice of an earlier time. The mistake matters for literary studies because it has marred our perception of the importance of religion to arguably the most important woman poet of the period. Certain of Barrett Browning’s<br>

They brood over situations they experience as uncomfortable or troublesome, especially if they see no obvious way out. One might call this the substantive logic of problem processing: experiencing an uncomfortable situation, diagnosing the nature of the problem and figuring out what to do to solve, or at least, alleviate the problem. Most problems have a personal character; they concern people as problem owners, their families, relatives, friends, colleagues, fellow members of sports clubs and<br>

These questions revolve around the character of the church-situation as reflected in the Johannine Epistles, and their relation to issues reflected in the Johannine Gospel, of course, are extremely relevant. Then again, what if constructions of larger overall theories—for all their glory and value—actually distort one’s understanding of the Johannine<br>

  Abstract: It is commonly thought that the greater the degree of abstraction used in describing phenomena the less understanding we have with respect to their concrete features. I want to challenge that myth by showing how mathematical abstraction—the characterization of phenomena using mathematical descriptions that seem to bear little or no relation to concrete physical entities/systems—can aid our understanding in ways that more empirically based investigations often cannot. What I mean here by “understanding” is simply having a theoretical account of how the system is constituted that enables us to solve problems, make predictions, and explain why the phenomena<br>

De Regt and Dieks have forcefully claimed that a philosophical study of scientific understanding should “encompass the historical variation of specific intelligibility standards employed in scientific practice” (2005, 138). In line with this suggestion, I discuss the conditions under which contemporary biologists come to understand natural phenomena and I point to a number of ways in which the performance of specific research practices informs and shapes the quality of such understanding.<br>

Kuhn’s list comprised such values as empirical accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness (Kuhn 1977, 321–22), which, as he argued, can be seen as constitutive of science. An enterprise could have different criteria for judging theories, but then it would not be science (331).<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qhc42">France’s Colonial Legacies</a><br>
  Author(s) BARCLAY FIONA<br>
  Abstract: The inevitable media attention surrounding the fiftieth anniversary of Algerian independence resurrected the ghosts of a conflict that many would have preferred to lay to rest. For a time the carefully managed official commemorations replaced the silence which habitually covers one of the most painful episodes in France’s recent history, highlighting the contradictions which characterise the nation’s attitude towards this period. This chapter seeks to tease out some of these conflicts, arguing that the events of 1962 continue to resonate within France because they function as a nexus of continuity and rupture, one which marked a moment of watershed for<br>

  Abstract: Outside the House of Baalbuilds on Humphreys’s achievement inA Toy Epicand is certainly the single text in which he best achieves his aims as a novelist-cum-Welsh nationalist. Whereas ‘The Land of the Living’ sequence will in its seven volumes cover a greater stretch of Welsh history and chart its effect on a wider range of characters, this single novel’s scope is both more specifically focused and in literary terms more adventurous. The novel has aWelsh setting and is a realistic portrayal of life in various areas of Wales, particularly the north, from the end of the nineteenth<br>

  Abstract: Throughout his long career as a novelist Emyr Humphreys has been inclined to reuse certain tropes, archetypes and paradigms, albeit in novels of a variety of types. We have seen in the earlier chapters that his protagonist is often a weak, over-sensitive male who is failing in some way in his familial or social life. From

  Book Title: Common Ground-A Priest and a Rabbi Read Scripture Together<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): NEUSNER JACOB<br>
  Abstract: Judaism and Christianity meet in scripture, which they share and about which they contend. In Common Ground Father Andrew Greeley and Rabbi Jacob Neusner present their characteristically candid - and often provocative - interpretations of the history, context, and meaning of scripture. Written in alternating chapters, Common Ground reveals how a rabbi understands Christ, Mary, and St Paul, and how a priest views creation, Abraham and Sarah, and the prophets. Neusner calls upon the ancient Rabbinic approach to scripture - the conversational dialogue of "Midrash" - while Greeley creatively renews the narrative tradition of Christianity. Together they show that differences in responses to scripture enrich the possibilities of biblical renewal.<br>

  NOTES ON LATIN AMERICAN-CANADIAN LITERATURE from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.cttq93rp">Reordering of Culture</a><br>
  Author(s) Etcheverry Jorge<br>
  Abstract: LATIN AMERICAN-CANADIAN LITERATURE is currently undergoing rapid development. Practically nonexistent, until the second half of the 1970s except for the presence of certain writers, it is now laying claim to a well-defined space within the “Canadian mosaic.” Symptomatic of this trend is the fact that publishing houses such as Coach House, Wallace, Québec Amérique, and others,¹ are publishing Canadian-Latin American authors in English and French translation. Apart from this activity, there are also publishing efforts in the Latin American ethno-cultural sphere itself, characterized by editorial criteria that vary from publisher to publisher; however, all these publishers give priority to the<br>

  Abstract: This paper argues that West Indian Canadian Writers have contributed significantly to a redefinition of the
                  centre.Such writers have moved black characters from the periphery to centre stage, exploring the black experience from the inside rather than from a Eurocentric vantage point. Questioning the “hegemony of the centre,” they often examine the problems of their societies from a fresh perspective. In the process, they expose the insidious effects of colonialism on the colonized, who ultimately lose sight of their own history, heritage and at times even their identity.

While her poetry is essentially about the right to define and to determine one’s own being, it would be misleading to speak of the universal appeal of her work, since there are many who would react sharply to her unambiguous ideological perspectives.²<br>

  Abstract: THE STUDY OF LATIN AMERICAN literature written outside the country of origin leads inevitably to the theme of exile. First treated during the Middle Ages, the problem of exile lends itself in various ways to literary study. One such way is provided by the exiled character him or herself, a source of insight into a wide sphere of social issues. Appearing periodically in Latin American literature to illustrate the various sociopolitical upheavals history, the exile in our own time figures prominently in Chilean writing in Canada, where writers are currently reworking this theme, each in their own style.

  Abstract: THE WRITINGS OF DANY LAFERRlÈRE, and more specifically his three North American novels¹ centered on the adventures of a sexually insatiable black man, are examples of textual hybridity, characteristic of “Border Writing,” as defined, among others, by Emily Hicks (1991). This notion, inscribed in a geographical metaphor, is the nucleus of a multidisciplinary network of categories useful to the understanding of a writer like Laferriére, whose work paradoxically defies and encompasses borders of all kinds.<br>

  Abstract: Nearly two decades after the defeat of the Charlottetown Accord, Canada’s public broadcaster faces a familiar set of challenges. The fragmentation characterizing the CBC/Radio-Canada’s audience has increased since 1992, and with it, so has a demand for the representation of different cultural groups. The desire for representation expressed by the country’s principal linguistic groups, by members of its different geographic regions, and by its Native peoples has been supplemented by a desire for representation expressed by members of Canada’s multicultural communities. At the same time, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has had to make do with progressively less funding – the cuts<br>

  Abstract: In his 1590
                  Faerie Queene, Spenser represents demonic conjuration in terms that could well describe poetic creation. His diabolical magician Archimago, for instance, conjures malevolent spirits using ‘verses’ (1.1.27) from his magic books, and he fashions his spirits to make ‘false showes’ that ‘abuse [the] fantasy’ (1.1.46) of the Redcrosse knight.¹ Indeed, ever since A. Bartlett Giamatti first noticed that the demonic ‘false shewes’ conjured by Archimago’s verses are akin to the imaginative images invoked by Spenser’s poetry, it has become commonplace to read the magician as Spenser’s allegorical figure for the poet. Hence critics generally characterize Archimago and the<br>

  Abstract: In the absence of an institutional Catholic Church in England after the Reformation, lay piety loomed particularly large in the English recusant community’s efforts to sustain a sense of religious identity and culture. Though scholars of early modern Catholicism once disagreed about whether early modern Catholic culture was characterized by the survival of late medieval traditions or the influence of missionary priests, recent work on both English and Continental Catholicism has shown that it was in fact defined by complex interactions between the two, as the traditions of the past and the spiritual directives of the Counter-Reformation merged, clashed, and<br>

  Abstract: Merleau-Ponty’s chief criticism of his contemporaries, as we have seen, was that they were wrong in refusing to acknowledge that intentions and consequences presented a problematic. One might also speak here of a dialectic of intentions and consequences, but in either case the connotation was of an unavoidable practical or pragmatic uncertainty. A problem can be solved, but a problematic must be coped with for better or for worse. To resolve a problematic into its analytically distinct constituent elements is to destroy its characteristic tension between (or among) those elements. Likewise, a dialectic contains its own internal dynamic, for example<br>

A question that we must ask is why philosophy is expressed in this way?

This growing awareness of the role of education meets with increasing demands for well educated and specialized people.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt16r0hwb">Forgetting Differences</a><br>
  Abstract: Pierre Matthieu was certainly not the first to characterize the French Wars of Religion in terms of tragedy. The intersection between history and tragedy was a commonplace in French writing about the wars from all sides, and in many different genres. An anonymous 1562 “Advertissement à la Royne mere du Roy” complains to Catherine de Médicis about the treatment of the Huguenots, using a theatrical metaphor to warn the queen mother that she risks becoming the main character in the tragedy represented by a France at civil war:<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1bgzckh">Katherine Mansfield and Translation</a><br>
  Author(s) Singh Parineeta<br>
  Abstract: Today when my wife announced that she had invited Miss Fulton to dinner a spark of joy electrocuted me. I was flipping through the letters which had arrived with the morning post when I was startled by my wife’s voice. She had a way of moving as if her feet didn’t touch the ground and could enter a room without sound. This was something I liked about her when we first met, but recently this characteristic had been making me cagey. ‘You don’t mind, do you? Having another guest?’ she asked. I shook my head and circled my arm about<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1bgzcz6">The Cinema of Theo Angelopoulos</a><br>
  Author(s) Jameson Fredric<br>
  Abstract: The easier way to explain our failure to grant Theo Angelopoulos the position he deserves in modern cinema – that he is less theoretically experimental than Godard or less politically ostentatious than Pasolini we can grant, but why we fail to love seeing his films more than those of Antonioni or Fellini remains something of a mystery – clearly lies in the character of modern Greek history, which is far less familiar than that of the western European countries. Greece has gone through a collective experience of which most other modern nations have only known bits and pieces: revolution, fascism, occupation, civil<br>

  Abstract: In critical commentaries on the work of Theo Angelopoulos, Ο Μεγαλέξανδρος (
                  MegalexandrosorAlexander the Great, 1980) is usually omitted from extended discussion.

  Abstract: This scene appears just before the climax of the widely read playwright Ben Jonson’s
                  The Alchemist.¹ Although Face and Subtle have proven themselves to be cut-throats – the word play is evident – they are also engaged, along with a third character named Dol, in a joint venture, one brokered on an exceedingly precarious notion of trust (that will evaporate in the final scenes of the play).

  Abstract: The analysis thus far presents the spectre of an ‘Arabless’ pre-Islamic Arabia which may appear an extreme reaction to the familiar notion of Arabs in Antiquity, but we pose these radical challenges as there is a need to provoke critical questioning of the idea of Arabness and the timeworn practice of labelling peoples ‘Arab’ without considering how they related to senses of Arab community. An array of groups inhabited pre-Islamic Arabia and some of their descendants would come to identify themselves as Arabs, but outsiders’ evidence and anachronistic paradigms about ‘original Arab characteristics’ have not been able to give a<br>

  Abstract: One of the central concerns of Agamben’s
                  Homo Sacerproject is to identify the traits of a life that escapes being captured by law.¹The Highest Poverty: Monastic Rules and Form-of-Lifeprovides one of the most sustained treatments of this problem by arguing that the Franciscan movement offers the first exemplar of an extra-juridical ‘form-of-life’,² at once rejecting the connection between law and life that characterises sovereignty, and developing a radically anti-consumerist relation to the world. According to Agamben, the Franciscan ideal of giving up on all ownership (designated as ‘highest poverty’) radically calls into question the internal relation between<br>

  Abstract: Richard Wagner’s operas are often characterised by his own expression,
                  Gesamtkunstwerk, which English musicologists translate as ‘total artwork’. But Wagner himself only ever used the term in two essays, both published in 1849. ‘Art and Revolution’ and ‘The Artwork of the Future’ were both written from political exile; the first in Paris and the second in Zürich. The still young-ish Wagner (he was born in 1813) had supported the revolutions of 1848 and was an active, if not especially important, participant in the 1849 May Revolution in Dresden. As a result, he was to spend almost a decade in exile<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g09v6s">The Edinburgh Companion to Poststructuralism</a><br>
  Author(s) Holohan Conn<br>
  Abstract: In the two books he wrote on the cinematic image, Gilles Deleuze proposes a fundamental break in the history of film form. This break occurred, he declares, sometime around the end of the Second World War and finds its first expression in the work of Italian neorealist film-makers such as Roberto Rossellini. In Rossellini’s images of aimless characters wandering through the ruins of a bombed-out Europe, Deleuze uncovers a decisive rupture with the logic of classical cinema, a rejection of the possibility for action upon which classical narrative depends.

  Abstract: One of the most famous figures of poststructuralism, Jacques Derrida, died on 8 October 2004. Over the following days, weeks and months, newspapers and other media the world over contained reactions, responses, comments and obituaries to him.

  Author(s) Grondin Jean<br>
  Abstract: Hermeneutics serves to characterize a broad current in contemporary Continental philosophy that deals with the issues of interpretation and stresses the historical and linguistic nature of our world-experience. In contemporary thought, it is mostly associated with the thinking of Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900–2002) and Paul Ricoeur (1913–2005), who situate themselves in the hermeneutic tradition of thinkers such as Wilhelm Dilthey (1833–1911) and Martin Heidegger (1889–1976).

  Author(s) Stone Alison<br>
  Abstract: Nineteenth-century philosophy can be broadly characterised by several themes: the conflict between metaphysics and religious faith on the one hand and the empirical sciences on the other; a new focus on history, progress and evolution; new ideas of individuality, society and revolution; and ever-increasing concerns about nihilism.¹ This volume provides a re-examination of nineteenth-century philosophy in terms of these and other themes distinctive of the period.<br>

  Author(s) Gillespie Michael<br>
  Abstract: The term ‘nihilism’ has been used to denote a philosophical concept or position, a psychological or sociological state or mood, a doctrine or agenda for political action and a cultural condition or movement. Moreover, the connotations of the term within each of these areas are multiple, complicated and contested. It is thus not easy to define the term or to determine the nature of the phenomenon that the term describes. This difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that the term has been principally used as a pejorative by opponents to characterise a condition, doctrine, or movement that they fear, disagree<br>

  Abstract: The question of the relation ‘Rancière and

This leads to a bifurcation: what is the character, status and significance of Rancière’s work onfilm, and – quietly – therefore also, the character, status and significance of Rancière’s work in relation to the discipline or disciplines of filmstudies? I say ‘disciplines’ because film studies both is and is notonediscipline. No discipline is univocal. No discipline is singular – other than in the eyes, or the fantasy, of the most reductive, taxonomical and exterior gaze – a gaze from outside of the field in<br>

Developing and adhering to a particular set of methods was considered to be characteristic of those disciplines and somehow compromised by an unexamined notion of empirical enquiry.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b3gr">François Laruelle’s Philosophies of Difference</a><br>
  Abstract: If for Laruelle Nietzsche establishes the standard model of philosophy as Difference, Heidegger marks the full taking-stock of Difference in relation to the Western tradition as such and draws out the consequences of its immanent critique as the culmination of metaphysics. Whereas Laruelle characterises the Nietzschean model of Difference as one of ‘Idealism’, he designates the Heideggerean model as that of ‘Finitude’. Laruelle’s reading of Heidegger follows the late Heidegger in treating the thought of the ontological difference of Being and beings as still determined and thus relatively constrained by the history of metaphysics. Thus for the late Heidegger, as<br>

  Abstract: Laruelle opens his chapter on Derrida with a quintessentially Nietzschean image, that of the tightrope-walker. Derrida is characterised by Laruelle as being perhaps the most trenchant critic of the Western decision for logocentrism and metaphysics, while nonetheless reinstating that decision despite himself, being unable ‘to take the final step’:<br>

  CHAPTER FIVE  Equivalence: from:

  Abstract: Poetry can be a reflection upon what it is to be the kind of being that uses language, a reflection upon how humanity is characterised by being linguistic. This reflection, in the form it takes in several of the poems read in this book, is critical, in as much as it emanates from a crisis, a deeply unnerving realisation about the nature of being a language-using being. This unnerving realisation, I suggest, is the realisation that the language people use, and which can feel to its users so deeply intertwined with the natures of the objects it refers to, the<br>

  Abstract: The tradition I sketched in the run-up to my discussion of ‘The Idea of Order at Key West’, that of identifying a spark or charge in poetic language, is sometimes manifested in psychologistic forms in the twentieth century: the energy expressing itself in poetic language is not that of a divine ordering spirit, nor the character of a people, nor a latent ‘chemical’ power in the language itself, but in the psyche of the poet concerned. The surrealist and poet André Breton thought this way. Adopting the language of the poet-critic Pierre Reverdy, who said that one ‘creates … a<br>

  Abstract: Metaphor, as will already be evident from ‘Figure: Walter Ralegh’, has been thought characteristic of poetic language. A recent book on the subject states that ‘metaphor has always been, and still is, the main device of poetry’.¹ Several important accounts of metaphor have been offered from diverse quarters in recent decades, and I want to engage with three of them in this chapter: the cognitive account of metaphor as conceptual mapping; Donald Davidson’s insistence that the meaning of a metaphor is just its literal meaning; Paul de Man’s argument that knowledge about the operations of the mind has the structure<br>

  Abstract: Early in the introduction to this book I quoted the Czech structuralist Jan Mukařovský’s itemisation of the supposed distinguishing formal features of poetic language, which came to the conclusion that, ‘finally, not even
                  individuality, the emphasized uniqueness of linguistic expression, characterizes poetic language in general’.¹ Whilst originality or uniqueness might characterise some instances of poetic language, only function will identify all instances. But some kind of qualification may be made to Mukařovský’s assertion. It might not be the emphasised uniqueness of expression that makes the deployment of (for want of better terminology) a highly conventional phrase poetic, precisely because the<br>

  Author(s) Hittinger John P.<br>
  Abstract: In the classic account of democracy, rule by the majority formally establishes a regime as democratic. Any such organisation is characterised as allowing the rise of those who are neither rich nor distinguished, but who utilise their equality to bring together a numerical majority of supporters (Aristotle [350 BCE] 1980: 3.11; Simon 1951: 76). Democracy emerges as a cluster of concepts and practices sustained by a set of ideas about human equality and popular sovereignty. Participation in actual self-rule is also an aspirational standard of democratic movements. It is commonly acknowledged that many aspects of modern democracy arise from beliefs,<br>

  Author(s) Volten Peter M. E.<br>
  Abstract: The transitions to democracy in Eastern and Central Europe from 1989 onwards not only came as a big surprise both inside and outside the region, they were also characterised by incredible speed and by a radical challenge to the prevailing political cultures during the pressing phase of consolidation. The two companion concepts and processes – transition and consolidation of democratic transformation – are clearly culture-bound and dependent on the historical and present context of the country or region involved. This was particularly the case in Central Europe, where cultural and contextual confusion sometimes led to misunderstanding and friction. Westerners who showed their<br>

  Author(s) He Baogang<br>
  Abstract: In the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen Square event, the Chinese government has both tightened its authoritarian rule and introduced a wide variety of local mini-democratisation practices, including village elections, township elections, intra-party democracy, participatory and deliberative forums, and participatory budgeting. While these do not jeopardise the monopoly of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on political decision making, they illustrate major trends and characteristics of Chinese democratisation and highlight the Chinese hybrid model of democratisation. This chapter focuses on official democratic mechanisms and institutions initiated at the local level, rather than on more general aspects of democratisation, such as rights<br>

  Abstract: In

Cultures, in the plural, are defined as a plurality of human modes of organisation.

  Author(s) Shorten Richard<br>
  Abstract: Evil in contemporary politics has an important rhetorical dimension. Whenever instances of wrongdoing are contested in the public realm, the relevant actors are liable to call upon a familiar store of resources for persuading audiences to respond in particular ways. These resources can be expected to consist in recognisable rhetorical tropes and figures, a predictable range of ‘commonplaces’, and the manipulation of definitions according to recurring patterns of argument. They can be envisaged to entail, too, the arousal of a characteristic series of emotions. The actors themselves, in the relevant sense, might also be variously composed. They may be perpetrators<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r1z12">The Edinburgh Companion to Shakespeare and the Arts</a><br>
  Author(s) Wray Ramona<br>
  Abstract: In the courtyard of the “Casa di Giulietta” – and on the cover of this book – stands a striking embodiment of Shakespeare’s Juliet.¹ In the same way that Montague, in 
                  Romeo and Juliet, memorializes Capulet’s daughter – “For I will raise her statue in pure gold” (5.3.298) – so has the city of Verona elected to honour and localize a character from the early modern English stage. The work of local artist, Nereo Costantini, the sculpture of Juliet was financed by the Lions’ Club of Verona, completed in 1968 and displayed, for the first time, in 1972.

  Author(s) Holbrook Peter<br>
  Abstract: Of course Hotspur is speaking in character, as a bluff soldier – in a non-trivial sense these are his not Shakespeare’s words. Nevertheless it is always something of a shock to come across, in the greatest poet of the English language, such a memorable expression of the hatred of poetry. Glendower has been wittering on about his supernatural and poetic endowments, and Hotspur has had enough. The bombastic Welshman assures Hotspur he has “framèd to the harp / Many an English ditty lovely well, / And gave the tongue a helpful ornament – / A virtue that was never seen in you”<br>

  Author(s) Rumbold Kate<br>
  Abstract: In the twenty-first century, “Shakespeare” is not only an English cultural icon but shares some of the characteristics of a powerful global brand. This chapter shows the surprising but important role that the many books of quotations and extracts from Shakespeare’s works, published from within his own lifetime to the present day, have played in establishing that status. It argues that these anthologies have not simply reflected Shakespeare’s growing status, but actively helped to construct it. The seemingly inherent qualities for which Shakespeare is now admired – the beauty of his language, his wise understanding of human nature, his Englishness – are<br>

  Author(s) Costantini-Cornède Anne-Marie<br>
  Abstract: From 1930 to 1990, the phenomenon of Shakespeare on film was characterized by a great variety of activity, from landmark “mainstream” films, deferential to textual authority, to a full range of innovative cinematic essays of all kinds, including modernizations, derivatives or non-English cinematic Shakespeares, and transcultural appropriations trading on radical time and space transpositions, such as Akira Kurosawa’s 
                  Throne of Blood (1957) and Ran (1985), which shift Macbeth and Lear to Sengoku-Jidai (“wartroubled”) medieval Japan. Five main tendencies may be distinguished from the early days of sound movies to the beginning of the Shakespeare on screen revival marked by Kenneth<br>

  Abstract: In a recent TV drama one of the characters falls in love with another. ‘It’s only chemicals,’ his friend assures him, but when the friend finds himself in the same position he is unable to take the same view of his own situation. It would be a caricature to represent the dominant paradigm in contemporary Anglo-American philosophy of mind as holding of all our psychological states, ‘It’s only chemicals.’ Yet this paradigm – functionalism – does hold that each of them is, in fact, a physiological state, but one individuated in terms of its function in mediating between sensory inputs<br>

  Abstract: For much of the last century philosophy of mind has been dominated by the attempt to give an account of mental states that does not have recourse to the Cartesian picture of them as essentially private, in the sense of being only providentially connected with the behaviour through which they are expressed. The states that have seemed particularly recalcitrant to such attempts are our experiences in perception and bodily sensation; for these paradigmatically have a subjective character – a something it is like to have them, as Thomas Nagel puts it¹ – that apparently eludes explanation in terms of the<br>

  Abstract: Let us suppose that we reject the ‘myth of the given’ or the idea of ‘contents’ of consciousness whose character explains what it is like to have our experiences, and adopt instead an account in terms of the ways things can become intentional objects of experience through the manner of our bodily interactions with them. This may still leave us with the uneasy feeling that something the ‘given’ was meant to suggest has dropped out of our story, namely, the way in which our perceptions and especially our bodily sensations are not only what we

By rendering myself capable of reading these texts I have sought to encourage others to feel less well prepared for what they might encounter. My thought is that without such a disruption they will remain prepared only for the (for them, for everyone) depressing prospect of reading the Other.¹<br>

So much so is now acknowledged even in mainstream political science fora. For example, in a critical review essay recently published in the

  Abstract: Although our contemporary world is marked throughout by the importance of questions of identity, something increasingly reflected in the directions of contemporary social–scientific research, in the general field of nationalism studies the issue of the attraction and salience of national identities has not been sufficiently examined. This is partly due to the hegemonic position of modernist and constructionist approaches in the relevant literature.² In opposition to the common doxa reproduced by nationalist myths, contemporary research on the nation tends to stress the constructed character of national identity: the nation is primarily understood as a modern social and political construction.<br>

These movements are economic globalization and the revolution in information and communications technologies (ICT). These are movements that may be seen as the engines of the contemporary global economy. They drive the new information world order, in which most of the continent of Africa is not faring too well. The expansion of globalization and ICT is itself largely driven by the logic of the market (Etta and Parvyn-Wamahiu 2003).<br>

  Abstract: Evolutionary psychology, a recently constituted but already broadly extended programme in the study of human behaviour, is notable for, among other things, the unusually pre-emptive character of its claims. According to its major proponents, ‘reverse engineering’, the method that defines and distinguishes evolutionary psychology, permits identification of the underlying, innate mental mechanisms that govern all human behaviour, from incest-avoidance and femaleadolescent anorexia to past-tense formation and a taste for Victorian novels. In supplying these identifications, it is said, evolutionary psychologists provide genuinely scientific explanations for human behaviours and cultural practices that, up to now, have been improperly or inadequately explained<br>

  Abstract: The first study of Deleuze's critical and clinical projectAidan Tynan addresses Deleuze's assertion that 'literature is an enterprise of health' and shows how a concern of health and illness was a characteristic of his philosophy as a whole, from his earliest works to his groundbreaking collaborations with Guattari, to his final, enigmatic statements on 'life'.He explains why alcoholism, anorexia, manic depression and schizophrenia are key concepts in Deleuze's literary theory, and shows how, with the turn to schizoanalysis, literature takes on a crucial political and ethical role in helping us to diagnose our present pathologies and articulate the possibilities of a health to come.Key FeaturesThe first book length study of Deleuze's critical and clinical project and the conceptualisations of health and illness he developed over the course of his careerUses the idea of the literary clinic to unify Deleuze's literary theory with the political critique he developed with Guattari, and argues in this way for a distinctively Deleuzian critical practiceDraws on Deleuze conceptualisations of health and illness to reassess his relationship to key thinkers such as Spinoza, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud and Melanie Klein and literary figures such as Melville F.

  Book Title: Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clemens Justin<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalysis was the most important intellectual development of the twentieth century, which left no practice from psychiatry to philosophy to politics untouched. Yet it was also in many ways an untouchable project, caught between science and poetry, medicine and hermeneutics. This unsettled, unsettling status has recently induced the philosopher Alain Badiou to characterise psychoanalysis as an ‘antiphilosophy’, that is, as a practice that issues the strongest possible challenges to thought. Justin Clemens takes up the challenge of this denomination here, by re-examining a series of crucial psychoanalytic themes: addiction, fanaticism, love, slavery and torture. Drawing from the work of Freud, Lacan, Badiou, Agamben and others, 'Psychoanalysis is an Antiphilosophy' offers a radical reconstruction of the operations and import of key psychoanalytic concepts and a renewed sense of the indispensable powers of psychoanalysis for today.<br>

  Abstract: Psychoanalysis is an antiphilosophy. Despite the precision of this concept and this claim, their implications remain controversial. This book thus introduces the concept of antiphilosophy, speaks of its constitution and pertinence with respect to psychoanalysis, and examines the consequences of such a determination through a sequence of case-studies. Although the concept has some highly abstract aspects and a somewhat forbidding intellectual history, it is deployed here, first, as a kind of corrosive of received ideas, and, second, as an affirmative means of characterising psychoanalysis that captures something essential, if often elided, about the peculiar status of the practice.<br>

  Abstract: In many respects, and with few notable exceptions, Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmaking in France during the 1980s and 1990s has been characterised in both critical and academic discourse by notions of peripheral and auteur-led modes of production and limited exposure to niche audiences, not to mention struggles relating to funding, distribution and exhibition (Bluher 2001). The films have often been treated by academics and critics as a kind of socio-cultural document, rather than an entertainment ‘product’ aimed at mass audiences: a cinema more of interest to sociologists, journalists and academics as a reflection of contemporary socio-political realities facing<br>

  Author(s) Moran James<br>
  Abstract: Where did modernism happen? What were its important places and distinctive geographies? These are not new questions and, until relatively recently, might have been thought settled. A powerful and well-rehearsed narrative about modernism defines it as essentially metropolitan and internationalist in character, recalling that the majority of high-modernist writers and artists were exiles or émigrés, and that their texts are conspicuously polyglot, heteronomous, and fashioned from diverse cultural materials. Modernism, according to Malcolm Bradbury, was ‘an art of cities’ and the jolting energies of life in the major European capitals can be read in the fractured, discontinuous forms of modernist<br>

  Abstract: There is no doubting the importance of ideas of place in Basil Bunting’s poetry, particularly in his major work,
                  Briggflatts(1966), where Northumbria emerges as a luminous and multi-faceted affective terrain. Bunting’s representations of place are also complex and multi-layered, issuing from a geographical imagination that thrives on contradictions. His regional modernism is characterised both by the imaginative centrality of northern landscapes and cultural paradigms to his writing, and by the refraction of such local and regional attachments through a self-consciously international modernist poetics.Briggflattsexplores its themes of dislocation and homecoming through an intense imaginative engagement with the landscapes,<br>

  Abstract: Street-level decision making is complexly moral and contingent rather than narrowly rule bound and fixed. A fundamental dilemma—perhaps the defining characteristic—of street-level work is that the needs of individual citizen-clients exist in tension with the demands and limits of rules. This does not mean that rules do not permeate all aspects of street-level work (they do) or that most street-level actions are not consistent with law and policy (they are). The most common situation may be that the rules effectively fit the complexity of workers’ judgments about citizen-clients. When the rules and standard procedures fit the situation, street-level<br>

  Book Title: Utopia in Performance-Finding Hope at the Theater<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Dolan Jill<br>
  Abstract: "Jill Dolan is the theatre's most astute critic, and this new book is perhaps her most important. Utopia in Performance argues with eloquence and insight how theatre makes a difference, and in the process demonstrates that scholarship matters, too. It is a book that readers will cherish and hold close as a personal favorite, and that scholars will cite for years to come."---David Román, University of Southern CaliforniaWhat is it about performance that draws people to sit and listen attentively in a theater, hoping to be moved and provoked, challenged and comforted? In
      Utopia in Performance, Jill Dolan traces the sense of visceral, emotional, and social connection that we experience at such times, connections that allow us to feel for a moment not what a better world might look like, but what it might feel like, and how that hopeful utopic sentiment might become motivation for social change.She traces these "utopian performatives" in a range of performances, including the solo performances of feminist artists Holly Hughes, Deb Margolin, and Peggy Shaw; multicharacter solo performances by Lily Tomlin, Danny Hoch, and Anna Deavere Smith; the slam poetry event Def Poetry Jam; The Laramie Project; Blanket, a performance by postmodern choreographer Ann Carlson; Metamorphoses by Mary Zimmerman; and Deborah Warner's production of Medea starring Fiona Shaw. While the book richly captures moments of "feeling utopia" found within specific performances, it also celebrates the broad potential that performance has to provide a forum for being human together; for feeling love, hope, and commonality in particular and historical (rather than universal and transcendent) ways.<br>

  Abstract: Utopia can be a placeholder for social change, a no-place that the apparatus of theater—its liveness, the potential it holds for real social exchange, its mortality, its openness to human interactions that life outside this magical space prohibits—can model productively. In the last chapter, I found these feelings of utopia in Holly Hughes, Peggy Shaw, and Deb Margolin’s interactions with their audiences. Their stories directly addressed spectators and modeled an ephemeral but powerful intersubjectivity that let spectators experience affectively, if fleetingly, what utopia might feel like.

  Book Title: The Immaterial Book-Reading and Romance in Early Modern England<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Wall-Randell Sarah<br>
  Abstract: In romances-Renaissance England's version of the fantasy novel-characters often discover books that turn out to be magical or prophetic, and to offer insights into their readers' selves.
      The Immaterial Bookexamines scenes of reading in important romance texts across genres: Spenser'sFaerie Queene,Shakespeare'sCymbelineandThe Tempest,Wroth'sUrania,and Cervantes'Don Quixote. It offers a response to "material book studies" by calling for a new focus on imaginary or "immaterial" books and argues that early modern romance authors, rather than replicating contemporary reading practices within their texts, are reviving ancient and medieval ideas of the book as a conceptual framework, which they use to investigate urgent, new ideas about the self and the self-conscious mind.<br>

  Book Title: The Real and the Sacred-Picturing Jesus in Nineteenth-Century Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): GATRALL JEFFERSON J. A.<br>
  Abstract: The figure of Jesus appears as a character in dozens of nineteenth-century novels, including works by Balzac, Flaubert, Dickens, Dostoevsky, and others.
         The Real and the Sacredfocuses in particular on two fiction genres: the Jesus redivivus tale and the Jesus novel. In the former, Christ makes surprise visits to earth, from rural Flanders (Balzac) and Muscovy (Turgenev) to the bustling streets of Paris (Flaubert), Seville (Dostoevsky), Berlin, and Boston. In the latter, the historical Jesus wanders through the picturesque towns and plains of first-century Galilee and Judea, attracting followers and enemies. In short, authors subjected Christ, the second person of the Christian trinity, to the realist norms of secular fiction. Thus the Jesus of nineteenth-century fiction was both situated within a specific time and place, whether ancient or modern, and positioned before the gaze of increasingly daring literary portraitists. The highest artistic challenge for authors was to paint, using mere words, a faithful picture of Jesus in all his humanity. The incongruity of a sacred figure inhabiting secular literary forms nevertheless tested the limits of modern realist style no less than the doctrine of Christ's divinity.<br>

  Book Title: Traces of the Past-Classics between History and Archaeology<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassi Karen<br>
  Abstract: What are we doing when we walk into an archaeological museum or onto an archaeological site? What do the objects and features we encounter in these unique places mean and, more specifically, how do they convey to us something about the beliefs and activities of formerly living humans? In short, how do visible remains and ruins in the present give meaning to the human past? Karen Bassi addresses these questions through detailed close readings of canonical works spanning the archaic to the classical periods of ancient Greek culture, showing how the past is constituted in descriptions of what narrators and characters see in their present context. She introduces the term protoarchaeological to refer to narratives that navigate the gap between linguistic representation and empirical observation-between words and things-in accessing and giving meaning to the past. Such narratives invite readers to view the past as a receding visual field and, in the process, to cross the disciplinary boundaries that divide literature, history, and archaeology.Aimed at classicists, literary scholars, ancient historians, cultural historians, and archaeological theorists, the book combines three areas of research: time as a feature of narrative structure in literary theory; the concept of "the past itself" in the philosophy of history; and the ontological status of material objects in archaeological theory. Each of five central chapters explores how specific protoarchaeological narratives-from the fate of Zeus' stone in Hesiod's Theogony to the contest between words and objects in Aristophanes' Frogs-both expose and attempt to bridge this gap. Throughout, the book serves as a response to Herodotus' task in writing the Histories, namely, to ensure that "the past deeds of men do not fade with time."<br>

  Abstract: The archive appears to have taken the place of historical narrative as a key locus for critical historical reflection. This shift from historiography to the archive has a number of implications. For one, it draws attention from the closed authoritative historiography to the multiplicity of texts involved in documenting the past and to their open potential for generating future histories.¹ Besides the historian-author, many other actors—archivists, informants, donors, and researchers of various kinds—are revealed to animate the archive. This sociality contrasts sharply with the stereotype of the archive as solitary and lifeless. The archive is also characterized by<br>

  Book Title: Microdramas-Crucibles for Theater and Time<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Muse John H.<br>
  Abstract: In
      Microdramas, John H. Muse argues that plays shorter than twenty minutes deserve sustained attention, and that brevity should be considered a distinct mode of theatrical practice. Focusing on artists for whom brevity became both a structural principle and a tool to investigate theater itself (August Strindberg, Maurice Maeterlinck, F. T. Marinetti, Samuel Beckett, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Caryl Churchill), the book explores four episodes in the history of very short theater, all characterized by the self-conscious embrace of brevity. The story moves from the birth of the modernist microdrama in French little theaters in the 1880s, to the explicit worship of speed in Italian Futurist synthetic theater, to Samuel Beckett's often-misunderstood short plays, and finally to a range of contemporary playwrights whose long compilations of shorts offer a new take on momentary theater.Subjecting short plays to extended scrutiny upends assumptions about brief or minimal art, and about theatrical experience. The book shows that short performances often demand greater attention from audiences than plays that unfold more predictably. Microdramas put pressure on preconceptions about which aspects of theater might be fundamental and about what might qualify as an event. In the process, they suggest answers to crucial questions about time, spectatorship, and significance.<br>

  Abstract: In engaging the tension between perspectives that challenge traditional gender stereotypes and those that reiterate normative conventions, feminist readers encounter a set of more nuanced methodological and theoretical considerations. At the outset, it is imperative to situate Ibn ʿArabī’s teachings on gender within the assumptions of his worldview—that is, to take seriously the Sufi framework of his engagement with gender. As is characteristic of all Ibn ʿArabī’s works, paradox, ambivalence, and contradiction are part of his mystical methodology. Since reality “as it really is” or mystical experiences give a glimpse into that which cannot be understood or captured in<br>

  Abstract: The novel and the theater are two forms of fiction: in both cases, it is a matter of creating an imaginary world, and making characters, whose story constitutes what is called the plot, enter into this world. In order for the impact of the work to surpass that of simple entertainment, the story must also have a signification. Through carefully constructed lies, the book, like the play, strives to communicate a general human truth, but they do not rely on the same devices, and they do not seek the same type of truth.<br>

The protagonist had consistently abided by subcultural values—standards of behavior—and/or was dependably good in the conventional sense—or at least as good as other people.¹<br>

  Abstract: In characterizing the reform talk in elastic narratives as shallow, I mean two particular things. First, accounts of one’s crimes were contradictory, vague, or both. Quite often, one’s life, including but not limited to one’s reform, was broadly described (for example, one previously enjoyed a “fast” lifestyle that was condemned) but specific crimes were neutralized. Second, desistance, like offending, was attributed to vaguely stated factors. In addition, desistance was conceptualized<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/j.ctt1xcmdx">New German Dance Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) HARDT YVONNE<br>
  Abstract: Dance is usually considered the most ephemeral form of art in Western society. This transitory character of dance dominates both historical and contemporary discourse. Nonetheless, historical investigations trace not only the history of dance, but also demonstrate how dance embodies historic and cultural corporealities. Only in more recent years, however, has a focus on history and memory appeared in research on contemporary European concert dance. As Aleida Assmann states, “Today it is most prominently art, which discovers the crisis of memory as its topic and finds new modes in which the dynamic process of cultural memory and forgetting configures.”¹ For<br>

  Author(s) KLEIN GABRIELE<br>
  Abstract: Looking at the history of dance in the modern West, and especially in Europe, where aesthetic modernism began around 1900, there are two characteristics of dance. Whether it is so-called popular dance or a more artistic form, from a sociological perspective, the history of dance is the history of globalization and transnationalism. It is also the record of how urban experiences have been expressed physically. The artistic avant-garde of the twentieth century thrived in large cities, and even folk dances rarely originated in the countryside.<br>

  Author(s) STEINBERG MARK D.<br>
  Abstract: It would be unwise, even harmful, to approach a regional history of emotions looking for essential patterns of national or ethnic character. To be sure, many people have claimed defining emotional traits for their own culture. In the early 1900s, for example, it was common for Russians to speak of a “Russian soul” naturally inclined toward “brooding and melancholy.”¹ More deleterious have been claims about other cultures: Serbs are belligerent, Romanians are intensely emotional, “Gypsies” are impassioned but irresponsible, Germans desire order, Jews are avaricious. National and ethnic cultural stereotypes have histories and are worth studying as revealing constructions and<br>

                  Imperial Leatherfeminist and postcolonial critic Anne McClintock uses the metaphor of the magic lantern to characterize the desiring dimensions of European imperialism in the early modern period, writing that, “long before the era of high Victorian imperialism, Africa and the Americas had become what can be called a pornotropics for the European imagination—a<br>

                     Anti-Narcissus: Anthropology as Minor Science. The idea was to characterize the conceptual tensions animating contemporary anthropology. From the moment I had the title, however, the problems began. I quickly realized that the project verged on complete contradiction, and the least misstep on my part could have resulted in a mess of not so anti-narcissistic provocations about the excellence of the positions to be professed.<br>

  Abstract: This book’s question has often been the status of structuralism, and for good reason. Lévi-Strauss’ structuralism ought to be understood as a structural transformation of Amerindian thought—the result of an inflection sustained by the latter inasmuch as it was amenable to being filtered through problems and concepts characteristic of Occidental
                  logopoiesis(the same and the other, the continuous and the discrete, the sensible and the intelligible, nature and culture…), according to a movement of controlled equivocation and unstable equilibrium incessantly fertilized by corrupting translations.

  Author(s) Mandelli (Krizia) Mariuccia<br>
  Abstract: In my opinion, accessories are small, portable talismans of our well-being. They make up that framework of meaning that we construct about ourselves; they are invaluable indicators of taste, character, style, and behavior. I can understand a lot more about people by looking at their shoes or their watch than the clothes they wear or the things they say. Walter Albini, one of my first assistants who went on to become an almost legendary name in fashion, used to say that accessories are ten times more important than clothes. I agreed then—and I agree now.<br>

  Author(s): Sayers Jentery<br>
  Abstract: In
         Making Things and Drawing Boundaries, critical theory and cultural practice meet creativity, collaboration, and experimentation with physical materials as never before. Foregrounding the interdisciplinary character of experimental methods and hands-on research, this collection asks what it means to "make" things in the humanities. How is humanities research manifested in hand and on screen alongside the essay and monograph? And, importantly, how does experimentation with physical materials correspond with social justice and responsibility? Comprising almost forty chapters from ninety practitioners across twenty disciplines,Making Things and Drawing Boundariesspeaks directly and extensively to how humanities research engages a growing interest in "maker" culture, however "making" may be defined.<br>

  Abstract: Film adaptations of

Both Franco Zeffirelli (1968) and Baz Luhrmann (1996), for example, eliminate the character of Paris from the final scene in the Capulet’s tomb.¹ But a more radical reimagining of the play’s end comes in Karina Holden’sRomeo & Juliet A Monkey’s Tale, a television documentary produced by Animal Planet in 2006 about Macaque monkeys in Lopburi, Thailand.² From the opening iambs of its modified prologue (“In Thailand’s town …”), Holden’s urban wildlife film pulls two seemingly far-removed worlds—Shakespeare’s Globe and Animal Planet—into a potentially catastrophic orbit with<br>

  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Carter Paul<br>
  Abstract: The volume's central narrative-between Northern cultural philosophers and Australian societies-traverses the troubled history of misinterpretation that is characteristic of colonial cross-cultural encounter. As he brings the literature of Indigenous and non-Indigenous anthropological research into dialogue with Western approaches of conceptualizing sociability, Carter makes a startling discovery: that meeting may not be desirable and, if it is, its primary objective may be to negotiate a future of non-meeting.<br>

  Abstract: Obviously, not everyone meets in the meeting place. Most people pass through remaining strangers to one another. The meeting place legitimates the social value of not meeting. It creates scope for solitude: not everyone is lonely in the crowd. Even in the meeting place meeting is exceptional. In fact, in a way, the intention of the informal choreographies that characterize the collective movement form of the public is to avoid a face-to-face encounter. If you watch the sea of heads bobbing up and down as people stalk into the distance, it resembles nothing so much as an undulating sheet of<br>

These are words about pigeonholes, the natural locations for things, but they are also terms that are pigeonholed, like their cultures, thought to be of merely local or anthropological interest. A discussion of them illuminates what might be meant by characterizing the meeting place as “a more convenient place.” At the same time, it also illuminates another<br>

The meeting place is neither people nor place; it is some kind of algorithm of sociability, which from a material thinking point of view must be manifest in some palpable expression, whether fleeting glance, parallax of legs, or other unforeseen juxtaposition of formerly strange things. The meeting place is a matrix for the production of metaphors, figures of transport joining unlike things. When it incubates encounter, it not only facilitates and multiplies opportunities of exchange but also sets the exchange rates. Both stable and unstable, it can be characterized as<br>

  Abstract: The publication of Victor Farías’s

Farías’s book contributes little that was not already known about Heidegger’s personal affiliation with Nazism.¹ And his analytical effort to implicate Heidegger’s thought at large with Nazism is characterized by a superficiality so obvious that, as Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe has observed, it betrays a certain intellectual dishonesty,² a dishonesty, I would add, endemic to the future anterior perspective of anthropological inquiry. It suggests that Farias’s identification of Heidegger’s philosophical writing at large<br>

  Abstract: Modernity is an atavism. Its advent in Western culture led to and was given shape by political, social, and aesthetic developments that can be characterized by a recursive temporal subjectivity. This book provides a historical and theoretical account of that subjectivity by looking at late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century science, fition, and photography. Theories and expressions of atavism in these representational spheres reveal the way modern thought oriented itself around a paradigm of obsolescence and return that structured the experience of modern time. If “modernity” designates itself in terms of its eternal up-to-date-ness, atavism—a theory of biological reversion emerging<br>

Inspired and awed by the strength of the figure before him, Yank breaks his new friend out of his cage, only to be repaid with “a murderous hug.” Lying near death on the floor of the cage, Yank utters his last words “in the strident tones of a circus barker”: “Ladies and gents,<br>

  Abstract: Documentary, in presenting the sights and sounds of reality, enables reality to “speak” at the same time as it “speaks about” reality. It thus realizes the desire that cinematography inaugurated: of knowing reality through its images and sounds, that is—figuratively—of allowing reality to “speak for itself.” This book examines the documentary film as a cinematic project that seeks to enable the citizen-spectator to know and experience reality through recorded images and sounds of reality. Closely linked to the development of both modernity and modernism, documentary arises as a film genre characterized by a dual assertion of the objective<br>

  Author(s) Marshall Donald<br>
  Abstract: In 1912, Arnold Schönberg composed

  Author(s) Parr James A.<br>
  Abstract: In an initial approximation, there could hardly be two more disparate works or two more dissimilar protagonists than Don Quixote and Don Juan. The differences in age, social class, self-assigned mission, attitudes toward women, and the Apollonian versus Dionysian worldview would seem to mitigate against any similarities of consequence. It will be my purpose, nevertheless, to seek out those similarities and to suggest that difference assumes a secondary role—one that could be equated with surface structure—in comparison to the commonalities of the deeper structure made manifest in the characters’ final disposition at the hands of their authors, but<br>

  Author(s) Lockhart Melissa A.<br>
  Abstract: José Hernández (1824-86), with his
                  Martín Fierro(1872 and 1879), is undoubtedly the emblematic author of Argentine identity. Critics and cultural essayists have been unable to resist constructing around him a series of supposedly national and spiritual values concerning what it means to be Argentine. At the same time, they have established the canonical character of a genre known as the gauchesque.² The theme of the gaucho has passed through various stages of transformation, even though not all works of the era are considered to be part of the gauchesque genre: from Hilario Ascasubi (1807-75) to Bartolomé Hidalgo (1788-1822) and<br>

  Abstract: In a sense, to speak of foreign policy presupposes the availability of a given spatialization of the world in terms of us and them. Conventionally, foreign policy is the set of actions by “us” out “there.” In the modern, post-Westphalian world of nation-states, foreign policy constitutes the actions of state elites who try to maintain, at minimum, something called “our national security” and to further at every opportunity something called “our national interest.” This discourse of foreign policy is amnesiac about the relative novelty of its central identities and the dialectical character of its antinomies. It exemplifies the Nietzschean dictum<br>

  Abstract: Ethnicity is not. Any more than the nation. I begin this chapter by evoking Frantz Fanon’s famous quote, “The Negro is not. Any more than the white man” (1967, 231), to indicate the dialectical and mutually constitutive character of ethnicity and nation under the regimes of modernity. Neither nation nor ethnicity is an immanent force, an essence within history, destined for eventual recuperation. Rather, they have to be understood in a relational framework, one that highlights their mutual indispensability and the hierarchizing effects of their interaction (Comaroff 1991).

  Abstract: The disciplinary character of architecture is one of the most important, though under explored, issues that architects face today. Disciplinarity—the way that architecture defines, creates, disseminates, and applies the knowledge within its domain of influence—is increasingly central to the discussions about the present and future direction of the field.

  Abstract: Architects frequently take great pride in pointing to architecture as the most interdisciplinary of professional pursuits.

In this way, Benhabib associates the Utopian impulse with what Ernst Bloch calls our “principle of hope”—our ability and desire to imagine something other and better than our existing conditions. At the same time, however, the Utopian impulse is characterized by a set of conservative logics and gestures that are increasingly seen as<br>

Contemporary critical discourse, in particular, tends to construct social forces in spatial relations such as “inside versus outside” or “margin versus center.” Given this characteristic of contemporary political discourse, my interest in combining an analysis of feminist theory with an analysis of utopian literature derives not just from the explicitly political and didactic nature of utopian literature, but also from the way that Utopian literature’s<br>

If his stories often drift, it is partly because many of his characters are drifters by choice, by nature, or by force of circumstance. When the narrator in “Sensini” says that the eponymous writer’s stories are peopled by “brave and aimless characters” (LEE 5), he could be referring to the fiction of Bolaño.

  Abstract: One of the reasons Bolaño’s fiction matters to so many readers is that it is underpinned by a strong, distinctive, and relatively simple sense of what matters in life. His characters live in ethically and politically oriented worlds. This does not go without saying. Since Western literatures began strongly to affirm and defend their autonomy with respect to political and religious institutions in the mid-nineteenth century, many critics and writers have campaigned to purge literature of didacticism, and some have gone further and argued that literature should be ethically and politically neutral. It is worth distinguishing these two objectives, because<br>

Human rights is often used as an ideological excuse for the exercise of arbitrary power; the security of western states has served as a justification for the constriction of personal freedom; and, with flags flying, Christian fundamentalists have called for the defense of western “values.” The best of them—political liberty, social justice, and cosmopolitanism—are rooted in the Enlightenment, and they retain their radical character.<br>

  Book Title: Randall Jarrell and His Age-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burt Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Burt's book examines all of Jarrell's work, incorporating new research based on previously undiscovered essays and poems. Other books have examined Jarrell's poetry in biographical or formal terms, but none have considered both his aesthetic choices and their social contexts. Beginning with an overview of Jarrell's life and loves, Burt argues that Jarrell's poetry responded to the political questions of the 1930s, the anxieties and social constraints of wartime America, and the apparent prosperity, domestic ideals, and professional ideology that characterized the 1950s. Jarrell's work is peopled by helpless soldiers, anxious suburban children, trapped housewives, and lonely consumers.
      Randall Jarrell and His Agesituates the poet-critic among his peers -- including Bishop, Lowell, and Arendt -- in literature and cultural criticism. Burt considers the ways in which Jarrell's efforts and achievements encompassed the concerns of his time, from teen culture to World War II to the Cuban Missile Crisis; the book asks, too, how those efforts might speak to us now.<br>

Bruce Robbins has shown how some literary intellectuals “manufacture vocations for themselves … in speaking in public, of the public, to the public, and to some extent for the public” (21). Stanley Fish, however, has argued that “literary criticism is 
                  only, today, an academic discipline [whose] specialized language … is the mark of its distinctiveness” (Professional 43). Responding to Robbins, to Fish, and to David Simpson, Timothy Peltason asks that contemporary critics learn from Victorian thinkers how to make “complex characterizations of the experiences …<br>

  Abstract: “In order to have a sense of who we are,” writes Charles Taylor, “we have to have a notion of how we have become, and of where we are going” (47). The unconscious (in psychoanalytic terms) bears traces of early experience; clinical practice moves from present experience to its roots in the recent or distant past. For these reasons and others, Jarrell’s poems often seek a past self within present experience, or a child within an adult. With help from concepts central to psychoanalysis, and from literary sources such as Wordsworth and Proust, his characters try to understand themselves as<br>

  Abstract: We have seen in the “Lost World” poems and throughout Jarrell’s oeuvre how he took care to define and defend the self. We have seen how his lonely personae seek intersubjective confirmation and how his alienated characters resist the so-called social world. We have seen how Jarrell’s divided, conflicted selves depend on psychoanalytic ideas—both those of a familiar Freudianism and those of later object-relations theories. We have seen how concepts of work and play, and related ideas about childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, both inform and confine the ways Jarrell’s characters think about their lives. And we have seen how<br>

Beginning with an overview of Jarrell's life and loves, Burt argues that Jarrell's poetry responded to the political questions of the 1930s, the anxieties and social constraints of wartime America, and the apparent prosperity, domestic ideals, and professional ideology that characterized the 1950s. Jarrell's work is peopled by helpless soldiers, anxious suburban children, trapped housewives, and lonely consumers.
      Randall Jarrell and His Agesituates the poet-critic among his peers -- including Bishop, Lowell, and Arendt -- in literature and cultural criticism. Burt considers the ways in which Jarrell's efforts and achievements encompassed the concerns of his time, from teen culture to World War II to the Cuban Missile Crisis; the book asks, too, how those efforts might speak to us now.<br>

  Chapter 2  INSTITUTIONS, PROFESSIONS, CRITICISM from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/burt12594">Randall Jarrell and His Age</a><br>
  Abstract: Recent years have seen an impassioned debate about academic institutions and the profession of letters. Bruce Robbins has shown how some literary intellectuals “manufacture vocations for themselves … in speaking in public, of the public, to the public, and to some extent for the public” (21). Stanley Fish, however, has argued that “literary criticism is 
                  only, today, an academic discipline [whose] specialized language … is the mark of its distinctiveness” (Professional 43). Responding to Robbins, to Fish, and to David Simpson, Timothy Peltason asks that contemporary critics learn from Victorian thinkers how to make “complex characterizations of the experiences …<br>

  Chapter 4  TIME AND MEMORY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/burt12594">Randall Jarrell and His Age</a><br>
  Abstract: “In order to have a sense of who we are,” writes Charles Taylor, “we have to have a notion of how we have become, and of where we are going” (47). The unconscious (in psychoanalytic terms) bears traces of early experience; clinical practice moves from present experience to its roots in the recent or distant past. For these reasons and others, Jarrell’s poems often seek a past self within present experience, or a child within an adult. With help from concepts central to psychoanalysis, and from literary sources such as Wordsworth and Proust, his characters try to understand themselves as<br>

  Abstract: We have seen in the “Lost World” poems and throughout Jarrell’s oeuvre how he took care to define and defend the self. We have seen how his lonely personae seek intersubjective confirmation and how his alienated characters resist the so-called social world. We have seen how Jarrell’s divided, conflicted selves depend on psychoanalytic ideas—both those of a familiar Freudianism and those of later object-relations theories. We have seen how concepts of work and play, and related ideas about childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, both inform and confine the ways Jarrell’s characters think about their lives. And we have seen how<br>

  Abstract: Human action has always been a mystery, even for those who perform it. Beyond the obvious train of events, the monotonous and predictable taking of decisions (which is often no more than assuming one’s own destiny, what is given to us and what we can accommodate only with decorum),¹ on a very few exceptional occasions the dull cadence of action is interrupted and, with a flash of proof, with an almost luminous character of revelation, the agent is shown the emptiness of his existence, the irreparable hollowness of his existential becoming.<br>

  Abstract: Some of the most enduring questions inspiring the modern study of medieval European cultures have concerned the relationship between person and community. How did medieval people relate to their communities, and what shaped or determined the nature of this relationship at certain moments and in particular places? To what extent can the self in the Middle Ages be understood as an autonomous individual or subject independent of the pressures of community, institution, and locality—as a “modern” subject, as some might characterize this species of individualism? Conversely, did the pressures of collectivity and commonality in medieval culture most often disallow<br>

  Author(s) Mooney Catherine M.<br>
  Abstract: Angela of Foligno as daughter, mother, and wife has a chameleonlike character, to judge by the opinions of her many editors and commentators. She is variously adulterous spouse or mistreated wife, tender or detached mother, daughter overly devoted to her mother or one eager to break free. These multiple representations of Angela are striking because each is based on evidence from a single source, known as the

  Abstract: The appeal of the Frankfurt School’s critical theory to a young leftist of the late 1960 s was based on a paradox expressed in the practice of both critical theory and the leftist. On the one hand, modern capitalist society seemed able to co-opt protest by integrating it into the dynamics of competitive business, creating a demand for the newest, most advanced, and most risqué products (a trend that continues today as cultural rebellion has became the motor of consumer society). On the other hand, that society was characterized by a spirit of revolt against its “one-dimensional” reduction of all<br>

  Abstract: As Ulrich Beck says, unlike other previous civilizations, we cannot attribute everything that threatens us to external causes; societies are in conflict with themselves, with the production of that which they do not desire. Explaining this characteristic contrasts with our common sense, which tends to establish net causalities, distinguishes subjects from objects, thinks in terms of hierarchy, and explains the idea of defense in terms of spatial protection. To identify and understand the nature of threats in a world that belongs to everyone and to no one, we have no choice but to make a “metaphorological” effort. I am going<br>

We can now register a fear with new characteristics in the fear taxonomy, and we could call it global fear, in other words, fear of the consequences of the process of globalization. It is a question of risks that have to be governed and from which we have the right to be protected. At the same time, unreasonable reactions to some of the concerns<br>

  Book Title: Civil and Uncivil Violence in Lebanon-A History of the Internationalization of Communal Conflict<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Khalaf Samir<br>
  Abstract: Lebanon's fragmented political culture is a byproduct of two general features. First, it reflects the traditional forces and political conflicts caused by striking differences in religious beliefs and communal and sectarian loyalties that continue to split the society and reinforce its factional character. Second, and superimposed on these, are new forms of socioeconomic and cultural stress caused by Lebanon's role in the continuing international conflicts in the region.<br>

  Abstract: The social and political history of Lebanon—despite occasional manifestations of consensus, balance and harmony—has always been characterized by successive outbursts of civil strife and political violence. The brutality and duration of almost two decades of senseless bloodletting might have obscured some of the earlier episodes. Consequently, observers are often unaware that much of Lebanon’s history is essentially a history of intermittent violence. Dramatic episodes such as the peasant uprisings of 1820, 1840, and 1857 and the repeated outbreaks of sectarian hostilities in 1841, 1845, 1860, 1958, and the protracted civil war of 1975–92, reveal, if anything, the<br>

  Abstract: A defining element in Lebanon’s checkered sociopolitical history, one that has had substantive implications for the character and magnitude of collective strife, is the survival and reassertion of communal solidarities. In fact, the three overarching and persisting features—(1) foreign intervention, (2) the reawakening of primordial identities, and (3) the escalation of protracted violence—are all intimately related. This is, after all, what informs the major thrust of this study. We will, in subsequent chapters, identify and account for the various forms foreign intervention has assumed.

It has been a source of bewilderment, as we have seen, to both its detractors and admirers. A few of those struck by its perplexities have been candid enough to caution against facile analysis and hasty inferences. Two veteran observers, separated by more than two decades of eventful history, advance almost the same sobering caveats.

  Abstract: This study is predicated on the overarching premise that much of the 
                     displaced and protracted character of collective strife that has beleaguered Lebanon at various interludes could well be a reflection of two other constant features of its fractious political history; namely the radicalization of communal solidarities and the unsettling, often insidious, character of foreign intervention. By probing further into the nature of this interplay one, it is hoped, can better understand when, how and why social strife becomes more belligerent and assumes some of the menacing cruelties of uncivil violence.<br>

  Abstract: Stories perform many functions for those who read them and those who write them. In this sense, we should first focus on what makes a story an important model for reflective judgment. I will argue that processes of aesthetic apprehension are created by the work of the productive imagination of some moral experiences. This makes stories important vehicles of reflective judgments. Through their written expression, moral stories have demonstrated that, in spite of many theorists’ skepticism, they capture the “ineffable” characteristics of evil actions.¹ In works of fiction as well as in historical stories about evil acts, the “ineffable” seems<br>

I have not yet defined why this connection is conceptually so important. I would like to argue in this chapter that moral wrongdoing is best described in actions wherein the characters are revealed in the complexity of their interactions, which are crystallized in plots. I have argued before that moral wrongdoing is one of the basic conditions for understanding evil because the perpetrator of evil actions causes permanent damage—that is, moral<br>

  Book Title: Reading the-The Literary Aims of a Theravada Buddhist History<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Scheible Kristin<br>
  Abstract: Reading the Mahavamsaadvocates a new, literary approach to this text by revealing its embedded reading advice (to experiencesamvegaandpasada) and affective work of metaphors (the Buddha's dharma as light) and salient characters (nagas). Kristin Scheible argues that theMahavamsarequires a particular kind of reading. In the text's proem, special instructions draw readers to the metaphor of light and thenagas, or salient snake-beings, of the first chapter.Nagasare both model worshippers and unworthy hoarders of Buddha's relics. As nonhuman agents, they challenge political and historicist readings of the text. Scheible sees these slippery characters and the narrative's potent and playful metaphors as techniques for refocusing the reader's attention on the text's emotional aims. Her work explains theMahavamsa's central motivational role in contemporary Sri Lankan Buddhist and nationalist circles. It also speaks broadly to strategies of reading religious texts and to the internal and external cues that give such works lives beyond the page.<br>

  Author(s): Shoulson Jeffrey S.<br>
  Abstract: Taking as its starting point the long-standing characterization of Milton as a "Hebraic" writer,
         Milton and the Rabbisprobes the limits of the relationship between the seventeenth-century English poet and polemicist and his Jewish antecedents. Shoulson's analysis moves back and forth between Milton's writings and Jewish writings of the first five centuries of the Common Era, collectively known as midrash. In exploring the historical and literary implications of these connections, Shoulson shows how Milton's text can inform a more nuanced reading of midrash just as midrash can offer new insights intoParadise Lost.<br>

  Abstract: Deeply shaped by the presentiment of an impending catastrophe, the dialogue between Adorno and Benjamin depicts a melancholy constellation. In a previous chapter, we have already observed the ambivalent assessments of Benjamin on melancholy, as they appear in both his book on the German tragic drama and his strongly critical review of Erich Kästner’s novels. Now, it is important to emphasize the melancholic character of Benjamin himself. According to many witnesses, melancholy was his deepest disposition; it also explains his fascination with

  Book Title: Flight Ways-Life and Loss at the Edge of Extinction<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): van Dooren Thom<br>
  Abstract: Each chapter of
      Flight Waysfocuses on a different species or group of birds: North Pacific albatrosses, Indian vultures, an endangered colony of penguins in Australia, Hawaiian crows, and the iconic whooping cranes of North America. Written in eloquent and moving prose, the book takes stock of what is lost when a life form disappears from the world -- the wide-ranging ramifications that ripple out to implicate a number of human and more-than-human others. Van Dooren intimately explores what life is like for those who must live on the edge of extinction, balanced between life and oblivion, taking care of their young and grieving their dead. He bolsters his studies with real-life accounts from scientists and local communities at the forefront of these developments. No longer abstract entities with Latin names, these species become fully realized characters enmeshed in complex and precarious ways of life, sparking our sense of curiosity, concern, and accountability toward others in a rapidly changing world.<br>

  Book Title: After Christianity-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): D’Isanto Luca<br>
  Abstract: When Vattimo was asked by a former teacher if he still believed in God, his reply was, "Well, I believe that I believe." This paradoxical declaration of faith serves as the foundation for a brilliant exposition on Christianity in the new millennium -- an age characterized by a deep uncertainty of opinion -- and a personal account of how Vattimo himself recovered his faith through Nietzsche and Heidegger. He first argues that secularization is in fact the fulfillment of the central Christian message, and prepares us for a new mode of Christianity. He then explains that Nietzsche's thesis concerns only the "moral god" and leaves room for the emergence of "new gods." Third, Vattimo claims that the postmodern condition of fragmentation, anti-Eurocentrism, and postcolonialism can be usefully understood in light of Joachim of Fiore's thesis concerning the "Spiritual Age" of history. Finally, Vattimo argues for the idea of "weak thought." Because philosophy in the postmetaphysical age can only acknowledge that "all is interpretation," that the "real" is always relative and not the hard and fast "truth" we once thought it to be, contemporary thought must recognize itself and its claims as "weak" as opposed to "strong" foundationalist claims of the metaphysical past. Vattimo concludes that these factors make it possible for religion and God to become a serious topic for philosophy again, and that philosophy should now formally engage religion.<br>

  Abstract: Among the numerous “conflicts” that characterize contemporary philosophical and intellectual discourse, the one between laicism¹ and religion—between the need for democratic states to promote confessional pluralism and substantial relativism, and the supposedly peremptory, authoritarian, and hegemonic culture of the religions—is emerging as one of the most crucial and important. The debate on the laicity of the state in France or in Turkey, the theologization of politics in the United States, the discussion of so-called postsecular society in Germany, the ongoing debate in Italy about the relation between relativism and faith, and the polemical fury over the clash of<br>

  Abstract: The story of the temptations of Jesus has been variously treated in the New Testament. Mark, in its characteristic terseness, devotes only two verses to the subject (1:12–13) that amount to no more than a summary. Providing a much lengthier account, the other two of the Synoptic Gospels agree on all essential features but diverge partially in the order of presentation. Both Matthew (4:1–11) and Luke (4:1–13) begin with the temptation of changing stones to bread; thereafter Matthew follows with the temptations of Jerusalem’s temple and of empire, whereas Luke reverses the order and ends the account<br>

  Abstract: The best way to characterize Confucianism in the Qing dynasty (hereafter Qing Confucianism) is to contrast it with what is called Song-Ming Neo-Confucianism. Song-Ming Neo-Confucians were primarily moral philosophers debating among themselves endlessly on metaphysical questions such as whether “moral princi ples” (
                  li理) are inherent in “human nature” (xing性) or in “human mind” (xin心). By contrast, Qing Confucians were, first and foremost, scholars devoting themselves painstakingly to philological explication of classical and historical texts. As a result, the Song-Ming Period witnessed the emergence and development of the rivalry between two major philosophical systems represented,respectively, by the Cheng-Zhu<br>

  Abstract: With a historiographical tradition as long and variegated as China’s, any attempt at a sweeping generalization of Chinese historical thought with a view to clearly distinguishing it from its Western counterpart is hazardous. To suggest that there are essential determinate characteristics in Chinese historiography that are wholly absent in the West is to lapse into a false essentialism. The more I know about the history of Western historiography, the less I am sure about the possibility of drawing a sharp distinction between the two traditions. As far as the individual component parts of Chinese and Western historiographies are concerned, they<br>

  Book Title: Why Only Art Can Save Us-Aesthetics and the Absence of Emergency<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): ZABALA SANTIAGO<br>
  Abstract: The state of emergency, according to thinkers such as Carl Schmidt, Walter Benjamin, and Giorgio Agamben, is at the heart of any theory of politics. But today the problem is not the crises that we do confront, which are often used by governments to legitimize themselves, but the ones that political realism stops us from recognizing as emergencies, from widespread surveillance to climate change to the systemic shocks of neoliberalism. We need a way of disrupting the existing order that can energize radical democratic action rather than reinforcing the status quo. In this provocative book, Santiago Zabala declares that in an age where the greatest emergency is the absence of emergency, only contemporary art's capacity to alter reality can save us.
      Why Only Art Can Save Usadvances a new aesthetics centered on the nature of the emergency that characterizes the twenty-first century. Zabala draws on Martin Heidegger's distinction between works of art that rescue us from emergency and those that are rescuersintoemergency. The former are a means of cultural politics, conservers of the status quo that conceal emergencies; the latter are disruptive events that thrust us into emergencies. Building on Arthur Danto, Jacques Rancière, and Gianni Vattimo, who made aesthetics more responsive to contemporary art, Zabala argues that works of art are not simply a means of elevating consumerism or contemplating beauty but are points of departure to change the world. Radical artists create works that disclose and demand active intervention in ongoing crises. Interpreting works of art that aim to propel us into absent emergencies, Zabala shows how art's ability to create new realities is fundamental to the politics of radical democracy in the state of emergency that is the present.<br>

  Abstract: In this intimate ethnography, Raquel Romberg seeks to illuminate the performative significance of healing rituals and magic works, their embodied nature, and their effectiveness in transforming the states of participants by focusing on the visible, albeit mostly obscure, ways in which healing and magic rituals proceed. The questions posed by Romberg emerge directly from the particular pragmatics of Puerto Rican brujería (witch-healing), shaped by the eclecticism of its rituals, the heterogeneous character of its participants, and the heterodoxy of its moral economy.<br>

  Abstract: From the early 1920s to the late 1950s the dialectic of modernism and tradition, whether classical or vernacular, characterized the Italian state’s architectural patronage.¹ This essay investigates post–World War II state-sponsored building initiatives, mainly housing, and the architectural debates accompanying their design and realization. It sets them against the backdrop of Italian architectural discourse on identity that surfaced during the Fascist period (1922–1943) and continued to weigh heavily on the decisions of architects and urban designers in postwar democratic Italy. The essay focuses on the role that appropriation of extant vernacular building traditions and the abandonment of classicism<br>

  Abstract: In this benchmark book, twelve international scholars tackle the most vexed question in khipu studies: how did the Inkas record and transmit narrative records by means of knotted strings? The authors approach the problem from a variety of angles. Several essays mine Spanish colonial sources for details about the kinds of narrative encoded in the khipu. Others look at the uses to which khipu were put before and after the Conquest, as well as their current use in some contemporary Andean communities. Still others analyze the formal characteristics of khipu and seek to explain how they encode various kinds of numerical and narrative data.<br>

  Abstract: Depending on which virtue is brought to the fore, a different Christian form of life appears, and the beauty of the church as a whole is thus variegated and enhanced. The early Dominicans found in the book of the prophet Zachariah a metaphoric and allegorical verse that foretells the establishment of the mendicant orders and characterizes the difference between the Franciscans and the Dominicans. Speaking as a shepherd who guides his flock by means of sweetness and strictness, the Lord declares: "And I will feed the flock…. And I took unto me two rods; one I called Beauty, and the<br>

In addition to examining the work itself, he considers the literary, philosophical, and intellectual-historical implications of theMnemosyne-Atlas. As Johnson demonstrates, theMnemosyne-Atlasis not simply the culmination of Warburg's lifelong study of Renaissance culture but the ultimate expression of his now literal, now metaphoric search for syncretic solutions to the urgent problems posed by the history of art and culture.<br>

  Book Title: Outlaw Rhetoric-Figuring Vernacular Eloquence in Shakespeare's England<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mann Jenny C.<br>
  Abstract: A central feature of English Renaissance humanism was its reverence for classical Latin as the one true form of eloquent expression. Yet sixteenth-century writers increasingly came to believe that England needed an equally distinguished vernacular language to serve its burgeoning national community. Thus, one of the main cultural projects of Renaissance rhetoricians was that of producing a "common" vernacular eloquence, mindful of its classical origins yet self-consciously English in character. The process of vernacularization began during Henry VIII's reign and continued, with fits and starts, late into the seventeenth century. However, as Jenny C. Mann shows in
         Outlaw Rhetoric, this project was beset with problems and conflicts from the start.<br>

This divinely sanctioned nakedness is tarted up with rhetorical frippery in a manner that is characteristic precisely of the way in which lies manifest themselves: “But since God has willed this to be the nature of the case, that simple and undisguised truth should be more clear, because it has sufficient ornament of itself, and on this account it is corrupted when embellished with adornings<br>

  Abstract: I would like now to provide further evidence of the pragmatic function of absolute metaphors in relation to two very specific examples, the 
                  terra incognita metaphor and the metaphorics of the ‘incomplete universe’. It is characteristic of both that they originate in quite specific historical ‘experiences’: the first gives a metaphorical gloss to the age of discovery’s conclusion that the ‘known world’, which for millennia was relatively constant and appeared to have certain zones of unfamiliarity only at its edges, proves in retrospect to have taken up only a small corner of the earth’s surface; the other views the universe<br>

The Bolsheviks in Russia and the Fascists in Italy both recognized the importance of mobilizing the masses through the elaboration of a civil religion.

  Abstract: Truth, reference, and meaning have traditionally been the three central notions in philosophical semantics. In the preceding two chapters we dealt with the question of the role to be assigned to reference and truth in (historical) representation. We found that representations cannot be said to refer to the world in the way proper names and sentences do, though they can be characterized as self-referential. Similarly, the notion of truth can meaningfully be used in the context of representation, not in the sense of propositional truth but in the quasi-Heideggerian sense of truth as a revelation of a past reality.

  Book Title: Mourning Happiness-Narrative and the Politics of Modernity<br>

  Author(s): Soni Vivasvan<br>
  Abstract: Soni explains that this puzzling phenomenon can only be comprehended by studying a structural transformation of the idea of happiness at the level of narrative form. Happiness is stripped of its ethical and political content, Soni demonstrates, when its intimate relation to narrative is destroyed. This occurs, paradoxically, in some of the most characteristic narratives of the period: eighteenth-century novels including
         Pamela, The Vicar of Wakefield, andJulie; the pervasive sentimentalism of the time; Kant's ethics; and the political thought of Rousseau and Jefferson.<br>

  Abstract: “Happiness is a new idea in Europe,” boasted Robespierre’s colleague Saint-Just in 1794.¹ He believed that the new era in human history ushered in by the American and French revolutions in the eighteenth century was characterized by an unprecedented attention to secular happiness as a political project. For Saint-Just the promise of the Enlightenment and the goal of revolutionary aspiration was comprehended in the word “happiness.” Contemporary scholars have by and large concurred with Saint-Just’s assessment. The eighteenth century, they claim, conferred respectability on the pursuit of secular happiness as no other period before it. Indeed, eighteenth-century thinkers, not satisfied<br>

  Book Title: Mourning Happiness-Narrative and the Politics of Modernity<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Soni Vivasvan<br>
  Abstract: Soni explains that this puzzling phenomenon can only be comprehended by studying a structural transformation of the idea of happiness at the level of narrative form. Happiness is stripped of its ethical and political content, Soni demonstrates, when its intimate relation to narrative is destroyed. This occurs, paradoxically, in some of the most characteristic narratives of the period: eighteenth-century novels including
         Pamela, The Vicar of Wakefield, andJulie; the pervasive sentimentalism of the time; Kant's ethics; and the political thought of Rousseau and Jefferson.<br>

  Book Title: Studies in Medievalism XXIV-Medievalism on the Margins<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Montoya Alicia C.<br>
  Abstract: This volume not only defines medievalism's margins, as well as its role in marginalizing other fields, ideas, people, places, and events, but also provides tools and models for exploring those issues and indicates new subjects to which they might apply. The eight opening essays address the physical marginalizing of medievalism in annotated texts on medieval studies; the marginalism of oneself via medievalism; medievalism's dearth of ecotheory and religious studies; academia's paucity of pop medievalism; and the marginalization of races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, and literary characters in contemporary medievalism. The seven subsequent articles build on this foundation while discussing: the distancing of oneself (and others) during imaginary visits to the Middle Ages; lessons from the margins of Brazilian medievalism; mutual marginalization among factions of Spanish medieval studies; and medievalism in the marginalization of lower socio-economic classes in late-eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Spain, of modern gamers, of contemporary laborers, and of Alfred Austin, a late-nineteenth- and early twentieth-century poet also known as Alfred the Little. In thus investigating the margins of and marginalization via medievalism, the volume affirms their centrality to the field.

  Author(s) Johnson Valerie B.<br>
  Abstract: This essay applies ecocriticism to the study of neomedieval texts, an approach that I term “ecomedievalism.” Ecomedievalism interlaces study of neomedievalisms through the bifurcated lens of ecocriticism and ecomaterialism.¹ Neomedieval texts continually deploy environmental descriptions and language to develop a sense of an authentic medieval setting, part of the worldbuilding process, yet little critical attention is devoted to analyzing these methods from an ecological perspective. Ecocriticism’s rapid theorization has allowed the field to move beyond the political activism that characterized its origins, and now offers an opportunity to begin academic study of the fictional environments in neomedievalisms.² Consequently, this essay<br>

  Author(s) Kessler Martin<br>
  Abstract: Among the theologians of the late eighteenth century, Herder combines a unique variety of traditional elements with highly progressive and innovative components. His publications touch on most classical fields of academic education as well as the broad range of professional interests typical of the Protestant clergy. Herder expanded the frontiers of academic theology, exploring and interpreting results of contemporary debates in the humanities and sciences. Within the boundaries of a transitory period characterized by rationalist, empirical, and idealistic currents of thought, Herder investigated the various positions by addressing a wide range of fundamental questions.

  Abstract: The above quotation, taken from a 1934 novel by Enid Dinnis, the main character of which is based loosely on the figure of Julian of Norwich, speaks volumes for the ‘industry’ of imaginative projection which Julian has become during the course of the last century or so. The very fact that this now obscure novel reached its sixth imprint in 1934 attests to its contemporary popularity and to a burgeoning fascination with Julian and the anchoritic life which she embraced. Since that time, Julian has become an increasingly familiar figure within both literary and non-literary circles, and both religious and<br>

  Abstract: Influenced – perhaps unduly – by an early encounter with Julian in Eliot’s

Hinted at inA Vision Showed to a Devout Woman, this becomes a defining characteristic ofA Revelation of Love¹ and, in looking at both texts as a work in progress, I have perceived both poet and poetic in process of becoming, the growth of a poet’s mind as Julian seeks ways of communicating what can be told of the nature of her mystical awakening.

  Abstract: In order to critique the philosophical concept of the absolute subject — the subject posited by German idealist thought — one need not dismiss wholesale all prior Western metaphysics, as did Heidegger. For his part, Kleist made narratives of such critiques. Casting a critical eye upon contemporary philosophical systems, he relentlessly denied absolution to the characters in his texts. His explorations of the fundamentally fragmentary nature of subjectivity implicated him in the same Romantic philosophical dilemma that I have been describing throughout. If an abyss can be said to have opened around 1800, Kleist fell into it. In this chapter<br>

  Abstract: For scholars of the Middle Ages, the old
                  French chanson de gestehas traditionally served as the benchmark for one extreme of a continuum of representation, a genre expressing the distilled essence of the medieval masculine. This reading of the epic presumes a transparent equivalence of the masculine with the body and actions of the knight, constructing the “male” as a necessary element in an ideology of chivalric caste and power. Furthermore, this definition of the masculine is, in Simon Gaunt’s words, “monologic,” meaning that “in thechansons de gestemale characters are defined as individuals in relation to other<br>

  Abstract: The relationship between the Church and medieval theater was fruitful and complex but it was also contested. Was the medieval Church a facilitator of, or an impediment to, the development of the theatrical form? How, for example, can one define the relationship between the dramatic elements of the liturgy and religious theater? Long ago Karl Young studied the drama of the medieval Church and its relation to the liturgy and posited rather rigid boundaries between the two.¹ For him, any text that does not clearly indicate that human actors impersonate or perform specific characters is not a play.

  Book Title: Middle English Romance and the Craft of Memory-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): McKINSTRY JAMIE<br>
  Abstract: In Middle English romances many memories are created, stored, forgotten, and rediscovered by both the characters and audience; such memory work is not, however, either simple or obvious. This study examines the ways in which recollection is achieved and sustained through physical, cognitive, and interpretative challenges. It uses examples such as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Sir Orfeo, and Emaré, alongside romances by Chaucer and Malory, to investigate the genre's reliance on individual and collective memorial processes. The author argues that a tale's objects, places, dreams, discoveries, disguises, prophecies, and dramatic ironies influence that romance's essential memory work, which relies as much on creativity as it does accuracy. He also explores the imaginative crafts of memory that are employed by romances themselves.

  Abstract: In the decade leading up to Nigeria’s independence, the three major ethno-regional blocs in the country, the eastern region, the northern region, and the western region, organized essentially around the three major political parties, the National Council for Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC) the Northern People’s Congress (NPC), and the Action Group (AG), respectively. The struggle to define the character and logic of the emergent state and imagined grand nation by the many ethnic nationalities of the regions, through the leveraging of group interests within the larger context, was evident in the major newspapers that represented each of these major<br>

  Chapter 3  Love and Relationships: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt1x72wv">The Novels of Josefina Aldecoa</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter will explore the complex issue of love and relationships in contemporary Spain. In recent times, attitudes towards marriage and the rituals and customs governing relationships have profoundly altered. In the novels
                  Porque éramos jóvenes(1986),El vergel(1988), andEl enigma(2002), Aldecoa charts the evolution of love and relationships in mid- to late twentieth-century Spain. Each of the protagonists in the novels is engaged in an on-going quest for love and self-fulfilment. They experience at first hand the euphoric highs and soul-destroying lows of forbidden romance, unrequited love, and marriages of convenience. Moreover, these middle-aged characters are<br>

  Abstract: Throughout the sixteenth century, the majority of the Christian territories of Europe went through a political evolution towards authoritarian monarchies. At this time, the Iberian Peninsula became the nucleus of a political entity
                     sui generis, characterized by the consolidation of numerous kingdoms and territories under the power of one prince. This, along with the development of strong royal power, transformed it into one of the pre-eminent models of authoritarian monarchy, or the “Modern State.”<br>

  Abstract: Desire was a defining element in early Enlightenment medievalisms, I have argued, because these medievalisms often expressed their longing for the past in an erotic or sexualized language. Embodied, performative forms of knowledge represented one response to the desire to physically touch the past. The 
                  roman genre provided another response to this erotization of the past due to its association with illicit desire and its supposedly seductive, corrupting power. For late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century authors, it was a cliché to think of the Middle Ages as a period characterized, above all, by the prominent place its literature assigned to<br>

  Book Title: The Faustian Century-German Literature and Culture in the Age of Luther and Faustus<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Weeks Andrew<br>
  Abstract: The Reformation and Renaissance, though segregated into distinct disciplines today, interacted and clashed intimately in Faust, the great figure that attained European prominence in the anonymous 1587 'Historia von D. Johann Fausten'. The original Faust behind Goethe's great drama embodies a remote culture. In his century, Faust evolved from an obscure cipher to a universal symbol. The age explored here as "the Faustian century" invested the 'Faustbuch' and its theme with a symbolic significance still of exceptional relevance today. The new essays in this volume complement one another, providing insights into the tensions and forces that gave the century its distinct character. Several essays seek Faust's prototypes. Others elaborate the symbolic function of his figure and discern the resonance of his tale in conflicting allegiances. This volume focuses on the intersection of historical accounts and literary imaginings, on shared aspects of the work and its times, on concerns with obedience and transgression, obsessions with the devil and curiosity about magic, and quandaries created by shifting religious and worldly authorities.

  Author(s) van der Laan J. M.<br>
  Abstract: For many reasons, we can consider the sixteenth century a Faustian age. One way to define the era in Faustian terms, and probably the most obvious, involves a particular individual, part fact perhaps, but almost entirely fiction, who emerges full blown in the sixteenth century and has been with us ever since as a dynamic figure laden with meaning. That person or character is Faust himself, who embodies the zeitgeist or spirit of the age. If we survey the century, we find that Faust receives more and more attention as the years go by and transforms from a cipher, from<br>

  Abstract: In retrospect, the period between 1968 and 1975 might be described as the “breakthrough years” during which Updike became a major novelist, introduced or returned to important recurring characters and themes into his fiction, and continued his exploration of the American scene. Of course, before 1968 Updike was well-known to a select group of readers and critics, many of whom had high regard for his work. While his audience among the general readership was considerable, it did not rival that of contemporary popular giants—writers like Leon Uris, Mary Renault, James Clavell, Irving Wallace, Mary Stewart, and Arthur Hailey.

  Abstract: During the second half of the 1970s, Updike carried out further exploration of familiar themes, especially in short stories and the 1976 novel 
                  Marry Me. He also made what was for him a decidedly bold move. Although he had occasionally written of locales and people other than those from his native Pennsylvania and his adopted home in New England, his 1978 novel The Coup marked his first attempt to render an extended treatment of another region of the world and deal with characters whose creation tested his imaginative powers in ways his earlier fiction had not.

  Abstract: The continuing debate over Updike’s status at the beginning of the twenty-first century can be illustrated by the following three assessments. In his lengthy 
                  History of American Literature (2004), Richard Gray describes Updike as a master craftsman whose novels deal with problems posed by the “entropic vision” that characterizes modern life (615). But Jay Prosser (2001b) insists that, whatever Updike’s supporters say about his talents, the decline in his reputation, though not “spectacular,” has been “significant.” Prosser believes this falling off is inevitable, because in his view Updike was never “America’s most representative contemporary author”; instead, if he “was ever<br>

  Author(s) Egger Sabine<br>
  Abstract: It could be argued that the poetry of Johannes Bobrowski (1917–1965) tends towards absolute moral polarities, with Germans generally bad, and their Jewish, Polish, and other victims equally good, rather than exploring the complexities of individuals, ethnic communities, and their relations. This does not apply in the same way to the prose fiction he increasingly turned to in the 1960s. Several of his narrative texts show a German soldier with positive character traits, partly representing the author’s own experience, while pointing to the insufficiency of these traits in the historical context.

  Abstract: In the aftermath of the Second World War, it was through fiction that many French writers decided to reflect on the conflict. Unsurprisingly, the relationship between “occupiers” and “occupied” was often depicted quite simplistically: German soldiers were either robots or barbarians. Yet, many texts — including the best sellers

  Author(s) Horning Audrey<br>
  Abstract: Public and community archaeologies clearly have their deepest roots in places characterised by structural, societal inequities, and in situations where archaeologists have sought to be inclusive. As such, community archaeology has been generally theorised within a postcolonial, post-processual framework whereby we as scholars and trained professionals question our own position and our right to talk about the past of ‘other people’, often disenfranchised people. As characterised by Gemma Tully, the principal rationale for community archaeology is that ‘better archaeology can be achieved when more diverse voices are involved in the interpretation of the past.’¹ The best of these new inclusive<br>

  Book Title: El niño en el cine argentino de la postdictadura (1983-2008)-alegoría y nostalgia<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): DUFAYS SOPHIE<br>
  Abstract: Este libro constituye la primera monografía dedicada al papel del niño en el cine latinoamericano. El análisis detallado de una decena de películas argentinas de la post-dictadura dirigidas entre 1983 y 2008, incluyendo tanto clásicas (La historia oficial, Un lugar en el mundo) como olvidadas (Amigomio, El rigor del destino), revela cómo la mirada y el lenguaje del niño son puestos al servicio de una alegoría nostálgica, estructurada en torno a la memoria o al lenguaje verbal y vinculada a la figura del padre ausente. Dufays combina los análisis fílmicos con una amplia reflexión teórica sobre las cuatro nociones clave de alegoría, melancolía, nostalgia y duelo y los articula con una genealogía de la figura alegórica del niño en las tradiciones narrativas latinoamericanas. Este recorrido permite al lector explorar las significaciones simbólicas y discursivas que el personaje infantil, la infancia y la familia han adquirido en el cine y en el contexto postdictatorial argentino. Sophie Dufays es investigadora postdoctoral del Fondo Nacional de Investigación Científica de Bélgica, en la Universidad de Louvain-la-Neuve. This book is the first monograph devoted to the role of the child in Latin American cinema. Through close analysis of about ten Argentine fiction films of the post-dictatorship period directed between 1983 and 2008, including both classic such as The Official Story and A Place in the World) and forgotten works such as Amigomío and El rigor del destino. Dufays shows how the child's gaze and language are a means of focusing a nostalgic form of allegory, structured around either memory or verbal language, and related to the figure of the absent father. In combining these analyses with a wide theoretical articulation of four key notions (allegory, melancholy, mourning and nostalgia) and with a genealogy of the allegorical child character in Latin American narrative traditions, Relatos de infancia allows the reader to explore the meanings that childhood and family have come to acquire in cinema, particularly in the Argentine post-dictatorial context. Sophie Dufays is a FNRS Postdoctoral Researcher (Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research) at the University of Louvain-la-Neuve.<br>

  Book Title: Arno Schmidt's 'Zettel's Traum'-An Analysis<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Langbehn Volker Max<br>
  Abstract: Arno Schmidt (1914-1979) is considered one of the most daring and influential writers of postwar Germany; the Germanist Jeremy Adler has called him a "giant of postwar German literature." Schmidt was awarded the Fontane Prize in 1964 and the Goethe Prize in 1973, and his early fiction has been translated into English to high critical acclaim, but he is not a well-known figure in the English-speaking world, where his complex work remains at the margins of critical inquiry. Volker Langbehn's book introduces Schmidt to the English-speaking audience, with primary emphasis on his most famous novel, 'Zettel's Traum'. One reviewer called the book an "elephantine monster" because of its unconventional size (folio format), length (1334 pages and over 10 million characters), and unique presentation of text in the form of notes, typewritten pages, parallel columns, and collages. The novel narrates the life of the main characters, Daniel Pagenstecher, Paul Jacobi and his wife Wilma, and their teenage daughter Franziska. In discussing the life and works of Edgar Allan Poe, the four engage in the problems connected with a translation of Poe. Langbehn's study investigates how literary language can mediate or account for the world of experiences and for concepts. Schmidt's use of unconventional presentation formats challenges us to analyze how we think about reading and writing literary texts. Instead of viewing such texts as a representation of reality, Schmidt's novel destabilizes this unquestioned mode of representation, posing a radical challenge to what contemporary literary criticism defines as literature. No comprehensive study of 'Zettel's Traum' exists in English. Volker Langbehn is associate professor of German at San Francisco State University.<br>

  Abstract: In this poem, Cuban poet José Martí depicts the arrival of African slaves in Cuba in a tragic manner.¹ His characterization surrounds the violence done to Africans with metaphors of nature’s ferocity. The little boy in the last stanza foreshadows and represents the Cuban nation yet to be born out of this sordid past. The two tropes, of violence and nature, provide an entry point for a discussion of the development of the use of the idea of the African citizen in constructing national identity in Cuba. This idea of the emerging Afro-Cuban citizen was reformulated through re-remembering race and<br>

  Author(s) Eibl Doris G.<br>
  Abstract: For a long time Quebec short fiction did not rank highly in the hierarchy of genres. In the 1980s and 1990s, however, it experienced a boom in popularity, with the number of publications steadily rising: In the early 1970s only about ten short-story volumes had been published per annum, whereas the 1990s saw an average of thirty to thirty-five volumes published per year, not to mention publications in numerous journals and weekly as well as daily newspapers. From the mid-1970s onwards a great thematic and formal diversity could be found in French-Canadian short stories. This diversity, characterized by a seemingly<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt81gcs">History of Literature in Canada</a><br>
  Author(s) Mathis-Moser Ursula<br>
  Abstract: Oralités-Polyphonix 16, a festival and symposium that took place in Quebec in June 1991, explored fundamental aspects of orality, its forms and functions as well as its specific Québécois character. Orality can operate both in a printed text and in the act of performing, whose most popular manifestation — next to theater and dance — is the chanson. One of the many facets of orality is the euphonic experiment with linguistic material, which has already been touched upon in connection with surrealist and postsurrealist sound effects and language practices (see ch. 17, Mathis-Moser), and which is especially prominent in the works of,<br>

  Abstract: My characterization of the ethical potentialities of exemplary rhetoric admittedly flies in the face of a commonplace critical presumption about the teleology of morals and the authoritarian nature of didactic literature. A composite sketch of the teleological account might take the following form: morality took an unfortunate turn in the Middle Ages when it assimilated itself to Church-dominated dogmatism, until moral rationalism found its feet again in the autonomous ethics of Enlightenment reason and Reformist spirituality.

  Author(s) Chronister Necia<br>
  Abstract: Unlike any other medium, literature has the ability to employ the reader’s imagination in the construction of bodies. When a narrator communicates information about a text’s characters, the reader completes the act of constructing bodies by imagining their contours, postures, and gestures. A character’s gender is thus dependent upon both the narrator’s speech—his/her use of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives—and the reader’s expectations regarding gender. If the narrator omits information about the character’s gender, the reader finds clues in the text—social cues, behaviors, and actions—to fill in that information and assign one. Such moments activate literature’s potential<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt9qdmdt">German Women's Writing in the Twenty-First Century</a><br>
  Author(s) Stehle Maria<br>
  Abstract: Since the mid-2000s there has been a marked uptick across the Western world of discussions surrounding the validity and effectiveness of feminism today.¹ Terms such as “postfeminism” or “lifestyle feminism” are increasingly used to characterize a popular interest in making feminism palatable through depoliticization, even as political actions are publicly evaluated as successes or failures on the basis of criteria more appropriate for their second-wave forebears. These discussions either brand feminist cultural production as successful activism against a sexist, mainstream, and consumerist culture, or condemn it as mere media sensation that points to the failure or ineffectuality of feminism today.<br>

  Book Title: Arturo Pérez-Reverte: Narrative Tricks and Narrative Strategies-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): WALSH ANNE L.<br>
  Abstract: The writings of Arturo Pérez-Reverte, one of Spain's most renowned contemporary authors, have been described as a minefield. This monograph examines the complexities behind the narrative technique employed in creating such a minefield, including an analysis of the role played by both male and female characters, the relevance of the past as a motif, and aspects of the role of storytelling in creating mystery where none should exist. Both Revertian novels and journalistic writing are seen to be part of an over-all game which is played between their author and his readers. Film, too, forms part of the material reviewed as, though Pérez-Reverte is not a script writer, many films have been based on his novels. The text-centred analysis concludes that the themes of interest in all Revertian output revolve around two main areas: the significance of the past, whether historical, cultural, or literary, and the role of the written word in communicating, in rescuing and in challenging versions of that past in order to combat what Pérez-Reverte terms 'dismemory'.

  Book Title: Juan Goytisolo: The Author as Dissident-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): de Menezes Alison Ribeiro<br>
  Abstract: This monograph offers two new perspectives on Spanish writer, Juan Goytisolo. First, under the themes of authorship and dissidence, it integrates his writing across several genres, providing a rounded assessment of his contribution to cultural debates in Spain since the sixties and arguing that resistance to repressive discourses characterizes his essays and autobiographies as much as his fiction. Second, it revises the prevailing critical interpretation of Goytisolo's fiction by building on four premises: that his novels are less clearly oppositional than prevailing interpretations imply; that, in order to engage with discourses of identity, he employs an idiom which, contrary to his own statements, is not a poststructuralist autonomous world of words; that a textual practice grounded in the recognizable experience of post-Civil War Spain, rather than one which seeks out the realm of pure textuality, is essential to Goytisolo's subversive political intentions; and that the autobiographical element of much of his work constitutes a more complex narrative aesthetic than has been appreciated. The book argues that if Goytisolo's work is interpreted as an ethical engagement with postmodernist theory, rather than as an illustration of it, then certain contradictions for which he has been criticized are seen in a new and valuable light.

  Abstract: In the opening pages of 
                  Biography: A Very Short Introduction, Hermione Lee describes the genre of biography through the striking metaphors of the autopsy and the portrait. A biography is like an autopsy because it literally opens up the individual to ‘investigate, understand, describe, and explain what may have seemed obscure, strange, or inexplicable’ (Lee 2009, 1). Conversely, the metaphor of the portrait suggests that biographies can capture the character of a subject, bringing a person to life through ‘attention to detail and skill in representation’ (Lee 2009, 2). Taken together, these metaphors underscore both the analytical and representational operations<br>

  Abstract: King’s importance to indigenous literatures is well established throughout Canada and the United States, and he is one of the bestknown Cherokee authors outside of North America. In his essays and fiction, King often challenges Western stereotypes of Indigenous peoples and provides literary concepts, characters, symbols, and narratives that more accurately represent the complex context of Indigenous literatures. Indeed, King’s works have been groundbreaking for the study of Indigenous issues not only in Canadian society, but also as they relate to colonial histories in countries around the world.

  Abstract: Thomas king published major works prior to and simultaneously with a shift in the primary focus of American Indian literary critical inquiry from issues of culture and identity to questions of history and politics. Much of the early scholarship on King’s fiction, therefore, approaches it with an interest in identities and storytelling strategies and assesses its cultural, multicultural, and crosscultural character. The attention to American Indian intellectual, activist, and tribal nation specific histories by Osage scholar Robert Warrior (1995), Cherokee scholar Jace Weaver (1997), and Muscogee Creek and Cherokee scholar Craig Womack (1999) shapes more recent critical work, for example,<br>

  Author(s) Rintoul Suzanne<br>
  Abstract: Much of the criticism on Thomas King’s fiction focuses on border crossing, and rightly so: national boundaries, town lines, bridges, rivers, and myriad other signs point to in-between spaces where King renegotiates hierarchical binaries. The role of gender in relation to this motif, though, remains underexplored. King’s texts are full of gender-ambiguous characters, some of whom harness the power to revise the dominant discourses of Empire, but discussions of gender have nevertheless taken the proverbial backseat to discussions of race.¹ This is surprising, given that the intersectionality of race and gender has been well established in feminist and postcolonial theory<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7758/9781610441872">Fighting For Time</a><br>
  Author(s) Collinson Margaret<br>
  Abstract: The analytical significance of time has long been recognized in the natural science writings of Galileo, Newton, and Einstein and in the philosophical tracts of Heidegger, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche, among others. Indeed an awareness of a past, a present, and a future, and of the finiteness of life are central features of human existence (Berger and Luckmann 1967). Human beings find meaning and identity in the temporal character of existence (Urry 1991, Collinson 2003). Yet it is only relatively recently that the importance of time has been acknowledged in theories of society (Giddens 1979, 1984, 1987; Adam 1990; Harvey 1990;<br>

  Author(s) Gould Mark<br>
  Abstract: The inability of scholars and practitioners in the field of law and economics to conceptualize the value commitments that characterize professional responsibility, their expectation that all actors will act opportunistically in situations of imperfect information, and their commitment to private ordering and the undermining of legal rules have weakened severely the duties of care and loyalty that ground corporate law. Should we be surprised that corporate officers fail to put shareholder and firm interests above their own (the duty of loyalty) and that they fail to adhere to transparent processes providing shareholders and other stakeholders sufficient information to make independent<br>

  Author(s) BEN-DAVID JOSEPH<br>
  Abstract: Sociology of knowledge was very popular in continental European sociology during the 1920s and 1930s, went into almost complete oblivion during and after World War II, to reappear again with added force about 1970 (Curtis & Petras 1970; Fuhrman 1980; Hamilton 1974; Merton 1973; Remmling 1967; Stark 1958). This recent interest in the sociology of knowledge has been distinguished from prewar sociology of knowledge by three characteristics: (1) the field is now as popular in Britain as on the continent of Europe and has many adherents also in the United States; (2) it also claims as its domain science, a<br>

  Abstract: Modernity has two related definitions, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. It is “the quality or condition of being modern; modernness of character or style,” and “an intellectual tendency or social perspective characterized by departure from or repudiation of traditional ideas, doctrines, and cultural values in favor of contemporary or radical values and beliefs (chiefly those of scientific rationalism and liberalism).” The second definition with its emphasis on breaking from tradition has its roots in the European Enlightenment and French Revolution, though Enlightenment writers themselves did not use the specific term

  Abstract: Trials against former leaders of a dictatorial regime are symbolic moments in the founding of a new political order. Beyond the classic functions of criminal justice (punishing the guilty, preventing similar deeds in the future and reinforcing respect for the law), these trials can also play an epistemic role in societies in transition.¹ They constitute important processes of narrative construction, understood as “storytelling” (
                  mise en récit) about injustice. The selection of the relevant facts at the trial, their legal characterization, and the assignation of blame by sentencing may constitute public affirmations of an official and normative version of events,² which<br>

  Abstract: Eastern European countries seem locked mentally somewhere between the discovery of the intrinsic logic of capitalism characteristic of the nineteenth century and the post-Weimar Republic period. This is a period characterized by an incredibly fast economic growth and a passionate advocacy of the values of free enterprise and capitalism, accompanied by a good deal of anomie, fission of the body social, stark social contrasts, shocking degrees of corruption, a culture of poverty (to recall Oscar Lewis’s term which refers to low trust, self-victimization, disbelief in social ties and networks, contempt for institutions, and so on), and cynicism.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7829/j.ctt1cgf87j">Serbian Orthodox Fundamentals</a><br>
  Abstract: Orthodoxy, as already suggested, through the dialectical interaction of her religious content—doctrinal and functional—with the national substance of the Serbian being, sacralises the identity of the latter in the confines of the human–divine communion. Spatial, sacramental, historical, temporal, aesthetic, and spiritual signifiers or referents of faith contribute toward the constitution of a holistic and objectified experience that permeates the nature of the national collectivity. A genealogy of right belief, underlined by the “mediative” presence of venerated patriots and the autocephaly of ecclesiastical institutions, concretise the convergence of the catholic and universal character of Orthodoxy into a unique<br>

The present article sets out to review the films of the last twenty years dealing with the Soviet period. Despite the declared break with the past, characteristic of transitional societies, a closer look at the social and cultural fabric of “post-Communism” reveals that the simplistic opposition of “before” versus “after” is subverted by recurrent long-term intellectual frameworks, narrative devices, and visual imagery, employed to make sense of the world “here and now” as well as “there<br>

In such a landscape, the language of categories and coordinates is subverted in favor of blurriness, uncertainty, and the supernatural. I call this cohort the doubletake generation, in reference to their coming of age at the time of the Soviet Union’s collapse. Upon reaching adulthood, they revisit the intense historical experience that coincided with their childhood or adolescence—a time when external changes fuse with internal ones, and<br>

  Abstract: The curious genre of medieval magical handbooks has been researched for many decades. Already Lynn Thorndike, in his famous

This category of fresh deceased usually lasts one year, which is the necessary time period for<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: Theories are always, in some way, about their theorists. While Luhmann’s variant of mutant functionalism is not palatable to American tastes, his theories are as reflective of late‐20th‐century European sensibilities as Parsons’s were of mid‐20th‐century America or Bellah and Geertz’s of the upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, some art critics have warmed to Luhmann’s book as an exemplar of one of the newer “cool” theories of art; that is, those that challenge more subject‐centered and humanist theories and aim to accommodate the growth of new mediums such as digital art and cyberspace. But in any conception of art that includes culture, the medium is only as good as the meaning it conveys. And it is the meaning of art that is sorely lacking in Luhmann’s appraisal. Paul Ricoeur once wrote that “materialism is the truth of a world without truth.” It might then be said of Luhmann’s conception of the art system that it is the truth of art without meaning.<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Doctrine and method, theory and interpretation are not necessarily coordinate. Were such coordination possible, a metacritical stance would be required. By accepting uncritically the presuppositions that lie behind psychoanalytic metapsychology, Juillerat abrogates, in my view, ethnological responsibility, that is, the responsibility to measure in a receptive manner the presuppositions of ones hermeneutic against those of the culture one is studying. Though his attention to ethnographic detail leads Juillerat to refine psychoanalytic doctrine, it confirms the epistemological and hermeneutic assumptions of that doctrine (e.g., notions of the unconscious, id, ego, and superego, drives, repression, and, indeed, psychic space). Yafar myth and ritual as he presents them become allegories of that doctrineallegories, I would argue, of allegories. There would appear to be no escape, were it not for the Yafar voices that sound through Juillerats psychoanalytically predetermined presentations. (He offers us almost no contextualized verbatim texts in these essays, though he does in his monographs.) They remind us that, as LviStrauss demonstrated, myths are readily translated one into another, particularly when they are decontextualized. What is of ethnographic, indeed, psychoanalytic import is howand perhaps whytranslation is arrested and a particular myth (e.g., the Oedipal tale) becomes so authoritative that it has the power of promiscuous reduction. Though fascinated by the range of Yafar cultural expression, Juillerat fails to consider the implications of Yafars refusal to reduce their corpus of mythology and ritual to a single mytha singular ritual.<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”
            Theological Studies47 (1986): 44–45.<br>

Abstract: Scholars and their students interested in the field would do well to begin with these studies, despite some unevenness in period, place, and theme. Developments in the twentieth century, for example, are not well served, especially as their globalization bursts all traditional boundaries in the discipline, making a historical perspective essential to an understanding of ongoing transformations in literate life everywhere, not just in the West. Similarly, the absence of illustrations undermines the potential value of these books as introductions to the history of reading. Much of the work here depends on the material objects that readers actually had; without images of them, the reader develops less of a sense of the field. Finally, the exclusion of the essays on correspondence from the original collection is deeply regrettable; Chartier’s summary of their implications in the introduction hardly does justice to them, especially to the important study of the 1847 postal survey by Dauphin and two other colleagues. The translations are generally accurate, but the indexes are barely adequate.<br>

Abstract: Hence, our choice of philosophies should not be limited to the two main philosophies identified by Budd but rather could take up ideas from process thinking, which is a quieter but nevertheless relevant philosophy to which LIS should attend. By valuing the processes and articulating this with better abstractions more congruent with our action, we not only further our own project; we also sustain a vital engagement with the projects of individuals. We more clearly articulate the library in the life of the user, to use the words of Wiegand [

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question about the extent to which novels can be understood as “evidence” in any sense at all, or whether Kern should be focusing on trial reports rather than their fictionalized representations. This difficulty would be obviated if the focus of the work were an understanding of the impact of developments in scientific theory on narrative form, yet Kern seems reluctant to move fully in this direction. And indeed, if the ideal reader ofA Cultural History of Causalityis in fact a literary critic, he or she may be inclined to probe a number of Kern’s other assumptions as well—he is perhaps a little too inclined to assert that the Victorian novel is artistically “tidy,” that its patterns of closure are always neat and carefully wrought, as an expression of what Thomas Vargish has called “the providential aesthetic” in his study of the same name (Virginia, 1985). Scholars of nineteenth‐century fiction may perhaps feel that Kern’s descriptions of such neat closures sit uncomfortably with their readings ofBleak House(which is as much about the loss and destruction of evidence as it is about its recovery and careful explication) orOur Mutual FriendorDaniel DerondaorThe Brothers Karamazov(each of which problematizes our sense of a character’s relentless movement toward transgression, judgment, and punishment or acquittal). One is left with a sense that Kern occasionally deploys the term “Victorian” in a rather unsophisticated fashion: as Thomas has shown inDetective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science,even the most carefully crafted detective story of the nineteenth century can raise for readers and critics crucial questions about individual and national identity and the power of public surveillance. Yet these criticisms should not undermine a reader’s sense of Kern’s achievement in this book: it is a vast, ambitious attempt to effect a synthesis of scientific thought and literary experimentation, and on the whole it succeeds well.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: Instructive as his book is, Popkin could also have explored in greater depth yet the relationship between historical scholarship and expressions of the self. By focusing on autobiographies alone, he misses an opportunity to examine how such texts and scholarly publications related to (and possibly affected) one another, most notably in their divergent or convergent patterns of self‐representation. The boundary between autobiographical and scholarly writings may be more porous than Popkin intimates. Paul Hollander’s recent study of academic acknowledgments arrives, for instance, at conclusions that mirror Popkin’s regarding self‐representation and professional norms (“Acknowledgments: An Academic Ritual,”
   Academic Questions15, no. 1 [2001–2]: 63–76). Likewise, one could question why Popkin limited himself to the discursive analysis of published sources and “the motives that historian‐autobiographers acknowledge in their texts” (78). Autobiographies are also social practices that call for systematic research outside the text, in archival and published sources (and, perhaps, interviews as well). But Popkin is too good a historian not to know this. His book is by and about historians; it is dedicated to historians, but it is not only for historians. Its chief objective may well be to show how much the historian’s autobiography has contributed “to the literature of personal life writing” (8). In this respect as in many others,History, Historians, and Autobiographyis a success.<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] I wish to thank the editors of the AHR, first, for inviting me to consider the issues in this essay, second, for the helpful comments of Acting Editor Jeffrey Wasserstrom, and, third, for the quite stimulating commentary of several anonymous reviewers. 1 See Eric Foner, ed., The New American History (Philadelphia, 1990); Foner, ed., The New American History, rev. and expanded edn.

Beard.4 But during the 1970s, the claims being made for a national mind or culture were challenged by social historians. Intellectual history was chastened and transformed by the confrontation with social history. Eschewing their former embrace of synthesis, intellectual historians pulled back to study more precisely defined themes and thinkers.5 Not only intellectual history but other subfields accommodated social history's provocation to rethink conventional gen- eralizations. In addition, a professional, even "social-scientific," concern for precision and specificity of reference collaborated-sometimes with forethought, often not-with a sharpened awareness of difference and conflict that came from social movements outside the academy to undermine older composite narratives. Neither the frame supplied by Charles and Mary Beard in The Rise of American Civilization (1927), with its dramatic narrative of conflict between the "people" and the "interests," nor the consensual pluralism that succeeded that interpretation in the 1950s survived.6 If the consensus historians underplayed conflict, the Beards' approach, for all of its sympathy for the dispossessed, was found to be inadequate as well. Their narrative revealed little feel for the diversity of Americans, and it paid scant attention to non-whites. Most important of all, while their narrative voice was sympathetic, one did not discover the quotidian life or hear the voices of those groups that have found voice in more recent historiography. Judged by newer historiographical expectations, The Rise of American Civilization seemed "thin," compared with the increasingly popular "thick" description that was built, in part, on the enormously influential anthropological work of Clifford Geertz.7 In the past quarter century, there has been a proliferation of exciting new research, much of it bringing previously overlooked or explicitly excluded groups and events into the light of history. The number and variety of American stories multiplied. Suddenly, there were histories where there had been none or where the available histories had not been attended to by professional historians: histories of African Americans in the era of slavery and beyond; of Native Americans; of workers at home in their communities, at work, and at play; of women at home and outside of the home and of gender relations more generally; of consumption as well as production; of ethnic minorities and "borderlands"; of popular culture and other "marginal" forms of cultural production; of objects and material culture; of whites and whiteness as historical subjects; of non-state international and intercultural relations; and much more.

These developments were occurring at a moment when the number of American historians was expanding to an unprecedented degree. Disciplinary expansion both allowed and prompted increased specialization. And that worried some, who began to speak of hyperspecialization and fragmentation. The structure of specialization derived in large part from the impact of a social history that often fused the group-based particularity of focus with ideological commitments to class and identity-based social movements. This pattern of work discouraged the integration of particular histories into some kind of synthesis.8 Traditionalists, perhaps not surprisingly, were unnerved by these develop- ments.9 But even some proponents of the newer history worried. Early on, Herbert G. Gutman, one of the leading figures in the movement to write a history that included all Americans and that recognized differences-class, ethnic, racial, gender-was concerned that instead of enriching and enlarging the usable history of the United States, the new scholarship was failing to do that, perhaps making it in fact less usable. The "new social history," he wrote in the introduction to his collection of pioneering essays in the field, "suffers from a very limiting overspe- cialization." Take an Irish-born Catholic female textile worker and union organizer in Fall River involved in a disorderly strike in 1875. She might be the subject of nearly a dozen sub-specializations, which would, he feared, "wash out the wholeness that is essential to understanding human behavior."10 Later, in the wake of a national meeting of writers at which historians and history seemed to be largely ignored in discussions of the political and cultural situation in the aftermath of Richard Nixon, Gutman mused aloud in the pages of The Nation over whether the failure of historians to incorporate social history's findings into a new synthesis had seriously diminished, even evacuated, history's possible contribution to public debate."1 In the mid-1980s, in what turned out to be a controversial pair of articles, I raised a related question: how might one construct the (to my mind) needed synthesis of recent historiography on the United States.12 There was considerable negative reaction to those articles, coming from two different positions.

These arguments were equated with a carelessness about scholarly rigor.13 The other, and more widespread position, focused on the risks of a national narrative itself. It was evidently feared that such a narrative would, by definition, re-exclude those groups and themes that had so recently been brought under the umbrella of history and would re-inscribe a "master narrative" dominated by white, elite males.14 By the end of the 1980s, however, the question of synthesis had become less controversial. The issue became more practical, more professional in some sense: how to do it and how to do it within the parameters of inclusion that had been central to the discussion from the beginning. It was on this note that Alice Kessler-Harris, the author of the chapter on social history in The New American History (1990 edition), addressed the question. In the last section of her essay, with the section title of "The Problem of Synthesis," she acknowledged the problem and explored various possible ways to overcome "fragmentation" and move toward synthesis.15 A different issue emerged in the 1990s. Poststructuralist literary and cultural theory, sometimes broadly and even more vaguely characterized as postmodernism, was and is suspicious of any aspiration toward a comprehensive narrative. It is to this body of theory that we owe the commonplace use and misuse of the epithet "master narrative."16 These theories have been rather slow to penetrate workaday historical practice among American historians. Levels and types of awareness of them vary: from shocked indignation at the whole idea, to vague awareness and thoughtless dismissal, to intellectual fascination largely in isolation from the making of one's own histories. In his recent book, Beyond the Great Story: History as Text and Discourse (1995), Robert Berkhofer seeks to force more attention to these issues. Insistently, but not always consistently, he urges historians to recognize the dimensions of the postmodern crisis that surrounds them. He seems more interested in sounding the alarm about the quicksand before us than in guiding us [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 13 Eric H.

But either way, he intends to challenge the very possibility of narrative synthesis.17 While these worries, proposals, and polemics were being fashioned, the daily work of historians proceeded. Among the products of that work have been a good number of explicitly synthetic volumes. There is, of course, no clear or settled notion of what defines a work of synthesis. I have used a rather generous definition. Some of the books I am calling synthetic might alternatively be designated as monographs-archivally based but exceptionally ambitious books that tackle big questions and seek to frame a large field or to provide an interpretation for an audience well beyond specialists. Others are more obviously synthetic, relying heavily on secondary literature to establish the state of the art in a broad field for a wide audience, including, often, students and the general public. With this diversity of form, purpose, and audience in mind-as well as a concern for a reasonable distribution of fields and periods-I have, with the help of the editors of the American Historical Review, selected a few recent synthetic works for examina- tion.18 The very existence of these books mutes the question of whether we need synthetic works or whether, under the constraints of present historiographical practice, synthesis is possible. In fact, the seeming proliferation of syntheses at present-and their variousness-suggests that the field of American history is at a formative (or reformative) moment that invites synthesis: the quest for new understandings that has undermined established narratives has now, perhaps, prompted new efforts at crystallizing a very unstable body of historical writing into new syntheses. A different question, however, provides the focus of this essay. What strategies for narrative synthesis are available to historians today? How might we think about the relation between a particular structure of narrative synthesis and the author's purpose or interpretation? How do these different strategies relate to current historiography? What particular work do they do, within the profession and beyond it? And finally I want to ask some questions about the firmness of the boundaries (mostly geographical) that define what is and is not captured in synthetic narratives of U.S. history. These works do not, of course, cover the whole field of synthetic works. More and other books could have been chosen, but these eleven books (and several others mentioned along the way) at least represent different kinds of history, different [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 17 Robert F.

Together, the eleven total nearly 6,000 pages of outstanding historical writing. If nothing else, I can conclude that synthetic narrative invites long books. Because I cannot claim special knowledge in any of the fields being synthesized in these books, I do not propose to do the kind of analysis one would find in specialized reviews. Such criticisms that I have will be framed from the position of my interest in synthetic narrative. I say that in part to be honest about my own limitations in appraising these books but also for another, more positive reason. I want to insist that narrative synthesis is a form of knowledge, indeed, a particularly powerful form of creating, not simply summarizing, knowledge. I hope to get past or under the story enough to probe the implications of different modes of structuring a narrative synthesis. The way different narrative strategies construct that knowledge is important. While inclusion is one of the tests our generation will rightly ask of synthesis, there are other important historiographical issues that are embedded in the question of narrative synthesis.19 The more seriously we consider possible narratives of American history, the more we may be prepared to ask questions that press beyond inclusion. We may even be both bold enough and hopeful enough to worry a little about the language of inclusion, if not the principle. Is there perhaps more than a hint of dominant culture noblesse oblige in the language of inclusion? Might not a more sophisticated notion of the temporal and geographical boundaries of American history, including an awareness of the diasporic stories within American history, complicate and enrich the notion of inclusion?20 Can the historical and historiographical terrain be opened a bit more in a way that enables a deeper, denser, and more complex historiographical exploration of justice and difference at the center of American history? Might democracy be the word, the concept, the commitment that will move us in that direction? As I examine the stack of books before me, I propose to keep these issues in mind and to return to them at the end of this essay. JON BUTLER'S Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (2000) covers the whole mainland British colonial space and history, and it addresses a wide range of themes. In fact, themes, not time or chronology, organize his story. His brief, often one-word, chapter titles reveal a very distinctive type of synthesis, one immediately accessible to the reader, whether professional or lay: Peoples, Economy, Politics, Things Material, Things Spiritual. It is a reasonable progression, and in each case he brings together a good deal of material. Although his theme is transformation, Butler also claims (following recent historiography) a more inclusive geography, making more of the middle colonies than would have been the case a generation ago. In some ways, his manner of organizing the material topically bears a relation to [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 19 I do not propose to go into theories of narrative or even my own notions, but I will here indicate that my understanding has been greatly influenced by the work of Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative, Kathleen McLaughlin and David Pellauer, trans., 3 vols. (Chicago, 1984-88). 20 Such thinking is not restricted to specialists in the profession exploring the theme of diaspora. The novelist Russell Banks has recently argued that the focus for a synthesis of American history ought to be the African diaspora. See "The Star-Spangled Novel," Los Angeles Times, July 2, 2000.

If Hofstadter's book was intended to provide a snapshot that would serve as a starting point, Butler's title ("Becoming America") and his stated intentions announce change as his theme. He means to persuade the reader of a broad pattern of transformation that produced a distinctive and modern society in advance of 1776 and that in turn spawned the first modern revolution. Such an argument demands more complex and careful attention to process and cause than his framing of the book seems to allow. While he has surely gathered together a considerable body of material (his notes run to fifty pages), he has not produced a synthetic narrative of change over time, one that sketches a develop- mental sequence that integrates disparate elements in the interest of a causal interpretation. By bounding each unit of synthesis, Butler is stuck with a structural isolation of topics that undercuts narrative explanation. Given that Butler's theme is transformation, this narrative structure is crippling. For reasons related to structure and style of argument, Butler's claims for American modernity are quite vulnerable. While there are doubtless some specific ways in which the British North American colonies became "modern" before independence, they were not uniformly modern-over space or in all aspects of life. Many historians would readily grant numerous anticipations of modernity by the middle of the eighteenth century, but few would insist, with Butler, that so much modernity had been achieved so soon, implying that only a few pre-modern anomalies remained on the eve of revolution.22 Most give a significant role to the revolution.23 But the most serious problem is not with the phenomena he notices or does not notice, even if there is some real unevenness on this point. Rather, it is Butler's teleology of the modern, combined with his exceedingly loose, elusive, and, as is so often said today, undertheorized definition of modernity. Add to this an unneces- sary but apparently irresistible tendency to claim American uniqueness and "firsts" for nearly everything he identifies as modern in America. He names a number of phenomena that he considers evidences of the modern-polyglot, slaves, cities, market economy, refined crafts and trades, religious pluralism, and "sophisticated politics." Without further historical specification and theoretical precision, one can indulge in reductio ad absurdum. With the exception of religious pluralism, all of these qualities probably described Athens in the age of Aristotle at least as well as the British colonies. In fact, I suspect that Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, relying on their recent book The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (2000), would argue that the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 21 Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (New York, 1971). 22 Jon Butler, Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (Cambridge, Mass., 2000), 1. 23 See, for example, Gordon S. Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (New York, 1992). Long before, Bernard Bailyn suggested certain developments that Butler would consider modern had developed in the eighteenth century, but he emphasized the unevenness and even paradoxical character of this proto-modernity.

In the end, however, it is diversity, which he tends to equate with multiculturalism, that for Butler makes Americans modern. But if we look around, we cannot but wonder about his claims for a uniquely polyglot society. This assertion may be quite vulnerable from any sight line approaching a global perspective. Can he fairly claim that New York City harbored a level of diversity "never before gathered together"?25 Might not this be as plausibly said of Constantinople during the period covered by Butler's book? And did not the Ottoman Empire-of which Constantinople was the capital-far exceed the religious and ethnic diversity of the British colonies? My point here is partly one of fact, of care in making comparative statements without comparison. More important, however, are the criteria of the modern. Few, if any, major political bodies in the past half millennium more successfully accommodated diversity than the Ottomans, yet that achievement has never brought them recognition for a precocious modernity. One needs greater defini- tional and descriptive specificity to make the argument he claims. Because of the breadth and generality of synthetic narratives, it is especially important to be clear about key concepts. Similarly, he tends to claim the realization of "Americanness"-here equated with some vague notion of modernity-for events that, however interesting in themselves, hardly sustain his assertion that they designated "the American future."26 For example, writing of the French Huguenots, a group he knows well, he notes their assimilation, and he calls this "American."27 Well, of course it is, but so are the endogenous marriages that continue for various groups well into the twentieth century-sometimes because of racial difference and even legislation (as in the case of African Americans) or out of choice, as in the case of Scandinavians in the upper Midwest. Or to take a more ominous subject, it seems a bit fatalistic to say that colonial encroachment on Indian land "predicted" nineteenth-century relations with the Indians.28 Oddly, such a claim, while taking the moral high ground, nonetheless erases the postcolonial history of the United States by denying contingency and thus diminishing both the capacity and moral responsibility of all later actors or potential actors. The twin and linked teleologies of "modern" and "American" produce a distorting and de-historicizing synthesis. If there is a problem with the sort of synthesis Butler has written, what precisely is it? He makes historical claims about patterns and meanings of development on the basis of a narrative structure that effectively isolates and de-historicizes his themes. By not constructing a developmental narrative that integrates the various themes now separated in distinct chapters, the process and complexity of develop- ment is obscured.

In the absence of a narrative of change to explain and interpret, he resorts for a theme to repeated assertions of "modernity." The issue is not so much the claim for an eighteenth-century American modernity-although I am myself drawn to much more complex, nuanced, and contradictory discussions of that theme-as it is the incapacity of the particular model of synthesis he deploys to advance that theme or argument. Philip D. Morgan's Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry (1998) is at once similar to Butler's and quite different. Both focus tightly in each chapter on a particular topic or theme; there is little play among the different themes in both cases. While Butler's themes propose a reorganization of material, thus giving an impression of freshness, Morgan's quite important questions are phrased in well-established ways. While Butler's structure works against his theme of transformation, Morgan's similar structure better fits his goals for the book, partly because transformation plays a smaller role in his analysis than one might expect. Slave Counterpoint addresses nearly all the issues raised by a half century of vigorous scholarship on the beginnings of slavery, the practices of racial slavery as a labor and social system, and the nature of African-American culture in early America. It is a book of enviable learning: with a seeming total command of the historiography and an impressive knowledge of a substantial archival base, Morgan proceeds to pose (or re-pose) difficult historiographical issues. Again and again, he offers compelling answers. Want to know what scholarship has disclosed about slavery and African-American culture in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and Lowcountry? Look to Morgan's synthesis of a generation of scholarship. To have done that is to have done a great deal, and he has done it magnificently. Yet one gets the sense of a summary volume, a volume driven by the past, by past questions. Synthesis can either cap a phase of scholarship or initiate another. I think Morgan's book falls into the former category, while Ira Berlin's new book, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (1998), which also relies on a generation of scholarship and addresses many of the same issues, has the potential to become a new starting point. Berlin has captured the shift to an Atlantic perspective that has increasingly characterized scholarship by early modern Europeanists, Africanists, Latin Americanists, and historians of British North America. In this sense, his work, at least the early parts that sketch out and populate the Atlantic littoral, points forward.29 In a dramatic opening section, Berlin, relying more on secondary literatures than does Morgan, locates his story in very broad understandings of time (periodization) and space (the Atlantic world), the dimensions of which are shadowy, almost invisible, in Morgan's account. He locates Africans in an Atlantic history connecting four continents and in a rich and growing historiography reaching out from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and North America.30 One [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 29 Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (Cambridge, Mass., 1998). 30 Berlin's powerful evocation of the Atlantic builds on many predecessors.

But even if he narrows the story to the territory that later became the United States and loses the multiple histories implied by his portrait of the Atlantic world, the beginnings of stories, whether novels or histories, are heavy with intention and implication that can, I hope, be built upon.31 In fact, the four Atlantic continents remain an always changing aspect of American and African histories. Attending to, or at least recognizing, that larger and continuing extended terrain of American history would enrich the story of the making of African Americans and America, a historiography that is at present too much captured by an implicit and too simple assimilation or "Americanization" model. Nonetheless, Berlin has provided a powerful image of the creation of the Atlantic world and of the origin of modern slavery within it. Morgan has a quite different strategy. His domain is not the Atlantic but the South, or two regions of the South, which he is anxious to reveal as differentiated. Thus his is a comparative history, comparing two regions within the South. Suggesting a certain scientific aspiration, he refers to his delimited space as a kind of laboratory, a site for an "indirect experiment."32 This approach offers him much. He is able to focus tightly on his questions and generally achieves sharply phrased answers. Yet, like any good scientific laboratory, his field of inquiry is almost hermetically sealed. A two-hundred-page part of the book titled "The Black World" begins with a fifteen-page section on "Africans." Yet it is in only one paragraph at the beginning and a few other scattered references that one reads anything about Africa. His story rarely strays east (or south or north or west) of the Maryland/ Virginia and South Carolina boundaries. His comparative method has impressive rigor. Yet one senses that not only does his approach trap him within a particular place, he is also caught within a very confining net woven from the existing historiography. As Walter Johnson pointed out in a review of the book in this journal, his questions are smaller than the stories he has unearthed.33 Much like another important book on African-American history, Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom (1976), this book, for all its synthetic aspirations, cannot capture some of its best material within the tightly bounded historiographical questions and issues that frame it.34 As in the case of Berlin's book, Morgan's is quite explicit about time and space. There is a well-thought-out chronology of change, and one of his major arguments is that the South, and thus the black as well as white experience, was not uniform over space. He shows real and important distinctions between the experience of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex (New York, 1990; 2d edn., 1998); and John K.

Yet by treating both the temporal and spatial aspects of the story as sites (and very limited ones) rather than as processes of historical making, he weakens the capacity of his local analyses to explain change over time and, to a lesser extent, space. His major explanatory claims appear in the introduction. They are not only brief but also separate from the rich stories he tells and the analyses he makes of historiographical questions.35 The expansiveness of Many Thousands Gone, by contrast, evokes a strong sense of change, of process. It achieves a narrative synthesis of the movement of Africans onto the Atlantic and into the Western hemisphere. The difference between this approach and the tightly controlled analysis crafted by Morgan is striking. Like Morgan's, Michael Schudson's book, The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life (1998), is organized around fairly established questions- especially one big question. Has American civic life deteriorated over the course of the past three centuries? Naturally, the question is of a different order than those driving Morgan's analysis. It has not been generated by disciplinary scholarship. It arose out of American public life. Schudson thus draws on history and other disciplines to address directly a public question, one endlessly repeated today and, as he shows, in the past. Schudson himself, we should note, is not a historian. He was trained as a sociologist, and he teaches in a Department of Communication. While he reveals an impressive command of the relevant historiography, historians are not his primary reference group or audience.36 Although I am sure specialists will find some of his formulations to be of considerable historiographical significance and likely to encourage new lines of research, his intention, again, is different: his audience is a general one, and he seeks to bring historical knowledge to bear on a civic issue. What he is doing points toward the most important work that one kind of successful narrative synthesis can do, for the profession and for the public. By openly declaring his address to a public issue and for a public audience, Schudson participates in a very important tradition of historical writing. Some of the very best professional historians of the United States in this century have done precisely that: Frederick Jackson Turner, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles Beard, and Richard Hofstadter all focused on issues, worries, or preoccupations of fairly general interest to write synthetic works that importantly rephrased fundamental themes in American history. This mutual enrichment of public and professional discourse is perhaps the ideal cultural work of narrative synthesis. Let us hope that historians can do this more often and more effectively. Yet as I make this point, I realize that all of the historians just named, including Schudson himself, were either trained as social scientists or did not recognize a significant boundary between history and the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 35Morgan, Slave Counterpoint, xv-xxiv. I should note that my concerns about boundary setting in Morgan's book do not apply nearly so much to Philip D. Morgan, "The Black Experience in the British Empire, 1680-1810," in The Oxford History of the British Empire, Vol. 2: The Eighteenth Century, P. J. Marshall, ed. (Oxford, 1998), 465-86. 36 This command is at once impressive and sometimes puzzling. In discussing the Founding and the Constitution, he does not mention Gordon Wood's The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1969). Nor, in writing about the first decades of the nineteenth century, does he mention either of two key books by Robert H. Wiebe, The Opening of American Society: From the Adoption of the Constitution to the Eve of Disunion (New York, 1984); and Self-Rule: A Cultural History of American Democracy (Chicago, 1995).

Is this a mere coincidence, or is it an issue to be addressed by the profession? While I would not place Schudson's book in the same class as the scholarship produced by the short list of great historians, he has written a fine book. It is a book about change over time, and he establishes three eras of citizenship and participa- tion, each clearly defined. He does not devote much attention to how each configuration changes into the next, but he effectively characterizes their differ- ences, even in some very brief summaries, as in the following paragraph from early in the book: Another way to characterize the past three hundred years of political change is to say that the type of authority by which society is governed shifted from personal authority (gentlemen) to interpersonal authority (parties, coalitions, and majorities), to impersonal authority (science, expertise, legal rights, and information) ... The geographical center of politics has shifted from the countryside to the cities to the suburbs and perhaps, today, to "technoburbs," "postsuburbs," or "edge cities," or whatever we name our newer habitations. Correspondingly, the kind of knowledge a good citizen requires has changed: in an age of gentlemen, the citizen's relatively rare entrances into public discussion or controversy could be guided by his knowledge of social position; in the era of rule by majorities, the citizen's voting could be led by the enthusiasm and rhetoric of parties and their most active partisans; in the era of expertise and bureaucracies, the citizens had increasingly to learn to trust their own canvass of newspapers, interest groups, parties, and other sources of knowledge, only occasionally supported by the immediacy of human contact; and in the emerging age of rights, citizens learn to catalog what entitlements they may have and what forms of victimization they may knowingly or unknowingly have experienced.37 This paragraph reveals the argument and the narrative strategy that Schudson uses to undercut the widespread notion of civic decline: rather than a story of decline, it is one of restructuring, one that recalibrates citizenship and civic practice in relation to changing values and social experiences. What some, including me, see as the erosion of our public life and the thinning of American political culture, he presents as a complex rearticulation of expectations and institutions. Whether one fully agrees with Schudson or not, the book and the point of view it ingeniously argues constitutes an important contribution of contemporary civic life. And a narrative strategy of restructuring (as opposed to the usual rise or fall scenarios) deserves a place in the historian's menu of narrative types. "Presentist" purposes may, however, carry the danger of anachronistic readings. Schudson is vulnerable on this score, especially in his consideration of the colonial period. He too easily asks how democratic any phase of political life was. A commitment to explore the fate of democracy in our past-something I endorse- surely includes recognizing when democracy is not an available concept. He might better have asked how the legitimation and exercise of power worked. Indeed, such a deeper historicism would complement his anti-anti-Whig approach. Similarly, while a then-and-now binary invites sometimes interesting questions and offers some illumination of past and present, it also invites problems. Again, one sees this risk in Schudson's work. False categories of judgment are explicitly or implicitly brought to bear.

Voters then were expected to have "local knowledge-not of laws or principles, but of men."38 The binary obscures the role of principles in the past and knowledge of men in the present. Most important of all, it diverts our attention from the principles that it was thought would aid voters in judging character.39 Sometimes, by focusing so much on the party system that we worry about today, he overlooks those important issues that eluded the parties or that parties avoided. Substantive issues-the reason citizenship and civic life are important-are marginalized in his account of the different concepts and patterns of public life. The result, whether intended or not, is a form of consensus history.40 "Progress or decline is not the real question," Schudson concludes.41 He converts that question into one of restructuring that points to his core argument: there must be a fit between forms of citizenship and forms of everyday life, between values and institutions, between aspirations and commitments. It is that historically informed understanding that allows him in his conclusion to speculate in quite promising ways about an evolving pattern of citizenship that may yet serve our collective hopes and needs. Still, his conclusion leaves me uneasy. Like the journalistic coverage of politics today, the substance of political conflict is subordinated to discussion of the "health" of the system, of the institutions and practices. By contrast, the tensions, conflicts, and substantive issues that made politics so important in the development of the United States and in the lives of individuals are at the center of Eric Foner's The Story of American Freedom (1998). Foner's book has an uncanny resemblance to one that at first glance might seem utterly unrelated: Richard Hofstadter's The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It.42 Of course, Foner inverts the point Hofstadter sought to make. If Hofstadter famously played down conflict and (less remarked upon) paid little attention to the social making of political ideologies, Foner emphasizes conflict and the changing historical construction and reconstruction of the idea and ideology of freedom. Foner's work is much more explicitly sensitive to social history, even if it parallels Hofstadter's in its interest in ideology and the limits and possibilities of American political culture. While Hofstadter was alternately comic and ironic, bitterly so at times, in The American Political Tradition, Foner's Story of American Freedom is strikingly fair and straightforward. Yet the underlying hope is similar. As James Oakes has perceptively noted, Foner's narrative is undergirded by an unstated but firm liberal ideal of freedom- one that at once shares in an Enlightenment universalism and [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 38 Schudson, Good Citizen, 81. 39 See Joyce Appleby, Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans (Cambridge, Mass., 2000). 40 See, for example, his summary judgment of the party system at Schudson, Good Citizen, 132.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 142 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] accommodates current concerns for inclusion and regard for difference.43 I would even argue that Hofstadter's own liberal position was closer to Foner's than one might at first suspect. Both appraised American political culture and its prospects from the position of a richer, more textured liberalism than we usually recognize in current debates.44 In thinking about the core issue in Foner's narrative, therefore, it seems fair to consider it to be the quest for a democratic liberalism, insisting on the relevance and indispensability of the modifier inserted before liberalism. One might thus characterize Foner's as a democratic synthesis, which, as I suggested above, offers a stronger and more egalitarian standard of judgment than commonplace invoca- tions of inclusion. It offers as well the implication of voice and empowerment. To Foner, as he indicates in his introduction, "abstract definitions" of freedom are not the focus. His concern is "with the debates and struggles through which freedom acquires concrete meanings, and how understandings of freedom are shaped by, and in turn help to shape, social movements and political and economic events."45 The result is a narrative that is at once focused yet always open to an examination of larger issues, structures, and events that intersect with and often drive his story. It is a dynamic story, filled with actors, with agents making freedom and using freedom. He selects key events or controversies of different eras, events that are widely contested (slavery, labor and property, the role of the state, social movements). Of course, coverage is selective; the gain is the richness deriving from a series of concentrated focal points. In each case, he examines the conflict, the parties contending, and the stakes. He does not hesitate to declare justices and injustices, to name winners and losers, and he does so from a consistently democratic perspective. Foner thus achieves inclusion without the dilution conse- quent with the faux openness characteristic of talk radio and without the postmod- ern hesitations that undermine moral judgment.46 The American West: A New Interpretive History (2000) by Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher spans the whole of American history, from "the European invasion" until the present.47 The book is written in the spirit of Frederick Jackson Turner. Instead of lamenting the ambiguity of Turner's conception of the frontier, which after Turner got reduced by rigorous historians to a place, the West, Hine and Faragher embrace its fullness.

Interestingly, this work also comes from a Columbia scholar, however much it is openly acknowledged to have derived largely from his experience at the New School for Social Research.

That openness allows them to tell the history of the United States as a story of successive frontiers, including a fascinating rethinking of American regionalism as urban-centered at the end of the twentieth century.48 In fact, the chapter on the postwar era is a tour de force-imaginative, original, and quite compelling. In Turnerian fashion, they argue that "westering defined America's unique heritage."49 To a very impressive degree, they give substance to this claim, but recent historiography makes that claim, even for western history, problematic. As Hine and Faragher show, in the nineteenth century as well as today, the West (and the United States) was formed by migrations from west to east and south to north, and even in a limited way north to south, as well as east to west. The notion of westering is so strong in American and European history and culture, it is difficult to construct an alternative narrative structure, though no less important for the difficulty.50 This worry does not, however, undercut another summary point they make: the "frontier is our common past."51 The book is grounded in social history. Of all the books under consideration here, The American West is probably the most sensitive to the categories of experience and groups previously excluded from mainstream narratives of Ameri- can history. Their work goes well beyond mere representation of such groups and categories; previously invisible groups, whether Native Americans, migrating women, African-American settlers, working people, or the people of the border- lands, are actors who contributed to the shaping of history. But there are limits to this achievement. While there are multiple positions and voices represented in their narrative, only rarely does their narrative bring the reader inside group life. There is not much inquiry into the interior experience and subjective meanings shared by the various groups identified and recognized.52 While the story could have been situated in a wider context, one that revealed the global reach of the empires or, later, the importance of global markets, in its particular geographical focus the book consistently avoids privileging the English line of settlement. Other settler efforts are considered and sometimes compared. As is often the case with synthetic histories, however, there is a tendency to do the work of inclusion at a particular moment, and then lose the group at issue.

At times, the transnational themes they develop are extremely illuminating. They refer to what would later be characterized by theorists of the global cities as a "dual economy" in describing the role of foreign migrants, especially Chinese, in the nineteenth-century California agricultural economy.53 Likewise the interplay of national and international in their discussion of the Zimmerman telegram inviting Mexico to ally with Germany in World War I and in their discussion of San Francisco's "commercial hinterland."54 But, as in the case of Butler's book, there is a bit of parochialism in making claims of distinction. Perhaps such assertions can be demonstrated, but more rigorous definitions and empirical research than we have here are required to establish, for example, that the United States is today the world's most multicultural society.55 How would it compare with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, whose citizens speak more than 100 languages and live on almost numberless islands? The social-history approach, whatever its success in representing difference, has in this instance under-represented national political institutions and policies. The development of the West, as Richard White and other historians of the West have pointed out, was profoundly indebted to what western Republicans now call "big government," for water, transportation, Indian removal, and, more recently, direct investment, as in defense contracts and installations and aerospace industries.56 The political economy and the role of markets, as has already been suggested, do not get the attention they deserve. We often overlook how much industry was in the West, and how much western industries-from milling and meatpacking to mining-were integral to the industrial system of the United States. And we forget how much the astonishing productivity of western agriculture enabled the formation of a large urban industrial labor supply. More of these dimensions of western history might have been included if only in the interest in enabling the story better to tell the national experience. If Hine and Faragher encompass both the full geographical and temporal dimensions of western history, Linda Gordon's microhistory builds out from a very delimited western space, the Sonoran highlands of Arizona, to develop a highly innovative narrative synthesis that locates itself at the various and causally interrelated scales of town, region, nation, and the transnational. Her work reminds us that there is a difference between a mere local study and a microhistory. The local histories of villages, towns, and cities, so common in the 1970s, tended to use global concepts but within artificially bounded fields of inquiry. One of the most famous of them all, Kenneth Lockridge's study of Dedham, Massachusetts, offered an isolated inwardness as a principal finding, although it was a finding that derived [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 53Hine and Faragher, American West, 358-60. 54 Hine and Faragher, American West, 395-97, 414.

Mostly, her account is the story of the arrival and fate of Catholic orphans from New York who were to be placed in Catholic homes. The homes were Mexican as well as Catholic, and that was the problem and the focus of conflict. The conflict played out along class, ethnic, religious, and gender lines, and it eventually reached the Supreme Court. It is a compelling and very human narrative, but one that also addresses a whole range of analytical and interpretive issues of broader interest to historians. Bringing the issues of gender, class, and race into relation with each other allows for an appraisal of their relative importance in this particular historical explanation. I think that her story reveals class to be more important than her conclusion argues, but the real point to be made is that only a narrative synthesis that brings diverse threads together will enable the historian and the reader to make this kind of judgment. These complex ends are achieved in part by her adoption of an imaginative literary strategy. Gordon's book is constructed of two types of chapters. One is quite often a broad frame for local events. In these chapters, her perspective as narrator is exterior to the action. The issues addressed are frequently structural and, as often as not, extend beyond the community. Here, one gets an analytical explanation of the relation of local experience to larger national and international cultural, political, and economic developments. Between these chapters, she has crafted others that get inside the culture of the community, providing wonderfully rich, thick descriptions of daily life and the development of the conflict. With oral histories as well as fragmentary documentary evidence, she brings the reader very close to the experience and voices of the community. The play between these accounts and the more conventional chapters produces an unusual but powerful synthesis. Whether a microhistory qualifies as a synthesis, even by my generous definition, may be debated. But the singular relevance of this book for the discussion of synthesis concerns not scale but its literary ambition, the literary experiment that gives structure to the book. Those who would write other syntheses-at various scales-will, I hope, be encouraged, even inspired, to experiment with novel narrative strategies in the interest of more powerful representations of the past. Quintard Taylor presents a third version of western history, In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West, 1528-1990 (1998). He offers a broad synthetic account that characterizes the experiences of African Americans over a very long period of time.

Drawing on a substantial body of scholarship, most of it published in the past quarter century, he aims to "reconstruct the history of African American women and men" in the West over five centuries, although mostly his focus is the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Taylor's central themes are the quest for community by blacks and the relative degrees of freedom and opportunity they find in different times and places. The conjuncture of the map of African-American presence and the conventional history of the West that his story brings out compels rethinking of both African-American and western history. He makes the point, for example, that the issue of Texas independence in 1836 was not simply, as myth, even the more recent multicultural version, would have it: Anglos and Tejanos in Texas confronting a despotic government in Mexico. It was also an Anglo effort to preserve slavery.60 More broadly, the map literally reveals that African Americans in the West were overwhelmingly city and town dwellers, and it is that fact that unifies their experience. The kind of synthetic narrative that he has constructed provides an invaluable service at a particular moment, crystallizing a generation of scholarship, making generalization possible. His work not only informs the public of the dimensions of previously unrecognized histories, it also provides a base for the next generation of scholarship. In a similar way, another recent synthesis, one that focuses on a more narrowly defined but also more developed area of scholarship, reveals the harvest of recent scholarship on work and workers. American Work: Four Centuries of Black and Vhite Labor (1998) by Jacqueline Jones at once brings this rich scholarship to a wider audience and proffers a fresh way of framing the field.61 If The American West, In Search of the Racial Frontier, and American Work cover very long chronological spans, books by David M. Kennedy and Fred Anderson address short periods. Their focus is also quite different, since both concentrate on political and military history. Kennedy's Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945 (1999) addresses what might well be called "high politics," while Anderson's The Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 (2000) brings social history and high politics into fruitful play, finding in that interaction the terms of his central argument about the nature of power in the British Empire. At the outset, both books locate their stories in a broad international context. Kennedy's book begins at the close of World War I, and the first character introduced is Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler, who was in a military hospital recovering from a poison gas attack when he heard the news of Germany's surrender.

The geography of Washington, D.C., even that of the White House, and the biographies of three men-Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Hitler-are more important to Kennedy's story than the world beyond the borders of the United States or, for that matter, than the American people of his subtitle. One of Kennedy's aims is evidently to urge upon Americans a greater attention to and sense of responsibility in the larger world, yet with the exception of the excellent discussion of the differing explanations of the economic crisis offered by Herbert Hoover and Roosevelt, there is surprisingly little incorporation of inter- national elements into the dynamic of the story. For all the importance of the larger world, for Kennedy, as for many Americans, whether professional historians or not, the international is a sort of "other," something "over there," if I may reverse the title of one of Kennedy's earlier books.62 Kennedy- also pays little attention to social history, not even to social histories that have sought to better explain the politics of the interwar years.63 Nor does the book address intellectual history, the history of science and technology (except briefly in connection with war production), the states, education, urban history, and much more. In fact, the book would have been more accurately described by the title of William E. Leuchtenburg's classic, F.D.R. and the New Deal, 1932-1940, which is here superseded and extended into the war years.64 So titled, adding the war to the New Deal, one could have no objection to this extraordinarily well-written, deeply researched, and compellingly argued book. But is it a history of "the American people"? Freedom from Fear is a masterful narrative on the terms it has assumed for itself. Yet having said that, historiographical questions remain. Kennedy apparently assumes that three voices are the important ones; not many other voices are heard, even though each of a small clutch of additional figures is presented very effectively as a full human being: Lorena Hickok, Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Raymond Moley, Herbert Hoover, John L. Lewis, and A. Philip Randolph, among a few others. History for Kennedy, unlike for the other authors of these syntheses, is made by select leaders, not by ordinary people. What is remarkable, therefore, is the illusion of synthesis that is achieved. The book was published in a series that promises narrative syntheses of the defining periods of American national history. Most so far published accept traditional definitions of periods, and they are framed as political history, but none is so severely restricted as this one, which won the Pulitzer Prize in part because it was recognized as a work of grand synthesis. Dramatic changes in the historiography of the American field make it seem anachronistic.

Fred Anderson's Crucible of War again engages us with the question of elites and ordinary people, and it provides -a promising approach. While Kennedy seems quite confident of the importance of a few leaders, Anderson seems to be ambivalent, and that ambivalence enriches his history. Although I think the principal contribution of Crucible of War to our understanding of the British Empire is grounded in the social history of the political and military experience of ordinary Americans, the dramatic focus, as with Francis Parkman's great nineteenth-century narrative, is on two great leaders of the French and Indian War, the marquis de Montcalm and James Wolfe.65 Yet, as Alan Taylor has insightfully insisted, Anderson has rewritten the story of their confrontation in a way that diminishes these actors, especially Wolfe.66 To be sure, Anderson's book goes beyond Parkman in its respect for Native Americans, their agency, and their role in the empire (and the role of the empire and war for them). He also modifies Parkman on a point that is central to the book's contribution to imperial history: unlike Parkman, Anderson not only notices but makes much of the division between English colonials and English metropolitans. These differences in expectation and experience make the war in his view a "theatre of intercultural interaction."67 Like Butler, Anderson seeks to diminish the role of 1776 in understanding the development of what became the United States. Historians, he argues, will better understand the creation of the United States by closely examining the Seven Years' War and, more generally, by challenging the usual tendency to "take as our point of reference the thirteen rebelling colonies, not the empire as a whole."68 Yet, even as he argues the importance of getting behind the Revolution of 1776 so that one can discover the eighteenth century as it was experienced, the revolution remains a touchstone for him. More than anything else, he wants the reader to recognize that the shots fired in the Seven Years' War were the ones with implications around the world. But he keeps de-historicizing his story to use it to diminish the shot of lesser implication (in his view) heard 'round the world in 1775. When one begins the book, there is a sense of excitement. Here is a history of the United States ready to take the globe as its context. Before the narrative even begins, the reader is presented with a portfolio of maps. Only two of eight describe the British colonies; no more than four of them consider North America at all. The portfolio begins with a world map, revealing the global distribution of the battles that marked the Seven Years' War. There are also maps of the Indian subcontinent, Central Europe, and the Caribbean. The introduction promises a book that will make the world, or at least the full extent of the British Empire, its context and subject. We are told that "if viewed from Montreal or Vincennes, St. Augustine, Havana, Paris or Madrid-or, for that matter Calcutta or Berlin-the Seven Years' War was far more significant than the War of American Independence."69 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 65 Francis Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe, 6th edn., 2 vols.

We get very little of Asia (although Manila makes a brief but important comparative appearance), the Caribbean, Africa, and continental Europe. Of course, other European powers are part of the narrative, but they only have walk-on roles. We learn little of them at home or about the ways leaders or ordinary citizens interpret events, while we are, by contrast, led through elaborate accounts of high British politics. The preface, presumably written last, sketches an extraordinary agenda for what would be a stunning book. Unfortunately, Anderson did not write the book he there described. Still, judged in terms of what it did rather than what it proposed to do, it is an outstanding work of craft. It will no doubt be our generation's account of the Seven Years' War. As military history, it is superb, and it contributes importantly-but not so grandly as some of the opening rhetoric promises-to the non-controversial but still unclear issue of the causal relations that connect the Seven Years' War to the coming of the revolution. Anderson in fact offers a rich Anglo-centric narrative that explores and explains the different meaning of the war both as strategic event and as experience for the British of the metropole and in the colonies. It is written with verve and confidence-and a seemingly complete command of the materials, primary and secondary. One of its themes is the misperception of events by political elites; with the exception of William Pitt, surely Anderson's hero in this story, they fail to understand the different meaning of the war and empire for ordinary soldiers and colonial subjects. He thus makes cultural issues the heart of the book. Military and political elites play a dramatic role in the narrative, but causation for Anderson- and here he points to important newer developments in military and diplomatic history-is to be found in the culture of everyday life.70 In making this point, he not only offers an important interpretation of the war (building in part on his previous book on Massachusetts soldiers), he also reveals the empire to be less solid, more a matter of continuous negotiation, than historians often consider such entities, whether empires or nations or states.71 MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN ANDERSON, Ira Berlin, referring to the earliest history of Afro-European North America, and Daniel T. Rodgers, addressing the early twentieth century, incorporate the Atlantic, or at least the North Atlantic, into their narratives of American history. Berlin and Rodgers write very different kinds of history and focus on different periods. Berlin's is a social history, while Rodgers has written an intellectual history, or, perhaps, a history of political culture. Yet both Berlin and Rodgers recognize the complex webs that route movements-of people, of ideas, of money, of things-in the Atlantic world. The transnational terrains that Berlin and Rodgers evoke establish larger and truer frames for national histories than do notions of bounded and self-contained regions or nations. The first section of Berlin's Many Thousands Gone, a portrait of the Atlantic littoral, describes a world framed by cities and the sea, little divided by national [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 70 Anderson, Crucible of War, 453-54. 71 See Fred Anderson, A Peoples' Army: Massachusetts Soldiers and Society in the Seven Years' War (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1984).

Berlin's opening tableau describes the emergence of the Atlantic world as an ever- expanding historical terrain, where the African presence is pervasive on the sea and in the cities, including Lisbon, where they made up 10 percent of the population in the sixteenth century. He evokes a world defined by a network of cosmopolitan cities populated by creolized peoples. African people were not only omnipresent, they were often crucial cultural and economic brokers, helping to knit this new world together. Berlin lets go of this powerful frame and image in his later chapters, where he narrows the focus to regional difference within the bounds of British North America. Still, the book's protean beginning remains in the reader's mind, inviting others to realize its narrative logic and moral meaning.72 In Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (1998), Daniel T. Rodgers also achieves a richer historicism by expanding the space of analysis. One small indication is in the subtitle. He refers to "social politics," not the more usual "welfare state." His approach, examining relations in space as well as over time as fields of contingency, makes the welfare state a problematic common term. When he uses the more general and more mobile term "social politics," he effectively historicizes the concept, lineage, and practice of the welfare state. The development of a social politics has other possible paths and outcomes besides evolution into the national welfare state.73 The national welfare state thus becomes a historically and place-specific invention rather than a universal or, worse, the teleological endpoint of American liberal narratives-an endpoint surely upended by the politics of the last quarter of the twentieth century. Following the pioneering work of James T. Kloppenberg, who also assumed a Euro-American context for progressivism and social democracy, Rodgers ap- proaches this age of reform as at once a transnational and national issue.74 A variety of reforms-from urban planning to social insurance to regulation of capitalism- are examined as products both of general, transnational ideas and of particular, national political cultures. The complex narratives thus developed by Rodgers and Kloppenberg-ones that recognize, especially in the case of Rodgers, the historicity of the balance between national and transnational-are a major advance in the narrative synthesis of a national history. Both Rodgers and Kloppenberg impress on the reader that ideas could cross the Atlantic in either direction. This is salutary; American intellectual history is too often thought by Europeans and Americans as well to be either insignificant or derivative, not quite up to equal participation in an international world of ideas. This common point is handled differently in each book. While Kloppenberg notes [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 72 One hopes this extension of the historiographical terrain will continue and that connections as well as comparisons will be made between the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic and between the Atlantic slave trade and the slave trade that turned to the east, to the Muslim empires of the Mediterranean and today's Middle East. Big as it is, the Atlantic does not capture the logic and dimensions of slavery in this era. 73 See, for example, the argument (somewhat dependent on Rodgers's work) in Thomas Bender, "Cities, Intellectuals, and Citizenship in the United States: The 1890s and 1990s," Citizenship Studies 3 (1999): 203-20. 74 Daniel T. Rodgers, Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (Cambridge, Mass., 1998); James T. Kloppenberg, Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought, 1870-1920 (New York, 1986).

Rodgers, by contrast, focuses on the specific transit of ideas and emphasizes the way intellectuals and reformers on either side of the Atlantic drew selectively on these ideas, depending on personal taste and local circumstance. The result is a fundamental and valuable reorientation of the way we might understand intellectual history. The conceptual opening they have created invites a yet more radical under- standing of the territory and movement of ideas. Let me go back to the title of Rodgers's book. I think that "Atlantic Crossings" projects too narrow an under- standing of the implications of the book. It emphasizes the movement of people and ideas back and forth across the Atlantic. To that extent, it recalls a much older Anglo-American historiography of "trans-Atlantic influences."75 Rodgers goes well beyond this historiography in showing that, in important respects, Europe was partly Americanized and the United States was partly Europeanized by the phenomena he describes. But his really important accomplishment is to get away from the "influence" model, to displace the linear A to B notion of intellectual history. But he could have gone farther yet. There is more to the circulation of ideas than this framing recognizes. It is more than an Atlantic crossing, more than a link between Western Europe and the United States. The whole Atlantic, South Atlantic as well as North Atlantic, and, indeed, increasingly, parts of the Pacific world better describe the extent of the intellectual network his book evokes. In regard to urban development and reform, an important theme in Rodgers's book, it is clear that there is a global conversation at work. Rather than the linearity of steamship crossings (the dustjacket illustration) between the port cities of Western Europe and New York, I imagine a Great Bazaar of urban ideas, technology, and aesthetics hovering over the Atlantic, with many traders and buyers. This exchange is not, of course, symmetrical, and that itself is an issue, but participation was nearly global in 1900. Progressive ideas, especially those dealing with urban reform and technologies, traveled through many circuits and with different voltage, but nearly the whole world was connected, not only Western Europe and the United States. Simply look at the cities of Eastern Europe, Latin America, parts of Africa, Central and East Asia. Surely, they were part of an international conception of urbanism-and of urban commercial culture. The remnants of the era make it clear that New York and Chicago, no less than Lyons, Cairo, Buenos Aires, or Shanghai, were local instances of a global process of city-making. THESE LAST COMMENTS SUGGEST what I take to be the next challenge of narrative synthesis. But before I conclude, let me briefly review what has been accomplished by the cohort of synthetic histories considered here. These books reveal, even verify, the capacity of narrative synthesis to achieve inclusion and to respect issues of identity. Moreover, it seems possible in synthetic narratives to combine structure [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 75 See Frank Thistlethwaite, The Anglo-American Connection in the Early Nineteenth Century (Philadelphia, 1959).

The volumes here examined reveal many narrative strategies and quite different relations to a wider reading public. There is no single model, and no one volume (yet) does all the things we might fairly expect in a realized synthesis. In addition, these books, both in what they do and do not do, suggest to me the value of embracing a narrative core that is a more explicit and deeper exploration of democracy and difference, freedom and empowerment, contest and justice. Such a focus promises a sharper analytical history, one more historical and less susceptible to teleology, whether of modernity or anything else. It seems plausible to propose that a wider canvas, a supranational context, may in fact enhance the examination of these issues. The work of Hine and Faragher, Berlin, Gordon, and Rodgers in particular enables one to imagine an even more radical synthesis of national history, one that operates on multiple geographical scales, from narratives smaller than the nation to supra-national ones-thus identifying the nation as a product of history as well as an object of historical inquiry. Such a framing of national history will increase awareness of the complexity of the multiple axes of historical interaction, causation, and identity formation. While I mean these concluding comments to suggest an ambitious new agenda for the discipline, we must not overlook an already existing and compelling example. Decades ago, David Brion Davis embarked on a multivolume history that considered all these issues. He brought them together in his majestic synthesis that explores slavery and freedom in the Atlantic world, a history of nearly global reach that is also-and I emphasize this fact-a history of the United States.76 My point, then, is that such histories can be written, have been written, and I trust that more will yet be written. The present moment seems especially propitious for such histories. The relation of the nation to both subnational and transnational solidarities is very much in question. It is a public concern as well as an object of interdisciplinary scholarly inquiry. Historians surely have an open invitation to rethink the boundaries of national histories.77 Colonial historians have been moving in this direction for some time, redefining their field as the Atlantic world long before the globalization talk. Likewise, Rodgers and Ian Tyrrell, both of whom work on the modern period, moved in this direction fairly early and for a different reason: their concern about the claims of American exceptionalism.78 With these various concerns at work, we may fairly expect a movement of American historians and other historians as well toward a wider sense of their fields. National histories will not be so firmly bounded, and the assumption of their national autarky will be softened by the recognition that national histories are [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 76 David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (Ithaca, N.Y., 1966); The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823 (Ithaca, 1975), with the final installment yet to come. 77 See Bender, Rethinking American History in a Global Age; and Thomas Bender, The La Pietra Report (Bloomington, Ind., 2000), also available on the World Wide Web at www.oah.org/activities/ lapietra/index.html. 78 Ian Tyrrell, "American Exceptionalism in an Age of International History," AHR 96 (October 1991): 1031-55; Daniel T.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela.

This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M. Larson, "'Capacities and Modes of Thinking': Intellectual Engagements and Subaltern Hegemony in the Early History of Malagasy Christianity," AHR 102 (October 1997): 969-1002; Richard Elphick and Rodney Davenport, eds., Christianity in South Africa: A Political, Social, and Cultural History (Berkeley, Calif., 1997); and many other works discussed in David Chidester, Judy Tobler, and Darrel Wratten, Christianity in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography (Westport, Conn., 1997). The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86. Those influenced by the Comaroffs in this respect include David Chidester, Savage Systems: Colonialism and Comparative Religion in Southern Africa (Charlottesville, Va., 1996); Leon de Kock, Civilising Barbarians: Missionary Narrative and African Textual Response in Nineteenth-Century South Africa (Johannesburg, 1996); Doug Stuart, "'Of Savages and Heroes': Discourses of Race, Nation and Gender in the Evangelical Missions to Southern Africa in the Early Nineteenth Century" (PhD dissertation, Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London, 1994).

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 443 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne does not fail to capture some aspects of social and political reality. This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject. Elizabeth Elbourne, Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (Montreal, 2002). There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76. On Tswana views of the firearms frontier, see Robert Moffat to Richard Miles, Lattakoo [Kuruman], December 5, 1827, in Isaac Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman: Being the Journals and Letters of Robert and Mary Moffat, 1820-1828 (London, 1951), 274. Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another. On Cape influence, see also Johannes du Bruyn, "James Read en die Thlaping, 1816-1820," Historia 35 (1990). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 445 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elboume eventually came to be known), some of whom acted as patrons of the early LMS mission to the Tswana. The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people."

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman.

Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843. The LMS Directors overturned the dismissal and censured Philip. 37 An interesting point of contrast is provided by Janet Hodgson, "A Battle for Sacred Power: Christian Beginnings among the Xhosa," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410.

Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 455 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elboume comment, at least as it pertains to the Comaroffs' own work. The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work. Taylor is of course a Christian Hegelian, whose view of the emergence of the modern self is certainly influenced by Hegelian dialectics, in however inexplicit a fashion.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Abstract: Excavating Victoriansbrings out very clearly the discomfort the newly discovered vast expanse of geological time gave the Victorians and examines some of the writings that helped shape responses to it. Though the book may not be of particular relevance to the historian focusing closely on Victorian geology or archaeology, for the historian of science who examines wider cultural or literary phenomena it is an important guide to the stimulus that the writings of geologists and archaeologists gave other mid-Victorian writers. Nevertheless, the specialist or narrowly focused historian of science will probably find it frustrating rather than helpful, since the overviews of Victorian geology and archaeology are brief and there are distracting errors, such as the attribution of theNinth Bridgewater Treatiseto William Buckland rather than to Charles Babbage (p. 18). The chapters on Tennyson and Dickens are both interesting and illuminating, although a reader accustomed to historical argument and with limited knowledge of the techniques of literary criticism may find them faintly bewildering in places. Nonetheless, it is in this part of the analysis that the work provides valuable guidance to the historian of science.<br>

Is it claimed or granted?—the existence of vulnerability and passivity within autonomy and initiative, and the relationship between moral ideals and historical manifestation, questions that exist more on the margins ofOneself as Another. Those interested in Ricoeur’s religious thought will find little of direct interest here. Those who see a deep connection between his moral philosophy and his philosophy of religion will find some confirmation, but there are other places where the connections are more explicitly manifest.Reflections on the Justis best approached as a companion volume to earlier philosophical works, certainlyThe Justbut perhaps more importantlyOneself as Another. As such, it holds an important place in Ricoeur’s oeuvre.<br>

Abstract: This second, more normative dimension of Mrozik’s project opens up some challenging questions. If it is the case, as she suggests, that a sympathetic reading of the
   Compendium of Trainingcan provide valuable intellectual resources for contemporary ethical reflection, it remains unclear to me how our engagement with this text should proceed, given the significant disparities in cosmological assumptions (e.g., karmic causation and rebirth) and forms of practice that separate Mrozik’s contemporary readers from the text’s original audience. The text, moreover, appears less concerned with advancing particular truth claims than with creating a distinctive kind of religious subjectivity through ascetic and ritualized practice. Can we assess the value of the text’s ethical ideals apart from the forms of discipline and practice with which they were linked in medieval India? IfVirtuous Bodiesleaves such questions open to further exploration and analysis, its nuanced reading of theCompendium of Trainingbrings into sharper focus the centrality of human embodiment in South Asian Buddhist religious discourses and encourages us to reflect deeply on its implications for our own ethical inquiry.<br>

Abstract: It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
            Adaptation—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case thatAdaptation“undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on Film,” inBooks in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship, ed. Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up tosomething, and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average movie we find easier to read. In fact,Adaptationhas only solidified Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.<br>

Some portions rise to an almost literary style and provide a rich survey of key ideas in twentieth-century French philosophy, while others engage quite originally with scholarship in moral psychology and theories of self-knowledge that will be more familiar to analytic readers. This work also complements the more detailed ethical theory on Larmore’s other books. Despite its relative inattention to volitional aspects of practical identity, and some questionable moves in the critique of authenticity, then, this work is still highly recommended.<br>

Abstract: The Captivity of Innocencesuccessfully concludes an innovative study of primeval myth in J’s Genesis. Its argument about exilic authorship serves as a springboard for a free and erudite exploration of biblical concerns with name, exile, and the paradoxes of divine-human relations. Very few biblical scholars today can compass this range of biblical, literary, and philosophical literature with such finesse. At a time when biblical studies incorporate a wider range of methods than ever, LaCocque, like Roland Barthes (whom he cites), powerfully combines traditional and more contemporary intellectual paradigms. Advanced students and scholars will find inThe Captivity of Innocencea far-reaching and engaging reading of Genesis 11 by a virtuoso of biblical studies.<br>

Abstract: In sum: while it has it flaws, this book is one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date surveys of the field of theories of religion around. It is worth the cover price for that alone, which makes it definitely recommendable. Those who want to learn about the current state of theory, especially if they tend in the realist direction, will find this book very useful. Constructivists acquainted with theory will likely find it less so.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: Critchley uses the term in a discussion of Levinas and politics. Noting that government tends to become tyrannical when left to itself, Critchley commends the way Levinas’s ethical ideas can cultivate forms of “dissensual emancipatory praxis” that “work against the consensual idyll of the state, not in order to do away with the state or consensus, but to bring about its endless betterment” (“Five Problems in Levinas’s View of Politics,” 183).<br>

Abstract: 3. Jessica Tiffin points out that “from the moment he enters the village, and despite his characterization both in heroic motif and active, masculine past tense, the cyclist's historical nature is subsumed into the unreal space of fairy tale and the Gothic” (85). The shift from the descriptions of the countess in the present tense to the narrative past begins with the words, “One hot, ripe summer day in the pubescent years of the present century, a young officer in the British army, blond, blue-eyed, heavy-muscled, visiting friends in Vienna, decided to spend the remainder of his furlough exploring the little-known uplands of Romania” (Carter, 97).<br>

Abstract: This article argues that the end of Tacitus's
         Dialogus de Oratoribusis inconclusive in ways that draw attention to the difficulty of interpretation not onlyofthe dialogue, as by modern scholars, but alsointhe dialogue, as by its leading characters. The inconclusiveness is especially marked by a commonly noted, but little discussed, feature of the end: when the rest of the characters laugh at the point of departure, Tacitus himself does not. Arguing that this difference of affective response on the part of the characters prefigures differences in interpretive response on the part of readers, the article identifies different strains in recent scholarship: pessimistic and optimistic. Both forms of response entail an attribution of a “poetics of conspiracy” (Hinds) to the ultimate speaker of the dialogue, the author Tacitus, and a “hermeneutics of suspicion” (Ricoeur) to its reader. At the same time, the author's double-position, as character and author, between narrated event and narration of the event to the reader, suggests that the other characters in the dialogue may, like the author and reader, also exercise such poetics and hermeneutics on one another and themselves. The article ends with thecomparandumof the first satire of Tacitus's near contemporary, Juvenal, suggesting that, in the case of these works that can look with hindsight on the social and political past of the Early Empire, their modes of transmission and reception may be politically determined (e.g., as conspiratorial, suspicious) but may also demonstrate, within the restrictions of social and political determinations, a high degree of contingency, reflexivity, and autonomy. Such possibilities suggest that the text itself is part of a pragmatic and performative tradition of the kind enacted by its characters, in addition to a tradition of the production of (comparatively static and unfree) “literary” works.<br>

Abstract: Conventional views of text/music relationships in early Italian opera focus on the imitation of affections. But by dealing exclusively with the referential meanings of texts (e.g., emotions, images, and concepts) these views overlook an important aspect of music's interaction with language. In opera, music also imitates language's contextual and communicative functions—i.e., discourse, as studied today by the subfield of linguistics called pragmatics. In his operas Monteverdi fully realized Peri's ideal of “imitating in song a person speaking” (“imitar col canto chi parla”) by musically emphasizing those context-dependent meanings that emerge especially in ordinary language and that are prominent in dramatic texts, as opposed to poetry and prose. Such meanings are manifest whenever words such as “I,” “here,” and “now” appear— words called “deictics”—with the function of situating the speaker/singer's utterances in a specific time and place. Monteverdi highlights deictics through melodic and rhythmic emphases, repetition, shifts of meter, style, and harmony, as part of a strategy to create a musical language suited to opera as a genre and to singers as actors. In
         Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patriaandL'incoronazione di Poppea, this strategy serves large-scale dramaturgical aims with respect to the relationships among space, time, and character identity, highlighting issues also discussed within the contemporary intellectual context.<br>

Abstract: At the heart of this essay is the suggestion that variation can be understood as a vital mode of Mozart's musical thinking, an impulse evident not merely in movements labeled "theme and variation," but in his output as a whole. Accordingly, I begin by sketching a more general theoretical context for the interaction of this variation impulse with the more teleological formal dynamics of sonata.<br>

Abstract: Framed in such a way, the early movements of Mahler's Second Symphony—characterized by the alternation between halting sections that dissolve almost as soon as they begin and long-breathed melodies that seem to unfold effortlessly—suggest the melancholic subject's struggle between despair in the face of abject meaninglessness and a manic euphoria, neither of which addresses the loss. By contrast, the text in the symphony's final movement, adapted by Mahler from Friedrich Klopstock's chorale on the resurrection of the dead, encourages true remembrance of the deceased as a figure beyond death. Heard as a musical enactment of mourning, the final movement suggests that the dead who are mourned are resurrected through remembrance. Forcing us to acknowledge Mahler's death on some level, the final movement completes the work of mourning by engendering the composer's own resurrection in our memories as we witness each performance of his Second Symphony.<br>

Abstract: The
         Left Behindnovels by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins have become a major publishing phenomenon in recent years. The novels have succeeded in part because they address the anxieties of their readers, using apocalyptic language to depict a future world in which evildoers are punished, and the faithful reverse the tables on their cultural marginality. The novels, however, also speak to the "here and now," articulating in narrative form the beliefs and actions that place one among either the saved or the damned. The novels accomplish this through the issuance of marks. Both believers and the followers of Antichrist have distinctive marks, which prove less than reliable. At stake, ultimately, is an evangelicalism open to the ambiguity and uncertainty of contemporary life, and a reactive fundamentalism that insists, metaphorically, on the rigidity of marks—a quest for certainty ill-advised in a world characterized by relentless change.*<br>

Abstract: Abstract: Vico's theory of metaphor is best understood as a monster in the tradition of classical rhetorical invention. It is the mutant offspring of metaphor characterized as "necessary" (an "ear" of com, for example) and metaphor characterized in terms of analogy. From the perspective of his method. Vico marries these apparently incompatible forms inherited from Aristotle and thereby identifies a third type of linguistic metaphor. I argue that the metaphor identifies a stipulatory definition taken out of context. In order to situate this claim, I outline Vico's genetic analysis and elaborate in general terms what metaphor and definition share. Most importantly. Vico insists that beings, actions, and events are linguistically identifiedin some particular diseursive context. Indeed, in many cases that context alone determines whether the expression can be called a definition or a metaphor. Like Cicero's ideal jurist, Vico's hero employs motivated words and realizes possibilities available to common sense. Henee Vico's theory of metaphor is both "constructivist"—language has the power to makes things—and "humartist"—it must do so in a form appropriate to history and culture. Vico's theory is consequently important to us because it challenges the proper/figurative distinction championed in the philosophy of language and adds a pragmatic dimension to contemporary views of metaphor at work in literary theory.<br>

Abstract: AbstractThe rise of prose in Greece has been linked to broader cultural and intellectual developments under way in the classical period. Prose has also been characterized as challenging poetry's traditional status as the privileged expression of the culture. Yet throughout the classical period and beyond, poetry was still regularly invoked as the yardstick by which innovation was measured. This paper investigates how poetry figures in the earliest accounts of prose style. Focusing on Isocrates, Alcidamas, and Aristotle, it argues that although each author distinguishes between the styles of prose and poetry, none is able to sustain the distinction consistently. The criteria for what constitutes an acceptable level of poeticality in prose were unstable. The diverse conceptions of poetic style were tied to intellectual polemics and professional rivalries of the early- to mid-fourth century bce and reflect competing aims and ideals for rhetorical performance in prose.<br>

Abstract: The cross-cultural program of research presented here is about matters of temporal persistence-personal persistence and cultural persistence-and about solution strategies for solving the paradox of "sameness-in-change." The crux of this paradox resides in the fact that, on threat of otherwise ceasing to be recognizable as a self, all of us must satisfy at least two constitutive conditions. The first of these is that selves are obliged to keep moving or die, and, so, must continually change. The second is that selves must also somehow remain the same, lest all notions of moral responsibility and any commitment to an as yet unrealized future become nonsensical. Although long understood as a problem demanding the attention of philosophers, we argue that this same paradox arises in the ordinary course of identity development and dictates the different developmental routes taken by culturally mainstream and Aboriginal youth in coming to the identity-preserving conclusion that they and others are somehow continuous through time. Findings from a set of five studies are presented. The first and second studies document the development and refinement of a method for parsing and coding what young people say on the topic of personal persistence or self-continuity. Both studies demonstrate that it is not only possible to seriously engage children as young as age 9 or 10 years in detailed and codable discussions about personal persistence, but that their reasoning concerning such matters typically proceeds in an orderly and increasingly sophisticated manner over the course of their early identity development. Our third study underscores the high personal costs of failing to sustain a workable sense of personal persistence by showing that failures to warrant self-continuity are strongly associated with increased suicide risk in adolescence. Study four documents this same relation between continuity and suicide, this time at the macrolevel of whole cultures, and shows that efforts by Aboriginal groups to preserve and promote their culture are associated with dramatic reductions in rates of youth suicide. In the final study we show that different default strategies for resolving the paradox of personal persistence and change-Narrative and Essentialist strategies-distinctly characterize Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal youth.<br>

Abstract: Postmodern theory is often seen as a realm either of totally free play--where anything goes and there are no rules at all--or of despair where all visions of equality and democracy are equated with totalitarianism. Coherent ways of talking about "actors" or "responsibility" can appear to be entirely repudiated. Further perceived as elitist, obscure, convoluted, and entirely removed from any kind of practical reality, postmodernism is often viewed as having nothing relevant to say to teachers or those interested in concretely improving education. This paper attempts to show that these visions are not entirely fair to the ways many "postmodern" theorists strive to explore carefully the myriad tensions invariably involved in politics and pedagogy or to the (perhaps surprising) egalitarian commitments that generally undergird their projects. Taking advantage of the fluid and ultimately undefinable character of the idea of the "postmodern," this paper draws from an eclectic group of thinkers, teasing out a range of different perspectives that might inform, complicate, and contest efforts to "teach freedom."<br>

Abstract: Although narrative inquiry has a long intellectual history both in and out of education, it is increasingly used in studies of educational experience. One theory in educational research holds that humans are storytelling organisms who, individually and socially, lead storied lives. Thus, the study of narrative is the study of the ways humans experience the world. This general concept is refined into the view that education and educational research is the construction and reconstruction of personal and social stories; learners, teachers, and researchers are storytellers and characters in their own and other's stories. In this paper we briefly survey forms of narrative inquiry in educational studies and outline certain criteria, methods, and writing forms, which we describe in terms of beginning the story, living the story, and selecting stories to construct and reconstruct narrative plots. Certain risks, dangers, and abuses possible in narrative studies are discussed. We conclude by describing a two-part research agenda for curriculum and teacher studies flowing from stories of experience and narrative inquiry.<br>

Abstract: Peter Middleton has written regarding Blake,
"The recurrence of names is not a guarantee of an existing entity, successfully named and
located, able to unify the appearances of its names in the text. Instead this recurrence
marks redefinition, re-examination, as of the terms used in a long, complex process of rea-
soning. ... These characters are not, we might say, quite in the same play or on the same
stage or even quite all there" (41)

Abstract: This paper follows two purposes: the first to unpack some of the artistic cargo of symbols as distinct from the more conventional aspects of them (e. g., their ability to refer to other things or events, and their ability to communicate ideas), and the second to show, by means of contrasts, the actual workings of Interpretation Theory as it could be applied to the analysis of art-making and art-viewing. For the first purpose, the author draws material from philosophy, dramatic writings, linguistic theory, and statements of artists in an analytic search for the often intractable character of the artistic image. For the second purpose, the author demonstrates, through the use of logic and the poetic metaphor, how a particular form of hermeneutic inquiry can be applied to assist an understanding of the assumptions upon which research is often built.<br>

Abstract: Bainbridge and Stark's essay on "The Consciousness Reformation" illustrates conceptual and theoretical ambiguities characteristic of research in the scientific study of religion more generally. This paper traces these ambiguities to the presence of two competing, but poorly differentiated, epistemological traditions. An examination of the assumptions implicit within each of these traditions provides a basis for clarifying the distinction between religious symbolism and religious belief, the concept of meaning, the difference between consistency as an attribute of belief and coherence as an attribute of reality, and the role of interpersonal bonds in maintaining the plausibility of religious symbolism. An emerging third perspective that appears to circumvent some of the limitations of the two major epistemological traditions is also discussed.<br>

Abstract: Recent literature on Heidegger concentrates heavily on his (temporary) involvement in or collusion with Nazi ideology and policies. Without belittling the gravity of the issue, this article shifts the focus somewhat by invoking a distinction which recently has emerged (or reemerged) in political thought: namely, the distinction between "politics" and "the political" or between politics viewed as partisan ideology or policy making, on the one hand, and politics seen as regime or paradigmatic framework, on the other. The main thesis of the article is that Heidegger's promising contributions to political theory are located on the level of ontology or paradigmatic framework rather than that of ideological partisanship. While not neglecting the dismal intrusions of the latter plane, the article probes Heideggerian cues for a "rethinking of the political" by placing the accent on four topical areas: first, the status of the subject or individual as political agent; second, the character of the political community, that is, of the polity or (in modern terms) the "state"; thirdly, the issue of cultural and political development or modernization; and finally, the problem of an emerging cosmopolis or world order beyond the confines of Western culture. In discussing these topics, an effort is made to disentangle Heidegger from possible misinterpretations and to indicate how, in each area, his thought pointed in the direction of an "overcoming" of Western political metaphysics.<br>

Abstract: This paper proposes a theoretical foundation for extending our understanding of study drawings by bringing forward concepts from a number of disciplines that are concerned with the structure of knowledge. Study drawings are defined as the informal, private drawings that architectural designers use as a medium for graphic thinking in the exploratory stages of their work. Drawings from the work of Paxton through Picasso are analyzed to confirm the familiar characteristics of study drawings and to identify the properties which account for their role in the working process of design, including their use as a means of inquiry. This epistemological function is compared with certain features of written language in order to propose an internal structure for study drawings. The paper concludes that much of the origin and nature of knowledge in design can be explained in terms of the properties and processes of study drawings and that these terms should be used to evaluate proposals for new media in design.<br>

Abstract: Many students of religion suggest that wholeness or the attainment of an integrated self is an especially valuable goal whose attainment marks a moment of religious insight. Theoreticians like Jung, Allport, and Maslow strongly support this belief. Freud does not. To reconcile the two camps one must either drop Freud altogether or confine his critique of religion to an attack upon neurotic religion, or more exactly, religion based upon superego functioning. One could then claim that healthy religion is a function of the ego, e.g., the ego's tendency towards integrated functioning and the attainment of 'wholeness'. I argue that this ploy, which is itself a function of an egosyntonic desire for wholeness, is altogether wrong. It misrepresents Freud's ego psychology and it therefore misrepresents his critique of the ego's role in religion as well. First, his theoretical, as opposed to his literary, critique of religion is also a critique of certain characteristics of the ego. Second, these characteristics, especially the ego-syntonic drive towards feelings of wholeness, are functions of the ego's obedience to repetition compulsion. Third, the later texts on religion cannot be understood apart from their roots in Freud's earliest theory of ego functioning, especially the physicalist program he developed in his "Project" of 1895. The ego creates and takes part in religious dramas which present an illusory world of wholeness and completion of self. But as the seat of reality testing it must pierce the veils as quickly and as repeatedly as it weaves them.<br>

Abstract: Despite the significant impact of the awareness of perspectival relativism on the religious imagination, recent philosophers and theologians have rarely subjected epistemological relativism to careful scrutiny. This paper attempts to overcome the current theological impasse by a careful exploration of the metaphysical implications of relativism. The central thesis of the essay is that truth is relative because meaning is contextual and being is relational. Contextualized meaning and relational being join to form relative truth disclosed through symbolic awareness. The roots of contemporary relativism lie deep within eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophical movements and are inseparably entangled with the psycho-social pluralization endemic to the process of modernization. The efforts of Neo-orthodoxy, polytheism, and the scientific study of religion to resolve dilemmas posed by epistemological relativism are inadequate. What has gone unnoticed is that the discovery of truth's relativity is the realization of its inherently dialectical character. This insight begins to emerge when it is recognized that meaning is contextual and context is semiophantic. Principles identified in Hegel's logic, in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of temporality, and in Ricoeur's and Gadamer's hermeneutics disclose that meaning assumes form through dialectical interrelationship in which co-implicates mutually constitute each other. The synchronic and diachronic dimensions of relationality reveal the inexhaustability and perpetual revisability of meaning. The problem of semantics, however, is inseparable from the question of ontology. Ontological reflection leads to the conclusion that being itself is dialectical-fundamentally social or essentially relational. Determinate identity is born of ontological intercourse with otherness. Relations are not external and accidental, but are internal and essential to being itself. Identity and difference, unity and plurality, oneness and manyness are thoroughly corelative, joined in a dialectical relation of reciprocal implication. This pluralized unity and unified plurality is the ontological matrix of truth's relativity. Symbolic awareness is the interface of contextual meaning and relational being. The density of constitutive relations and the nascence of concrete actuality engender a dissonance between manifest and latent content in the reflection of being in consciousness. The polysemy of symbols captures the polymorphism of being in a way that establishes the need for a constant process of decipherment in which we reformulate our notions in order more fully to penetrate synchronic and diachronic relations that are ontologically definitive. By maintaining the tension between the revealed and the concealed, symbolic awareness insures that knowledge always evolves through ceaseless reinterpretation. For symbolic consciousness, truth, as being itself, forever becomes. The essay concludes with the suggestion that the wedding of a relativistic epistemology and a relational ontology in a symbolics of the religious imagination reopens the possibility of constructive theological reflection in a pluralistic age.<br>

Abstract: Through the provision of a set of theses for the interpretation and evaluation of theologies of liberation, this paper attempts to mediate the existing conflict between academic theologians and theologians of liberation. It seeks to establish the legitimacy of theological discourse focused on the problem of alienation and liberation if carefully executed according to a clear set of guidelines. The paper begins with the argument that all interpretations of theologies of liberation must begin with an analysis of the theological genre within which these works fall. After insisting that theologies of liberation belong neither to the genre of systematic theology nor that of Christian social ethics, the paper develops the second thesis that theologies of liberation are best understood as members of a genre whose distinctive characteristics and functions are analogous to those intrinsic to secular ideologies. This thesis hinges upon a revisionist understanding of ideology drawn from the works of Clifford Geertz et al. and upon a careful specification of the generic similarities between the two forms of discourse. The second part of the paper moves from the level of interpretation to that of evaluation. It argues that theologies of liberation share with ideologies a tendency to occlude self-critical reflection. It suggests that a conscious recognition that theologies of liberation do not exhaust the possibilities of theological discourse but are relative models which select and interpret Christian symbols and doctrines in the light of the central dynamic of alienation and liberation might provide an antidote to this pathology. It maintains with Rosemary Ruether that there is no absolutely adequate model of alienation and liberation and that various models of alienation and liberation must be "interstructured" in order to overcome the perspectival biases of models which focus upon a single root of oppression. To establish relative degrees of adequacy between various theological models of liberation the paper argues that these models be evaluated a) by the criterion of appropriateness to the charter documents and to the historical development of one's chosen religious tradition, b) by the criterion of adequacy to the human condition in its essential commonality and in its historical diversity, and c) by the criterion of dialectical inclusiveness. The paper concludes by agreeing with theologians of liberation that ultimately no set of criteria validates a theology of liberation. As fundamentally geared to praxis, such a theology must be subject to a process of existential verification.<br>

Abstract: Economics is privileged in contemporary government policy such that all human transactions are seen as economic forms of exchange. Education has been discursively restructured according to the logic of the market, with education policy being increasingly colonised by economic policy imperatives. This paper explores some of the consequences of this reframing which draws upon metaphors from industrial and business domains. This paper examines a significant dimension of teaching that currently has marginal presence in official discourse: social contingency. We argue that social contingency is characterised by a variety of distinctive features that include unpredictability, relationality and ethical demands. The significance of social contingency is highlighted by a comparison with industrial production, which is organisationally contingent, and craft production, which is characterised as materially contingent. We argue that the different nature of contingency in these domains makes them inappropriate as metaphors for teaching. We explore the nature of social contingency and some of the practical and ethical consequences of the failure to articulate this in official discourse. Its absence in such discourse is illustrated by consideration of competence statements in the Initial Teacher Education context. We argue that the neglect of social contingency is founded on assumptions of teacher sovereignty that are both philosophically and ethically unsustainable.<br>

Abstract: This study of organised political violence in north-central Nicaragua from 1926 to 1934 focuses on the infamous Conservative gang leader Anastacio Hernandez and on Sandino's rebels. The contexts of a weak central state and local-regional caudillismo are outlined. It is shown that after the 1926-27 civil war. Hernandez and others produced ritualised spectacular violence in the service of their Chamorrista caudillo patrons. The language, practices, and characteristics of organised violence are examined. It is argued that Sandino's rebels appropriated these tools of political struggle, and that changes and continuities in the organisation of violence in Nicaraguan history merit greater attention.<br>

Abstract: Recent challenges to traditional approaches and purposes for studying the history of political theory have raised questions about its constitution as both a subject matter and subfield of political science. Methodological arguments advocating what is characterized as a more truly historical mode of inquiry for understanding political ideas and recovering textual meaning have become increasingly popular. The relationship of these hermeneutical claims about historicity, such as that advanced by Quentin Skinner, to the actual practice of interpretation is problematical. Such claims are more a defense of a certain norm of historical investigation than a method of interpretation, and the implications of this norm for the reconstitution of the history of political theory require careful consideration.<br>

Abstract: This reflection on Errington's thought-provoking paper, by an intellectual historian and a student of Chinese philosophy, does not dispute her interpretive position on classical Malay literature in general and on hikayat in particular. Rather, it attempts to challenge three salient points of her argument: that the distinction between "oral" and "written" is a hazy one in the paratactic style of the hikayat; that the "images" in this type of literature are flat, repetitive and without content; and that the Malay art of story-telling is diametrically opposed to the rhetorical style of history characteristic of the post-Renaissance West. It is hoped that such a discussion will bring about fruitful encounters between scholars in different fields and disciplines in Asian studies.<br>

Abstract: In "The Magic Mountain," the only literary text by Thomas Mann in which German anti-Semitism is an object of satire, it remains uncertain whether a number of individuals are to be considered Jewish, or not. These uncertainties are symptomatic of the novel's protracted genesis, and especially of Thomas Mann's lifelong, historically and biographically conditioned efforts to distance himself from the anti-Semitic typologies evident in his early work. The most prominent of the relevant individuals in "The Magic Mountain," Dr. Krokowski, exemplifies this phenomenon. The various characteristics attributed to Krokowski evoke the continuing memory of a literary figure through whom Thomas Mann had previously only intended to relieve his anti-Semitic resentments. Thus Krokowski has a dual significance, representing Thomas Mann's early anti-Semitism and his later and vigorous, but nevertheless not entirely successful, attempts to overcome it.<br>

Abstract: A recurrent misconception about the concept of utopia fails to realize fully that its essential endeavor constitutes a speculative act involving the distribution of power and resources. Consequently, utopian desire is closely linked to structures of power and can be manipulated by interests in positions of influence within these structures. It is these connections to the machinations of power that bring utopian visions their potential for social/political influence. However, these same types of links also provide avenues for these conceptions to be cynically influenced in ways that can usurp individual autonomy. The role of power and utopia can be analyzed in the formative process of a specific social structure as well as in their contribution to the conception of a common heritage or history. The "historical perspective" often serves as the foundation for the production of propaganda seeking to capture the imagination of a populace either to instigate positive social change or to legitimize an oppressive regime. Through the lens of Collingwood's philosophy of history, this article investigates the connection that the "historical consciousness" has to the attributes of power and utopia as well as the role that this relationship plays in the formation of a collective mentality. In short, it studies the essential characteristics of the bond between individuals that allows a community or collective to perpetuate itself. It also explores how the attributes of power and utopia can use latent historical perceptions to strengthen the process of ideological integration that underlies any social action or formal structure of authority.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur distills this point well: "When we discover that there are
several cultures instead of just one and consequently at the time when we acknowledge
the end of a sort of cultural monopoly, be it illusory or real, we are threatened with the
destruction of our own discovery. Suddenly it becomes possible that there are just
others, that we ourselves are an 'other' among others" (History and Truth [Evanston,
Ill., 1965], p. 278).

Abstract: Death and futility are among a cluster of themes that closely track discussions of life's meaning. Moreover, futility is thought to supervene on naturalistic meta-narratives because of how they will end. While the nature of naturalistic meta-narrative endings is part of the explanation for concluding that such meta-narratives are cosmically or deeply futile, this explanation is truncated. I argue that the reason the nature of the ending is thought to be normatively important is first anchored in the fact that narrative ending qua ending is thought to be normatively important. Indeed, I think futility is often thought to characterize naturalistic meta-narratives because a narrative's ending has significant proleptic power to elicit a wide range of broadly normative human responses on, possibly, emotional, aesthetic, and moral levels towards the narrative as a whole.<br>

Abstract: This study builds on the premise that local knowledge of limestone—and its workable characteristics—was foundational to landscape inhabitation in the Puuc region of Yucatán, México. Classic Maya architecture of the northern Yucatán generally is considered to represent the apogee of Maya construction prowess with extensive use of core-veneer masonry and the creation of tall, wide corbelled vaults. Less commonly discussed is the variable distribution of high-quality limestone across the Yucatán, the social matrix that undergirds the quarrying, transporting, and working of limestone, and the pronounced social differences materialized in stone architecture. This study explores these three topics by bringing to bear Yucatec Mayan linguistic evidence and excavation data from the archaeological site of Sayil, in the hilly Puuc region of Yucatán. That information provides a basis for understanding the development of a sprawling residential complex, the role that variable limestone quality played in its expansion, and serves as an index of intra-compound social difference. Late additions to the dwellings indicate that recognition of the cultural value of carved stone persisted long after masonry skills became attenuated. The durability of stone renders it a particularly effective—if underutilized—medium for interpreting social landscapes of the past. Este estudio amplifica la premisa de que el conocimiento de la piedra caliza—y sus propiedades arteseanales—fue una base fundamental para la ocupación del paisaje de la Región Puuc, Yucatán, México. En general, la arquitectura de los mayas de la época Clásica del norte de Yucatán se considera representativa del apogeo de su proeza arquitectónica con el uso extensivo de núcleos de piedra burda recubiertos de piedra labrada y la creación de habitaciones con bóvedas altas y anchas. Menos mencionados son la distribución geográfica variable de piedra caliza de alta calidad a través de Yucatán, la matriz social que permite la explotación de canteras y el transporte y trabajo de los bloques, y la diferencia social profunda que se nota en la arquitectura en piedra. Este estudio explora estos tres temas usando evidencia de la lengua maya yucateca y datos de excavaciones del sitio arqueológico de Sayil, en la serranía Puuc. Esta información proporciona las bases para entender el desarrollo de un grupo residencial expansivo y el papel que la calidad variable de la piedra caliza tuvo en su expansión, y sirve como índice de diferencias sociales entre los habitantes del mismo grupo. Adiciones tardías a los edificios indican que el reconocimiento del valor cultural de la piedra trabajada persistió mucho tiempo después de la disminución de las técnicas especializadas de albañilería. La durabilidad de la piedra la hace un buen instrumento, aunque poco utilizado, para interpretar los paisajes sociales del pasado.<br>

Abstract: This article explores socio-cultural practices with regard to aging women in Vārāṇāsī, a city in North India. It is based on 17 months of field research carried out in 1999—2000 among marginalized Hindu women. I argue that aging is a continuous process that is characterized by the specific psychological patterns that form throughout a woman's life history. These patterns are demonstrated by women's particular types of behaviors and demeanors and, in turn, permit others to ascribe to them—in varying combinations and ratios—specific cultural values or qualities. I argue that these attributes are the critical ones that inform the cultural construction and designation of being 'middle-aged' and 'older' as it pertains to Hindu women of Vārāṇāsī.<br>

Abstract: This essay represents an attempt to critically assess the intellectual orientation often termed 'structuralism.' In particular, the essay is concerned with European, and even more specifically French, structuralism as displayed in the writings of Louis Althusser, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, and C. Levi-Strauss. The analysis indicates that despite a novel language, an often rigorous character, and some interesting, indeed exciting, intellectual constructions, structuralism is very much a child of positivism. The positivism/structuralism relationship is most clearly revealed when structuralism is contrasted with Marxian social inquiry. For comparative and illustrative purposes, then, the essay contrasts structuralism and Marxism.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in confusing motives with causes; irrationalism, which advocates a "liberté d'indifférence", basing itself on the same premise as rationalism, and confusing motives with causes, is wrong in seeing the negation of the very existence of motives as the one way of saving human freedom. Both views disregard the fact that human action is impossible and cannot be understood without motives and that this, in turn, does not mean a determination of man in a mechanical way, for motives are not a part of nature but rather an organic element in a specific human situation—voluntary action. Human freedom is the freedom peculiar to a finite being immersed in time. Both those who stress passivity and receptivity and those who stress the dynamic creating ability of the self are wrong; both those who thought that freedom is possible only on the basis of clear and distinct motives and that action is nothing but the end of deliberation (St. Thomas) and those who thought that freedom is possible only by an irrational emergence of the vital ego (Bergson) or by negating the existence of any previous determination of the self (Sartre) are mistaken. A true human decision is composed of two elements; given motives and values on the one hand, and non-intellectualist spontaneous choice on the other. Duality is peculiar to human action. This is made more explicit in dealing with the more fundamental involuntary elements; character, sub-consciousness and life. Man acts freely from a finite and determined point of view; he acts in a clear and transparent way on the basis of confused and amorphous data; he lives his freedom when thrown into life. Necessity is inherent in man; it is one of his modes of being. There is no "inner freedom" on the one hand and "objective" causal necessity on the other. This conception of human action as both activity and passivity is reminiscent of Merleau-Ponty's statement in his "Philosophie du perception": "Le monde est déjá constitué, mais aussi jamais complètement constitué.... Il n'y a donc jamais déterminisme et jamais choix absolu, jamais je ne suis chose et jamais conscience nue". There is no dilemna between determinism and irrationalism, just as there is none between extended substance and thinking substance; there is dialogue.<br>

Abstract: Although the character of Job's wife has been given very little space in the biblical text of Job, she has been treated by many exegetes as significant. There are two main streams of interpretation in which she has figured prominently. In classical Christian approaches, ranging from Augustine to some modern commentators such as Habel, Job's wife tends to be regarded as a temptress in the mold of Eve and as a collaborator of the Satan. Post-modern, especially feminist, approaches tend to rehabilitate the character of Job's wife, accrediting her with prompting Job's critical reflection and with anticipating the direction in which the plot of the book develops. In the present article, interpretive approaches to Job's wife, including the favorable approach of some Jewish exegesis of antiquity, as well as the somewhat middle road of medieval Jewish exegesis, are surveyed. A critical discussion of feminist treatments of Job's wife deals primarily with the work of Newsom, Pardes and van Wolde. The place of Job's wife in the book is assessed with regard to how her theological views compare to those of the Satan on the one hand, and Job on the other, as well as to her role as a catalyst in the plot.<br>

Abstract: The major thesis developed in Sartre's L'imaginaire is that all imaginary acts can be subsumed under the heading of one "image family" and, therefore, that imagination as a whole can be theorized in terms of pictorial representation. Yet this theory fails to meet the objective of Sartre's study, to demonstrate that imaginary activity is not a derivative of perception but an attitude with a character and dignity of its own. The subsidiary account of imagination in terms of neutralization of belief has the advantage of not being constrained by the requirement that imaginary activity serve a purely reproductive function of bringing an absent "original" into a quasi presence and, thus, leaves room for free creativity and fiction. It also points to a concrete lived experience of alterity at the heart of subjective life where the subject stages its life as if it were the life of an other, putting pressure onto Sartre's contention that the cogito defines subjectivity.<br>

Abstract: "La dérive d'une vie," that of the hero in En rade, is metaphorized by the dérive of narrative, composed of a complex network of metaphors. In 1893, Paul Souriau proposed that metaphor makes a fleeting representation pass into the unconscious. Dreams and hysteria, states in which the unconscious holds sway, are of considerable importance in this text. An analysis of the way that metaphor works will shed light on the relationships between dream and reality, and between consciousness and the unconscious in general. The double fil of extended metaphor is also metaphorized as a bifurcating road, the road of narrative and the labyrinthine path the hero's thoughts take. In fact, route or chemin is not only a metaphor for the text and for extended metaphor itself, but also for the complex pathways of the nerves and brain. If the road or path of narrative is also a representation of nerves/brain, then retracing these pathways of metaphors would be a way of following the text's attempt to dissect the brain and uncover the links between dream and reality, the double sphere of activity that characterizes this novel.<br>

Abstract: By incorporating the battle of Waterloo into the events of their novels, Hugo and Stendhal create a portrait of its principal protagonist, Napoléon ler. Associated in one case with a spatial prison out of time and in the other case with a temporal exile out of space, the image of the emperor is that of a figure of power deprived of time and, consequently, of its legitimacy. Stendhal imprisons his character in the present to deny the reality of Napoleon's defeat. Hugo, on the other hand, exiles his character from the present to link the past to the future and propose a new model of heroism.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines how two Jefferson biographies represented the Thomas Jefferson—Sally Hemings relationship in the post—civil rights movement era: Fawn Brodie's Thomas Jefferson (1974), a controversial publication that claimed that Hemings and Jefferson loved each other, and Joseph Ellis's American Sphinx (1996), one of the last mainstream biographies to deny that they had any children together. The story in both cases serves as an allegory of founding authority and national membership. The author finds that Ellis and Brodie characterize Jefferson as a fallible founder to affirm that founding ideals can accommodate and overcome racial differences and injustices.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of interpreting the concepts of tradition and traditionalism with specific reference to the tradition of the Anatolian house and the recent erosion of place quality in Turkish towns. The Anatolian house provides a remarkable example of cultural diffusion and transformation. During the reign of the late Ottoman, a variety of cultures impinged on one another, giving rise to autochthonous traditions that were shared by different religious and ethnic groups. But during the Republican Period the process of Westernization interrupted the continuity of historic traditions, resulting in the emergence of a peculiar contemporary tradition. The majority of Turkish housing today displays characteristics of a "vernacular modernism" conditioned by the moral and technical orders of a market economy. The worldwide spread of such cultural mediocrity has often been attributed to the corrosive influence of a single world civilization. A number of recent attempts have been made to search for a national idiom in Turkey. But these attempts, often promoting a "vernacular historicism," have yet to account for any distinct revision of urban house-form. Argument today revolves around an old rhetorical opposition between universal civilization and national culture. Should a post-traditional society sustain its cultural tradition to attain universal values, or vice-versa? The conservative in this debate is more involved in the revival than in the preservation of tradition. The progressive, though an ardent defender of preservation, resists revivalism because of its chauvinistic connotations and pastiche effects. This paper attempts to resolve this argument by suggesting a simultaneous unfolding of the historical problems of the Anatolian house tradition and the theoretical problems of presumed dichotomies such as "traditional vs. modern." Finally, the paper advocates the development of research strategies to facilitate correct readings of cultural tradition and design strategies to improve the quality of residential environments.<br>

Abstract: This article interprets John Sayles' 1996 film Lone Star as a reflection on how a community whose history is steeped in violence, such as the US, should seek to manage its difficult cultural memory. A conceptual triad of love, justice, and tragedy utilised to interpret the film's last line, 'Forget the Alamo.' It is concluded that the memory of a troubled past can only serve as the basis for responsible public life when we, like the characters in Lone Star, choose to remember with a charity that liberates both our ancestors and our selves from having to play out the roles of hero or villain.<br>

Abstract: This essay suggests that the images of love in Ngugi's first written novel, The River Between can be read as a phenomenology of love. Such a phenomenology demonstrates that the love Waiyaki, the main character, has for Nyambura points to a conciliatory path in resistance to colonialism. It is argued that although the main character fails in his mission, his declaration of love for the daughter of the pastor, who opposes indigenous practices, is an erotic manifestation that is a rejection of partisan spirit as well as a critique of Christian praxis in colonial Kenya, and could serve as a basis for reconfiguring contemporary gender relations.<br>

Abstract: The contemporary philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, has characterized the dominant trend in modern interpretative thought as the 'school of suspicion', whose most significant 'masters' are Freud and Nietzsche. For them, to seek meaning—whether in a text, dream, discourse, or institution—is, first and foremost, to suspect 'truth as lying'. It is my contention that Ricoeur could well have named Dostoevsky as a third master of this modern school of interpretation, for he, too, was preoccupied with exploring the possibility of 'truth as lying', whether to others or to oneself. The general concern of my essay is to clarify Dostoevsky's relation to the modern 'hermeneutics of suspicion' in a manner which is mutually illuminating. The particular focus is on Dostoevsky's hermeneutics of suspicion as employed in The Brothers Karamazov, especially with the object of deciphering the avowed 'love of humanity' which motivates Ivan Karamazov's famous 'rebellion' against God. Ivan's humanism is highly ambiguous, as his words and actions (of omission and commission) throughout the novel demonstrate. I attempt to show that the ambiguity of Ivan Karamazov can be illumined as an exercise of suspicion on Dostoevsky's part which distinguishes between the manifest sources of Ivan's moral stance and what is in reality its hidden basis. And, in order to situate Dostoevsky in relation to the modern 'school of suspicion', his interpretation of the ambiguous text of modern humanism is compared with that of Nietzsche. The dialogue which the essay sets up between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky on the problem embodied by Ivan Karamazov reveals areas of convergence and divergence: the former apparent in a shared suspicion of a secular humanism which affirms the love of humanity apart from religious faith; and the latter apparent in their different understandings of love—whether of humanity or of God. The comparison between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, then, highlights the distinction between a hermeneutics of suspicion which is ultimately reductive in intent, and one which can be said to be ultimately 'recollective'.<br>

Abstract: In this article alternative history is regarded not as a postmodern genre of Since Fiction but as a universal mode of thinking and storytelling. Its research is especially effective in discussions of historical-mythical pseudo-chronicles of lost civilizations, such as Agnon's Ir u-mloa, his Holocaust opus magnum. The article is devoted to the story from this volume "In Search of a Rabbi, or The Spirit of the Ruler" (Ha-mekhapsim lahem rav, o be-ruakh ha-moshel). The method lays open the author's complex historical and historiographic conceptions hidden in plots and characters, as well as in symbols of historical alternativeness such as "Crusher of Grits" (Kotesh grisin).<br>

Abstract: This article inquires as to the meaning of nervoso (nerves) among poor, working-class women from Salvador, Brazil. Our aim is to understand nerves as an experience that emerges from the background of a life trajectory and that, in many significant ways, disrupts the taken-for-granted character of that trajectory. From a phenomenological-hermeneutical tradition, we explore the links between experience, embodiment and temporality and then discuss the relevance of this approach for the understanding of women′s nervoso. In order to do so we present the life histories of three middle-aged women who have been afflicted with nerves. The accounts describe significant ways in which culturally inherited possibilities – grounded in a lived context of class and gender – are recovered and come to pre-figure a certain future. As we argue throughout the article, it is only when we situate the experience of nervoso within the temporal frame of life that we can truly understand it – that is, grasp it as part of a movement that involves both recovery and creation of meaning.<br>

Abstract: Original Sin is considered to be a uniquely Christian doctrine. Nevertheless, an analysis of apparently forgotten Jewish treatises — most of which are to be found only in manuscript form — reveals that an extraordinary philosophical theory of Original Sin is present in late medieval Jewish thought. It implies, therefore, a new dimension in characterising this doctrine and has implications for the understanding of the process of inter-communicating of Jewish and Christian thought. This study focuses on fundamental Jewish passages, beginning with Apocalyptic literature and ending with medieval philosophical texts. Yet, the examination of those Hebrew texts is carried out in the light of the writing of Christian scholars. This means that the attempt to clarify this Jewish doctrine is made, from a methodological viewpoint, both by looking at the development of this doctrine trough the history of the Jewish thought, and by a close examination of the parallel general sources. It is only then that one can see that rudiments of the Christian doctrine of Original Sin were inserted into the Aristotelian theory of Nature, and combined with elements from Maimonides' Biblical-allegoric exegesis.<br>

Abstract: In his famous paper, What Is It Like To Be A Bat?, Thomas Nagel argues against a reductive physicalist account of consciousness by highlighting what he calls "the subjective character of experience". In this paper I will argue that Nagel's insight is important for understanding the value placed on patient autonomy in medical ethics. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience brings with it the necessity for an epistemological humility with respect to the lives of others and what can be said to be "right" for them. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience lies at the heart of empathy and our capacity to make decisions that genuinely reflect respect for the patient's autonomy. Through the example of a case involving extreme medical intervention, I identify some impediments to the proper recognition of autonomy. These kind of cases highlight the significance of affective responses with respect to the subjective character of experience, and, by extension, to our capacity to imagine and act in accordance with another's perspective. I argue that affective responses are appropriate and needed considerations in the case where one must attempt to assume another's perspective in order to respect autonomy. I conclude that understanding that experience has an irreducibly subjective character is essential to respecting patient autonomy.<br>

Abstract: By establishing a parallel between the cycle of Lumière films and the Age of the Enlightenment ("siècle des lumières"), the author identifies the pensive character of the films' images as well as the aesthetic of the visible world they display. She then examines the transformation of a time-image into a memory-image in the Lumière films, arguing that the films are not only offer time-images, that is, residual images of the past, but have become images-as-memory in the contemporary spectator's mind.<br>

Abstract: Si comme Foucault lui-même le souligne, la question de la vérité occupe dans
toute sa recherche une place à différents égards cruciale (Foucault 1994 III : 30-
31, IV : 693), ce n'est qu'à partir des années 1980 qu'elle devient ensemble à
la problématique du sujet la préoccupation principale du philosophe. En effet,
déjà dans ses recherches sur la sexualité, Foucault s'est intéressé à une forme
particulière d'assujettissement à l'œuvre dans la pastorale chrétienne et qui sera
par la suite un modèle exemplaire pour les actions disciplinaires (Foucault 1994
III: 256-257, IV: 125-129, 148, 383-385, 783-788). Le sujet est contraint
d'avouer la vérité sur sa vie la plus intime, et notamment celle sexuelle, « pour
mieux renoncer à lui-même et se soumettre à son directeur de conscience » (Granjon
2005 : 42). Il s'agit d'un processus de formation du sujet dans un rapport à soi
aliéné. Selon FOUCAULT (1994 III : 551), ce modèle de formation du sujet est à
l'œuvre également dans « toutes les grandes machines disciplinaires : casernes,
écoles, ateliers et prisons [...] qui permettent de cerner l'individu, de savoir ce
qu'il est, ce qu'il fait, ce qu'on peut en faire, où il faut le placer, comment le
placer parmi les autres ». En 1980 lors d'une leçon au Collège de France pour
le cours intitulé « Du gouvernement des vivants », Foucault (2012 : 80-81) refor-
mule la question de la formation du sujet dans les termes de « régimes de vérité ».
Les années 1980 représentent un tournant dans les orientations analytiques du
philosophe. Dans un article paru en 1981, FOUCAULT (1994 IV : 693) annonce son
projet de recherche à venir, toutefois interrompu par sa mort prématurée. Il
reviendra à plusieurs reprises sur ce changement de thème directeur en essayant
aussi de montrer qu'il était sous-jacent dans ses recherches antérieures.<br>

Abstract: The basic unit of Joyce's fiction is, arguably, the encounter, a reminder of the Dubliners story of that name. This essay explores the many occasions of self-encounter, as when Joyce's characters see themselves in mirrors, in the eyes of others, or in the guise of someone other than they are or appear to be: when Gerty MacDowell projects her "Lady Bountiful" self onto Bloom's erotic gaze, for instance. The regulating idea here (as in Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of perception) is that we perceive ourselves through our bodies, but this perception is not an empirical mirror-image; it is an image mediated (and thus transformed) by an array of intentions, memories, desires, and ongoing experiences of ourselves and others, including our experiences of how others see us (something to which Stephen is particularly subject). Joyce's mirror-experiences range from ironic unmasking—"The Dead"—to phantasmagorias—the "Circe" episode of Ulysses, where no image is unreal, and every misnomer (like "Henry Flower") has its moment of truth.<br>

Abstract: Ernst Troeltsch distinguished between naive, apologetic and evolutionistic absoluteness.
From the original spontaneity of 'naive absoluteness' and its artificial (partly super-
naturalistic, partly rationalistic) defence as 'apologetic absoluteness' (in the Middle Ages and
in the Enlightenment, respectively) there came forth in Hegel the idea of 'evolutionistic
absoluteness' — an ingenious but untenable attempt to reconcile the solid apologetic
conception of absoluteness of that day with the dynamics of history by presenting it as the
outcome and terminus of historical progression. See Troeltsch, Die Absolutheit des Christen-
tums, 87ff. Cf. J. Klapwijk, Tussen historisme en relativisme, 222-29. At present the belief in
progress and thus also the mix of it with the idea of absoluteness is no longer a subject of
discussion.<br>

Abstract: Interestingly enough it appears that the structural features of reconciliation show a re-
versed version of the structural features of evil. Resolving the evil I do toward the other re-
quires that I am able to say what I have done wrong (the reverse of silence and the
tinspeakable), that I recognize my guilt (which is incompatible with splitting) and that I ask for
forgiveness (which is very shameful, but may résolve shame when penitence is accepted and
forgiveness is given); see Glas (in press); Muφhyand Hampton (1988); Volf (1996).<br>

Abstract: Desmond is certainly not blind to the risks of such an endeavor: God and the Betioeen
mentions on the one hand a loss of faith in case of the forlorn mystic who in his 'ardor for the
divine other' is confronted with his own 'lack and nothing' (GB 266), and on the other a
possible usurpation of divine sovereignty (GB 268).<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

worldview. Whether or not we realize it, we all have certain presuppositions and biases that
affect the way we view all of life and reality. A worldview is like a set of lenses which taint our
vision or alter the way we perceive the world around us.' (http://christianworldview.net/,

Abstract: In Matter and Memory, Bergson examines the relationship between perception and memory, the status of consciousness in its relation to the brain, and more generally, a possible conjunction of matter and mind. Our reading focuses in particular on his understanding of the evanescent presence of the present and of its debt vis-à-vis the "unconscious" consciousness of a "virtual" past. We wish to show that the Bergsonian version of a critique of "the metaphysics of presence" is, for all that, an offshoot of a Platonic type of metaphysics. It is true that Bergson departs from traditional stand-points on the side of a self-sufficient and original present and a form of presence to which the transparency of consciousness would confer the character of immediate evidence. All the same, it can hardly be claimed that his rehabilitation of the past and the unconscious opens up new perspectives on how forgetting and death are bound up with the work of memory.<br>

Abstract: Much light can be shed on events which characterize or underlie scandals at firms such as Enron, Arthur Andersen, Worldcom, ImClone, and Tyco by appealing to the notion of ethical distance. Various inquiries have highlighted the difficulties in finding or identifying particular individuals to blame for particular events, and in the context of situations as complex as these it can sometimes be helpful to investigate the comparative ethical distance of various participants in these events. In this essay I offer a characterization of ethical distance in terms of moral responsibility, and in doing so I describe and illustrate the rough inverse correlation between moral distance and degrees of moral responsibility. I urge that the concept of ethical distance is capable of shedding light upon situations in which several people are involved in bringing about a state of affairs. I then argue that moral responsibility cannot do justice to all situations involving ethical distance. When the distance between a person and a state of affairs grows sufficiently large, a different type of treatment is called for, and I introduce the notion of moral taint to describe the moral status of agents in these situations.<br>

Abstract: This essay posits the conceptual rudiments of "rhetoric of narrative." Approaching contemporary narrative theory according to the classical trivium, the essay explores what and how stories mean and argue. It focuses on the relevance and value of the rhetorical tradition for illuminating distinctive features of a "rhetoric of narrative," showing how a "rhetoric" of narrative builds upon a "grammar" and a "logic" of narrative. Ultimately the essay posits that narratives can be positioned at some point along a continuum represented by poles roughly characterized as "aesthetic" and "ideological," with propagandistic argument lying at the latter extreme. The chief literary example for applying the conceptual distinctions emerging from our investigations is George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.<br>

Abstract: The myth of an economy where nobody could have a predominant position, has lost its credibility. The presentiment of a high risk of social explosion makes companies undertake tentative moral legitimation. Thus, a new paradigm develops according to which the firm has to care for the satisfaction of public interest if "it wants to try to win forgiveness" for misbehavior towards the decorum rules of the atomicity of competition. Thus, there is a wave of "business ethics industry" building up. However, the stock exchange performances considered as ethical, are not different from others! The market does not seem to be able to say why it might be interesting to invest in stock considered as ethical. Moreover, opinion polls reveal a very significant discrepancy between the characterization of "the responsible company" as defined by itself or by notation agencies and, on the other hand, the hierarchy of criteria according to the answers of polled people. When companies and agencies favor sustainable development and good governance, rejecting child labor and so on, polled people consider that the paramount criterion of ethical conduct is personnel management. The problem is right here. Such is the view of a positively critical economist, situated at the point where macroeconomics meets corporate management.<br>

Abstract: From the beginning of his career, sixteenth-century playwright Angelo Beolco (also known as Ruzante, the name of the peasant character he created and played) declared his anguish at the worsening of the peasants' economic and political position. Illegitimate child of the authoritarian patriarch of a minor noble family beginning its decline and (probably) a household servant likely of peasant origin, he appears to have identified with the peasants' exclusion from governing institutions and the blocking of their access to wealth. At first, the Evangelical reform movement, with its emphasis on justice for the poor, appealed to him as an effective instrument for persuading the powerful to correct the situation. That hope having proved illusory, Beolco passed through a rapid evolution of beliefs that calls into question Lucien Febvre's theory of the parameters of religious experience in the Renaissance. The present article explores this evolution.<br>

Abstract: Andrey Bely's novel "Petersburg" (one of the high points of Russian literary modernism and a rough analogue to James Joyce's Ulysses) repeatedly claims that parent and child, being of the same flesh and blood, share an ambivalent identity. At the same time, because the novel opens by invoking a major character's genealogical relation to Adam, the book implies that this kin identity is universal and can be applied to the entire human race. This essay analyzes the role of kinship metaphor in "Petersburg", demonstrating that tropes of parent-child identity facilitate the novel's dizzying metaphoric conflation, that they form a kind of metafictional mirror in which the novel probes its own nature as a work of the imagination, and that Bely's theory and practice of metaphor touch on broader philosophical issues of figure and fictionality.<br>

Abstract: How places are made is at the core of human geography. Overwhelmingly the discipline has emphasized the economic and material forces at work. Neglected is the explicit recognition of the crucial role of language, even though without speech humans cannot even begin to formulate ideas, discuss them, and translate them into action that culminates in a built place. Moreover, words alone, used in an appropriate situation, can have the power to render objects, formerly invisible because unattended, visible, and impart to them a certain character: thus a mere rise on a flat surface becomes something far more-a place that promises to open up to other places-when it is named "Mount Prospect." The different ways by which language contributes toward the making of place may be shown by exploring a wide range of situations and cultural contexts. Included in this paper are the contexts of hunter-gatherers, explorers and pioneers, intimate friendship, literary London, Europe in relation to Asia, and Chinese gardening and landscape art. There is a moral dimension to speech as there is to physical action. Thus warm conversation between friends can make the place itself seem warm; by contrast, malicious speech has the power to destroy a place's reputation and thereby its visibility. In the narrative-descriptive approach, the question of how and why language is effective is implied or informally woven into the presentation, but not explicitly formulated or developed. Ways of making place in different situations-from the naming of objects by pioneers, to informal conversation in any home, to the impact of written texts-are highlighted and constitute the paper's principal purpose, rather than causal explanations, which must vary with each type of linguistic behavior and each situation.<br>

Abstract: It has become commonplace to describe Machado de Assis's characters and narrators as deeper than those of his contemporaries, and his novels as representations more creatively ambiguous than most literary depictions of nineteenth-century Brazil. In this essay I argue that throughout his novels psychological depth is a function of moral imagination; and a troubled moral imagination is a necessary condition for the literary representation of the modern self. Machado's protagonists are able to fashion the public presentation of their selves by imagining alternatives to their origins, desires, and social predicaments. They have in their pasts a burden they need to overcome, and while doing so they find themselves in conditions of freedom and harm. Evil then arises as a consequence of moral dynamism, in so far as it becomes a project for undoing the other. The genesis of a radical conception of free will and evil in Machado's narratives goes back to his translation of Victor Hugo's The Toilers of the Sea (1866). His concern with a more meticulous characterization of inwardness deepens between Iaiá Garcia (1878) and Dom Casmurro (1899), when adopting the structure of a confessional narrative he arrives at a balance between disguised motives (malice), double chronology (nostalgia), and human life as an unfolding, reversible, and self-aware process (metamorphosis). To frame Machado's strategy for depicting moral change, I take from Augustine's Confessions the suggestion that retrospection is the only way of restoring the identity of someone whose self is marked by his or her sense of dissimilarity with the past. Finally, from Kant and Paul Ricoeur I draw the elements for a further consideration of evil as an invitation to think differently about seeing, judging, and narrating human life.<br>

Abstract: In this updated and revised version of his 2008 Society for Business Ethics presidential address, Richard Nielsen documents the characteristics and extent of the 2007–2009 economic crisis and analyzes how the ethics issues of the economic crisis are structurally related to a relatively new form of capitalism, high-leverage finance capitalism. Four types of high-leverage finance capitalism are considered: hedge funds; private equity-leveraged buyouts; high-leverage, subprime mortgage banking; and high-leverage banking. The structurally related problems with the four types of high-leverage finance capitalism converged in something of a perfect economic storm. Explanations for the crisis are offered in the context of the type of the high-leverage finance capitalism system that permitted and facilitated the economic crisis. Ethics issues and potential reforms are considered that may be able to mitigate the destructive effects of what Schumpeter referred to as the "creative destructive" effects of evolutionary forms of capitalism while realizing the Aristotelian economic ideal of creating wealth in such a way as to make us better people and the world a better place.<br>

Abstract: The aim of the present article is to investigate how the passages of the Holy Text regarding natural sciences or the cosmological order of the universe can be read from a hermeneutical viewpoint, in a philosophical rather than a historical, grammatical or stylistic sense; the debated problems of literary and artistic character, and the relationship between Qur'an and science per se, are not involved here. If we assume as a working hypothesis the Gadamerian perspective that 'being, as far as we can understand it, is language', we can accept that the being of God and of the universe are disclosed in Qur'anic language and that the Qur'an becomes the framework of the aletheia (in the Heideggerian sense) of science. This paper utilises the above-mentioned epistemological and hermeneutical key in order to make a first attempt to explore the possibility of a philosophical analysis of the question of science in the Qur'an, and concludes that, although it can sound highly paradoxical, the attitudes of total agreement, partial agreement or no agreement between Qur'an and science are not mutually exclusive, but rather work in parallel at different linguistic levels. ‮الهدف من هذه الدراسة هو بحث کيف يمکن فهم الآيات القرآنية المتعلقة بالعلوم الطبيعية أو النظام الکوني من وجهة نظر منهج تفسيري من ناحية فلسفية لا تاريخية أو نحوية أو بلاغية. لن يتم هنا مناقشة قضايا أدبية أو فنية أو العلاقة بين القرآن والعلم في هذا البحث. إذا افترضنا أن وجهة نظر جادامير (remadaG)، ‮ وهي أن " الوجود، کما نفهمه، هو اللغة "، تعتبر نظرية قابلة للتطبيق، يمکن أن نقبل أن وجود الله والکون يبين من خلال اللغة القرآنية وأن القرآن يصبح إطار الوصول للحقيقة، طبقاً لفهم هيدجر (reggedieH). ‮إن هذا البحث يستخدم علم الحد والمنهج التفسيري من أجل القيام بأول محاولة لاستکشاف إمکانية تحليل فلسفي لقضية العلم في القرآن. وقد انتهى هذا البحث إلى أن التوافق بين القرآن والعلم تاما أو جزئيا أوعدم التوافق لا يعتبر أمرا قاطعا من الجهتين لکنه يعمل على درجات لغوية مختلفة متوازنة.‬<br>

Abstract: This article highlights two features of Qur'anic style and content: duality/opposition and typological figuration, which can be seen as providing a continuous and consistent 'narrative stream' through the Qur'an. It is of some interest that both of these features have been singled out as distinctive of apocalypse as a genre in the study of numerous religious and cultural traditions. As debate on whether or not the Qur'an is a bona fide example of apocalyptic literature quietly continues, the interplay of conceptual and substantive oppositions and dualities is discussed in order to highlight the importance of this prominent feature to both the form and contents of the Book. It is suggested that its function is profoundly related to the typological figuration indispensable to the Qur'anic depiction of, for example, the character of the prophets and therefore prophethood. Whether or not this represents a genuine instance of apocalyptic literature, it nonetheless remains that the prominence of the motif renders the Qur'an susceptible of a reading expressive of something called an apocalyptic imagination. It is hoped that this article succeeds in demonstrating that in fact these apparently familiar subjects are stimulated to new life by considering them as defining, interlocking, structural elements of a distinctive Islamic apocalypse. ‮تبرز هذه الدراسة خاصيتين لأسلوب القرآن ومادته: الثنائية/التقابل وتصنيف النماذج مما قد ينظر إليه على أنه يمثل تيارا مستمرا ثابتا في القرآن. ومن اللافت للنظر أنه قد جرى الترکيز على هاتين الخاصيتين على أنهما يختصان بالحديث عن أحوال الآخرة في کثير من الأديان والتقاليد الثقافية. وفي هذا المقال سندرس التفاعل بين الثنائية والتقابل لکي نبرز الأهمية الأساسية لهذه الخاصية بالنسبة لشکل القرآن ومحتواه. فنحن نرى أن وظيفتها تمت بقوة إلى ظاهرة تصنيف الأنواع في تصوير القرآن لشخصيات الأنبياء ثم النبوة نفسها. والأمل أن ينجح هذا المقال في التدليل على أن هذه الموضوعات المألوفة يمکن رؤيتها على أنها نمط إسلامي فريد في الحديث عن الأخرويات.‬<br>

Abstract: Beckett's aggressiveness in crossing generic lines paradoxically accompanied a keen sensitivity to genre and medium differences that often constrained his writing. My argument here is that this combination of abandon and respect was founded in a recognition not just of formal differences in art but of differences in the ways we think. In the wake of groundbreaking work by Jerry Fodor and Howard Gardner, there has been a great deal of research advancing (and qualifying) a modular conception of how the mind evolved and how it continues to work in modern humans. This work puts new light on both the formal differences between mimesis and diegesis, and on Beckett's approach to these two different ways of rendering narrative. Particularly it makes clear why Beckett should have so radically subordinated character and action to staged diegesis in his later work.<br>

Abstract: How does international interaction shape states' patterns of thought, emotion, and action? This paper examines the processes by which motives and practices feed each other in reproducing historical structures. An artificial intelligence model defines state-subjects as cultures combining special meanings that produce causal attribution, state self-identification, emotions, and action motives. These special meanings are built from subjective cultural categories describing social acts and group character of the self and others. Anger, pride, fear, and relief motivate action. A collection of such subject-cultures may produce a pattern of actions that reiterates the cultures. The model discriminates between those combinations of elements in special meanings which reproduce subjects and historical structures, and those which do not. The meanings discovered in such reproduction analysis can be validated by discourse analysis.<br>

Abstract: Recent debates in International Relations have seen some of the characteristic dichotomies of the discipline under severe and sophisticated challenge. The proposition, for example, that the study of International Relations, is somehow "independent" of mainstream debates on theory and practice in the social sciences is now widely rejected. The disciplines change in attitude on this issue owes much, in the 1980s, to the influences of an as yet small group of scholars who have infused the "third debate" in International Relations with an appreciation for previously "alien" approaches to knowledge and society, drawn from interdisciplinary sources, which repudiate (meta) theoretical dualism in all its forms. Utilizing the sponge term "postpositivism" Yosef Lapid has concentrated on an important aspect of the "third debate," one which has seen positivist based perspectives repudiated in favor of critical perspectives derived, primarily, from debates on the philosophy of science. This paper takes a broader view of the "third debate" in focusing on some of the broader patterns of dissent in social theory that are now evident in its literature. It argues that for all the differences associated with the new critical social theory approaches, theirs is critique with common purpose. Its purpose: to help us understand more about contemporary global life by opening up for questioning dimensions of inquiry which have been previously closed off and supressed; by listening closely to voices previously unheard; by examining "realities" excluded from consideration under a traditional (realist) regime of unity and singularity. Its purpose, reiterated: the search for "thinking space" within an International Relations discipline produced by and articulated through Western modernist discourse.<br>

Abstract: Heidegger's characterization of Dasein as Being-in-the-world suggests a natural relation to environmental philosophy. Among environmentalists, however, closer inspection must raise alarm, both since Heidegger's approach is in some senses inescapably anthropocentric and since Dasein discovers its environment through its usability, serviceability, and accessibility. Yet Heidegger does not simply adopt a traditionally modern, instrumental view. The conditions under which the environment appears imply neither that the environment consists only of tools, nor that what is true of the parts is also true of the whole, nor that an orientation to use—where appropriate—precludes any other orientation. Heidegger's anthropocentric commitments thus do not rule out the possibility of a non-instrumental perspective on the natural world.<br>

Abstract: Twelve years after the genocide, nothing has been forgotten in Rwanda. The country resembles a multiplicity of experiences, words and silences. The aim of the article is to reflect on the representations – or absence of representations – of the past. The approach is based on the ambivalence of any reference to the past. It is not a question of making a judgement in the abstract about the more or less legitimate character of the attitudes observed, but to understand the dynamics at work. The analysis is divided into three parts. The first part recalls the specific aspects of the case under study. The second examines the silences that weigh upon Rwandan society. The third notes the main accounts of the past.<br>

These refugee city dwellers, committed to the fundamental principles of national resistance, the struggle for the right to return and membership in the Palestinian community, are nevertheless driven by relationships expressing their roots and attachment s that place a value on proximity and private property.<br>

Abstract: According to recent analyses, we are said to be witnessing in the West a « naturalisation » of filiation. The present article challenges this hypothesis, based on anthropological and historical analyses of old “parallel” kinships and the new forms of family configurations. It recalls the longstanding reference to nature in the representations and uses of kinship and the existence of a metaphorical and symbolic world characterised both in the past and today by the plurality of meanings given to kinship relations.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to analyse some questions proposed by the debate on the issue of modernity and post-modernity in the context of the philosophy of Leonardo Coimbra, from the reflection on these issues made by Jürgen Habermas in the work
         The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity. Thus, the critique to modern reason, the reflection on the metaphysics, the issues about the relationship between reason and faith, the religious phenomenon, the process of secularization, are our starting point for the questioning and the philosophical understanding that postmodernity makes of these problems The inauguration of this new rationality allows a new questioning about the reason and the world, manifesting the sublime character of its nature, allowing a new reflection, a critique of self-sufficient and self-reflexive reason and recovering another discursive and cooperative form of reason.<br>

Abstract: In the context of the family’s crisis, in addition to the marital failures that produce suffering and inconvenience, there are biases due to controversies, ideological interests and opinions, which originate general and simplistic solutions to complex problems with peculiar characteristics. The article, – according to the commitment of the Holy Father Francisco to mitigate the heavy burden of people in “irregular” unions (where situations of fragility or misery improve stigma of exclusion) – try demonstrate the continuity of the Magisterium Pontifical Council, in which
         Amoris Laetitiaand the reform of the canonical matrimonial process were inserted. Through the study of the answers and the search for solutions that are careful to the hierarchy of truths, the Holy Father pointed out: “to generate personal and personalized processes”; to follow paths of reflection and discreet understanding the conditions of each case; ultimately, to help progress guided by a logic of forgiveness and reconciliation, according to a merciful and encouraging pastoral care. Sacraments and consciences, both sacred, require to be served with truth.<br>

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive firms are composed of multiple communities with specialized expertise, and are often characterized by lateral rather than hierarchical organizational forms. We argue that producing knowledge to create innovative products and processes in such firms requires the ability to make strong perspectives within a community, as well as the ability to take the perspective of another into account. We present models of language, communication and cognition that can assist in the design of electronic communication systems for perspective making and perspective taking. By appreciating how communication is both like a language game played in a local community and also like a transmission of messages through a conduit, and by appreciating how cognition includes a capacity to narrativize our experience as well as a capacity to process information, we identify some guidelines for designing electronic communication systems to support knowledge work. The communication systems we propose emphasize that narratives can help construct strong perspectives within a community of knowing, and that reflecting upon and representing that perspective can create boundary objects which allow for perspective taking between communities. We conclude by describing our vision of an idealized knowledge intensive firm with a strong culture of perspective making and perspective taking, and by identifying some elements of the electronic communication systems we would expect to see in such a firm.<br>

Abstract: The structural analysis of myth is a prime focus of anthropological interest, largely because of the efforts of Levi-Strauss. This paper uses some Levi-Straussian ideas to develop a strategy for myth analysis that I call the non-sense-in-myth strategy (NIMS). The strategy is given a trial run on a well-known and (I believe) much-misunderstood myth: Adam and Eve in Eden. The structure identified has an evolutionary character consistent with many modern understandings concerning the nature of human reality. NIMS, a mediator between Levi-Straussian intellectual leaps and a real methodology, indicates the value of cautious optimism concerning the question "Can structural analysis of myth become a scientific endeavor?"<br>

Abstract: A number of investigators are agreed that the popular medical systems of tribal, peasant, and allied peoples are "effective." Most of the literature closely examining that effectiveness focuses on the ethnopharmacological dimensions of the healing systems and generally ignores psychosocial factors. Recent developments in psychophysiology may offer insights into these neglected areas. The specific idea to be examined here is that successful "general medical treatment," or "symbolic healing," by either the shaman or physician, is based in part on a psychosocial mobilization of the patient's biochemical response system. Moreover, it is argued that to account fully for these processes we must reconceptualize the character of the human organism; a unitary alternative to standard Western Cartesian dualism (mind vs. body) is proposed, based on a model derived from recent research in neuroendocrinology. This model can be the basis for a nonreductionist theory of medical effectiveness needed to account for a series of observations (derived from both anthropological and medical contexts) which seem to transcend the explanatory powers of the traditional reductionist biomedical model.<br>

Abstract: Evil should be characterised as a specific constellation, which results from destructive connections between individual activities and systemic influences. The article shows some important aspects of the structure of evil and prefers the terms of wickedness and obscene coincidences to describe its own character. Therefore, also the division between rationality and affectivity appears as inadequate, because evil has on the one side an intrinsic attractiveness for individuals and is on the other side in modern societies more and more a product of a rationality, which is free from passion. Especially the emotional impoverishment is responsible for the increase of evil, which is demonstrated by two examples. Based on Paul Ricoeur, the evolution of malum can be developed by a short analyse of the relationship between Ethics and Emotions.<br>

Abstract: The essential significance of scientific metaphor lies in applying the general metaphorical theory to specific interpretations and elaborations of scientific theories to form a methodology of scientific explanation. It is a contextual grasp of objective reality. A given metaphorical context and its grasp of the essence of reality can only be valid when the context is continually restructured. Taking the context as a whole, the methodological characteristic of scientific metaphor lies in the unity of understanding and choice, experience and concepts, semantic structures and metaphorical domains, rationality and irrationality. As a form of thinking based on reasons, scientific metaphor plays an important role in invention, representation, explanation, evaluation, and communication. 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𰍀𦐒𶄶𤡇𠁁𢌒𤅸𣕘𙥨𳌤𰍀𸕄𡥇𩜂𵝰𤈒𩦒𠄐𱆅𣎘𩜂𵝰𰍀𠡕𠌇𵊙𷌢 𡙄𵠨𦄦𠀓, 𰀁𧒒𤐘𥄄𙥨𱆁𱆅𣎘𵊙𷌢𰍀𦁁𧡡𵝰𤘅𤠙. 𣐧𦅙𣕅𣑘𵉦𣑔𢌒𰍀𙥨𱆁𵠡𢙙𡉰 𥈦𥕩, 𡒂𦍷𵠡𢙙𰍀𙦁𦀩𷌥𦔀, 𥅥𳀡𲑳𣑐𸕄𡥇𵠡𢙙𰍀𣎄𢌒𡑐𠡔𥈦𥕩𣑔𢌒𦐒𶄶𰍀 𦍷𥤨𤘕. 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𰍀𦁁𧡡𵝰𩌅𤑉𴤠𩘖𠀦: 𩜂𵊙𙦂𶡳𥌡, 𲑣𹕤𙦂𧀐𤕥, 𵠡𠁁𲑧𦔀𙦂 𸕄𡥇𢒕, 𩜂𤘕𙦂𸝐𩜂𤘕𰍀𲑹𙥨. 𠌖𠀦𙥨𱆁𦍷𩜂𰀁𥔒𩜂𰍀𤘅𲔀𤐘𤌵, 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𠡕𦍷 𡑗𦄦, 𴤠𤑉, 𵠨𦄦, 𵞀𠈕𡑐𠄲𧥩𱕡𦁁𸝔𰍀𷌥𵈁𡅑𳀡.<br>

Abstract: Riprendo, ampliando i conte-
sti di riferimento, la complessa
nozione demartiniana di mun-
dus (De Martino 1977:11-282)
che comprende il mondo inte-
riore, come vissuto psicopatolo-
gico e di alienazione, e il mondo
esterno spazio-temporale e sim-
bolico per analizzare il rapporto
discorso-mondo. Mi allontano
dalla nozione di Searle (2001,
trad. it. 2003: 117-137) in cui la
direzione d' aggiustamento ri-
guarda un mondo come real-

invece, a Vernant (1997: 49) il
cui approccio pragmatico con-
duce non solo a moltiplicare i
mondi - mondo esterno comu-
ne, mondo interno del locuto-
re, differenti mondi costituenti
ciascuno il risultato di un pro-
cesso specifico d'interazione e
di transazione-, ma anche ad
individuare senso e finalità dei
discorsi e potenza interazionale

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and theorize the topology of 'vision' in field ecology, a domain considerably different from laboratory work in the physical sciences, and discuss the temporal extension of data-collection practices. Data collection in this field is characterized by widely varying measurements, measurement dimensions and temporal extension of data collection. We present the ecologists' field laboratory as a perceptual machinery with a heterogeneous and heteromaterial topology as it pertains to measures, precision, replication and other material practices. Because of the complexity of ecological fieldwork, considerable co-ordination and articulation work is necessary. Here, tables, tags and labels are central tools to achieve coherence of inscriptions. We topicalize the work that digitizes measurements conducted on lizards and their habitats, and that therefore imposes signs that lend themselves to mathematical and statistical processes. It is only through these digitizing processes that lizards become visible to other (interested) ecologists, most of whom have not seen this particular animal species in person. We thereby contribute in new ways to discussions of the topography and topology of scientific vision, to the relation of measurement to practice, and to the 'adequation' of nature and mathematics.<br>

Abstract: This essay explores the drama of selfhood and the attendant problem of ethics in Brian Friel's Faith Healer. Drawing from the tenets of Freudian psychoanalysis, I scrutinize the protagonist's narrative identity through fissures created by the discrepancy between his story and the other two characters' versions. These crevices register the protagonist's post-traumatic affects for an uncanny home, which, intertwined with his equally uncanny talent to become the place of trauma, compels him to return time and again instead of acknowledging its loss. Symptomatically, in his fixation on an uncanny home in order to disavow its loss, the protagonist sutures his privation, to such an extent that he not only bars memory exchange with other characters, but appropriates them into a master narrative. Given the fact that the three characters' stories are addressed to invisible auditors who converge with the play's actual audience, the healer's final act of authority is limited as long as it is subject to the audience's interpretation of his memory narrative. In its appeal to the audience's decision on ethical justice for the healer's narrative imagination among multiple proposals, this play is an exercise of poetical ethics of memory.<br>

Abstract: After some initial remarks on the ongoing historiographic debates regarding experience as an analytical category, the article first tries to show, through a concise survey of J. G. Herder's essays on Ossian and Shakespeare, that Herder cannot be claimed as a source for the notion of historical experience in the sense of an immediate access to the past, as the theorist of history F. R. Ankersmit has stated. Instead, this article argues, experience can be understood as one of the key terms of Herder's historical view of modernity, whose development he describes as involving a paradigmatic change in the character of human experience itself. For Herder, the shift from primary to secondary experience in the modern historical process results in the necessity of an aestheticization of historiography. In this respect, the article briefly concludes, Herder inspired 19thcentury historians such as G. G. Gervinus.<br>

Abstract: The article resituates Ricur's theory of métaphore vive in the contemporary context of the so-called "cognitive revolution." The latter denomination is highly misleading. There is nothing revolutionary about the cognitivist study of metaphor as a general pattern of thought; just like the discipline of rhetoric that was already on the decline in l8th century Europe, it is conservative in its validation of everyday, ideologically charged language as the model for all language, including that of poetry and art. Riceur’s conception of "live metaphor," on the other hand, does justice to the "revolutionary" character of poetic language, its function of breaking the order of "commonplaces we live by"—and are ruled by. A "poem in miniature," metaphor constitutes the model for any "poietic," creative imagination. Resulting from a clash, disturbing the common everyday language, live metaphor (and poetry in general) projects a world in such a way as to render strange and thus question the world we live in.<br>

Abstract: The question how to situate Dea Loher's drama Manhattan Medea in the Medea reception serves as a point of departure for a discussion of imitation, originality, and the act of copying. In their dialogues, the characters Medea, as in Euripides' tragedy a refugee, and Velazquez, a security guard, reflect on originality and imitation. The article explores the theoretical and self-referential aspects evoked by these discussions and links them with a more general inquiry into the dimensions of interpretation in the arts. The question of originality and appropriation is expanded and problematized through focusing on radical social criticism voiced among others by the drag queen Deaf Daisy. In this context the article also examines the potential of performative signification encountered in Medea's deadly bridal gift, especially in light of Marjorie Garber's remark that "[w]hat gets married is a dress." Transgressive in its form too, Manhattan Medea combines tragic elements and those characteristic of comedy.<br>

Abstract: Among the prominent writers on the Holocaust, Yehiel Dinur, who wrote under the pseudonym Ka-Tzetnik, offers his readers the most horrific, almost unbearable reading experience. This article examines the reader-writer relationship in Holocaust literature by considering whether readers of Ka-Tzetnik’s works are able, in Ricoeur's terms, to appropriate or actualize the meaning of a literary text that discloses a mode of "being-in-the-world" that is intensely unbearable and seemingly inexpressible. Interviews were conducted with a group of people who, through their professions as writer, literary scholar, educator, or historian, are concerned with such issues. Two main responses to Ka-Tzetnik were discerned: Some readers perceive him as so warped by his experiences that his extreme, even "insane", vision actually stands as a barrier between the reader and the reality of the Holocaust. For others, it is precisely the unrestrained portrayal of the insane Holocaust reality that is identified with an unmediated "true" Holocaust experience. The first group of readers does not believe that Ka-Tzetnik’s texts can be appropriated. But the reading experience of the second group can also not be characterized as appropriation: for them Ka-Tzetnik creates a primarily emotional core experience, which cannot be deconstructed to reconstruct or actualize the text in the reader's own terms, in the present. The case of Ka-Tzetnik, therefore, raises the difficult question of whether the Holocaust can be understood through a dialogical process of deconstruction and appropriation, or whether Holocaust literature should offer an overwhelming, totalizing experience in which precisely the inability to deconstruct and appropriate the text ensures the communication of the inconceivable.<br>

Abstract: A formal claim was made in the mid-20th century that the goal of art conservation is to present the artwork as the artist intended it to be seen. Dispute over this claim among conservators and art historians involved differences of perspective on the relative roles of science and art history in the interpretation of artist's intent. A separate but concurrent debate among philosophers, art critics, and literary critics was sparked by publication of "The Intentional Fallacy," a scholarly article discrediting appeals to the intentions of artists and authors in art and literary criticism. In this separate debate, difficulty in the evaluation and application of artist's intent was traced to ambiguity of the term "intent." The author discusses 11 variations of its meaning and puts the issues surrounding artist's intent together in the contexts of art conservation. He also presents more recent viewpoints in the social sciences that associate issues of artist's intent with the role of the artist in the continued existence of the artwork. The writings of contemporary philosophers contribute useful perspectives on the essential nature of art and the autonomy of artworks from their creators. The author finds that the interpretation and application of artist's intent is an interdisciplinary task and that its evaluation in conservation contexts is limited to consideration of distinctive stylistic characteristics that demonstrate the correlated individuality of artists and their work. /// [French] Au milieu du 20e siècle, on prétendait que l'objectif de la restauration était de rendre aux oeuvres d'art l'aspect que l'artiste avait voulu leur donner. La controverse qui s'en suivit parmi les restaurateurs et les historiens d'art suscita des différences de considération sur les rôles relatifs de la science et de l'histoire de l'art dans l'interprétation de l'intention de l'artiste. Un débat séparé mais parallèle parmi les philosophes, les critiques d'art et les critiques littéraires fut déclenché par la publication d'un article érudit intitulé "The Intentional Fallacy," qui s'opposait à cette référence aux intentions des artistes et des auteurs dans la critique artistique et littéraire. Dans ce débat particulier, la difficulté de l'évaluation et de l'application de l'intention de l'artiste provenait de l'ambiguïté même du terme "intention." L'auteur examine 11 significations différnetes de ce mot, et il pose le problème de l'intention de l'artiste dans les contextes liés au domaine de la restauration. En outre, il présente des points de vue plus recénts, tirés des sciences sociales qui associent les problèmes de l'intention de l'artiste à celui de son rôle dans l'existence continue de l'oeuvre d'art. Les ouvrages des philosophes contemporains apportent des perspectives utiles sur la nature essentielle de l'art et de l'autonomie des oeuvres vis-à-vis de leurs créateurs. L'auteur pense que l'interprétation et l'étude des intentions de l'artiste est une tâche interdisciplinaire, et que son évaluation dans les contextes de la restauration doit être limitée à la considération des caractéristiques stylistiques particulières qui démontrent l'individualité corrélative des artistes et de leurs oeuvres. /// [Spanish] A mediados del siglo 20 fue hecha una afirmación formal acerca de que el objetivo de la conservación de arte es presentar la obra para que sea vista de acuerdo a la intención del artista. La disputa sobre esta afirmación entre conservadores e historiadores del arte comprendió diferencias de perspectiva sobre los roles relativos de la ciencia y la historia del arte en la interpretación de la intención del artista. Un debate entre filósofos, criticos de arte y críticos literarios, generado en forma independiente pero concurrente con esta disputa, fue encendido por la publicación de "La Falacia Internacional," un artóculo erudito que desacredita el recurso de apelar a las intenciones de los artistas y autores en las críticas del arte y la literatura. En este debate independiente, la dificultad en la evaluación y aplicación de la intención del artista fue adjudicada a la ambigüedad del término "intención." El autor discute 11 variaciones en el significado de este término, y coloca conjuntamente las cuestiones que rodean a la intención del artista dentro de los contextos de la conservación de arte. También presenta puntos de cista mas recientes en el campo de las ciencias sociales que asocian las cuestiones relativas a la intención del artista con el rol que éste tiene en la existencia perdurable de la obra de arte. Los escritos de filósofos contemporáneos contribuyen con perspectivas útiles acerca de la naturalcza esencial del arte y la autonomía de las obras de arte respecto de sus creadores. El autor encuentra que la interpretación y aplicación de la intención del artista es una tarea interdisciplinaria, y que su evaluación en contextos de conservacíon esta limitada a consideraciones sobre caractéristicas estilísticas distintivas, que demuestran la correlativa individualidad de los artistas y sus obras.<br>

Abstract: Whose perspective is reflected in ethnographic accounts is the enduring problem in bringing ethnographic observation forward in the construction of ethnographies. Both ethnographic research and modes of account display a liminal character that puts this problem in a more organizational perspective on their heterogeneous authority and unites doing ethnography and constructing ethnographies in similar ontological ambiguities arising in the social organization of communication.<br>

Abstract: This paper argues that the question of the relationship between religiosity and mental health has been miscast because both religiosity and mental health have been understood in the discipline from a distinctly modernist perspective. This modernist perspective is characterized by a metaphysic of substances and by empiricism, and it insists that all scientifically interesting relationships must be efficient causal relationships among substances. From this perspective the only legitimate questions revolve around which way the causal arrow points. The paper argues that this framing of the question and the modernist perspective which gives rise to it fail as adequate accounts of either phenomenon and, thus, of their relation. Further, in some fundamental sense the perspective fails to take either religiosity or psychopathology seriously.<br>

Abstract: This essay explores the notion of meaning, particularly as applied to acts of producing and reading texts. The analysis is grounded in principles of activity theory and cultural semiotics and focuses on the ways in which reading takes place among readers and texts in a culturally mediated, codified experience characterized here as the "transactional zone." The author builds on Vygotsky's work to argue that meaning comes through a reader's generation of new texts in response to the text being read. As a means of accounting for this phenomenon, examples are provided from studies illustrating, for instance, Vygotsky's zones of meaning, the dialogic role of composing during a reading transaction, and the necessity of culturally constructed subjectivity in meaning construction. The author concludes by locating meaning in the transactional zone in which signs become tools for extending or developing concepts and the richness of meaning coming from the potential of a reading transaction to generate new texts. "When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean-neither more nor less." (Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass)<br>

Abstract: Beginning in the 1970s there has been a shift in cultural anthropological methodology from participant observation toward the observation of participation. During participant observation ethnographers attempt to be both emotionally engaged participants and coolly dispassionate observers of the lives of others. In the observation of participation, ethnographers both experience and observe their own and others' coparticipation within the ethnographic encounter. The shift from the one methodology to the other entails a representational transformation in which, instead of a choice between writing an ethnographic memoir centering on the Self or a standard monograph centering on the Other, both the Self and Other are presented together within a single narrative ethnography, focused on the character and process of the ethnographic dialogue.<br>

Abstract: In this article, I reflect upon and attempt to understand the changing theoretical nature of post-World War II Anglo-American economic geography. In particular, I contrast the kind of theorizing that first occurred in the discipline during the 1950s with the very different kind now carried out under what has been called the "cultural turn" or the "new economic geography." I argue that, during this transition, not only did the use of specific theories alter, but the very idea and practice of theorization also changed. I characterize the phases of this movement by using the terms "epistemological" and "hermeneutic theorizing," defined on the basis of works by pragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty and science studies writer Donna Haraway. I argue that "epistemological theorizing" best describes the first period of theorization in the discipline around the quantitative revolution of the late 1950s and early 1960s, and that it is bound by the quest for accurate (mirror) representation. In contrast, hermeneutic theorizing describes the kind of theorizing found in the new economic geography, marked by an interpretive mode of inquiry that is reflexive, open-ended, and catholic in its theoretical sources.<br>

Abstract: I discuss several conceptual problems raised by current understandings of political violence, especially as they pertain to actions, motivations, and identities in civil wars. Actions "on the ground" often turn out to be related to local and private conflicts rather than the war's driving (or "master") cleavage. The disjunction between dynamics at the top and at the bottom undermines prevailing assumptions about civil wars, which are informed by two competing interpretive frames, most recently described as "greed and grievance." Rather than posit a dichotomy between greed and grievance, I point to the interaction between political and private identities and actions. Civil wars are not binary conflicts, but complex and ambiguous processes that foster the "joint" action of local and supralocal actors, civilians, and armies, whose alliance results in violence that aggregates yet still reflects their diverse goals. It is the convergence of local motives and supralocal imperatives that endows civil wars with their particular and often puzzling character, straddling the divide between the political and the private, the collective and the individual.<br>

Abstract: There can be ethical understanding of organizational policy issues and that is important. However, there can be policy understanding about what the organization should do without understanding of individual level responsibility. There can be cognitive understanding of both policy and individual level ethics responsibilities and that is important. However, there can be cognitive understanding without affective, emotive concern. intellectual understanding without affective concern can lead to understanding without motivation. There can be cognitive understanding and affective concern and that is important, but not enough. There can be cognitive understanding and affective concern without effective political method. An action-learning approach to organizational ethics can join cognitive understanding of policy and individual level issues with both affective concern and effective political method. Joining of cognitive understanding, affective concern, and effective political method can stimulate and enable ethical character.<br>

Abstract: Shaftesbury's deism, widely representative of eighteenth-century liberal theology, may be profitably viewed as a reaction against Puritanism in particular and Pauline theology in general. Seen from this perspective, it implies, without explicitly asserting, a reduction of moral standards from the infinite conception of moral law characteristic of Protestantism. Shaftesbury showed no appreciation of the need for redemption or forgiveness, and changed the emphasis in religion from devotion to God above all else to a purely anthropocentric morality which God merely supported. But, in spite of the crudity of his theology and the dubious implications of his ethics, Shaftesbury sought to combat some of the harmful psychological effects to which Paulinism might lead when received in the wrong spirit, and manifested genuine religious insight in this effort.<br>

Abstract: An account of character is developed on the basis of Ricoeur's philosophy of the will. Particular attention is paid to the role of the bodily involuntary in the process of character-formation. This augments the interpretation of the moral meaning of sanctification developed by Hauerwas. When interpreted in light of corporeality, sanctification entails not only a perceptual transformation but also an affective change in the agent's value orientation, the competent retraining of the agent's emotions, and the gracious triggering of an adoptive disposition toward the agent's incarnate situation. Finally, the rootedness of character in embodiment, with the attendant problem of automatism, indicates the limits of the usefulness of an "ethics of character" for moral theology.<br>

Abstract: Stanley Hauerwas, in developing what he calls "an ethics of character," discusses the importance of vision, imagination, and community for the shaping of character by means of "stories." Hauerwas convincingly argues that if persons are to be Christian disciples, they must allow their own way of life to be shaped by the story of Jesus' life. What Hauerwas does not undertake to explain is how the literary impact of stories (where vision, imagination and community become operative) affects the shaping of character. In this essay, I will demonstrate how the literary impact of one type of story, viz., the parable, can affect the shaping of character.<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo expone los principales resultados de una investigación realizada con el objeto de analizar el papel que cumplen las emociones colectivas en el mantenimiento del orden social. En concreto, trata de explicar el hecho de que las noticias más importantes que aparecen en los medios de comunicación sean noticias de horror, es decir, noticias en las que la muerte siempre aparece en el primer plano de la escena. Los informativos de los medios de comunicación expresan y fomentan la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. Ahora bien, para entender esta cultura es preciso determinar previamente la naturaleza emocional del horror, así como establecer una definición sociológica de este sentimiento. El horror es una emoción compleja compuesta por sentimientos de terror, de asco y de conmoción. El horror, sociológicamente, puede entenderse como "la emoción mediante la que un orden social señala sus límites más extremos". El estudio concluye señalando que existen dos modos alternativos de mantener el orden y la cohesión en el seno de un sistema social. El primer modo de legitimación, característico de las sociedades centrípetas, funciona mediante la gran potencia atractiva que ejerce sobre el campo social un núcleo central de valores sociales positivos. El segundo, característico de las sociedades centrífugas, funciona mediante la gran potencia repulsiva que ejercen sobre el campo social las transgresiones flagrantes del orden moral. El modo típico en el que las sociedades centrífugas regulan el orden social explica la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. /// This article sets out the main results obtained from a research study carried out for the purpose of analysing the role that collective emotions play in maintaining social order. In specifíc terms, it attempts to explain the fact that the most important items of news that appear in the media are news of horror, in other words, news in which death always appears in the foreground. The news programmes of the media express and encourage the culture of horror that is characteristic of our advanced societies. However, in order to understand this culture, we must first establish the emotional nature of horror and also establish a sociological definition of this feeling. Horror is a complex emotion made up of feelings of terror, disgust and shock. Sociologically speaking, horror can be understood as "the emotion through which a social order indicates its outermost limits". The study concludes showing that there are two alternative ways of maintaining order and cohesión within the bosom of a social system. The first method of legitimation, which is characteristic of centripetal societies, works through the great power of attraction it exerts over the social field of a central nucleus of positive social values. The second, which is characteristic of centrifugal societies, works through the great power of repulsion exerted by flagrant transgressions of moral order over the social field. The typical method in which centrifugal societies regulate social order explains the culture of horror that is characteristic of our advanced societies.<br>

Abstract: The view of language is greatly changed from early modern philosophy to later modern philosophy and to postmodern philosophy. The linguistic question in early modern philosophy, which is characterized by rationalism and empiricism, is discussed in this paper. Linguistic phenomena are not at the center of philosophical reflections in early modern philosophy. The subject of consciousness is at the center of the philosophy, which makes language serve purely as an instrument for representing thoughts. Locke, Leibniz and Descartes consider language from a representationalist point of view. To them, language itself is idealized and represents thought as if it were thought representing itself. Like the structural linguist Saussure, the founders of phenomenology and analytical philosophy give much attention to the logical or static structure of language, and stick up for the representationalism of early modern philosophy. However, their successors refuse to accept this attitude, meaning the final collapse of representationalism. /// 从早期现代哲学到后期现代哲学再到后现代哲学，在语言观上产生了重大的 变化。早期现代哲学以唯理论和经验论为典型形式。语言现象没有成为该时期哲学 反思的中心问题; 意识主体处于哲学的中心，这使得语言仅仅充当着表象思想的工 具。洛克、莱布尼茨和笛卡尔都从表象论的角度看待语言，在他们那里，语言本身 被观念化了，它们表象思想，就像思想在表象它自身。正像结构语言学家索绪尔一 样，现象学和分析哲学的创始人关注的都是语言的逻辑结构或静态结构，他们延续 了早期现代哲学的表象论，但他们的后继者拒绝接受这种态度，而这意味着最终突 破表象论。<br>

Abstract: J. Robert Oppenheimer was among the most important and enigmatic figures in 20th century science. He is best known for successfully directing the Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan at the end of World War II. Subsequently, he became a scientist and statesman who advised the United States government in the areas of atomic weapons development and public policy. He later became subject to an investigation in 1954 into his previous political affiliations and his personal behavior that ended in the revoking of his security clearance. This essay seeks to chronicle Oppenheimer's coming of age as a public intellectual with a view toward his own psychological history and most especially in relationship to the stages of faith development articulated by James Fowler and colleagues. Moreover, though not conventionally religious, Oppenheimer's life and thought were permeated with themes and ideas of a religious and ethical nature that shaped his adult character and informed his view of the world. This essay was originally presented at The Richardson History of Psychiatry Research Seminar at Weill Cornell Medical College.<br>

Abstract: Memory brings the past into the present. It is a feature of human temporality, contingency, and identity. Attention to memory's psychological and social importance suggests new vistas for work in religious ethics. This essay examines four recent works on memory's importance for self-interpretation, social criticism, and public justice. My focus will be on normative questions about memory. The works under review ask whether, and on what terms, we have an obligation to remember, whether memory is linked to neighbors near and distant, how memory is related to justice and forgiveness, and whether memory sits easily with the kind of relationships that allegedly characterize life in democratic public culture.<br>

Abstract: The role of narrative in explanation has received considerable attention in most of the disciplines concerned with questions of historical process, including history, geology, psychoanalysis and palaeo-anthropology. Archaeologists, however, have been curiously reluctant to consider the proposition that their reconstructions of the past are fundamentally narrative in character. An argument is put forward for the serious study of narrative in archaeology, and three case studies from the prehistory of the New Guinea Highlands are presented in support: a brief review of the debate over the impact of sweet potato on Highland society; an analysis of the changing interpretations of the Kuk Swamp agricultural site by Jack Golson; and a summary of the role of indigenous narratives in accounting for the history of wetland drainage amongst Huli speakers in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea.<br>

Abstract: The author suggests that all research is narrative. Resituating all research as narrative, as opposed to characterizing narrative as one particular form of inquiry, provides a critical space for rethinking research beyond current dualisms and bifurcations that create boundaries that limit the capacity for dialogue across diverse epistemologies. The contemporary bifurcation of research as either quantitative or qualitative, or as scientific or nonscientific, has resulted in a master narrative of research which assumes incommensurability across paradigms. The author weaves 3 questions through this research: (a) What is lost when narrative and science are constructed as opposing and incommensurable modes of inquiry? (b) How might scholars reconceptualize inquiry outside a binary framework that privileges science? and (c) In what ways can resituating all narrative as inquiry open spaces for dialogue across multiple epistemologies that is the heart of democratic inquiry? The author concludes by suggesting that narrative is not a method, but rather a process of meaning making that encompasses 3 major spheres of inquiry: the scientific (physical), the symbolic (human experience) and the sacred (metaphysical).<br>

Author(s): Mead W. R.<br>
Abstract: The paper considers the map and the milieu of Europe. Five distinguishing characteristics are discussed. Special attention is given to the "states system" of Europe, the intensity of the boundary network and the increasing tendency from the point of view of human geography to treat the continent as divided rather than as unitary. The first post-war generation of British geographers tended to neglect Europe in favour of North America. Sweden and France have been important in restoring the connection. Those whose research focuses on European topics will encounter bibliographical, linguistic and other problems; but these will be offset by the cordial working relationships among European geographers which, as among colleagues in the English-speaking world, seem to spring from the nature of the subject itself.<br>

Abstract: Since its first publication, A Costa dos Murmúrios has attracted the critics' attention to the paradox of the explicit denial of its own authority over the historical facts that are part of the narration and its implicit, if qualified, affirmation of the same authority. This article also focuses on the sort of subliminal tension but from the angle of the literary construction of emotions, rather than examining either the poetics of historiographic metafiction or the role of memory in the narration of the past. Analyzing various aspects of A Costa dos Murmúrios (such as the predominant points of view, the structure of the narrative, the disintegration of the characters' identities, the emotional impact of a few vivid scences, the personalization of national events), a case is made for reading this novel as an intimate chronicle of historical facts.<br>

Abstract: Le titre de « Juste parmi les Nations » est décerné depuis 1963 par l'État d'Israël afin d'honorer la mémoire des non-Juifs « qui ont risqué leur vie pour venir en aide à des Juifs » . Le « Juste » reçoit un diplôme et une médaille par un représentant de l'Etat hébreu lors d'une cérémonie publique où les individus « sauvés » et leurs « sauveteurs » , ou leurs descendants, sont réunis. Cet article étudie comment, à travers cette cérémonie, s'effectue un bricolage entre des « mémoires » véhiculées par des institutions et des individus, Juifs et non-Juifs, résidant en France et en Israël. Comment s'explique le recours à une seule et même pratique de rappel public du passé par des individus dont les récits des souvenirs peuvent diverger ? The title of « Righteous among the Nations » has been attributed since 1963 by the State of Israel to honor « the high-minded gentiles who risked their lives to save Jews » . Each nomination goes with the gift of a medal and a diploma to the nominee during an official ceremony. This public event gathers « rescued people » and « rescuers » and members of each family. In this article, the author studies how, through this ceremony, a « patchwork » between different and plural memories can take place. In a common place and time, the different actors crosses institutions, individuals, Jews and non-Jews, living in France or in Israël. How can we explain the use of a single common practice of remembrance by individuals whose social characteristics are different and whose narrations of the past diverge from each other ? Der Titel « Gerechte(r) unter den Nationen » wird seit 1963 vom Staat Israel verliehen, um an Nicht-Juden zu erinnern, « die ihr Leben riskiert haben um Juden zu helfen » . Der/die Gerecht(e) erhält von einem Vertreter des Staates Israel im Rahmen einer Zeremonie und im Beisein der « Geretteten » ein Diplom und eine Medaille verliehen. Dieser Artikel geht an Hand einer Analyse dieser Zeremonie der Frage nach, inwiefern durch die Übertragung von Erinnerungen der Individuen und Institutionen — jüdische und nicht-jüdische, französische und israelische - ein Patchwork von Erinnerungen entsteht. Im Vordergrund steht dabei die Frage, wie der offizielle Rückgriff auf lediglich eine Vergangenheit zu erklären ist, wo doch von einer Verschiedenheit der Erinnerungen auszugehen ist ?<br>

Abstract: L'idée de laïcité n'est pas soustraite à l'histoire. C'est pourquoi il est illusoire de postuler son sens dans l'absolu. Aujourd'hui, comme en d'autres époques, sa valeur politique tend à se polariser sur une opposition binaire entre une acception libérale et une acception anti-libérale dite républicaine. Toutefois, trois traits semblent particuliers aux années 1990 : — une disjonction entre l'acception politique dominante de la laïcité et sa force juridique, gagée par la Constitution et cadrée par des instruments juridiques internationaux ; — l'orientation nationalitaire du débat, pointant vers les populations issues de l'immigration musulmane, et questionnant leur appartenance à la nation ; — enfin, l'inscription du débat dans la problématique globale de la modernisation des formes scolaires, laquelle véhicule à la fois une epistemologie constructiviste et interactionniste, et une éthique laïque ef libérale. Les « affaires de foulards » sont un analyseur de cette complexité. Secularity concept must not be taken away from history. So it would be illusory to think about it as an abstract notion. Presently, as in older times, its political value tends to be focusing on a binary opposition between a liberal notion and an anti-liberal, so-called republican one. However three characteristics are specific of the nineties : — the split between main political meaning of secularity and its strength in legal terms, provided by the Constitution and by international legal tools ; — a debate focusing on nationality issues, with questions related to national belonging or muslim immigrants ; — last, the integration of this debate into the global issue of school modernization, which is concerned with a constructivist and interactionist epistemology and a liberal, secular ethic, as well. « Headscarves cases » are an indicator of this complexity.<br>

Abstract: As the twentieth century comes to an end, and with it a millennium, there has been much heated reflection on the passing age and the period of transition. Among the many characteristic phenomena of modern times, globalization has attracted particularly much attention. The process of European integration may be traced back to ancient times (vide Roman imperialism or Carolingian universalism). Recently, however, globalization has expanded and it has accelerated considerably. The author of this paper focuses on the current, paradoxical coexistence of global tendencies toward integration on the one hand and very clearly manifested, diversifying (or even separatists) national and nationalist tendencies on the other hand. The author analyzes these homogenizing tendencies at the level of media pop culture on the one hand and the increasing, even acute, awareness of diversity, including the diversity of national cultures, on the other hand. She does so within the framework of the symbolic culture concept. Contemporarily, tendencies toward globalization are suspended between the Scylla of uniformizatdon and the Charybdis of diversity. Sociology is particularly qualified to study these phenomena, at both local and universal levels.<br>

Abstract: Françoise de Graffigny's mid-eighteenth-century play Phaza features a main character who is unknowingly crossed dressed as male. The text provides a rich starting point for exploring questions of gender identity and performance. This article situates Phaza within the fairy-tale tradition in which women authors played a major role. Its analysis draws upon philosophies of narrative identity and theories of gender to show that identity comprises both permanence and performance. Reading Graffigny can make an important difference in our understanding of gender, authorship, and relations between the sexes in Enlightenment France. Phaza's masquerade sheds light on the ways in which women authors of the era approached and assumed various gender identities. Eighteenth-century texts like Phaza reveal a lineage of ideas that continue to influence feminist thought today and will do so in the future.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo propõe uma interpretação do fenômeno Chico Xavier na cultura e na sociedade brasileira. A partir do reconhecimento da importância cruciai de seu modelo mítico de espírita exemplar, o lugar de absolute destaque ocupado pelo médium mineiro na história do kardecismo brasileiro será interpretado à luz de urn código cultural articulado em sua biografia, que busca sintetizar os personagens paradigmáticos do "santo" e do "caxias". Desdobrado na unidade de sua obra mediúnica e trajetória pública, o tipo de espiritismo construído em Chico Xavier evidencia a proposta kardecista dominante ao longo do século XX, enquanto modelo de cidadania, prática religiosa e projeto nacional. The present article is a reading of the place of the phenomenon Chico Xavier in the Brazilian culture and society. Starting from the recognition of his crucial importance as a mythical model of exemplary spiritualist, the absolute prominence of the medium in the history of the Brazilian spiritualism will be interpreted in the light of a cultural code articulated in his biography, that synthesizes the Brazilian mythical characters of the "saint" and of the "caxias". Unfolded from his life and works the model of spiritualism built by Chico Xavier evidences the kardecismo's dominant religious point of view along the 20th Century, while citizenship model, religious practice and national project.<br>

Abstract: O artigo procura discutir a contribuição da perspectiva antropológica para a análise de conflitos, contrastando a ênfase da Antropologia na pesquisa empírica com a orientação predominantemente doutrinária que caracteriza o Direito. Dialogando com textos de repercussão significativa na Antropologia do Direito, o artigo realça a importância da dimensão simbólica dos direitos, caracterizada como aspecto central do universo empírico investigado, e sem a qual demandas por direitos, acordos e decisões judiciais não podem ser adequadamente compreendidos. The article makes a brief assessment of the contribution of Anthropology's perspective to the analysis of conflicts, contrasting Anthropology's emphasis in empirical research with the doctrinarian approach that predominates in Law. Drawing on significant texts in the Anthropology of Law, the article highlights the symbolic dimension of rights, characterized as a core aspect of empirical data, and without which demands for rights, judicial agreements and decisions cannot be adequately understood.<br>

Author(s): ZookAbstract: "The Budget" is a newspaper which has served Amish communities for over a hundred years by disseminating community news to Amish settlements across North America. The main feature of this newspaper are newsletters written by volunteers from local Amish settlements, called "scribes," who report news and happenings from their church districts. In this study the generic characteristics of the newsletters are identified, as is their role in the reproduction of Amish cultural values. The newsletters display generic consistency demonstrated in the predictable location, form, and content of the components of the newsletter. Scribes' reports of community news report events which are central to maintaining the importance of the interpersonal basis of Amish community life, and serve to maintain those items as reportable and noteworthy topics in the Amish communicative economy.<br>

Abstract: Although today much of the Mayo-Yoreme sacred myths and their inherent symbolism is rather esoteric knowledge, known to a few only, the community's performance of the responso (ritual of honoring the dead) is important for the re-establishment of relationships between humans and the supernatural beings and between living persons and the ancestors. The communal experience of the responso and the sense of beingenjoined are characteristic of the spiritual experience and fundamental to the musical experience as well Since life/death of any individual is an experience tied to other individuals, I argue that a philosophical inquiry of selfhood—of both the individual and the community—may help us reason about and make possible an understanding of the responso.<br>

Abstract: Critics have pointed out that in many contemporary cities wasteful modes of consumption, encouraged and facilitated by fantastic developments in technology, have significantly eroded the values of the traditional urban environment. Contemporary cities very often lack the sense of placeness, vibrant public life, and harmonious relationship between man and nature characteristic of the traditional urban environment. This article studies how the configuration of the physical boundary may be used as an important tool to reconstitute these values in contemporary cities. It suggests that the boundary is more than an abstract pattern of lines. Rather, it is integral to life within the city, and should possess greater significance in the design of the built environment.<br>

Abstract: Because Hobbes is understood to be a proto-liberal thinker, a great deal hinges on how we understand his writings. Does he contribute to the development of a purely secular political self-understanding, as many liberals today claim? And, by extension, does that mean that liberal thought today best stands on a purely secular foundation? What, then, should we make of the extensive theological speculation throughout his Leviathan! Here, I argue that to reconcile the seemingly purely secular claims in Leviathan with the obviously religious claims found there we must move beyond reading him in terms of what I here call 'the fable of liberalism', and comprehend Leviathan as a whole in terms of Reformation era debates between Protestants and Roman Catholics about the limits and purview of reason. Understood in that way we see his claims about 'reason' in a new and important light. Rather than being an inevitable development that comes to supercede honour and glory, as the fable of liberalism suggests, 'reason' is seen to have an historically contingent character, whose parameters are established by wagers about the meaning of religious experience.<br>

Abstract: This paper analyzes the presenter in advertisements by means of a theoretical framework drawn from literary criticism. The paper adapts literary theory to explore the advertising "who" -- the presenter of a message. It turns to dramaturgy and narratology theory to formulate a trichotomy of advertising "points of view" -- first-person narrator, third-person narrator, and dramatic character. The formal and functional properties of each are discussed with advertising examples. Advertising consequences are illustrated with examples taken from Advertising Age's "Best Advertising of 1989" compilation. These are discussed in terms of media patterns, message strategy, and overall communication objectives. The discussion also suggests the need for additional research to understand hybrid and parody forms.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we attempt to show the fruitfulness of the theory of communicative action for memory studies. Specifically, we intend to demonstrate that concepts characteristic of the discipline, such as "history," "memory," and "dialogue," reflect three types of universal validity claims: "memory" formulates claims to authenticity, "history" formulates claims to truth, and "dialogue" formulates claims to Tightness. Thus, it is possible to introduce a seminal Habermasian notion of rationality that rests on validity claims. This notion can serve to integrate, enrich, and identify blind spots in memory studies. Our purpose is to demonstrate the relevance of collective memory to social cohesion (cultural reproduction, social integration, and socialization) and the public sphere (its development and atrophy, rationalization, and colonization).<br>

Abstract: This article investigates the role of conversion in character reformation. It begins by exploring the initial formation of character in infancy and childhood, as well as challenges to the initial formation of character in adulthood. It then delineates the role ofconversion in character reformation by showing that an individual's encounter with a selftranscending conceptual universe may alter his or her self-identification. This alteration may be expressed as the individual's capacity to "tell a new story" about him or herself. This article argues that a shift in self-identification and self-narration lies at the heart of a reformation of character.<br>

Easley, Sam Greenlee, Chester Himes, Blyden Jackson, William Melvin Kelley, John O. Killens, Warren Miller, Julian Moreau, Chuck Stone, John Edgar Wideman, and John A. Williams as examples of black power sf. It focuses in particular on their inability to imagine a post-revolutionary future, and the strategies they adopt in place of more conventional sf techniques of extrapolation-such as refusal, immanentization, veil-rending, and pornotopianism-in order to narrativize the problem of what Walter Mosley has characterized as breaking the chains of (white) reality.<br>

Abstract: The article is intended to indicate how the study of written and cultural texts may be used to approach the problem of identifying the system of thought characteristic of particular groups. Certain premises of what may be called an “interpretative paradigm” have been selected to create a theoretical starting-point, and in this context the most suggestive appear to be the concept of culture developed by symbolic anthropology, the cultural-semiotic concept of text and the multi-dimensional hermeneutic approach to textual intepretation. The author therefore seeks to bring together, in addition to the general features ofinterpetative ethnology, certain theoretical and methodological starting-points derived from the three approaches mentioned. One may approach the problem of understanding of a foreign testimony via “adequate interpretation”. Here, to understand means to adopt the cultural “language” of a message as one's own, and to interpret and so transfer the unknown into an accessible code, most often one's own code. The process of interpretation is understood as the discovery of the hidden content behind the apparent stirface, and in this activity the understanding of culturally remote testimony is axiomatically taken to bepossible and communicable. In a broader epistemological context we can see in adequate intepretation one of the means to the never-ending process of correction of our pre-judged knowledge. In a spirit of critical rationalism we could deflne such interpretation as the working hypothesis that may be falsified by further Scientific activity and then replaced by a better theory. Such conclusions on the methodological range of the interpretative approach indicate only one of the possible syntheses of various epistemological paradigms, for the theoretical use and application of which ethnology seems especially suited.<br>

Abstract: The study ’The meaning of action, the action of meaning’ raises the theoretical question of the relationship between the intent and meaning, the self-referentiality and referentiality of the literary text. It sets out from the hypothesis that a literary text has not only a self-referential, but also a referential character. Unlike non-literary texts whose function is their intent, the referentiality of a literary text is open. The ambiguity and polysemy of the text then results from the non-obviousness of reality itself. The concept that captures this difference between literary texts and texts with other functions is that of meaning. The study uses the concrete example of the thematicisation of the metamorphosis of a puppet, a monster or an animal into a man in Kleist, Collodi and Grass to illustrate the difference between mechanical intent founded upon efficiency and living meaning, founded on ambiguity and non-functional complexity. An analysis of Pavel Vilikovský’s novel Kôn na poschodí, slepec vo Vrábroch (’Horse Upstairs, Blind Man in Vráble’) shows how, in its thematic, ostentatiously self-referential action, meaning is born as an expression of the polysemic re fe re n tia lity of the text. The analy sis shows that behind this self-referentiality the text is also created in the referential action of meaning to such an extent that it is precisely the open action of meaning which becomes the r » on-obvious sense of the action of the text.<br>

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Abstract: This paper argues that the analysis of culture and mass communication should be regarded as central concerns of sociology and social theory. It develops a framework for the analysis of culture and shows how this framework can be applied to the study of mass communication. Focusing on the medium of television, the paper highlights some of the distinctive characteristics of mass communication and examines some of the factors involved in the production, construction and reception of media messages. It is argued that this approach enables the analyst to pose questions concerning the ideological character of mass communication in a new and more fruitful way.<br>

Abstract: In July 2004, a young woman claimed that she had been attacked on the Paris urban railway system by four Maghrebins and two Africans and that the discovery that she might be Jewish had intensified the character of the attack. For a number of days, the French media were dominated by the case and leading politicians condemned it. The events drew attention to a number of issues concerning culture and identity in contemporary France and the role played in constituting this identity of history and memory. However, it also displayed how the constitution of identity is a selective process in which different elements may be dealt with, either in different ways or omitted altogether. This article explores how in attempting to come to terms with the legacies of anti-Semitism, other areas of history and memory have been neglected, including the legacy of France's colonial empire, and, in particular, her relationship with Algeria.<br>

Abstract: In this article, a young man's narratives of violence are analysed, and a culturally shared storyline is identified as the basis of these narratives. It is argued that the stories are organized so as to construct a preferred self-presentation. One strategy to achieve this is to establish boundaries for what type of violence to use, whom to fight, where and for what reasons. I also argue that the narratives are structured to avoid being categorized as either victim or perpetrator, although both categories are drawn upon. Issues of masculinity are made relevant through categorization of the characters in the narrative, and positions are made available. Different masculine categories such as the hero/villain/non-man become relevant in the analysis. Different gendered positions are used in negotiating a masculine identity around narratives of and through telling about violence.<br>

Abstract: Defined as "an act of cognition that schematizes two semantic fields and simultaneously effects and denies their rapprochement," metaphor as it appears in Lycidas is subdivided into three types, quantitatively distinguished. Ornamental metaphor is the minimal unit, consisting of a single metaphoric equation. Structural metaphors operate over larger poetic blocks, typically the extended clause. Governing the entire poem, the Lycidas/King metaphor bridges the real and fictitious universes in a metaphoric act characteristic of the pastoral elegy genre. Cutting across this three-tiered classification scheme is another typology based on metaphoric conjunction among the semantic features Human/Non-Human and Abstract/Physical. Accompanying tables present the results of the analysis.<br>

Abstract: Fictionality is an immanent—though not exclusive—quality in literary texts, whatever their mode or genre. However, the property of fictionality is generally not mentioned in connection with lyric literary texts. Possible-worlds semantics helps us to envisage lyric texts as capable of generating fictional worlds: that is, poetic fictional worlds. Such worlds have a special character due to the texture constructing them. Some aspects of this uniqueness may be seen in the poetic world of Martin Codax, a thirteenth-century Galician jongleur.<br>

Abstract: Narratology may be thought of as a complicated system of conceptual filters that enact a severe formalist reduction upon the corpus of what may be thought and said about storytelling. According to Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, this reductiveness needs to be expanded in order to attend more to language. One way of answering to her reformist prescription is a turn to the study of linguistic surface structure organized as a meditation on the metaphor of the filter. For Seymour Chatman this metaphor designates a character through whom a narrator elects to tell a story. For Max Black, "filter" is a trope for metaphoric process. Examining these senses of the filter in Henry James's short story "The Beast in the Jungle" leads to emphasis upon negations and belief qualifiers. In James's story, both turn out to be invaded by the logic of Freudian negation, itself a type of intrapsychic filtration.<br>

Abstract: The difference between literal and figurative language becomes evident by comparing the Dutch novel The Journey of the Customs Officer to Bentheim (1983) by Willem Brakman with Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. Certain passages in the Dutch novel can be read either as literal or as metaphorical descriptions. The reader having a reading attitude which activates that frame of "reality" which is strictly separated from the frame of reference called "fiction and representation" will read crucial passages in this novel figuratively. The reader for whom fiction and reality are inseparable and situated on the same ontological level will read them literally. Both reading attitudes, the modernist aqd postmodernist ones, are personified in the two main characters of the novel. This twofold reading implies a critique of Hrushovski's descriptive method for the analysis of metaphor which is used throughout this paper. If the position of frames of reference is undefined in his theory, in his interpretive practice it becomes clear that for him frames of reference are situated in the text. Yet The Journey's ambiguity as to whether one or two frames is applicable undermines this position. It is up to the reader to differentiate or not hierarchically between reality and fiction.<br>

Abstract: La personnalité, l'activité et l'œuvre de Gonseth peuvent être interprétés organiquement dans une instructive pédagogie de dialogue. L'auteur évoque a) la structure dialogale intime de Gonseth, b) les dialogues peu fructueux qu'il a entretenus avec le Cercle de Vienne, puis lors des Entretiens de Zurich, c) les dialogues qu'il a imaginés dans Les mathématiques et la réalité entre trois personnages: Parfait, Sceptique et Idoine, auxquels vient s'ajouter à la fin le Nouvel Idoine, d) les rencontres avec les néo-scolastiques à Rome, e) la «doctrine» explicite du dialogue exposée dans La loi du dialogue. L'auteur s'interroge aussi sur les conditions d'un dialogue fécond et sur les obstacles qui peuvent s'y opposer, (en particulier: l'incompatibilité des référentiels). Gonseth the man, his life and his work can be interpreted organically in an instructive account of dialogue. The author treats the following topics: a) Gonseth's intimate dialogical structure, b) the fruitless dialogues he had with the Vienna Circle and then at the Entretiens de Zurich, c) his imaginary dialogues in Les mathématiques et la réalité between the characters Perfect, Sceptic and Appropriate, and finally New Appropriate, d) his contacts with neo-scholastics at Rome, e) the explicit 'doctrine' of dialogue presented in La loi du dialogue. The article is also concerned with conditions for a fruitful dialogue and with obstacles that can stand in the way (in particular, the incompatibility of reference systems). Die Persönlichkeit, die Aktivitäten und das Werk Gonseths können im Rahmen einer lehrreichen Pädagogik des Dialogs einheitlich interpretiert werden. Der Autor erörtert a) die intime Dialogstruktur Gonseths; b) die wenig fruchtbaren Dialoge, die er mit dem Wiener Kreis und während der Zürcher Gespräche führte; c) die Dialoge dreier Figuren, die er in Les mathématiques et la réalité in Szene gesetzt hat: Perfekt, Skeptiker und Geeignet, zu denen sich am Schluss der Neue Geeignete hinzugesellt; d) die Begegnungen mit den Neo-Scholastikern in Rom; e) die explizite «Doktrin» des Dialogs, die in La loi du dialogue dargelegt ist. Der Aufsatz stellt auch die Frage nach den Bedingungen eines befruchtenden Dialogs und nach den Hindernissen, die sich ihm entgegenstellen können (im besonderen: die Inkompatibilität der Bezugsrahmen).<br>

Abstract: A flood of research literature on 1 Corinthians over the last fifteen years suggests an understanding of this epistle and of the ethos of the church in Corinth that resonates closely with issues in our culture today. The ethos of "secular" Corinth still heavily influenced the church in Corinth. It encouraged attitudes that today we associate with consumerism, postmodernism, and social construction, together with an overpreoccupation with autonomy, success, audience-pleasing rhetoric, and a "local" theology. The church sought to choose its own leaders, its own ethics, its own socio-political value-system, and its own criteria of spirituality. However, Paul sets forth a formative understanding of the cross; an understanding of the Church as one, holy, catholic, and apostolic; a Christomorphic re-definition of "spiritual" and of the Holy Spirit; love and respect for "the other"; and the gift-character of grace and resurrection. How does this relate to hermeneutical distance and appropriation?<br>

Abstract: This article addresses how a perceived tension between the spontaneous personal and the shared textual elements of religious language is resolved in the context of Pentecostal services recorded at two Assemblies of God (AG) churches in California and Michigan. In an analysis of pray er and the metapragmatic commentary that surrounds it, I argue that the balance between spontaneously created prayer and invocation of fixed text plays on an opposition that goes beyond ritual or religious language; rather, it is best understood as characterizing two opposing text-building or entextualization strategies. Using evidence from AG prayer, sermons, and songs, I show that the preferred entextualization strategy highlights the situatedness of the text in a particular context and as emanating from a particular speaker. My findings have significance not only for research on religious language, but also for further understandings of entextualization and the discursive means of constructing personhood and affect.<br>

Abstract: In Arendt's interrogations of political modernity, the concepts of history and politics have an ambiguous relation. On the one hand, she insisted that the performative character of politics as action was bound to its narrative aspect as remembrance. She was also a fervent proponent of integrating the historical sense into political understanding. On the other hand, Arendt characterized the modern historical sensibility from the point of view of politics as a "ghastly absurdity," and asserted that the political thought of our times needed to free itself both "from history" and "from thinking in historical terms." This paper explores the different meanings that Arendt granted to "history" as a (anti) political force and to historical sensibility as the basis for political understanding. It argues that not only were Arendt's rejection of the modern concept of history and its politics of history central for her critique, but that it was one of the key concerns that shaped the articulation of her own theory of action. The paper also examines the problem against the background of the intellectual tradition of Arendt's youth and in particular its uncompromising antihistoricism.<br>

Abstract: This article analyses the difficult relation between anthropology and history. The point, therefore, is to show how anthropology conceptualises the past differently from history as a discipline. Beginning with the differences between anthropology and history in terms of the concept of time, the article highlights that while for history time is concrete, objective and exogenous to human beings, for anthropology it is characterised by its being condensed, collectively subjective and endogenous. By analyzing actual examples, the article shows that the anthropologist is not interested in the past per se, but rather in the past as a dimension of the present. Accordingly, actualised, revised and manipulated history as well as the role of the past in the present need to be taken into account. Consequently, history and the past have their own specific efficiency because they are also a form of knowledge and social resource mobilised by single individuals or groups to find their bearings and act accordingly in the present and likewise to plan the future.<br>

Author(s): WOLICKA ELŻBIETA<br>
Abstract: The article of Elzbieta Wolicka is consecrated to the consideration of the phenomenon of time taken in the contexts of individual human experience, contemporary cultural situation and Christian faith. The starting point of the 1st part of the article is the fragment of Confessiones (ch. XI) of St. Augustine and the short parable of Franz Kafka entitled HE. The author of the article brings to the light the dialogical basis of the human perception of time and raises up the quaestion of "a hidden sabotage of trust" which is characteristic to the social relations of our times. This is also the one among many other factors of the so called "crisis of culture" (mal du siècle). The crisis consists of a feeling of a threat, a burden of the past and a fear of the future. The 2nd part of the article is concerned with the analysis of the eschatological meaning of some words of Christ in the Gospel of St. John (4, 23; 5, 25-29; 12, 13; 12, 27, 31). They reveal the Christian sense of the human temporal condition in the light of "the economy of salvation" and the dialogue between a believer and God. A catastrophic thrill, a feeling of existential paradox, a blockage of communication - the symptoms of the crisis of cultural conscience - could be described as "the edipse of God" (M. Buber) or "the abandonment of God" (J. Ellul) in the contemporary world. The Gospel points out that in the heart of human temporal experience there is still existing conversatio sacra and the presence of God in our history is actual.<br>

Abstract: Ethnomethodology captures ordinary events in ways that retain their dynamic and collaborative character. Ethnomethodologists identify people's methods for developing a practical objectivity that can render their local affairs meaningful and orderly, and they closely scrutinize the local details of mundane affairs in order to describe how a local cohort of cooperating parties concert themselves in providing an intelligibility for their social interaction, local work that is naturally occurring and depends upon the reflexive character of any emerging sense.<br>

Abstract: Several debates arose in the nineteenth century on the status of women in India in the context of determining an appropriate colonial policy on such matters as "sati" which were seen to mark the depressed position of women in society. The reform of these practices was held to be part of the regenerating mission of colonisation. The most sensational and the first of these debates concerned the outlawing of "sati". The literature on "sati" (and on social reform) of the period has largely adopted the framework of modernisation theory. The paper argues that the characterisation of the official debate as one between 'preservationists' and impatient westerners obscures a number of important issues. For instance, rather than argue for the outlawing of "sati" as a cruel and barbarous act, officials in favour of abolition were at pains to illustrate that the abolition would be consonant with the principle of upholding tradition. By treating the debates on "sati" as a discourse and examining its production the article contests the conclusions on "sati" drawn by colonial officials.<br>

Abstract: Seeking to understand the manifest in relation to the implicit and the unstated-the unconscious of the conscious-this paper focuses on the elusiveness of social consciousness in a transitional colonial society with a rich heritage of its own. The issue chosen for examination is that of widow marriage and the period is confined to the last three decades of the nineteenth century. Progressively convulsing the upper caste, mainly middle class, Hindu society, the issue was one that epitomised the interplay of conflicting emotions, values and ideas that characterised men's consciousness about women during this seminal phase of Indian history.<br>

Abstract: Studies of laboratory research in the natural sciences have shown the significance of crossexperimenter dialogue in the determination of scientific facts. Behavioral and social scientists have largely ignored that role in the construction of scientific facts. A dialogic data base differs epistemogically from strict behavioral observations because of its retroductive and dialectic character. Its symbolic nature calls for hermeneutic efforts designed to achieve and assess consensual rather than empirical validation. Its ultimate aim is social organization rather than prediction and control. In view of this distinction, experimental research of human behavior must show the integration of the empirical and dialogic bases of behavioral data so as to more accurately reflect its constructive nature.<br>

Abstract: This essay analyzes Carver's incorporation of African American characters into his short stories. Considering moments of black and white interaction in Carver's stories both enables a fuller understanding of the function of race in his writing and provides an examination of the many ways discourses of race shaped by white Americans' ideas about blackness were embedded in 1970s and 1980s America.<br>

Abstract: Ritual studies is a new discipline within the field of the study of religion. Liturgical theology is, in the West, a recent development within the Held of systematic theology. The article describes each and indicates ways in which they may contribute to the work of the other while retaining their separate identities. The development of methods for describing and analyzing ritual action may enable liturgical theology to construct its own analyses upon a more broadly phenomenological base. At the same time theology's insight into the history of liturgical action may enable ritual studies to overcome an excessively synchronie perspective and to attend to the normative character of ritual gesture.<br>

Abstract: Starting with Raglan's suggestion that Falstaff may be a "holy fool" and with Auden's belief that he is a comic symbol of charity, this essay explores the medieval tradition of wise fool, and especially Falstaff's always canny use of biblical allusion. His various jests, if read in relation to the political action of the main plot, reveal him as characterizing England's time of day and parodying the unchristian behavior of Hotspur, Henry, and Hal. By the time he dies mumbling Psalm xxiii to an uncomprehending Nell Quickly, there have accumulated many hints that he is, in fact, a candle to his age, a professional Fool with the heart of a faithful Lazarus, and destined to join Mowbray in Abraham's bosom. The merriment for which readers have found him lovable amid his masquerades of vice has its mysterious basis in his covertly Christian understanding of England's neo-Roman Caesars.<br>

Abstract: Modern critical theory is commonly thought of as a collection of diverse methods, schools, systems, and approaches. There is, however, a significant pattern in the diversity. This pattern is generated by the conflict between the widespread effort of twentieth-century theorists to make criticism scientific and the internal resistance to that effort presented by the hermeneutic impulse. The scientific tradition is characterized and unified by a set of common theoretical principles and by a common sequence of transformations that each school within it undergoes. The result of these transformations is that every proposed scientific model for criticism changes into an interpretive method and the project of scientific criticism is subverted.<br>

Abstract: The fortunes of epiphany indicate both recent historical disparities within literary criticism and current cultural disparities between academic and popular discourse. The contextualist practice of Wordsworth and Joyce, in contrast to the purist theory that arose with the New Criticism, suggests that epiphany is a narrative device underscoring the historical and cultural construction of character. This conception is borne out by the original Epiphany, in Matthew, which manifests divine personality to human eyes through an episode of cultural difference and accommodation. Robert Browning's historicist poetry uses comparable but secular means of manifesting personality. In his dramatic monologues "Karshish," "My Star," and " 'Transcendentalism,' " epiphanic themes serve as measures of their speakers' cultural construction. In discerning the relative differentiae that characterize such speakers, Browning's readers encounter their own relativity to interpretive conditions. As these examples imply, the modern literary epiphany ultimately effects the hermeneutic manifestation of the reader.<br>

Abstract: Recent studies on the interplay of written texts and oral performance have shifted away from "intrinsic" models of literacy and orality in favor of approaches that emphasize the ideological, social, and historical character of oral and literate practices. In keeping with this trend, I discuss how and why a minority religious community in Sulawesi (Indonesia) has incorporated writing and related textual practices into its tradition of ritual song performance.<br>

Abstract: This paper is a preliminary exploration of a neglected area in sociology of religion. It aims to interpret and to characterize the distinctive performative basis of Christian liturgy. Ambiguities in liturgical enactment can be routinely handled as long as they relate to the nuministic content of the rite and not to its social form. Silence is a distinctive non-reducible phenomenon of rite that can be related to the regulation of ceremonial form through tactful management of the implicit. Liturgies work on the basis of an apophatic characteristic that makes them distinctive as religious rituals.<br>

Abstract: Deconstruction has become a theme in various strands of geographical research. It has not, however, been the subject of much explicit commentary. This paper elaborates on some basic themes concerning the relationship between deconstruction and conceptualizations of context, with particular reference to issues of textual interpretation. The double displacement of textuality characteristic of deconstruction is discussed, followed by a consideration of the themes of 'writing' and 'iterability' as distinctive figures for an alternative spatialization of concepts of context. It is argued that deconstruction informs a questioning of the normative assumptions underwriting the value and empirical identity of context.<br>

Abstract: This article explores a paradox - the simultaneous cultivation and suppression of "healing dramas" by pediatric rehabilitation therapists. Dramatic moments are defined as ones in which the routine exercises and treatment activities of therapeutic practice are transformed into narrative plots. These improvisational plots involve multiple characters, risks, suspense, and above all, a heightened sense that something is at stake. Experience itself becomes the focus of attention for the patient. Based upon ethnographic research in Chicago and Los Angeles, this article offers an anatomy of two such moments, investigating not only how healing dramas are constructed between patients and healers but how and why institutional discourses and practices invite their abandonment.<br>

Abstract: Psychoanalytic anthropologists assume that folktales often reflect unconscious beliefs and attitudes of listeners, who can tolerate anxiety-provoking images and messages (perhaps wish fulfillments) because these have been projected at a safe distance into the characters in the story. Here I argue that our theory for how such a process occurs is inadequate in terms of contemporary psychoanalytic theory. We need to reexamine a number of questions for which we may have assumed we already have answers, including the nature of repression and how it is accomplished; who or what "hears" an unconscious idea that has been collectively repressed when it is expressed in a folktale; and whether Freud's structural model of id-ego-super-ego can provide an adequate theoretical framework for understanding how unconscious ideas find their way into "expressive culture." I examine these questions in light of a folktale collected among Brazilian peasants. I conclude by questioning the central importance of the ego in repression, and propose a concept of a whole, or supraordinate, self to describe the actual agency in charge of repression.<br>

Abstract: Notions of gender have a givenness for most people as they are rooted in fundamental assumptions about the underlying meaning of reality. In Buddhist Thailand, gender notions can be shown to derive from sources that formulate a Buddhist world view. In this paper it is maintained, contrary to the argument of some scholars, that Thai Buddhist culture does not relegate women to a religiously inferior status relative to men. Rather, both males and females who understand the world in Buddhist terms face the same problem of attachment to the world, although the characteristic tension between worldly attachment and orientation toward Buddhist salvation is expressed for females in gender images that are different than those for males.

Abstract: In their interpretations of magical acts and utterances, anthropologists frequently argue that magic and technology are informed by two different kinds of logic, the former "expressive" in character, the latter "instrumental." A close analysis of magical hunting songs used by the Aguaruna of Amazonian Peru reveals that the songs are part of a general ordering process that encompasses the strategic use of thoughts, speech, objects, and acts to achieve practical ends. In Aguaruna thought the expressive imagery of magical songs is an instrumental tool that shapes events in the performer's world.

Abstract: The flight of Voyager 1 past Saturn in 1981 provides an occasion for a semiotic comparison of reports in French newspapers (Le Monde and Libération), a popular science article (in, La Recherche), and specialized scientific articles in Nature. The texts differ in the distance supposed between reader and writer, in the treatment of human and nonhuman actors, in characterization of the event and assumptions about readers' interest in it, and in their narrative structure. The analysis shows that popularizations and specialized scientific articles are not related in a simple dichotomy or scale and cannot be explained by a notion of the "general public"; rather, the various types of texts must be considered in terms of more complex relations between what are called in semiotic terms the enunciator and the enunciatee.<br>

Abstract: This article proposes that Romantic sonatas exploit in their formal structures multiply directed temporal narratives, comprising a temporal stream and various other streams that can be broadly characterized as
         atemporal. The temporal stream articulates the principal sonata trajectory and correlates with the concept known in structural narratology as thefirst narrative; the atemporal streams reside on alternate temporal levels and remain external to, or disengaged from, that of the first narrative. The structural and expressive implications of this opposition, together with the view of sonata-formal conventions made available in recent work on Sonata Theory, provide a framework within which the article explicates Chopin’s robust dialogue, in the first movement of his Piano Sonata in B Minor, Op. 58, with Classical German-Austrian sonata conventions and contemporary Romantic aesthetic currents. The reading provides a foundation for reassessing Chopin’s work in the sonata genre, the norms and expressive potential of which he is often thought of as never fully apprehending.<br>

Abstract: This article focuses on the last two novels by Adolfo Couve, La comedia del arte (1996) and Cuando pienso en mi falta de cabeza (La segunda comedia), posthumously published in 2000. The article proposes an allegorical reading of the transformation of the painter Camondo into a wax statue, the protagonist of both novels who later loses his mind. The article argues that the loss of the mind allegorizes a quotidian time, in tune with Couve's world, which spins and repeats itself, closed, without a horizon, a “beheaded” time (lacking future). This allows the possibility to build a coherent sense of a series of narrative forms (which include language, space, time, characters) and that, taken as a whole, show the particular way in which Couve's narrative is built and developed.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the formative role of the World War II experience in shaping politically relevant memories in postwar Italy. Rather than considering the past a legacy or a heritage—something abstract, malleable and susceptible to serving political interests—the focus here is on the meaning-giving power of memories and symbols in the historical evolution. The birth of Italian democracy after the war was preceded by disruptive events that could have divided the nation. This article illustrates how contested and fragmented interpretations of critical events were structured by and through the dimension of cultural memory, which sustained social and political imaginations, eventually shaping characters and outcomes of the Italian political transformation.<br>

Abstract: On the face of it, the legacy of the 1798 rebellion in the northeastern Irish counties of Antrim and Down seems to be a paradigmatic case of “collective amnesia.” Over the course of the long nineteenth century, growing identification of the Protestants of the area with unionism, loyalism and Orangeism, fortified through opposition to the rise of nationalism amongst Catholics, encouraged public effacement of discomforting memories of the mass participation of Protestants, in particular Presbyterians, in republican insurrection. However, the uncovering of a “hidden” (or perhaps relatively low-profile) popular historiography grounded in oral traditions reveals continuous obsessive, though characteristically ambivalent, local preoccupation with remembrance of the rebellion. Acknowledging that forgetting is not the antithesis, but an integral component, of memory, this case study of what appears to be an Ulster
         lieu d'oubliconceptualizes “social forgetting” as the outcome of multi-layered relationships between oblivion and remembering.<br>

Abstract: The longstanding critical refrain that Virginia Woolf's fiction represents a turn ““inward”” to the vagaries of the inner life has more recently been countered with an ““outward”” approach emphasizing Woolf's interest in the material world, its everyday objects and their social and political significance. Yet one of the most curious and pervasive features of Woolf's oeuvre is that characters are so frequently wrong in their perceptions. This essay consolidates the inward and outward approaches by tracing the trope of misperception in Woolf's fiction as well as in her conceptions of the work of author and reader. For Woolf, the modern literary experience derives from the nature of the faculties of perception, the tenuous points of connection —— and disjunction —— between the inner and the outer worlds.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the
         sugyain the Babylonian Talmud that includes the story of the Oven of Akhnai, in BTBaba metzi‘‘a58b––59b, expanding earlier studies by Jeffrey Rubenstein and Charlotte Fonrobert. It shows that two scriptural quotations involving, respectively, David and Tamar, situated in the first part of thesugya, anticipate the subsequent story and clarify how it functions as a ““foundation myth”” of the Beit Midrash (Fonrobert), and, therefore, of male identity (Boyarin). I suggest that the entiresugyaconstructs male identity by way of contrast with two ““others,”” the divine and the female realms, which are excluded from the Law-making process. The danger of verbal wrong, however, reveals the necessity of reintroducing the excluded ““others.”” The text achieves this by recognizing the existence of a transcendent justice, and by making Tamar, a foreign and female character with no access to the Law, a model of delicacy in verbal communication.<br>

Abstract: R. Naḥman of Bratslav's magnum opus,
         Liqutey Moharan, expresses contradictory attitudes toward the value and ontological primacy of books as opposed to living speech. When his discourses are sorted by the date delivered, one can see a specific shift in attitude. R. Naḥman's emphasis on oral expression, in discourses leading up to 1804, is characteristic of Hasidism's shift from the literary approach of Kabbalah toward an orally driven mass movement. Rebbe Naḥman's later emphasis on printed books can be understood in light of his decision in 1804 to embrace the printed book as a mechanism for spreading his ideas, a decision that may have stemmed from his messianic aspirations. Ontologies of orality and literacy are thus exposed as shifting ideological responses to biographical and historical circumstances.<br>

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: In short, it is exposure to the experientially inspired and theoretically casual atmosphere of those early SPEP meetings—where neglected topics and unorthodox modes of thinking and speaking were encouraged in an undisciplined way—to which I owe the most. Of course, SPEP grew up. It has experienced its share of embarrassing upheavals, as the heavy presence of its own versions of the social and political prejudices in the larger culture became too obvious to ignore. But it is now a major event—the four-day anchor for a week-long convention that takes over hotels, runs multiple concurrent sessions, fosters satellite groups, and often follows established lines of discussion. Some even call it the alternative APA. Yet I am sure that as long as lifeworld experience continues to trump whatever it is currently fashionable to say about it, grown-up SPEP will retain enough of its original vitality and intellectual generosity so that another generation of aging academics will have cause to repeat our present thank-yous in another fifty years.<br>

Abstract: No doubt the rise of religion has not only posed a particular dilemma for critical theory but also provided a curious place to end this reflection. Having started my career doing philosophy of religion it is somewhat surprising to meet religion again as I turn to what surely must be at least a later phase of my career. I am reminded of Antonio's line from the Italian film
            C'eravamo Tanto Amati, translated asWe All Loved Each Other So Much: “We thought we could change the world, but the world changed us.” “Philosophers only interpret the world, the point is to change it,” so said Marx. But in a curious way those who would change the world are changed by it.<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: I want to conclude with one more argument from my own work. I have very often argued that philosophers of technology, regarding the expectations of society and their own traditions and habits, may come “too late” to technologies. They too often undertake their reflections
            afterthe technologies are in place. Rather, I argue, they should reposition themselves at what I call the “R&D” position where technologies are taking developmental shape, in think tanks, in incubator facilities, in research centers. Only then can truly “new” and emerging technologies be fully philosophically engaged.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: For, if phenomenology renounces its search for the absolute and for foundations, then it must give up seeing itself as a single and self-contained discourse. The minimal phenomenologist renounces monolinguism and is no longer the master of only one discourse. Instead, he or she must practice a mixed discourse. To do this is to practice diglossia, to become a code-switcher. In its ordinary sense, the practice of code-switching refers to the passage from one language or dialect to another one in the course of a single conversation, for instance, when the conversation moves from an informal to a formal setting or when it moves from one topic to another. But in the phenomenological context, this would involve the ability to shift from a phenomenological discourse to its “others,” whether they might be Freudian energetics, Deleuzian aspects, Badiouan events, and so on. This practice of translation or code-switching has perhaps always been the role of the phenomenologist, if it is accepted that phenomenological reflection does not begin from itself but is nourished by a life that precedes it and gives rise to it.<br>

Abstract: Adopting a hyperbolic perspective is also certainly a way to argue as well as a way to examine other “texts” because it is a trope and figure of thought that reveals those moments within discourse when one is attempting to transcend the bounds of reality because the extraordinary nature of a given situation or subject matter requires the use of an excessive prophetic voice or an ardent polemical exaggeration. As Mileur posits, “The work is a hyperbole, the intersection of other hyperboles, and the subject is, insofar as he can be written about at all, another hyperbole” (1990, 86). Rather than circumventing it, understanding hyperbole as the focus of thought and action can create significant moments of
      inventioas well aselocutiofor the hyperbolist and critic alike. By approaching a particular text, a critical term, and even a piece of criticism itself from a hyperbolic perspective, one might (re)consider and (re)interpret these “texts” as a stretching of discursive limits that leads one toward a re-presentation of the extraordinary—an attempt to communicate the ineffable or transgress the expressible.<br>

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: Elizabeth Bowen subjects both her characters and her readers to the dynamics of nostalgia in two of her novels.
         The House in ParisandThe Little Girlsare unique in Bowen'soeuvrein their use of “structural nostalgia”—a tripartite structure containing a section that takes place in the past put between two sections that take place in the present. Though this structure suggests that readers may simply engage in a nostalgic return along with the characters, Bowen uses it instead to force both her characters and her readers into a conscious examination of both the pleasures and the problems created by nostalgia.<br>

Abstract: In the essay I adopt Tamar Yacobi's “communication model” for settling discrepancies and inconsistencies in fictional texts and use it to demonstrate that the hypothesis of unreliable narration does not necessarily entail only one kind of interpretation. To support this point, I offer the distinction between
         self-deceptiveandother-deceptivenarrating characters, and I argue that some texts constantly cause the reader to hesitate between conflicting interpretations of the narrator as belonging to one of these two types. Such equivocation on the part of the reader is then extended to competing interpretations of the text, in accordance with each type of narrator. The chosen novel for this purpose is Vladimir Nabokov'sLolita.<br>

Abstract: Drawing upon recent ideas from the cognitive sciences, this paper is an interdisciplinary exploration of the representation of consciousness in McEwan's novel
         Enduring Love, focussing on overlapping manifestations of Theory of Mind ranging from altruism to violent pathology. Through techniques such as intertextuality, the use of paratexts, and the juxtaposition of scientific and literary discourses, McEwan constructs this novel as a Theory of Mind creating a demanding and appealing reading experience that mirrors the doubt and uncertainty of the characters as they strive to understand each others' minds. McEwan's deep interest in science and what it can and cannot tell us about human nature is a potent theme inEnduring Love. This article argues thatEnduring Loveexposes and exploits the unique potential of literary narrative to represent our intense desire to engage with other minds, both highlighting the fact that we are designed by nature to read and to misread minds, as well as the capacity of the novel to communicate the raw feel of human experience in a way that eludes scientific discourse.<br>

Abstract: William Blake's poem
         Jerusalem(1804–20), like all Perennial utopias, achieves a dialectical synthesis of the ideal and the actual through the narrative focalization of a religious experience at the level of character, one that is at once transhistorical and universal. By reading the poem through the lens of the Perennial paradigm, we discover that the temporal aspects ofJerusalemare intimately tied to the religious dimensions of Blake's utopian vision. In addition to giving us a new way to understand the well-documented distinctiveness of Blake's religious message, the Perennial paradigm shows Blake's soteriology inJerusalemto be utopian rather than salvationist (that is to say, individual-religious as opposed to collective-political). Because of the ultimately subjective nature of apprehension of the Divine Vision, Blake's utopian thought is not “clearly a forward-directed anticipatory and visionary concept,” as Magnus Ankarsjö has recently argued (15). Blake does not rally the reader towards some “ensuing peaceful millennium” (15) but rather to find enlightenment in the eternal moment. In light of Blake's suspicion of ratiocination, combined with his deliberate use of narrative focalization of Albion's religious vision, readingJerusalemas a Rational utopia grounded in Judeo-Christian of notions of Apocalypse is to miss Blake's core religious message.<br>

Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>

Abstract: Olga Stanisławska's reportage book
         Rondo de Gaulle'a[Charles de Gaulle Roundabout] was published in 2001 by Wydawnictwo Twój Styl in Warsaw. The book describes one woman's yearlong journey across Africa, from Casablanca, to Morocco, through Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Guinea, Congo, Zaire, and Uganda to Nairobi, Kenya. Stanisławska writes about the political, economic, and social issues of numerous African countries. She describes the painful issue of modern-day slavery in Mauritania, the dramatic fate of the Tuareg nation, and recent conflicts in Chad. The book's narrative sometimes merges with objectified, newspaper-style news, but more often ventures into a solipsistic memoir and a warm and sensual portrayal of the various communities the author visits. Stanisławska's actual journey across Africa is complemented by her emotional and literary voyage from the paradise-like plains of the Saharan desert countries to the hellish depths of the jungle in the Congo. She frames her journey, or rather "travels," from Karen Blixen'sOut of Africa(a self-created paradise) to Joseph Conrad'sHeart of Darkness(a self-imposed hell). Both of Stanisławska's journeys–physical and literary–provide a captivating platform for studying her narrative as an unending and deeply empathic encounter with another human being. InCharles de Gaulle Roundaboutthere is a visible tension between the author's need to tell a story and her anxiety that in doing so she may (mis)treat people and turn them into fictional characters, that is, make their stories finite.<br>

Abstract: Characterizing the slipstream genre, Bruce Sterling locates it between mainstream and science fiction; it “sets its face against consensus reality” and makes us feel “very strange.” A strong slipstream candidate is Steven Hall’s
         The Raw Shark Texts(2007). Manifesting as a distributed literary system, the text has as its core a print novel, but other internet and real world sites also contain fragments or “negatives.” One of the text’s two villains, Mycroft Ward, has transformed into an online database; a posthuman subjectivity, he appropriates “node bodies” that upload their information and download new instructions. This separation of content (online database) from form (node body) is, according to Alan Liu, one of the primary characteristics of postindustrial knowledge work. To this extent, Hall positions his narrative not only against databases but also against knowledge that is, in Liu’s terms, autonomously mobile, transformable, and automated, having lost its material instantiation and been pulverized into atomized bits of information. The text’s second villain—a “conceptual shark,” the Ludovician—represents the complete fusion of form and content; the typographical symbols used to describe the shark also comprise its flesh in verbal and graphic representations. The text thus positions its protagonist, Eric Sanderson, as caught between twenty-first-century forms of knowledge and the implosion of signifier into signified. In this sense, the novel functions as a parable for the contemporary human condition, looking toward a posthuman future but incarnated within an ancient biological heritage.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines the role of agency and metatextuality in Élisabeth Vonarburg's B
         ridgeCycle, comprised mainly of a group of short stories originally published between 1977 and 2002 and then revised in their definitive French versions for the collectionLe Jeu des coquilles de nautilus(2003). The cycle's main storyline involves the uncertain journey between parallel worlds by a series of recurring characters. Three intimately linked narrative components—each closely related to certain protocols of reading fiction and of particular interest to science fiction—form the theoretical and analytical bases of this study: the three recurring topoï of the protagonist-Voyager's travels; character agency that in part drives the sense of these realms and their occupation; and the dénouement which gives a certain meaning and closure to the spaces in their diverse manifestations and to the characters who pursue their quests in these spaces. Vonarburg's narratives place their protagonists in a situation precisely similar to that of the reader as she must negotiate the trans-world context, come to grips with her own relative lack of agency, and at the same time seek some level of control through knowledge. Suchmise en abymeallows the author, through the choice of dénouement, to comment on the manner in which this universe and the real one are imagined, represented, and decoded, and on how meaning is conveyed.<br>
