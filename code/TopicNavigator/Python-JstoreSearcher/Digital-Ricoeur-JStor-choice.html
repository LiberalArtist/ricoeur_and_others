  Listening for the Secret from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1p0vkcz">Listening for the Secret</a><br>
  Author(s) Meriwether Nicholas G.<br>
  Abstract: The Grateful Dead improvised—this is a given. Improvisation was a decisive aspect of what made the band special and set it apart from other bands. The band, of course, acknowledged the fundamental role of improvisation in its music—one could say it was part of the bandʹs DNA. Jerry Garcia said, ʺWe don’t improvise out of choice! We improvise because we donʹt have any choice! Itʹs not as though we could play anything exactly the same as we played it last night because weʹre incapable. So, improvisation, for us, is not an option, itʹs our coloration, itʹs our personality.ʺ²<br>

  Book Title: Reason to Believe-Cultural Agency in Latin American Evangelicalism<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Smilde David<br>
  Abstract: Evangelical Protestantism has arguably become the fastest-growing religion in South America, if not the world. For converts, it emphasizes self-discipline and provides a network of communal support, which together have helped many overcome substance abuse, avoid crime and violence, and resolve relationship problems. But can people simply decide to believe in a religion because of the benefits it reportedly delivers? Based on extensive fieldwork among Pentecostal men in Caracas, Venezuela, this rich urban ethnography seeks an explanation for the explosion of Evangelical Protestantism, unraveling the cultural and personal dynamics of Evangelical conversion to show how and why these men make the choice to convert, and how they come to have faith in a new system of beliefs and practices.<br>

  Abstract: I will now bring to bear on my imaginary experiment the traditions of thought in ancient Greece, conveniently labeled “Pythagorean,” that also contained multiple theories of rebirth. Most of the doctrines of rebirth discussed earlier have both historical and contemporary relevance, but for Greece one has no choice but to deal exclusively with the historical traditions, beginning with the figure most associated with rebirth doctrines, Pythagoras. Pythagoras, like similar figures in religious history, is simultaneously a historical and mythic persona such that it makes little sense to differentiate the two. Myth

  Abstract: In this chapter, I will look at autonomy from several angles. First, I’ll consider the familiar social/political idea of autonomy as individual independence, or self-sufficiency. Second, I will spend some time on the influential Kantian concept of the autonomous will and some significant critiques of that concept. Third, having rejected important facets of both previously discussed concepts of autonomy, I’ll explore a possibility compatible with care ethics—that of limited autonomy conceived as choice and responsibility within a certain span of control. Finally, I’ll discuss the connection of critical thinking to what might be called intelligent heteronomy.<br>

  Abstract: “Upon Appleton House, To My Lord Fairfax” praises Thomas Fairfax for his conscience, humility, moderation, and fulfillment of a providential plan, all as part of its overarching occasion: Fairfax’s retirement from public life. We should not be surprised then that it is populated by images of reversal: inverted trees, boats sailing over bridges, and rational amphibii with canoes on their heads. Yet these proliferating inversions offer neither a secret indictment of Fairfax’s choice nor a hopeful anticipation of his return to a military command.

  Book Title: Veiled Desires: Intimate Portrayals of Nuns in Postwar Anglo-American Film-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SABINE MAUREEN<br>
  Abstract: A provocative, interdisciplinary study of nuns on the big screen, from The Bells of St. Mary's (1945) to Doubt (2008), that shines fresh light on the cinematic nun as a woman and a religious in the twentieth century. Ingrid Bergman's engaging screen performance as Sister Mary Benedict in The Bells of St. Mary's made the film nun a star and her character a shining standard of comparison. She represented the religious life as the happy and rewarding choice of a modern woman who had a "complete understanding" of both erotic and spiritual desire. How did this vibrant and mature nun figure come to be viewed as girlish and naive? Why have she and her cinematic sisters in postwar popular film so often been stereotyped or selectively analyzed, so seldom been seen as women and religious? In Veiled Desires--a unique full-length, in-depth study of nuns in film--Maureen Sabine explores these questions in a groundbreaking interdisciplinary study covering more than sixty years of cinema. She looks at an impressive breadth of films in which the nun features as an ardent lead character, including The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), Black Narcissus (1947), Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison (1957), Sea Wife (1957), The Nun's Story (1959), The Sound of Music (1965), Change of Habit (1969), In This House of Brede (1975), Agnes of God (1985), Dead Man Walking (1995), and Doubt (2008). Veiled Desires considers how the beautiful and charismatic stars who play chaste nuns, from Ingrid Bergman and Audrey Hepburn to Susan Sarandon and Meryl Streep, call attention to desires that the veil concealed and the habit was thought to stifle. In a theologically and psychoanalytically informed argument, Sabine responds to the critics who have pigeonholed the film nun as the obedient daughter and religious handmaiden of a patriarchal church, and the respectful audience who revered her as an icon of spiritual perfection. She provides a framework for a more complex and holistic picture of nuns on screen by showing h~<br>

  Book Title: Questioning the Human: Toward a Theological Anthropology for the Twenty-First Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Van Stichel Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology is being put to the test: in the face of contemporary developments in the spheres of culture, politics, and science, traditional perspectives on the human person are no longer adequate. Yet can theological anthropology move beyond its previously established categories and renew itself in relation to contemporary insights? The present collection of essays sets out to answer this question. Uniting Roman Catholic theologians from across the globe, it tackles from a theological perspective challenges related to the classical natural law tradition (part 1), to the modern conception of the subject (part 2), and to the postmodern awareness of diversity in a globalizing context (part 3). Its contributors share a fundamental methodological choice of a critical-constructive dialogue with contemporary culture, science, and philosophy. This collection integrates a wider range of approaches than one usually finds in theological volumes, bringing together experts in systematic theology and in theological ethics. Authors come from different American contexts, including Black and Latino, and from a European context that include both French and German. Moreover, the interdisciplinary insights upon which the different contributions draw stem from both the natural sciences (such as neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and ethology) and the humanities (such as cultural studies, philosophy, and hermeneutics). This volume will be essential reading for anyone seeking a state-of-the-art account of theological anthropology, of the uncertainties it is facing, and of the responses it is in the process of formulating. The shared Roman Catholic background of the authors of this collection makes this volume a helpful complement to recent publications that predominantly represent views from other theological traditions.<br>

  Pressing Questions for Theological Anthropology in the Twenty-First Century from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x00kc">Questioning the Human: Toward a Theological Anthropology for the Twenty-First Century</a><br>
  Author(s) Kirchhoffer David G.<br>
  Abstract: The debate about the relevance of biology for ethics dates back to the time of Aristotle. In premodern theologies, nature and personhood have mainly been considered as two complementary notions. On the one hand, the human person was presented as a unique realization of nature; on the other, the human person fulfilled the assumptions that nature had given to him or her by virtue of his or her free will and the possibility for free choice. In other words, nature opens the possibility for free and responsible action. Since Darwin’s

  Abstract: Whatever else we may know, there is no knowing how to live. Useful as science may be in connection with means, it offers little help with our choice of ends. The laws and customs of each nation provide a framework within which men can accomplish their purposes, but this framework is always subject to correction in the name of some higher principle, be it civil rights, the demands of conscience, the divine law, or what not.

  Author(s) DWYER KEVIN<br>
  Abstract: When ethnographies assume polished form, the process of selecting a field site usually appears to have been a serendipitous alignment of intellectual commitments and affective attachments. The “arrival narrative” begins to take shape in those first days at the field site. As the narrative becomes fixed in the published ethnography, the anthropologist’s cultural connection—that commitment to people and place—becomes naturalized. In retrospect, the relationship can appear inevitable, even foreordained. My choice of field sites had more to do with day care than serendipity.<br>

  Abstract: French culture has long been perceived by the English-speaking reader as somehow more ‘erotic’ than Anglo-Saxon culture. This impression is partly due to the large numbers of pornographic publications which have been imported from Paris since the sixteenth century, first into England and later into the United States, but also to the peculiarly French association of pornography and subversion, hence the fascination that the genre has held for well-known and highly regarded writers from Rabelais to Robbe-Grillet. The choice of modern French (as opposed to any other nation’s) pornography as object of study is, therefore, justified by the unique existence<br>

In best effecting the satisfaction of human needs and of liberating humanity from material want, in proceeding towards ‘the goal of human liberation’ as such, it was not only true to say that some choices in human world-view and behaviour were better than others, but also that one choice was pre-eminent.

  Abstract: The museum is just one element of commemorative public policies and the way war is remembered. In fact, there are many other vehicles for memorialising war besides museums, ranging from social care for war veterans and the management of military cemeteries, to the politics of commemoration (the choice of Remembrance Days, the organisation of commemorative ceremonies) and the erection of physical memorials (wall plaques and tablets; war memorials and large commemorative monuments) as well as the naming of streets. Given all this activity, museums form only a very small part of the way in which memories of war are perpetuated.<br>

  Abstract: The experience of war and occupation profoundly shaped the politics of French intellectuals in the years after the Liberation. The sacrifices and suffering of the war years created a popular “expectation of justice”¹ and a desire for radical social and political change among intellectuals. The wartime division of friend and enemy, resistor and Nazi, between whom no middle ground was possible, brought intellectuals into a Manichean world in which refusal to choose sides became a choice for an intolerable status quo.

  Abstract: The relation between home and food is an essential one. Its ideological power is constantly exhibited in various items of everyday life such as the status of the “homemade” on the food market. That a quiche, for example, is labeled “homemade” at one’s local delicatessen distinguishes it from the mass-produced. It makes it ooze that specifically homely goodness: intimations of sound nutrition, careful choice of ingredients, and careful labor (of love). That is, it becomes a bit of “mother’s cooking”—which, at an important level, is, of course, a continuation of breast-feeding, the most homely of the homely yearnings and<br>

The selection of Jeffers and Snyder delimits an otherwise impossibly large field, and there is some reason to think that the choice is sound since “ecological consciousness seems most vibrant in the poetic mode. The poetic voices of Jeffers and Snyder, so rare in modern poetry but frequently found in primal people’s oral tradition, are a virtual cascade of celebration of Nature/God and being.”¹ We have already argued that Modernism—or,<br>

Though existentialist themes are to be found in Greek thought and in the Bible, the two most influential modem proponents are Kierkegaard (1813-1855) and Nietzsche (1844-1900). In Kierkegaard basic themes include: emphasis on the individual in his concrete particularity as contrasted with the individual conceived as part of a system; general antipathy to systems and rules; emphasis on commitment and choice as essential for real existence: emphasis on freedom as realized in the choices by the individual who in choosing makes himself; despair/dread in<br>

  Abstract: To repair is to make amends. These simple words separate the justice that merely reconciles from the deeper justice of the restorative Christ. Repair describes the work of justice
                  afterreconciliation. The idea emerges from the restorative justice movement and the repair required in the aftermath of genocide in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Bosnia, Cambodia, Liberia, and Uganda. Repair is partly symbolic because nothing—this side of heaven—can mend the atrocities witnessed in such countries during our own lifetime. Mass murder has become the weapon of choice for some regimes. Repair, however, must be pursued. It will be unusually costly.<br>

  Abstract: Jesus’ plans to create a new covenant people who through their lives will witness to the in-breaking hospitality of God’s kingdom begin in a rather inauspicious way. His choice of disciples seems somewhat unusual to say the least. Two sets of brothers hailing from Galilee whose “friendly rivalry” from their lives as fishermen spilt over into this new domain as disciples. James and John had particularly fiery tempers and liked to ensure they came out on top. Also, like other Galileans, their fierce regional loyalty was accompanied by distrust, often extending to an outright disdain, of

  Abstract: The modern quest for a Christian theology without metaphysics properly begins with Albrecht ritschl who sought to separate theology from scholasticism, on the one hand, and the speculative philosophical theology practiced by Hegel, on the other.² Of course, one finds a good deal of theology since then, including Karl Barth’s, that wishes to limit or eliminate metaphysical adventure. Barth himself thought that a theologian could travel through philosophy as a gypsy passes through a foreign land, being in conversation with its people but not accepting their assumptions about life.³ He knew that he had no choice but to use certain<br>

Vanhoozer insists on the sufficiency of the literal sense, while de Lubac insists on the indispensability of the spiritual sense. Vanhoozer develops an elaborate proposal for God’s authorship based on speech-act theory, while de Lubac largely ignores divine authorship and instead focuses attention on God’s sacramental presence in Scripture. Vanhoozer focuses on Scripture’s determinate meaning, while de Lubac focuses on Scripture’s infinite meaning. Yet what the two have in common is their persistent emphasis on God’s<br>

  Abstract: According to many present-day epistemologists, the justification of scientific theories is relative in at least two respects. Whether a specific theory is justified at time
                  tdepends both upon the set E of empirical data available att, and upon the set R of rival theories which are considered by the relevant scientific community at that time. Indeed, a theory is justified at timetif and only if it performs better than its rivals in terms of the accepted criteria for theory choice, and one decisive criterion for theory choice is some version of the criterion of empirical superiority.<br>

Once the novel had lost its traditional vocation, any choice by a writer must be evaluated against its rhetorical effectiveness. Novels can use media for a variety of storytelling purposes, and contemporary writers can appeal to other media to reveal the potential and limits of writing. We have seen how many of these novels thematize the circulation of the media object within the story world to explain the cultural meaning of the medium of writing.

A main contention is that Genette’s separation of voice and mood (who speaks and who perceives) and Genette’s understanding of focalization as a restriction of access to point of view are more radical proposals than previous narratologists have recognized—and that they are in line with unnatural narratology and allow for unnaturalizing reading strategies.<br>

  Author(s): SOROKA MYKOLA<br>
  Abstract: "Whom do our people read? Vynnychenko. Whom do people talk about if it concerns literature? Vynnychenko. Whom do they buy? Again, Vynnychenko." So wrote Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky about the young Volodymyr Vynnychenko. An innovative and provocative writer, Vynnychenko was also a charismatic revolutionary and politician who responded to the dramatic upheavals of the first half of the twentieth century by challenging old values and bringing forward new ideas about human relationships. Despite his inseparable association with Ukraine, what is often overlooked is the fact that Vynnychenko wrote the majority of his works outside his native land following his flight from Tsarist and Soviet tyranny. In this ground-breaking study, Mykola Soroka draws on contemporary theories of displacement to show how Vynnychenko's expatriate status determined his worldview, his choice of literary devices, and his attitudes toward his homeland and hostlands. Soroka considers concepts of identity to study the intertwined experiences of the writer - as an exile, émigré, expatriate, traveler, and nomad - and to demonstrate how these experiences invigorated his art and left a lasting impact on his work. The first book-length study in English on Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Faces of Displacement is an insightful examination of an exiled writer that sheds new light on the challenges faced by the displaced.<br>

Since literary analysis almost always also encompasses formal aspects of works, narratological concepts concerning the structure and forms of a narrative are taken by many as a ‘natural’ choice. Narratologists did not originally see their work as ‘a handmaiden to interpretation’; their theoretically-based taxonomic description of narrative was separated from interpretation, which always also has to do with the content of the narrative<br>

While it is often seen as originating within Christian, and predominantly Roman Catholic, theological circles, it is increasingly practiced by Christians of other denominations and by other religious traditions. And comparative theologians of any one tradition are presented with a seemingly endless possibility of choice in terms of which tradition, which text, or which aspect of that tradition to engage in comparative work. Once other religions are recognized as possible resources for constructive religious reflection and insight, there is no limit to where such truth or insight might manifest itself<br>

  Book Title: Points of Departure-Rethinking Student Source Use and Writing Studies Research Methods<br>
  Publisher: Utah State University Press<br>
  Author(s): JAMIESON SANDRA<br>
  Abstract: Points of Departureencourages a return to empirical research about writing, presenting a wealth of transparent, reproducible studies of student sources. The volume shows how to develop methods for coding and characterizing student texts, their choice of source material, and the resources used to teach information literacy. In so doing, the volume advances our understanding of how students actually write.The contributors offer methodologies, techniques, and suggestions for research that move beyond decontextualized guides to grapple with the messiness of research-in-process, as well as design, development, and expansion. Serviss and Jamieson's model of RAD writing studies research is transcontextual and based on hybridized or mixed methods. Among these methods are citation context analysis, research-aloud protocols, textual and genre analysis, surveys, interviews, and focus groups, with an emphasis on process and knowledge as contingent. Chapters report on research projects at different stages and across institution types-from pilot to multi-site, from community college to research university-focusing on the methods and artifacts employed.A rich mosaic of research about research,Points of Departureadvances knowledge about student writing and serves as a guide for both new and experienced researchers in writing studies.Contributors: Crystal Benedicks, Katt Blackwell-Starnes, Lee-Ann Kastman Breuch, Kristi Murray Costello, Anne Diekema, Rebecca Moore Howard, Sandra Jamieson, Elizabeth Kleinfeld, Brian N.

Vyacheslav Ivanov answers this question in his Dostoevsky book (1932): “Dostoevsky has long since made his choice: his surety and pledge for it is the figure of Christ shining upon his path.”³ The “infallible criterion” for this claim, Ivanov insists, is “the accord between what Dostoevsky had to teach and the living artistic imagery in which he clothed it.”⁴ For Ivanov, “the investigation of Dostoevsky’s religious<br>

  Abstract: In the scholarly literature on Augustine’s writings, few topics have instigated more discussion or debate than his belief about the use of coercion against schismatics and heretics. Many scholars see his choice to use coercion against the Donatists as a deviation from his usual way of thinking. For instance, as Ernest Fortin wrote about the matter: “The peculiar intractability of Donatists, their continued agitating, and the methods of terrorism to which they frequently resorted, had made of them a persistent threat not only to the religious unity but to the social stability of the North African provinces.

  Abstract: As mentioned in chapter 4 within the section, “The Human Good,” Lonergan defines conversion in terms of horizontal and vertical liberty. Horizontal liberty allows a person to make relatively minor choices from a range of options within a fixed boundary or “horizon.” Vertical liberty is the product of a much more radical choice, a leap of self-transcendence that expands or otherwise transforms one’s horizon itself. Sometimes the new horizon, “though notably deeper and broader and richer” than the previous horizon, may still be “consonant with the old and a development out of its potentialities.” However, sometimes a new horizon is<br>

This movement, however, has also been answered with renewed versions of the traditional functionalist and behaviorist rejections of the study of consciousness as anything other than an incidental by-product of computational capacity (Dennett, 1991). Consciousness is seen as private and hence outside scientific scrutiny, confabulated and deluded in its pretended access to cognitive process, and ultimately nonfunctional.

People were no longer expected to accept beliefs as a matter of faith but could confidently expect to have to prove their beliefs according to reason.

It is movement across geographical, national and/or cultural boundaries or differences. So, migration requires difference of some sort. We rarely speak of someone or something as having migrated if no change or adaptation was required, although of course at some level every move is by definition a change.

  Abstract: In classical economic analysis, labor is generally treated as a negative magnitude. It is described restrictively as a “disutility,” an expense of individual energy in exchange for a salary and the consumer goods to which that salary provides access. Leisure and consumer goods are the only sources of satisfaction and individual well-being. Thus labor is reduced to “negative consumption.” When labor is described this way, involvement in the labor market becomes a case of rational behavior and maximization under constraint: The choice to engage in a remunerated activity can be understood entirely as a choice balancing the sacrifice of well-being<br>

Rational and social choice theories—like their economistic prototype—all hark back to a more or less Hobbesian view of the individual as a self-contained actor who is director of his or her own passions and interests, chief among which is, for Hobbes, the fear of death and the corresponding right to flee its approach.<br>

  Abstract: The election of a representative rests on a double logic of distinction and identification. Voters want the person for whom they vote to have the ability to govern. When their choice is guided by recognition of the candidate’s leadership skills and technical competence, it is the logic of distinction that governs. The election is seen as a means of “choosing the best,” and voters implicitly concede that the candidates possess abilities that they do not. But voters also expect their representatives to be close to them, to be familiar with their problems and concerns, and to share their worries and<br>

  Abstract: Nietzsche, as is well known, was trained as a classical philologist, but it is, I think, often insufficiently appreciated that he remained intellectually true to this original choice of professions, albeit in his own highly idiosyncratic way, to the very end of his life. To be sure, from very early on Nietzsche understood “philology” as a discipline that was distinctively “philosophical” both in its method and in its content. The philologist cultivates an art of interpreting ancient monuments of civilization through the exact and subtle reading of obscure and difficult texts, and such practice is the best possible preparation for<br>

  Abstract: There is a wealth of secondary literature on Darwin’s species concept, covering many different perspectives of the topic.¹ Of the various accounts available, I have always been particularly intrigued by Frank Sulloway’s suggestion that Darwin’s choice of species concept was guided by “tactical” considerations. Among those tactical considerations was the decision to employ his fellow naturalists’ species concept, in order to speak to them “in their own language” (Sulloway 1979, p. 37). Implicit in the suggestion is that Darwin was a member of a fairly clear-cut community of naturalists. In order to communicate with them about natural history, either to<br>

  Abstract: In liberal democratic societies, nationalism has long been associated with minorities and opposition to the state. The phenomenon has indeed often manifested itself most visibly in challenges to the central state. The nationalism projected by states, to the contrary, has either remained relatively hidden or has been granted a legitimacy denied to minority nationalist movements. For example, it typically goes without saying from the perspective of states that they may choose an official language for the public sphere and that this choice is therefore obfuscated as a meaningful expression of nationalism. The legitimacy of a similar choice by minority nations,<br>

The Kingdom of God and women were subjects to be included or excluded by choice. Time represents quite another category of omissions that existed by necessity. Yet, that necessity did not exist because, by thinking of events under the aspect of turning wheels—the Wheel of Fortune or Ezekiel’s concentric wheels of prophecy and fulfillment, advancing as they spun—authors negated time.

  Abstract: “Politics,” Michael Oakeshott has argued, “is the activity of attending to the general arrangements of a set of people whom chance or choice have brought together” (1967:112). In light of the extraordinary political changes taking place in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, this view of politics seems rather staid and unspirited. But Oakeshott’s point is worth repeating: as a learning process deeply rooted in the particular historical circumstances of a people, ordinary politics is a matter of intimations. It is the activity of translating and inscribing the allusive fluctuations of everyday collective existence into familiar and routine terms of reference. Politics,<br>

Kuhn’s list comprised such values as empirical accuracy, consistency, scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness (Kuhn 1977, 321–22), which, as he argued, can be seen as constitutive of science.

  Abstract: If there is indeed an implicative asymmetry that could be taken as being primary in the Deleuzian conceptual system, it resides in the distinction between the intensive (or virtual) and the extensive (or actual). What interests me here is the bearing this distinction played in
                  Capitalism and Schizophrenia’s rereading of the two chief categories of classical kinship theory, alliance and filiation. The choice is justifiable in the first place because Deleuze and Guattari’s treatment of these two notions expresses with particular clarity an important displacement that takes place betweenAnti-OedipusandA Thousand Plateaus. Second, the choice also suggests the<br>

  Author(s) Derrida Jacques<br>
  Abstract: Few passages of Sartre’s architecturally complex work 
                  Being and Nothingness are more critical of the existential analytic of Being and Time than those, in the fourth and last part, devoted to “my death.” Heidegger’s summons to an authentic Being-toward-death—to the acknowledgment by Dasein that death is its ownmost possibility—becomes, translated into Sartre’s idiom, the realization of a “project toward death,” the realization of a “freedom-to-die” that allows Dasein to “constitute itself as totality by [its] free choice of finitude.”¹ The idea that death can be the object of such a project [projet] is thus, from the beginning, put<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttsjb1">Documentary Time</a><br>
  Abstract: Jacques Aumont once suggested that any approach to cinema and temporality should involve an initial choice between two possible perspectives: (a) the created space-time of the image or (b) the time of film viewing. The latter corresponds to the fact that images are viewed during a certain period of time and that, to be appreciated, they require the spectator’s gaze. The temporal status of an image depends on a viewer’s attention and, therefore, on the duration of contemplation. Aumont argues that we have to distinguish between these two axes of image-time and experienced time.¹ The

Hegel is certain that its invention can be “no accident.”¹ Frantz Fanon is more interested in knives—the knife held to the throat of the silent Arab prisoner, the knife used by two boys to kill one of their European<br>

  Abstract: The return to Kant is in fact the choice of a single path that brings an end to the tension in the critical project. It is a matter of “returning” to the question of representation as an explication of the relation between a subject and an object. Let’s first of all recall that, from 1810 to 1850, Hegel and his disciples were the main figures on the philosophical scene. Henri Dussort points this out, “From 1800 to about 1840, speculative thought, its famous developers and their disciples occupied the center stage.”¹ Friedrich Engels himself noted that this enthusiasm for the<br>

  Abstract: Humanitarian groups have failed, Fiona Terry believes, to face up to the core paradox of their activity: humanitarian action aims to alleviate suffering, but by inadvertently sustaining conflict it potentially prolongs suffering. In

The author makes the controversial claim that aid agencies act as though the initial decision to supply aid satisfies any need for ethical discussion and are often blind to the moral quandaries of aid. Terry focuses on four historically relevant cases: Rwandan camps in Zaire, Afghan camps in Pakistan, Salvadoran and Nicaraguan camps in Honduras, and Cambodian camps in Thailand.<br>

Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: This first‐rate collection of seventeen original essays, many by prominent feminist philosophers, provides an overview of issues and methodologies at the heart of global feminism and multicultural and postcolonial thought. Sets of essays debate whether global, postcolonial, feminist thinking entails a cultural relativism that precludes talk about universal human rights; provide excellent examples of the method of intersectional analysis; explore the defects of older models of women in development and third world economic development; pay special attention to Latina feminism and illustrations of global, postcolonial theorizing that invoke the North‐South border; offer constructive advice about how antiracist whites might best transform white identity; and explain how problematic empiricist assumptions can be avoided by feminist work relying on narratives of experience and by science. Some articles offer useful overviews, for example, Sandra Harding’s essay on economic development and Ann Cudd’s essay on feminist epistemology. Others, especially the debate over cultural relativism, take original positions. Uma Narayan’s essay is worth the price of the book; she shows how efforts to respect cultural differences often repeat colonial assumptions about “essential differences” and ignore the political history behind a culture’s choice of which practices to treat as defining its Tradition.<br>

Abstract: To the Corinthians, Paul spoke of the “resurrection of the dead.” The locution changed in the context of anti‐Christian polemics. Irenaeus and Tertullian, for example, emphasized the physical resurrection of the flesh; and the controversial background must have been at least partly responsible for the choice of the word
         flesh.52The Apostles’ Creed declares, “I believe in the resurrection of the flesh,” and the belief thus formulated was reaffirmed by later professions of faith. In the fourth century, the Athanasian Creed asserted that all men will be resurrected with their own bodies (omnes homines resurgere habent cum corporibus suis), and theFides Damasi,that we will be resurrectedinthe same flesh in which we presently live (in hac carne, qua nunc vivimus).53<br>

Abstract: 1. Is paradigm the right choice, and have I used it correctly?There is always a risk in adopting a concept that comes from a different tradition. It is even riskier when we fiddle with it and stretch it to fit a set of data for which it was not designed as I have done. But I believe that the risk is warranted for two reasons. The first is that there is considerable confusion within and outside of anthropology regarding the nature of the anthropological study of language. The oscillation mentioned in the article among a number of labels, including linguistic anthropology, anthropological linguistics, sociolinguistics, and ethnolinguistics, is only the most superficial and yet telling example of the widespread lack of clarity as to what constitutes linguistic research from an anthropological perspective. Further evidence of confusion can be inferred from the typically partial and often clumsy attempts to represent the linguistic subfield (or the study of language) in sociocultural anthropology textbooks. I felt that it was time to come to terms with the fact that perhaps those of us inside the subfield had not been communicating to those outside as effectively as we thought we were. I then realized that to address this issue I needed a notion that by its very nature would force us to think in terms of broad trends rather than particular notions or hypotheses. The popular notions of paradigm and paradigm shift seemed to me the perfect candidates; they could force us to think in terms of the major features of our research projects. CookGumperz and Gumperz are right when they write that Kuhns approach gives a sense of structural containment to the flow of ideas that to those living with them appear much more fluid and overlapping. (Their proposal to adopt Holtons themata is a bit cryptic given that his model is not considered an improvement on Kuhns by most historians of science.)

         124Because Braudel, always the schoolteacher, so emphasized his brief against biographical history, critics have often claimed that the delineation of limits and constraints inThe Mediterraneandevalues politics and events and leaves the book devoid of individual freedom.125Such misrepresentations distort the history that Braudel really presented: “The dangers of a social history are clear to us all, and in particular the danger of forgetting, in contemplation of the deep currents in the lives of men, each separate man grappling with his own life and his own destiny; the danger of forgetting, perhaps even of denying, the inimitable essence of each individual.”126For Braudel, the lessons of World War II demanded remembering both the forces acting upon each individual and individual acts freely chosen.127Braudel’sMéditerranéewas a call to arms: “The catastrophes and revolutions, dramas and surprises” of his time revealed “the social reality, the fundamental reality of man … in an entirely new light,” which in turn required a new history, a problem‐oriented and global, total history.128It was a new history slow to be understood, little to be appreciated, and rarely to be practiced in the Anglo‐American world remembering a different past and fighting different battles in the 1950s and 1960s. On the question of individual freedom, however, Braudel’s history of the sixteenth‐century Mediterranean is very similar to the work of its most brilliant contemporary political analyst, Machiavelli. We might recall the wily Florentine exile’s astute judgment when we reread the last words of Braudel’s penultimate paragraph in the second edition: “I would conclude with the paradox that the true man of action is he who can measure most nearly the constraints upon him, who chooses to~<br>

Abstract: Against the act of oblivion described above, I begin by invoking two terms from the rhetorical corpus:
            brevitasandcopia. Brevity or concision is a familiar norm, butcopia,or the capacity for elegant variation and elaboration of a given theme, is not. These terms appear to be mutually exclusive principles, but they are never regarded as such in antiquity. The choice between them is a question of what is appropriate to a particular context or aim. And yet in retrospect the rhetorical tradition can seem heavily weighted in favor ofcopia. Although Erasmus contended, for example, in his hugely popularDe copiathat “no artist will better compress speech to conciseness than he who has skill to enrich the same with as varied an ornamentation as possible,” the work itself was given over, as its title promises, to the techniques of elegant variation.40The concept ofcopia,as Terence Cave has pointed out, was never a technical term in rhetoric, but the popularity of Erasmus’s work suggests why it came in some ways to stand for rhetoric itself.41When other stylistic norms emerged in the revisionist rhetorics of Adam Smith and his successors, the choice forbrevitasovercopiaexpressed an implicit dissatisfaction with the whole system of rhetoric.<br>

Issue: jr.2005.85.issue-2<br>

Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: A comparative theology that acknowledges this correlation of religious ideas with religious activity favors an “inclusivist” understanding of the relationship between the home tradition and others.
      8To the extent that religious beliefs are correlated with specific forms of religious praxis, the theologian cannot help but think about religious reality in the terms set by his or her own tradition. This alliance with an inclusivist position certainly does not mean, however, that comparative theology assumes the unchangeability of the home tradition as that tradition encounters other cultures and faiths. One could in fact argue that this presupposition has already been abandoned by mainstream Christianity. According to Karl Rahner, the abandonment of the presumption of unchangeability defines the transition from the Western church to a truly world church, a process that was inaugurated for the Catholic Church by Vatican II.9The inclusivism of a theology that acknowledges and affirms the changes that a tradition undergoes in interreligious encounter could be termed a “dynamic” inclusivism, as opposed to the more familiar “static” inclusivism characterized by the presumption of unchangeability. This important qualification of the concept of inclusivism points to a feature of comparative theology that distinguishes it from the older, a priori “theology of religions,” namely, its reliance on specific comparisons. Clooney, whose attention to the details of compared traditions is exemplary, insists that comparative theology, as a truly constructive theological enterprise, takes place only after, and in light of, specific comparisons.10Yet, although the particular character of a given exercise in a Christian comparative theology will depend greatly on the particular choice of materials—whether Hindu, Islamic, or Buddhist—brought into conversation with the Christian tradition, it remains a worthwhile task to formulate a general conceptual model of comparative theology.

Abstract: Hence, our choice of philosophies should not be limited to the two main philosophies identified by Budd but rather could take up ideas from process thinking, which is a quieter but nevertheless relevant philosophy to which LIS should attend. By valuing the processes and articulating this with better abstractions more congruent with our action, we not only further our own project; we also sustain a vital engagement with the projects of individuals. We more clearly articulate the library in the life of the user, to use the words of Wiegand [

Abstract: To trouble the categories of biological kinship, Haraway draws on the figure of the vampire. The vampire “both promises and threatens racial and sexual mixing” and “feeds off the normalized human” (
         1997b, 214). Suggestive of violence, pollution, and mixing, the vampire is a figure for the alien, the immigrant, and the cosmopolitan and is embroiled in racism, sexism, and homophobia. The figure of the vampire clearly facilitates Haraway’s inquiry into leakages among kinship categories. Yet like the cyborg, the figure also tends to become, like whiteness, everything and nothing at once. Haraway asks, in response toTimemagazine’s 1993 cover of a morphed portrait of a woman’s face created by a computer mixing of different races, a figure she labels SimEve, “Nothing here is scary, so why am I trembling?” (1997b, 264). In a similar manner, I ask about the figure of the vampire: Everything is so messy, so why am I so suspicious? My suspicion arises from the ease with which Haraway’s use of the vampire allows us to be on the other side of kinship and the dramas of identity and reproduction. As Haraway concludes in her chapter, “I believe that there will be no racial or sexual peace, no livable nature, until we learn to produce humanity through something more and less than kinship. I think I am on the side of the vampires, or at least some of them” (1997b, 265). But where and how, within the specific matrices of racial and gendered/sexual oppression, can vampirism be a choice? I suggest that like the postmodern figure of the cyborg, the vampire, recuperated metaphorically for illegitimacy and racial crossing, can function to metaphorize the specificities of race and sex out of existence and once again make room for universalizing analogy.<br>

Abstract: In sum, the various Christian frameworks for understanding 9/11 that circulated in Mrs. Barrett’s classroom raised a host of troubling implications. The events of 9/11 were perpetrated by human hands, such that the deaths experienced were brutal, and the bodies of those lost, ugly. Those who were “saved,” however, suffered less and died more beautifully, by allowing God to “use” them toward his greater good. God allowed these events to occur in order to widen his presence in the public (secular) sphere and to encourage Americans to embrace Christianity. While God directs history and answers individuals’ prayers, then, God nonetheless enables atrocities like the Holocaust and the attacks on 9/11 to happen. And since all events in history, including 9/11, follow God’s logic and imply God’s approval, whether to act in this world to further the good is an open question rather than an obvious choice for most of the students in Mrs. Barrett’s classroom.<br>

Abstract: This came in the early afternoon of August 21, a very hot Saturday with temperatures between 35 and 40 degrees Celsius (95 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit), when many of the few Sofioters who had remained in the city in August had finally moved to their village or vacation homes. Prime Minister Ivan Kostov came back from his vacation for the occasion, and, together with Speaker of Parliament Yordan Sokolov and assorted ministers, he observed the explosion from the roof balcony of the adjacent building of the National Archives. At precisely 2:35 p.m. a loud explosion caused clouds of dust; but after the dust had settled, it turned out that “the mausoleum, like the Tower of Pisa slightly bent toward Hotel ‘Bulgaria,' had not even cracked.”
         35A second explosion followed at 4:50 p.m., but the building remained intact. Some papers even reported that it had straightened up (fig. 5).36Journalists couldn't resist the humor of the situation. One of them suggested that Vice Premier Bakîrdzhiev call on the North Atlantic Treaty Organzation (NATO) for help; NATO planes should bomb the site, he suggested, and this would not be considered an act of aggression but rather “a peaceful contribution to our civilizational choice.”37Finally, it was decided to dismantle the building mechanically, with the help of smaller detonations. This was finally accomplished during the next few days, and in the late afternoon of August 27 the last debris was removed from the square. The demolition had taken seven days, longer than it had taken to erect the building. For the first time in fifty years, the view from the former king's palace across from the mausoleum was unbroken.

Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: Foucault, however, is articulating the historical situation of what is taken to be true, especially within the context of the power that perceived truth commands and the uses to which it may be put. His is an important observation, but it does not obviate any ethical imperative aimed at seeking truth (in a weak and fallibilist sense). That ethical imperative demands that advocacy also be based in truth and that accuracy and advocacy be contingent upon the quest for truth. Further, an advocacy stance necessitates some conception of “right” and the acceptance that one particular way of looking at an issue is right (or at least closer to right than the alternatives). The stance itself includes a measure of accuracy if it is to be based in some version of truth. The choice of a position of advocacy is one of judgment, and that judgment has to have some foundation. Michael Lynch warns that “if there is no such thing as being right, wrong, or in‐between, then we can’t really disagree in opinion. We may of course still differ in all sorts of ways—in our hopes, fears, and desires. But we aren’t disagreeing over who is right and who isn’t” [
         19, p. 161]. The opinion, then, that “accuracy” is biased and not a sufficient value when placed next to advocacy is itself a claim to accuracy (in the sense of being “right”).<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: This posited, Popkin furnishes a wealth of information on the origins of the historian’s autobiography (Hume, Gibbon, Vico), its nineteenth‐century expressions (Dilthey, Henry Adams), and especially its sociological and literary characteristics during the second half of the twentieth century. Most authors have been white males, from middle‐class backgrounds, nearing the end of distinguished careers. Still, women, minorities (especially Jews), historians of working‐class origin, and middle‐aged authors have made inroads since the 1980s. This produces significant differences: women, for instance, are less likely than men to link their vocation to their teenage interest in history or to depict a nurturing community of scholars. Popkin minimizes, however, the impact of sociology. Commonalities predominate in his analysis. Most historian‐autobiographers, for one, frame their life stories as bildungsroman narratives, in which the author’s personality takes shape through the choice of a vocation. Like Friedrich Meinecke, they tell tales of self‐discovery, free will, and success. Their chronological accounts usually begin with warm childhoods in families that encouraged reading, education, and a thoughtful path toward a meaningful career. They then describe the pivotal apprenticeship and university years, the key mentors, and the decision‐making process through which the authors exercised their will and defined themselves. Theirs is invariably a process of choice rather than conflict or sudden illumination, even if world events captured the imaginations of many budding historians.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: Derrida upholds both injunctions of the tradition in question rather than solely privileging the structurally necessary element of secrecy, which Patočka associates with heretical Christianity, to the detriment of the cognitive element in responsibility advanced by Platonism. Yet his innovative interpretation of the heritage of responsibility consists neither in attempting to mediate between both demands nor in establishing their golden mean. Instead, what distinguishes Derrida’s interpretation of the Platonic and the Christian heritages is, first of all, the recognition that “the relation between the Platonic and Christian paradigms throughout the history of morality and politics” is defined by the “
      aporia of responsibility” (GD,p. 24). Responsibility toward this inheritance is itself aporetic; it excludes the choice of one of the inherited conceptions of responsibility at the expense of the other; that is, it requires that both traditions be simultaneously honored without any mitigation of the radicalness of their demands. The injunctions—on the one hand, of full knowledge of one’s actions, on the other, of secrecy—are mutually exclusive; moreover, we are unable to account for either of them. Thus, no program exists that could prescribe a way out of this dilemma.<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: If, as Koselleck has envisaged, history was elevated as the subject of its own absolute self‐knowledge—history itself a unified history of humanity, imperially gathering up all special histories into the unifying realm of the collective singular—it was also empowered by what Ricoeur calls a “hidden form of the same claim” that could act against its untenable status as self‐knowledge and singular time (
         MHF,p. 305). The historical present, now established as the perspective for all temporal formations, is centered as an absolute. Once the collective singular is discredited in its impossible universalizing mission to singularize the history of humanity, it turns to the singular historical moment, which is the now of the historical present. Even today, it insists on the developmental imperative and its familiar claim of a totalizing history; the “vocables of world history” and the imposition of odious comparisons promote programs of catching up with the parade of the historical present attained by modern Euro‐America (MHF,p. 305). The here and now is henceforth distinguished from times past, to be sure, but also from those different temporalities that exist immanently in the modern present but are hidden from it, as in the there and the then, since it is our time that provides both perspective and tribunal. The here and now of actual experience, our modernity, is our history, our time, and never theirs. The distancing of expectation from past experiences thus becomes the condition of asserting the difference of our self‐valorizing and self‐referring modernity and its superiority over both its antecedents and others. But the decision to shift the concept of modernity to the register of an absolute historical present eventually required misrecognizing the apparent contradiction that our time and place is characterized by its unique difference from others. Moreover, the change of index directs attention instead to generalizing the values our modernity embodies an~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: Both literally and figuratively speaking, Smith’s narrative presents a dramatic departure from the traditional Adamic myth whose “intention is to set up a
         radicalorigin of evil distinct from the moreprimordialorigin of goodness of things.”72Mormonism’s evil is as uncreated and preexistent as is good. Both are always potential to the act, as choice, of the uncreated person. As the attendees to the counsel and, later, earth’s inhabitants, humans must choose between the two plans and their personal fate is decided by their choice. Implicit in this personal struggle is the notion that the power is in these persons not only to discern but also to vanquish evil. This, too, is a central dynamic in Smith’s challenge to traditional Christianity’s theological anthropology. In Smith’s completely original Genesis 1, Moses's experience of the divine at the burning bush is followed by an assertion of his newly realized identity against Satan, who comes demanding to be worshipped: “Who art thou? For behold, I am a son of God, in the similitude of his Only Begotten; and where is thy glory, that I should worship thee?” Moses then summarily dismisses him with the command “Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not.” Subject to Moses's superior power, Satan must comply.73Thus, the agency and power of persons to effect their will, first manifested in the narrative of a heavenly council, characterizes earthly life as well.<br>

Abstract: The individual chapters of the book refer to this critical hermeneutical understanding developed in the introduction and in chapter 1 (in conversation with Reinhold Niebuhr) in different ways by taking up various models from the field of moral psychology and by discussing them critically: psychoanalysis (Sigmund Freud and, in a special chapter devoted to the understanding of generativity, Erik H. Erikson), structural‐developmental theories (Lawrence Kohlberg, Carol Gilligan), Johannes van der Ven’s understanding of moral education and practical theology, evolutionary psychology, feminist approaches, rational‐choice economics, and, throughout the book, the collaborative “Hardwired to Connect” study on “authoritative communities” published a few years ago. In addition, there are chapters with a focus on Christian and philosophical ethics: on Niebuhr and Ricoeur, whose influence on Browning is visible in his whole approach, but also on a number of contemporary ethicists like Martha Nussbaum, Owen Flanagan, Gene Outka, and Antonio R. Damasio.<br>

Author(s): Plate Liedeke<br>
Abstract: “I chose this story above all others because it’s a story I’m struggling to end. … That’s why I write fiction—so that I can keep telling the story. … Always a new beginning, a different end,” Winterson writes toward the close of her narrative (
         2005, 137). Linking the desire for retelling with the inability to formulate a conclusion and the necessity for an open ending, Winterson has Atlas walk away, yet presents this “very particular end not found elsewhere” (xiv) as but one possibility among several, the choice of which is ultimately left to the individual reader’s personal preference: “no one knows its composition,” Winterson observes. “Dark matter could be conventional matter, … or it could even be black holes. Or it could be Atlas holding up the universe. But I think it is Atlas and Laïka walking away” (2005, 151).Weight’s multiperspectival ending underscores its status as inaugural retelling of myth for a twenty‐first century that can only assimilate more pasts into its ever broadening present. In this sense, the Myths seems typical for the contemporary take on re‐vision. Whereas the names of the authors hold the promise of retellings with a critical edge—Achebe having given usThings Fall Apartas a reply to and a thorough undermining of Joseph Conrad’sHeart of Darkness(see Moyers1989; Achebe1990), and neither Atwood nor Winterson is a stranger to rewriting as cultural critique—Winterson’s phrase and its appropriation by the series’ editor make us suspect differently. “We want to tell the story again,” as the series’ editor Jamie Byng puts it on Canongate’s Web site, speaks of the storyteller’s desire for and delight in language; of the pleasure of telling stories, of keeping the stories alive by retelling them. Inevitably also meaning “we want tosellthe story again,” retelling becomes a retailing strategy, promising ever new and improved reading experiences that are as ephemeral as any other consumer experience. Speaking neither of learning from the p~<br>

Abstract: Finally, there are two other authors, John M. Budd [

Budd presents perhaps the most comprehensive analysis to date exploring the intersection of philosophy and librarianship. He traces the development of relevant philosophical movements that have contributed to expanding our considerations of librarianship, and he rejects early attempts to link library and information science with positivism. Budd outlines new ways of thinking about the social and ethical actions (praxis) of librarianship by framing contemporary theoretical constructs in terms of hermeneutic phenomenology. Budd critically analyzes the works of Hans‐Georg Gadamer [36], Paul Ricoeur [37
               None–39], Martin Heidegger [40], and others to argue that “the goal of seeking knowledge, achieved through hermeneutic phenomenology, points to one thing quite clearly—that the actions we engage in LIS, including facilitating information seeking, are inseparable from being, especially as conceived by Husserl and Heidegger” [6, p. 291]. Although his work has been criticized for its uneven treatment of certain ideas and for his choice of philosophers to include or omit from the analysis [41], the study provides a broad and comprehensive examination of the ways in which contemporary philosophical movements intersect the praxis of library and information science.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: Not just the choice of foil text but the epistolary gamble itself certainly seems to have paid off. What began at the draft stage in indirect discourse quickly mutated into first person: all of it directly addresed as much to the scribbler herself as to
         that woman of flint, that Clennam woman whose given name I couldn't remember now to save my life. As if there were any life to save. All there is left for me is to keep telling the story over and over again, spelling it out in order to believe it. It seems too cruel to be true: the man gone, the son taken. And all this writing entrusted to Ephraim Flintwinch as go-between, of all people! What a name: the villain of steel who winches me tight with those bolts when I, as he calls it, “go off”? Oh, if only I could go off once and for all, one way or the other, rave my way past all this! But no, it just goes on, that sweaty beast my only medium to the world—the madhouse keeper, the drubber, and, worse, the forcer—until now, mercifully, when I have grown too old and shriveled even for his brute use. What can it matter anyway? After all those words, and these words, and these more, by now that miserable orphaned girl and mother, that no one, she who was once me, has almost succeeded in writing herself out.<br>

Abstract: This is a radical form of metaphysical transcendence: after the allegory of love will have become incorporated in the universe of creation at the end of time, even the most ordinary of mirrors will reflect it punctually because love will have become all‐pervasive, identical with reality. In mortal time, the trope of the mirror of introspection stands for the existential stratagem leading to Augustine’s antiutilitarian affirmation of choice over circumstance, fruition (
         fruendis frui) over usage (utendis uti), love over personal convenience. Only through the paradoxical expedient of such a transformative self‐denial may Augustine’s soul fully come into its own as the token of his personal identity.<br>

Author(s): Andrew Dudley<br>
Abstract: Such abrasive curricular issues quickly strip away the veneer that makes a term like
         disciplineso attractive. As I have intimated throughout, the word is an alloy composed of method and institution. As aninstitutionwithin the humanities, a film studies program houses a large variety of courses that address or introduce films in some manner. A distribution rule, guaranteeing breadth, usually governs student choice over the spectrum of courses on offer. But as amethodfilm studies implies a sequenced and hierarchical set of experiences, usually including a baseline of film history and two or more levels of theory and analysis. If methodical cinema studies once seemed on the verge of emerging at many universities, this impulse largely dissolved once students and professors felt the attraction and the need to cover larger swaths of media. The territory broadened at the expense of methodological depth. After the growth of cultural studies, the tent (no longer a house) may have been stretched to the point of ripping.<br>

Article Title: Critique and Promise in Paul Tillich’s Political Theology: Engaging Giorgio Agamben on Sovereignty and Possibility<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: Further analysis of both his statement of potency and his conception of the gift is needed since Agamben’s choice to render
         epidosisas “to give” can imply a kind of agency on the part of the growing tree. Discovering that gifts seem to have agency of their own, of course, is one of the great revolutions brought about by the anthropological study of gift economies. With those initial discoveries, made by Branislaw Malinowski and Marcel Mauss in different works, many important questions have emerged about the character and force of gifts and gift economies. We can take up one of these lines of inquiry in order to focus on the ones that matter for our engagement with Agamben. We have the question whether gifts always and everywhere demand reciprocity or whether it is possible to give a gift that lacks any obligation. Likewise, we could wonder whether the demand to return a gift is pernicious and an act of domination or whether such obligations can be peaceful and purged of all agonism. Beyond the challenges of reciprocity, we can also wonder if there can ever be a gift free of obligation and what such a pure gift might be. All these questions have significance for considering human community, the character of God’s offering to the world, and the like. We take up the gift here not to address all of these issues but to consider the character of the gift involved in Agamben’s analysis of sovereignty and the gift that Tillich’s prophetic criticism offers immanent criticism.24<br>

Article Title: Literary Unrest: Blanchot, Lévinas, and the Proximity of Judaism<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: In the essay “Revelation in the Jewish tradition,” from which the lines above are excerpted, Lévinas refers twice to the volume of the book as a kind of dwelling place. He calls it an “
         espace vital”and speaks of it as inhabitable. Given Lévinas's resistance to the language of homecoming in his ethics, his unrelenting insistence that ethical subjectivity is a form of uprooting, it is striking that he uses this language. On the one hand, it is a common trope to refer to the book as the Jewish homeland, one that valorizes the culture's mobility. On the other hand, it is a trope that replaces one form of homecoming with another. Throughout his philosophical corpus Lévinas opposes Abraham to Odysseus in order to emphasize the Hebrew tradition as the source for a model of ethical subjectivity, one in which the uprooting of the subject does not culminate in the satisfaction of homecoming.14Given Lévinas's insistence on the parallel between the structure of ethical subjectivity and the teachings of Judaism, there is an inconsistency here, at least in Lévinas's choice of metaphors, which may reveal as well a tension at the heart of his conception of Judaism. As we'll see in a moment, this is an inconsistency that Blanchot will try to exploit.<br>

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: Faustus's rejection of faith is both producer and product of his sense that salvation will entail his own erasure, because it alienates him from his soul by alienating him from God; it is both producer and product of his determination not to read “past” what is material and embodied to what is intangible, because it gives him the sense that the intangible will turn out to be nothing. Yet Faustus's lack of faith does not enable him to feel that there is in fact no life after death. On the contrary, Faustus is obsessed with the afterlife and with hell specifically, about which he repeatedly questions Mephistopheles. Not that Faustus believes what Mephistopheles tells him about hell, however: he scoffs, “come, I think hell's a fable” (2.1.130) when the devil informs him that “hell hath no limits, nor is circumscribed / In one self place; for where we are is hell, / And where hell is, must we ever be” (2.1.124–26). Faustus will not imagine hell as a universally diffused, Augustinian state of privation; rather, he insists on imagining hell as an extension or reproduction of the university where he currently resides. In response to Mephistopheles' insistence that he himself is “damned, and…now in hell” (2.1.140), Faustus impatiently replies, “how now, in hell? Nay, and this be hell, / I'll willingly be damned here! What, walking, disputing, / etc.” (2.1.141–43). “Damned here…walking, disputing, etc.”: Faustus reveals how much it matters to him that hell be a place, and not a state of the soul. Faced with a salvation that seems to entail his annihilation in the disappearance or dissolution of his body, Faustus is comforted by the idea of a hell where he will walk and dispute, where he can have reading groups with the “old philosophers” (1.3.62) and where “the infernal spirits” will “swarm” (1.1.117) to his lectures. Imagining hell as a continuation of his brilliant academic career, Faustus simply sees damnation as the better choice.<br>

Abstract: Second, what is the relation between practical “reflection” (or decision) and practical reasoning? While no one can choose or avow for me, my reflective avowal must respond to what I take to be reasons, as Larmore’s argument about grounds of commitment contends—and so it cannot “dispense” entirely with reference to others (65). Thus, the authenticity found in practical affirmation or attestation cannot be an experience of complete independence from others (my choice must in principle be intelligible). And so the “irreplaceable nature of each individual life” seen in authentic self-relation (55) cannot be defined negatively as an exclusion of other perspectives: it must instead depend on the energy, effort, or initiative in avowal.<br>

Issue: 669643<br>
Date: 05 01, 2013<br>
Author(s): Vásquez Manuel A.<br>
Abstract: As is often the case, when a scholar who is trained as a descriptivist (in disciplines such as history, sociology, and ethnography) attempts to take on theoretical issues they become theoretically parochial. They understand what works for their predefined area of expertise. However, theory takes place in constituting the domains for research, prior to the act of description, not in the applying individual concepts to preexistent object-domains. As Paul Ricoeur put it, “to delimit a domain of application is a hermeneutical act,” an act “that calls for reflection in terms of a general theory of interpretation” (
      Figuring the Sacred[Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress Press, 1995] 304). This kind of reflection, in my view as a scholar trained in theory, is completely lacking in Vásquez’s choice of criterion, despite his long sections of exegesis of theoretical texts. Rigorous exegesis is not the same thing as rigorous theoretical thinking. Rather, in Vásquez’s choices we find a predetermined view in search of a theory. The book becomes a justification of his choices, not a critical, reflexive, hermeneutical act. Theory happens before the explication of theory begins, and awareness of this fact is absent from this text.<br>

Abstract: But whether he is right or wrong, Adam with these words frames the debate for both parties and for nearly all of the critical literature on Eve’s dream. At the center of that debate is this question of what exactly happened, the night before, in Eve’s mind. But in searching for the key to her spiritual condition in the dream space, we miss the profound importance of the fact that Eve does not and perhaps cannot yet articulate sin in her own person. It may be that her yet sinless vocal chords simply cannot form the words: “And I did eat.” As William Riggs writes, “Evil thoughts, in Adam’s famous assessment, ‘into the mind of God or Man / May come and go, so unapprov’d, and leave / No spot or blame behind’ (V 117–19), but thoughts articulated—so Eve’s experience of her own words argues—constitute a significant gesture toward choice.”
      
               If Riggs is right then Eve’s famous ellipsis, far from inviting speculation, should end it altogether. What is often read as a clever evasion of guilt or at least a questionable coyness may in fact be the surest sign of abiding innocence. We need not speculate on what did or did not happen in Eve’s dreaming mind. The fact that she refuses to pronounce the incriminating words may be—to borrow another famous verse that may or may not belong in quotation marks—all we know and all we need to know.29<br>

Abstract: Without the benefit of physical senses, the characters seem especially eager to nail down the philosophical “sense” of their experience, to get to the meaning of their suffering; thus the play’s series of
      sententiaethat seem to provide the necessary metaphysical interpretation. It is Bosola who provides the metaphor that closely echoes Gloucester’s imagery of tragic helplessness inKing Lear. Though Bosola participates in the torture and murder of the Duchess, the experience changes him; her suffering elicits prosocial feelings of empathy that lead Bosola to vow to help her husband Antonio revenge her death. This choice instigates a traditional revenge plot, but the play rejects Bosola’s attempt to rewrite the script. When he seeks out Antonio, he accidentally kills him in the dark, a turn of events that prompts Bosola to lament: “We are meerely the Starres tennys-balls (strooke, and banded / Which way please them)” (5.4.54–55). This dark image directly parallels Gloucester’s image of men as flies, though Bosola exacerbates the hopelessness of the situation by replacing “gods” with the fatalistic “stars” and casting humans as inanimate objects.The Duchess of Malfi—which includes psychological and physical torture, a severed hand, wax effigies, and a werewolf (“on the In-side” [5.2.18])—in many ways ups the ante ofKing Lear’s pessimism by combining it with horror and depravity so extreme that it could only be the product of blind fate. In these lines, the play provides one of the most bleak metaphysical representations of human life in early modern tragic drama. Later, Bosola describes the accidental death of Antonio as “Such a mistake, as I have often seene / In a play” (5.5.94–95), forging a connection between early modern understanding of the genre and Bosola’s metaphorically developed philosophy.<br>

Abstract: The famous charcoal sketch that won Maybeck the commission was produced in August 1912 (see
         Figure 3). By mid-September 1913, the general (or contract) drawings for the project were completed, and construction began immediately.
               The drawings developed between these two important milestones, as well as the additional full-size details and templates that were issued after the commencement of the work, followed the established process of the architectural profession. All the features that critics too easily dismissed as the accidental results of an unusually speedy design process in fact went through a long evolution. Paradoxically, earlier studies show that these earlier details were more conventional. The final design resulted from careful choice, not chance or haste.95<br>

Abstract: This paper presents an historical outlook on the macro-micro distinction in modern sociology. It links the genesis of social interactionism and microsociology to the rise of Romantic philosophy and attempts to elaborate methodological principles dividing macro- and microscopic perspectives in sociology. Six ideal-typical distinctions are considered: natural vs. social universality, emergent properties vs. emergent processes, morphological structuralism vs. genetical interactionism, choice among socially structured alternatives vs. structuring appearance into reality, structural vs. emergent directionality, operational vs. hermeneutical analysis. The complementarity of the languages of macro- and microsociological theories is advocated as a foundation for the further elaboration of conceptual links between the two levels of analysis.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: In this essay, I consider the rival liberal and communitarian accounts of justice emerging in complex, pluralist societies. I argue that we err in posing the question of human rights as a Hobson's choice between a formal, universal metanarrative, as envisioned in philosophical liberalism, or as a merely local, ethnocentric narrative of the western bourgeoisie, as in the communitarian critique. For human rights are best viewed rhetorically, as establishing the possibility of rationally persuasive argument across our varied narrative traditions. The essay concludes by attending to the role of religious belief in the public reason of a postmodern society.<br>

Abstract: In order to manage our daily lives, we make many decisions based on empirical evidence derived from instrumental action. At the other extreme, we are often attracted by a so-called postmodern solution that invites us to make arbitrary choices. In the education system, the pressing dilemma should not be a choice between standards of competence or unthinking relativism, but how to take action towards intercultural tolerance. Establishing a small teacher training course for a group of British Muslims has shown that communicative action informed by understanding can be disabled by the instrumentality of positivist frameworks, such as those used by government inspectors. In philosophy, Ricoeur offers a provisional dialectic of hope that can be used to show why neither positivist methods, rational analytic philosophy, postmodernity nor any one belief system for interpreting the world should be allowed to exert hegemonic control. The ethicopractical philosophy of Ricoeur also offers a reconstructive view of reality that helps us to rehabilitate belief in human nature and encourages us to seek solutions to conflicts of interpretation in understanding others. It is applied, in this instance, to project work with Muslim women in the UK, in which an ontology of action shows the power of working collaboratively towards an understanding of oneself as another.<br>

Abstract: An initial awareness is needed of the debates regarding the choice of research approaches in sociology and the diversity and specificity of methods currently being used in the domain of textual data analysis in France. In general the influence of the French socio-linguistic tradition looms large, including, on the one hand, the older works of Michel Pécheux on the "discursive formations" and his A.A.D. (Analyse Automatique du Discours, 1969), and on the other hand, two main perspectives of the "Ecole Française d'Analyse du/de Discours" - which refer to the "speech act" concept and to the problematics of enunciation, and emphasizes the processes and "sociodiscursive practices" between socially-located speakers. Such theoretical conceptions and specific requirements lead to build on methodologies different from the classic, theme-based content analysis, though not yet translated into an operational software. Then the main software developments currently having an impact (at least potential) on practices of computer-aided sociological analysis of textual data, in France, are classified : from the lexicometric using procedures of "French Data Analysis" ('Analyse Factorielle des Correspondances' of Benzecri, and so on...), to a set of "expert-systems" working on specific theoretical frameworks, through more classical methods of content analysis and coding-sorting-retrieving socio-semantic procedures, eventually with various statistical methods. L'auteur expose d'abord quelques considèrations épistémologiques générales sur les présupposés implicites des méthodes de recherche sociologique, abusivement séparées en qualitatives et quantitatives, et des interrogations spécifiques sur le statut des corpus textuels et des pratiques socio-discursives dans différents domaines et selon divers types de problématique en sociologie. Puis, après un résumé des problématiques sociolinguistiques de l'"énonciation", propres aux courants de l'Analyse de Discours à la française", il propose~<br>

Abstract: A prominent factor in opening the possibilities of individual choice was the influence of
mothers, fortified with married women's autonomy in disposing of their wealth. Often endorsed by
their husbands but often independently of them, women offered their children the possibility of
framing their own social identity without direction from the structures of patriarchal authority,
paternal or governmental. On the varieties of adult experience, see Stanley Chojnacki, 'Measuring
adulthood: adolescence and gender in Renaissance Venice',/Fam Hist, 17 (1992), 371-95. On the
role of mothers in providing opportunities for elective adult vocation for both sons and daughters, see
idem, "'The most serious duty": motherhood, gender, and patrician culture in Renaissance Venice',

Author(s): HILTEBEITEL ALF<br>
Abstract: John Brockington, who makes bhakti excisions in the practice of oral epic
theory, says my treatment of this saree-restoration scene "includes rather spe-
cious arguments against Edgerton's text," referring to a page on which I say that
"Edgerton's choice could merely typify the eagerness of the Critical Edition's edi-
tors to excise bhakti by stripping the text" (Rethinking, 251). But Brockington does
not mention my arguments, much less show how they are specious; see his review
of Rethinking, 602. Similarly, Mary Brockington fails to indicate why she attributes
to me "unfairness to Julius Lipner (p. 257 n. 49)" in my summary of some of his
arguments on this episode: see M. Brockington, review of Rethinking, Indo-lranian
Journal 45 (2002). The references are to Franklin Edgerton, ed., Sabhäparvan. In-
troduction and Apparatus (Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1944),

gious Beliefs and Practices (London and New York: Routledge, 1994).<br>

Abstract: On this last point see my oration Relatieve autonomie als kruispunt van wegen
(Relative autonomy at the crossroads), given on the occasion of my taking up the
post of professor of the philosophy of the socio-cultural sciences at the Free
University, lOth October 1980. There I pointed out that marxists on the whole
gloss over this choice (esp. note 25). Peter Singer recently made a number of inter-
esting observations about this in the context of a review of several new publications
on Marx's view of history. See for example the following passages on William H.
Shaw's Marx's Theory of History (Stanford Univ. Press): 'Shaw has to admit that
the arguments Marx offers for the key idea of historical materialism — that material
production dominâtes social life — are "flimsy and perfunctory". How can this be,
if Marx considered himself a scientist and this was his great discovery? Shaw's
explanation is that Marx was so convinced that the primacy of production was
obvious that he did not see the need for more argument. But why was he so con-
vinced that it was obvious? Here Shaw uneasily confesses: "one senses that Marx
and Engels attached some sort of ontological primacy to material production, from
which its explanatory weight for social science follows". In short, Marx and Engels
simply regarded production as more "real" than politics, religion and ideas.' (Peter
Singer, New York Review of Books, 20 December 1979, p. 45).<br>

Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>

Author(s): Platt Fred<br>
Abstract: Psychohistory is affected by problems similar to those affecting the broader discipline of history, psychoanalysis, and the social sciences generally: the heterogeneous composition of social movements, the phenomenon of discontinuity, and the capacity of people actively to construct versions of the world from their own idiosyncratic conflicts and in the context of the many different social locations they occupy. In particular, answers to the key question, how the social world is related to mind or events to cognitive and affective responses, seem as remote as ever. At the same time, ironically, a number of prominent social theorists, compelled to acknowledge the failure of rational choice and resource mobilization theories, have expressed a renewed interest in issues of collective identities, norms, values, moral obligations and transgressions, that is, in issues that have been central to psychohistory from the beginning. Historians no doubt will try to follow the paths taken by theorists, as they have in the past, but it is uncertain what paths they, in turn, will take.<br>

Author(s): Sneddon Andrew<br>
Abstract: Concerns about advertising take one of two forms. Some people are worried that advertising threatens autonomous choice. Others are worried not about autonomy but about the values spread by advertising as a powerful institution. I suggest that this bifurcation stems from misunderstanding autonomy. When one turns from autonomous choice to autonomy of persons, or what is often glossed as self-rule, then one has reason to think that advertising poses a moral problem of a sort so far unrecognized. I diagnose this problem using Charles Taylor's work on "strong evaluation". This problem turns out to have political ramifications that have been only dimly recognized in business ethics circles.<br>

Publisher: Society for Historical Archaeology<br>
Issue: i25616488<br>
Date: 1 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): McCarthy John P.<br>
Abstract: Much archaeological scholarship on consumption has approached its subject matter as the means to an end—e.g., as a way of studying socioeconomic status—rather than as a proper object of study in its own right. The "consumer choice" school, and, more recently, advocates of consumer behavior studies, have supported approaches that emphasize quantitative methods, at the same time downplaying the "qualitative" or symbolic aspects of consumption. A considerable body of literature on the symbolic aspects of consumption exists both in historical archaeology and other fields. The intention of this essay is to draw together this recent literature on consumption and combine it into a single approach that emphasizes shopping as the meaningful action at the very heart of consumption. With the emphasis on agency, this approach presents shopping as that crucial moment of transformation where identity, intention, and symbol combine in the decision to purchase, to own, an object.<br>

Abstract: David Carrithers argues that crimes are 'matters of conscious choice' for
Montesquieu, and adduces passages from Letter 83 as evidence. See David W.
Carrithers, 'Montesquieu's Philosophy of Punishment', History of Political Thought,
XIX ( 1998), pp. 213^10, p. 219. Carrithers acknowledges Montesquieu' s statement that
self-interest is always a 'determining cause' of unjust actions; but Montesquieu's
position in the Persian Letters seems to be that self-interested actions are not always
chosen with a range of options clearly in view. See also Mason, Montesquieu's Idea of
Justice, p. 150; Montesquieu, The Spirit of the Laws, Part 1, Bk. 1.<br>

Author(s): Wertz Howard R.<br>
Abstract: An existential-phenomenological description of everyday consumer experiences of contemporary married women with children is offered. An idiographic case study provides a thick description of this phenomenon and illustrates the hermeneutic process used in the interpretation. Following the case study, three interpretive themes are presented as mutually related aspects of an experiential gestalt that is shaped by the contextual ground of participants' life-world situations. Viewed holistically, the thematic aspects exhibit several dialectical relations that can be understood in terms of the emergent meaning of free choice. The applicability of this experiential gestalt to other life-world contexts is discussed.<br>

Author(s): Mohr Michel<br>
Abstract: The Russo-Japanese War broke out in February 1904, starting with the rupture of diplo-
matic relations on February 6. Murakami's speech at the conference was published in the April
1904 issue of Rikugô zasshi, but it probably had been given before the outbreak of the war,
since Murakami only speaks of "the Russo-Japanese problem." The same issue of Rikugô
zasshi no. 280 also contains the article Yoga sensdkan no ippan 予が戦争観の一班（‘‘My View

Abstract: Rational choice theory and the critical theory of Jurgen Habermas exclude important social categories from their analyses of strategic interaction. Successful strategic action in many contexts, however, depends upon the irreducibly intersubjective categories of the lifeworld. I defend this claim by analyzing the use of focal points to solve the multiple equilibria problem in coordination games, reconstructing both the generation of the salience behind focal points as well as the strategic rationality of using them. The goal of this reconstruction is to demonstrate the compatibility of what appears to be mutually hostile research traditions, validating the intuition that together they provide a better understanding of politics than either school can on its own.<br>

Author(s): Zelditch Michael<br>
Abstract: The methodological foundations of comparative-historical sociology have been transformed dramatically in recent years. Arguments against general theoretical models have proliferated, while the complexity and uniqueness of historical events and the virtues of inductive methods have been emphasized. The growing convergence of sociology and history has led to a decline in the use of general theories. This article begins with a description and analysis of the recent transformation of the methodology of comparative-historical sociology. An overreliance on inductive methods has resulted in inadequate specifications of causal relations and causal mechanisms in recent comparative-historical sociology. The concluding section discusses a nascent rational choice research program in political sociology to illustrate an alternative methodology.<br>

Publisher: Higher Education Press and Springer<br>
Issue: i27823295<br>

Author(s): Yiyu Liu<br>
Abstract: The essential significance of scientific metaphor lies in applying the general metaphorical theory to specific interpretations and elaborations of scientific theories to form a methodology of scientific explanation. It is a contextual grasp of objective reality. A given metaphorical context and its grasp of the essence of reality can only be valid when the context is continually restructured. Taking the context as a whole, the methodological characteristic of scientific metaphor lies in the unity of understanding and choice, experience and concepts, semantic structures and metaphorical domains, rationality and irrationality. As a form of thinking based on reasons, scientific metaphor plays an important role in invention, representation, explanation, evaluation, and communication. 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𰍀𦐒𶄶𤡇𠁁𢌒𤅸𣕘𙥨𳌤𰍀𸕄𡥇𩜂𵝰𤈒𩦒𠄐𱆅𣎘𩜂𵝰𰍀𠡕𠌇𵊙𷌢 𡙄𵠨𦄦𠀓, 𰀁𧒒𤐘𥄄𙥨𱆁𱆅𣎘𵊙𷌢𰍀𦁁𧡡𵝰𤘅𤠙. 𣐧𦅙𣕅𣑘𵉦𣑔𢌒𰍀𙥨𱆁𵠡𢙙𡉰 𥈦𥕩, 𡒂𦍷𵠡𢙙𰍀𙦁𦀩𷌥𦔀, 𥅥𳀡𲑳𣑐𸕄𡥇𵠡𢙙𰍀𣎄𢌒𡑐𠡔𥈦𥕩𣑔𢌒𦐒𶄶𰍀 𦍷𥤨𤘕. 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𰍀𦁁𧡡𵝰𩌅𤑉𴤠𩘖𠀦: 𩜂𵊙𙦂𶡳𥌡, 𲑣𹕤𙦂𧀐𤕥, 𵠡𠁁𲑧𦔀𙦂 𸕄𡥇𢒕, 𩜂𤘕𙦂𸝐𩜂𤘕𰍀𲑹𙥨. 𠌖𠀦𙥨𱆁𦍷𩜂𰀁𥔒𩜂𰍀𤘅𲔀𤐘𤌵, 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𠡕𦍷 𡑗𦄦, 𴤠𤑉, 𵠨𦄦, 𵞀𠈕𡑐𠄲𧥩𱕡𦁁𸝔𰍀𷌥𵈁𡅑𳀡.<br>

I propose, without insisting on the obvious reasons for my choice of terms, to
use the word story for the signified, or narrative content (even if this content
turns out, in a given case, to be low in dramatic intensity or fullness of incident),
to use the word narrative for the signifier, statement, discourse or narrative text
itself, and to use the word narrating for the producing narrative action and, by
extension, the whole of the real or fictional situation in which that action takes
place. (27)<br>

Author(s): Wendt Tim<br>
Abstract: Social scientists interested in explaining historical processes can, indeed should, refuse the choice between modeling causal relationships and studying history. Identifying temporality as the defining characteristic of processes that can be meaningfully distinguished as "history," I show that modeling such phenomena engenders particular difficulties but is both possible and fruitful. Narratives, as a way of presenting empirical information, have distinctive strengths that make them especially suited for historical scholarship, and structuring the narratives based on the model allows us to treat them as data on which to test the model. At the same time, this use of narratives raises methodological problems not identified in recent debates. I specify these problems, analyze their implications, and suggest ways of solving or minimizing them. There is no inherent incompatibility between-but much potential gain from-modeling history and using historical narratives as data.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers, Inc.<br>
Issue: i360632<br>

Author(s): Tobias Arati<br>
Abstract: The combined works of John Dewey and Jerome Bruner provide a framework spanning a century of educational thought which can inform curriculum decisions concerning students' educational development, especially for middle school students whose waning of motivation toward school has been well documented by researchers and has long concerned parents and teachers. This framework, combined with recent contributions of motivation and interest researchers, can create broad understandings of how to collaboratively construct effective educational contexts. As early as 1913, Dewey specifically looked at the pivotal role of students' genuine interests in Interest and Effort in Education. Our current research focus on how students' interest can inform curricular contexts marks the recent shift showing an increased use of interest in education research since 1990. In this article, we discuss our study of a team-taught double classroom of sixth grade students whose interests were determined through a series of brainstorming sessions, and individual and focus group interviews. Students' interests fell into six categories centering around subject areas such as Drama, Science, and Animal Studies. Learning contexts were constructed around four of these subject areas. Students participated in their first or second choice of subject area group. We found significantly higher scores on measures of Affect and Activation if students participated in their first choice group. We found intra-group unities of preferred and dispreferred ways of learning which distinguished each group from the class as a whole. Finally, our findings indicated that students reliably described their genuine interests over time. Students' interests were found to be effective tools for informing curriculum decisions in the creation of sixth grade learning contexts.<br>

Abstract: Le projet colemanien est de re-socialiser le choix rationnel, tout en maintenant des connexions micro-macro aussi opérationnelles qu'en économie. Le modèle général des Foundations soit rend compte des normes mais l'organisation sociale s'efface, soit remet celle-ci au premier plan (sous la forme réduite de la distribution du capital social) mais n'engendre plus assez de normes. Un travail parallèle de simulation donne à penser que le problème vient de la rationalité elle-même: simplement calculatoire, alors que seule une rationalité interprétative pourrait prendre en considération des objets collectifs. Ce changement exigerait que l'acteur rationnel eût accès à un langage moins sommaire: intensionnel et non plus extensionnel. /// Coleman's project is to resocialize rational choice while keeping micro-macro connections as operational as they are in economics. The general model of the Foundations either accounts for norms while effacing social organization, or highlights social organization (in the reduced form of social capital distribution) while failing to engender sufficient norms. A later simulation model suggests that the problem is intrinsic to calculative rationality: only with interpretive rationality can collective objects be taken into account. This shift would require the rational actor to speak in less cursory terms, to use intensional rather than extensional language. /// Colemans Absicht ist es, die rationale Wahl zu resozialisieren und gleichzeitig Verbindungen Mikro-Makro beizubehalten, die ebenso wirksam wären wie in der Wirtschaft. Das allgemeine Modell der Foundations erklärt entweder die Normen bei gleichzeitiger Vernachlässigung der sozialen Organisation, oder setzt die soziale Organisation in den Vordergrund (in der reduzierten Form der Verteilung des sozialen Kapitals) und verfügt damit nicht mehr über ausreichende Normen. Ein später entwickeltes Simulationsmodell läßt vermuten, daß das Problem aus der Rationalität selbst entsteht, das heißt ei~<br>

Abstract: When religious orders are compared on differences in belief described as Pre-Vatican and Post-Vatican they also differ significantly in their preference for certain theologians and their preferences for types of works. Although age also explains this difference, even with age held constant the difference remains. Those with Post-Vatican beliefs express reading preferences and choice of works which affirm action to transform society as distinct from action to adjust to existing patterns.<br>

Issue: i286652<br>

Author(s): Yang Barbara<br>
Abstract: Beginning in the 1970s there has been a shift in cultural anthropological methodology from participant observation toward the observation of participation. During participant observation ethnographers attempt to be both emotionally engaged participants and coolly dispassionate observers of the lives of others. In the observation of participation, ethnographers both experience and observe their own and others' coparticipation within the ethnographic encounter. The shift from the one methodology to the other entails a representational transformation in which, instead of a choice between writing an ethnographic memoir centering on the Self or a standard monograph centering on the Other, both the Self and Other are presented together within a single narrative ethnography, focused on the character and process of the ethnographic dialogue.<br>

Abstract: In this essay I argue that childbearing and various kinds of organ donation are morally analogous activities. I argue, further, that the ethos of giftgiving ought to inform our analyses of both of these forms of bodily life support. This reframing of the abortion and organ donation debates yields new insights into two relatively neglected subtopics. First, though frequently asserted, few have demonstrated why bodily life support--especially in the form of childbearing--cannot be morally required. This comparison yields insights into the reasons for such an axiom. Second, while the giving of bodily life support is sometimes exhorted and almost always respected and admired, its intelligibility and political meaningfulness as a moral choice is rarely explored. This analogical wager reveals why one ought to give another bodily life support. In summary, the analogy yields insights crucial to the development of cogent arguments regarding both the grounds for and limits of the responsibility to give bodily life support. Further, the analogy displays the disparity between what has been demanded traditionally of those who are pregnant and of those men (and women) who by virtue of tissue or blood type can offer other forms of bodily life support. The analogy enables reflection on abortion (and organ donation) to develop in a context free of sexist biases. Finally, efforts are made to assess this giftgiving ethos in light of the feminist "hermeneutics of suspicion" regarding arguments which have and can sacralize victimization.<br>

Abstract: With the rise of alternative inquiry paradigms across academic fields, faculty within the same academic departments choose to ground themselves within different intellectual traditions and distinct academic cultures, not simply those parallel to the positivist tradition. One illustration of the emerging paradigmatic pluralism across academe is the actual paradigm choice by individual scholars. Appreciating these paradigm choices is critical if we are to interpret the faculty work and faculty culture that shape institutional culture and influence resource allocation at universities and colleges. Using qualitative methods, I focus upon a single discipline in my exploratory study, law, but extend these concepts and issues in analyzing and interpreting my findings to how they might apply to faculty working in other academic fields.<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to show that so-called conventional metaphors play a twofold role in discourse. We distinguish two sub-groups of so-called conventional metaphors (semi-denatured and denatured metaphors) depending on whether or not we still perceive the conceptual contrast generated when the conventional metaphor was a genuine metaphor. On the one hand, the choice of some sample of denatured conventional metaphor reflects the same about our ideology as what the choice of a literally used expression does, the original conceptual contrast is not retrievable. On the other hand, the use of a semi-denatured metaphor exploits the recognition of an ideological change, its use reflects the consolidation of the conceptual restructuring that took place when it was a metaphor. Semi-denatured metaphors show how reality and ideology have been in part constructed by the metaphorical use of language.<br>

Abstract: Cet article rappelle les ambitions et les enjeux théoriques qui ont conduit Sen à penser une nouvelle conception de l'avantage individuel et des évaluations sociales. Souvent perçue comme relevant de la philosophie morale, l'approche par les capabilités (AC) apparaît comme l'œuvre d'un théoricien du choix social dont l'éclectisme des recherches a permis d'aboutir à une approche du choix social plus ouverte et moins mécanique que celle proposée par Arrow en 1950. Grâce à une concentration nouvelle sur l'espace des potentiels et des capacités individuels et un glissement essentiel du rationnel vers le raisonnable, l'AC offre un cadre renouvelé pour l'économie normative. This article recalls the ambitions and theoretical issues that led Sen to develop a new conception of individual advantage and social evaluation. This Capability Approach (CA) is often regarded as moral philosophy. However, it arose from the work of a social choice theorist, whose eclecticism allowed a social choice approach to be formulated, which is more open and less mechanistic than that proposed by Arrow (1950). Due to its new focus on the scope of individual potential and capacities, and a substantial shift from rationality to reason, Sens CA provides a renewed theoretical framework for normative economics.<br>

Author(s): Bevir Mark<br>
Abstract: Cet article présente l'approche interprétative de la gouvernance, une approche inspirée par la philosophie herméneutique, qui met l'accent sur l'intentionnalité, l'historicité et la réflexivité et qui propose de repenser la gouvernance. Cette approche a été développée pour répondre aux défis posés par les théories du choix rationnel et leurs remises en cause des premières études sur la gouvernance qui, pour comprendre les réformes néolibérales, s'appuyaient sur un positivisme tempéré et sur la littérature des réseaux de politiques publiques. En considérant la gouvernance comme le produit d'un travail de mise en sens et en s'appuyant sur une conception non essentialiste de l'État, cette approche répond ainsi à l'idée de méta-gouvernance défendue par les tenants du choix rationnel. Cet article présente cette approche en insistant sur l'intentionnalité et l'historicité, en l'illustrant par des exemples d'histoires de gouvernance, et en proposant en conclusion les implications d'une telle approche pour l'analyse des politiques publiques. La théorie interprétative encourage une approche plus éclectique des données, suggère la méfiance vis-à-vis de tout modèle ou cadre formel, et accorde un rôle renforcé donné au storytelling. This article discusses the interpretive approach to governance. The interpretive approach comes from a hermeneutic philosophy, emphasizing intentionality, historicism, and reflexivity. These philosophical ideas décentre governance. The first wave of governance studies relied on a lukewarm positivism, extending the literature on policy networks to cover neoliberal reforms. This account of governance faced challenges from rational choice theory and from the idea of metagovernance. The interpretive approach responds to these challenges. The interpretive approach to governance responds to rational choice by decentring governance; patterns of governance arise as the products of meaning in action. The interpretive approach responds to metagovernance by de~<br>

Abstract: The first-generation literature on policy design has made considerable contributions over the last 30 years to our understanding of the process, politics and implications of policy design and instrument choice. This literature, however, has generally treated institutions as a black box and has not developed a coherent set of frameworks, theories and models of how institutions matter to policy design. In this paper, I unpack the black box of institutions using transaction cost and mechanism design to show how regulations can be better designed in developing countries when institutions are weak, unaccountable, corrupted or not credible. Under these conditions, I show that efficient regulatory design has to minimize transaction costs, particularly agency problems, by having incentive compatible (self-enforcing) mechanisms. I conclude with a second-generation research agenda on regulatory design with implications for environmental, food and drug safety, healthcare and financial regulation in developing countries.<br>

Abstract: This essay proposes that sociology can learn from social theory developed in the humanities. In the face of recent challenges to sociological explanations of social outcomes (from rational choice and economic theory, cognitive psychological theories of intelligence, and communitarian social philosophy), social theory should specify the constitutive force of social signification. After identifying a key weakness in theoretical approaches currently available in sociology, the inadequacy of various conceptions of the social, I analyze three significant new works in cultural studies in order to sketch out alternative ways of defining and measuring the force of social signification. The essay concludes with an attempt to establish the basis of a dialogue between cultural studies and sociology.<br>

Abstract: This is partly an allusion to Wittgenstein on language games but I am emphasising the sense of play to add to what he says of games, life and travel. On language games, see more in
         Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-religion/ (accessed 18 February 2010): Some properties of language-games can be noticed in Wittgenstein’s several examples and comments. They are, first, a part of a broader context termed by Wittgenstein a form of life (see below). Secondly, the concept of language-games points at the rule-governed character of language. This does not entail strict and definite systems of rules for each and every language-game, but points to the conventional nature of this sort of human activity. Finally, Wittgenstein’s choice of ‘game’ is based on the over-all analogy between language and game, assuming that we have a clearer perception of what games are. Still, just as we cannot give a final, essential definition of ‘game’, so we cannot find ‘what is common to all these activities and what makes them into language or parts of language.’<br>

Abstract: The above-mentioned organicist models of Borges, Glissant, and others offer alternative, non-dualist ways of conceptualizing the relations between cultures and poetries. They operate on multiple levels. On the level of literary history and with regard to tracking formal innovation, Relation offers an alternative to a rooted or Manichean model of exchange; on the level of procedure and reference within the text, as we examine specific instances of cultural recycling; and on the meta-level of interrogating scholarly methods and selection of objects of study. The choice of model can potentially participate in what Walter Mignolo would call “epistemic disobedience,”
         
               or a refusal to maintain and reinforce the hierarchies of the colonial matrix of power.52<br>

Author(s): Salmose Niklas<br>
Abstract: Fitzgerald uses several tools to create
      the nostalgic aesthetic of Gatsby. The plot is fundamentally analeptic in construction (told in flashbacks), while the narration is subsequent (narratedafterthe main story takes place). The narrator, Nick Carraway, fits the definition of a homodiegetic perspective (a narrator who is also part of the story he tells): as countless commentaries have discussed, Nick is a distanced observer, retelling the events of the summer of 1922 in first-person singular, infusing through his commentary value into their importance, a technique that creates a distinct “now” and “then” between the time of the story and the time of the narration. Additionally, theorderof the narration is not chronological but jumps back and forth in time in order to support the emotional experience of inner time instead of clock time.
            Furthermore, the choice of words in2
         The Great Gatsbyis often undeniably romantic, alluding to Keats or simply evoking nostalgic sentiments using romantic conventions: “For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face” (Gatsby14). This essay will not deal with all of Fitzgerald's nostalgic strategies in his most famous novel but will focus on one particular and highly original method: the use of the reader's textual memory in order to create a nostalgic experience within the text as an enhancement of the novel's nostalgic themes.<br>

Abstract: Of particular importance for Jabbeh Wesley's ethical attitude toward Liberia and the world is not only the universal, cosmopolitan spirit that guided the poet's choice of names but also the fact that some of the names that might belong to one ethnic group were hybrids created from at least two languages and ethnicities. One such name is Nimley, which is both Grebo and Kru. Grebo and Kru, along with Bassa, are from the Kwa or Klao family of languages. These languages have common roots and are so intermeshed as to defy any search for linguistic purity. By choosing names from these language cultures, the poet raises the specter of wars of brothers against brothers. Given that these were child soldiers, the poet calls Africa's attention not only to senseless fratricidal murder but also to the smothering of the future of Africa itself. The poet thus insinuates a question: Why bring children into a world where they will turn against their parents like Frankenstein's creature? The idea of children turning against their parents is particularly demonstrated by the existence of Dekuah, a spirit child, whose symbolic relevance we shall discuss more fully later.<br>

Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: That period (1980–81) symbolized the end of the “then” period. Critical theory, with its close ties to the interpretation of Marx, was no longer front and center. But the idea of critique was still alive, or at least we thought that it could be kept alive given the ominous truth of criticism that associated critique and ideology (Gadamer). At least we tried. Some four years after the publication of the first issue of
            Cultural Hermeneutics, Reidel, the publisher, suddenly and with little warning discontinued the journal. Whether it was Reidel's penchant for the good life or that we were the lowest journal in the hierarchy I never knew, but this much was clear, unless something unusual happened my life as a journal editor was over. As I was mulling over what to do, a process that took months, I received a late-night call from a former graduate student who was on his way to a distinguished career. His question was simple: “Dave, if you give up, where are we going to get published?” I took the question seriously; I bit the bullet, as it were—whoever said something could not be created out of nothing—and I started a publishing company to privately publish my journal. And by the most unusual stroke of luck I and the grad students associated with me at the time changed the nameCultural HermeneuticstoPhilosophy and Social Criticism. Unbelievably the phrase “social criticism” had not yet caught the public's imagination, and the choice of title was a stroke of pure luck. Significantly this change of title marked a transition in my view of critical theory, as reflected in the new editorial statement: “In modern industrial society reason cannot be separated from practical life. At their interface a critical attitude is forged.” The statement, which now sounds a bit passé, though I still keep it on the masthead, takes its distance from the earlier phase of critical theory. No revolution in the nineteenth-century historical sense is to be expected here. Social critici~<br>

Abstract: Jean-Luc Marion is more interested in the phenomenology of religion than in ethics.
            
                  But before turning to his positive contributions, it is worth noticing a loud protest that concerns both him and Levinas, among others. In 1991 Dominique Janicaud published29
               The Theological Turn of French Phenomenology, bitterly accusing Levinas and a series of younger scholars, including Marion, of betraying phenomenology. By sneaking God into phenomenology they abandon the reduction and thereby compromise phenomenology's scientific rigor and neutrality. Speaking of Levinas, but implicitly of Marion and others,
                  he writes, “The dice are loaded and choices made; faith rises majestically in the background. The reader … finds him- or herself in the position of a catechumen who has no other choice than to penetrate the holy words and lofty dogmas…. All is acquired and imposed from the outset, and this all is no little thing: nothing less than the God of the biblical tradition. Strict treason of the reduction.”30

Abstract: There are two results of this discussion to which I want to draw specific attention. First, this article suggests that commentators on Janicaud's minimal phenomenology, though few, have largely misunderstood the significance of this development. They have taken it to diminish the prestige of phenomenology, to the point of turning it into a trivial enterprise that describes banal phenomena.
         
               This can be traced back to the fact that they set up the issue in terms of a contrast between an ambitious maximal phenomenology that tests the limits of the visible and a minimal phenomenology that roots itself firmly within its boundaries. But Janicaud himself already dispels that contrast: his call for a minimal phenomenology does not advocate for a less ambitious or more restrained vision of phenomenology, as if its motto were to “keep costs down, do as little as possible, take no risks.”27
            
               The alternative is not, as commentators have suggested, between either a phenomenology of the invisible or a phenomenology of the visible; instead it concerns two different possible approaches to a phenomenology of the invisible: one that pushes the limits of the visible through a maximal threshold of excess (Marion, Levinas, Henry) and another that pursues those limits through a minimal threshold of sense (Merleau-Ponty, Deleuze). That is the choice that Janicaud bequeaths to phenomenology today.28<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur, however, does not envision so explicit an invitation (or even exhortation) to action. Rather he insists on understanding how poetic or fictional texts refer to the world outside of language. In a significant move, Ricoeur rejects the false choice between conceiving of a text as either a transparent window into conscious authorial intention or as a closed, self-referential world. His approach instead treats authorship as one textual influence among many. Ricoeur says that his formulation of refiguration “is part of a hermeneutics that aims less at restoring the author's intention behind the text than at making explicit the movement by which the text unfolds, as it were, a world in front of itself” (1984, 1:81). Here Ricoeur directly engages the poststructuralist critique of authorial intention and textual reference. Yet he offers an insightful and sensible alternative to the idea that texts should be understood primarily as effects of language.
         
               Like Ricoeur, I see authorial/creative intention as an important aspect of reading texts of public memory that is nonetheless only part of the broader context of textual production and address. The intentions of creators leave indelible marks on the texts and thus on the public memories they disseminate. But many other factors affect the nature of a text, and Ricoeur's approach emphasizes that reality.12<br>

Abstract: As the decades pass, many of Shaw's antiscientific views, having ossified to a large degree in the 1880s, look increasingly eccentric and seem as mired in superstitious delusion as he claimed the field was. Peters imagines Shaw's “dazzling display of partial truths [isolating] him in a moated tower from which he staged offensive forays against the medical world.”
      
            If his vehement rejection of germ theory and his sartorial preferences have proven as misguided as his beliefs on authoritarianism and eugenics, other commitments have fared better. Vegetarianism, for instance, is a common lifestyle choice nowadays, and Shaw enjoys a certain prominence in the history of the practice as well as on websites and blogs devoted to it. Characterizing the Edwardian medical system in the preface to26
         Doctor's Dilemmaas a “murderous absurdity,” he lived long enough to see the institution of the National Health Service in 1948, although still argued for a greater lay presence within its administration of physician licensing and training. In the twenty-first century, amid protracted health care debate in both the United States and the United Kingdom, proposed government regulation of medical apps on smartphones and tablets, and alarming physiological trends including skyrocketing obesity rates, many of Shaw's observations and positions speak almost as urgently to our time as they did to his.<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>

Abstract: If Joyce's writing seems, from a purely chronological perspective on his works, increasingly comedic, then we may see it as eschewing the tragedic or even farcical cycles of historical inevitability that Karl Marx diagnosed—as it moves from the “maleficent and sinful being”
         
               (or state of being) of the paralysis of100
            Dublinerstoward a perspective in which historical repetition is confronted with the possibility of developmental change: “history repeating itself with a difference.”
               This may be why101
            Finnegans Wakeadds an extra age to Vico's historical cycles, an age of chaos and of contradictions but therefore one of pluralistic possibilities in its “disunited kingdom.”
               Joyce, in this sense, signifies choice—a joyful and comedic array of literary and linguistic possibilities: “acomedy of letters.”102
            
               At the level of literary language, this phenomenon is perhaps most clearly manifested in Joyce's emphasis upon a semantic indeterminacy that liberates the reader from authorial authority through such linguistic and rhetorical devices as ambiguity and irony. Giambattista Vico supposed that irony is “formed from falsehood by dint of a reflection which borrows a mask of truth.”103
            
               Joyce's ultimate irony is herein based, if not upon the certainty of falsehood, then upon the definitive and irretrievable indeterminacy of what purports to be an absolute transparency of language and therefore a medium of transcendental truth.104<br>

Abstract: Coming from the Latin
         decidere, “to cut off,” “by giving the victory to one side or the other” in a choice or conflict,decidecan have no truck with “both/and.” In point of fact, ethical behavior requires that the ambivalence of extreme relativism and radical subjectivity be overcome so that something like provisional certainty can arise, such as utopian imagination requires and projects. It does not matter that such certainty may be short-lived. The value of Utopia for imagining superior conditions resides in its vocation for doing so, even if time and necessity must always defeat attempts at total application: life lived will always attempt to play itself out in the loosest conformity with the prescriptions of any plan or social project (even in the face of violence).<br>

Issue: sciefictstud.41.issue-1<br>
Date: 3 1, 1973<br>
Abstract: This essay examines the role of agency and metatextuality in Élisabeth Vonarburg's B
         ridgeCycle, comprised mainly of a group of short stories originally published between 1977 and 2002 and then revised in their definitive French versions for the collectionLe Jeu des coquilles de nautilus(2003). The cycle's main storyline involves the uncertain journey between parallel worlds by a series of recurring characters. Three intimately linked narrative components—each closely related to certain protocols of reading fiction and of particular interest to science fiction—form the theoretical and analytical bases of this study: the three recurring topoï of the protagonist-Voyager's travels; character agency that in part drives the sense of these realms and their occupation; and the dénouement which gives a certain meaning and closure to the spaces in their diverse manifestations and to the characters who pursue their quests in these spaces. Vonarburg's narratives place their protagonists in a situation precisely similar to that of the reader as she must negotiate the trans-world context, come to grips with her own relative lack of agency, and at the same time seek some level of control through knowledge. Suchmise en abymeallows the author, through the choice of dénouement, to comment on the manner in which this universe and the real one are imagined, represented, and decoded, and on how meaning is conveyed.<br>
