  Abstract: To be Fundamentalist is to be marginal. It is to adopt and enact one’s own marginalization in society. It is to assume a position of outsider. It is to invoke counterpublic speech against public norms. Yet it is also to lay claim to an imagined higher standard than that which society currently upholds. It is, as we discussed in the last chapter, to envision a world in which Fundamentalist speech is normative. It is to speak for a public that the Fundamentalist community imagines but cannot, itself, enact. Therefore, we have seen, within Fundamentalism, a continual and productive tension between<br>

  Abstract: René Girard’s complex and sophisticated theory of sacrifice offers insights into the workings of human society that transcend culture and time and, while privileging Christianity and modernity, claim a certain universality. This invites scholars of other cultures and religions to consider the applicability of Girardian thought to their own fields of study. As scholars of Buddhism we take up this challenge by bringing Buddhism into conversation with Girard. Instead of concentrating on a particular text (Schlieter 2009) or genre (Hahn 2009) or practice (Arifuku 2009), we aim for a more comprehensive and general engagement with Girard by suggesting how Buddhism<br>

  Abstract: In everyday language, the term “paradox” is used to refer to any claim or argument that contrasts with what is usually considered obvious. In a more specific and philosophical sense, a paradox is a claim or an argument that develops from apparently true premises and leads to a seemingly absurd (self-contradictory or logically unacceptable) conclusion. The term is also sometimes used in the context of religion to refer to a form of fideism professing a religious belief even when, or precisely because, that belief defies reason (as paradigmatically expressed by Tertullian’s
                  Credo quia absurdum). And then there is at least<br>

  Abstract: During the Vietnam War, the objectives of American policy toward Vietnam centered not on the strategic importance of the “real estate” involved, but on the effects a defeat in Vietnam would have on the United States’ prestige in the world and its reputation for keeping its commitments.¹ American policy makers spoke often of these considerations. And they measured American actions in Vietnam against them, weighing the costs in lives and resources of deepening intervention against the costs in prestige and reputation of halting that intervention.² If prestige and reputation are, as many claim, the intangible side of power, then in<br>

  Abstract: To whom do the dead belong? And how must they be claimed? War produces unnatural death, deaths that occur out of place—away from home and kin—and deaths that occur out of time, to the young and strong. Modern war kills more noncombatants than soldiers; death strikes outside the rules meant to contain and rationalize the violence of war. The nations that are war’s agents claim the dead for political purposes and ideologies, wrenching them away from family and leaving deep wounds, turning them into instruments rather than agents of history.

  Book Title: A Problem of Presence-Beyond Scripture in an African Church<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Engelke Matthew<br>
  Abstract: The Friday Masowe apostolics of Zimbabwe refer to themselves as “the Christians who don’t read the Bible.” They claim they do not need the Bible because they receive the Word of God “live and direct” from the Holy Spirit. In this insightful and sensitive historical ethnography, Matthew Engelke documents how this rejection of scripture speaks to longstanding concerns within Christianity over mediation and authority. The Bible, of course, has been a key medium through which Christians have recognized God’s presence. But the apostolics perceive scripture as an unnecessary, even dangerous, mediator. For them, the materiality of the Bible marks a distance from the divine and prohibits the realization of a live and direct faith. Situating the Masowe case within a broad comparative framework, Engelke shows how their rejection of textual authority poses a problem of presence—which is to say, how the religious subject defines, and claims to construct, a relationship with the spiritual world through the semiotic potentials of language, actions, and objects. Written in a lively and accessible style, A Problem of Presence makes important contributions to the anthropology of Christianity, the history of religions in Africa, semiotics, and material culture studies.<br>

Focusing on these qualities of performance, in this chapter I explore the multiple ways in which Hindu Mauritians both construct and align<br>

  Abstract: Sociology and its companion social sciences, such as cultural anthropology and psychology, enjoy ambivalent relations with one another, and with sections of the humanities, from cultural history to the study of languages. To complicate matters more, the relations with the natural sciences are ambiguous as well and subject to debate. Intellectuals never created a clear-cut and generally accepted classification of the arts and sciences concerned with human behavior. The cognitive quality of literature and the visual arts never disappeared. Literary authors still claim to enlighten

Can there be maintained identity between New Testament teachings and later doctrinal formulations that utilize very different conceptual frameworks? Most importantly, if doctrines do in fact develop over time through expansion, contextualization, and critical correction, how can the faith communities that develop and reformulate doctrines claim to be part of the same broad Christian tradition?<br>

  Abstract: We noted in the previous chapter Bultmann’s claim that radical demythologizing is “the consistent application [of the doctrine of justification by faith alone] to the field of knowledge.”² This application has both a negative and a positive dimension. Negatively it is criticism of objectifying thinking within the

Demythologizing is a critical epistemology in the sense that it subverts every attempt to interpret the kerygma in the form of aWeltanschauung. It is thus an antimythological and antimetaphysical—i.e., deconstantinizing—hermeneutic.<br>

  Book Title: Writing Theologically-  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Barreto Eric D.<br>
  Abstract: Of course, by writing we refer to the kinds of reflections, essays, and exams students will have to complete in the seminary classroom. But writing also encompasses the many modes of communication and self-discovery that creative expression can unlock. Writing Theologically introduces writing not just as an academic exercise but as a way for students to communicate the good news in rapidly changing contexts, as well as to discover and craft their own sense of vocation and identity. Most important will be guiding students to how they might begin to claim and hone a distinctive theological voice that is particularly attuned to the contexts of writer and audience alike. In a collection of brief, readable essays, this volume, edited by Eric D. Barreto, emphasizes the vital skills, practices, and values involved in writing theologically. That is, how might students prepare themselves to communicate effectively and creatively, clearly and beautifully, the insights they gather during their time in seminary? Each contribution includes practical advice about best practices in writing theologically; however, the book also stresses why writing is vital in the self-understanding of the minister, as well as her or his public communication of the good news.<br>

  Book Title: Figures of a Changing World: Metaphor and the Emergence of Modern Culture-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BERGER HARRY<br>
  Abstract: Figures of a Changing World offers a dramatic new account of cultural change, an account based on the distinction between two familiar rhetorical figures, metonymy and metaphor. The book treats metonymy as the basic organizing trope of traditional culture and metaphor as the basic organizing trope of modern culture. On the one hand, metonymies present themselves as analogies that articulate or reaffirm preexisting states of affairs. They are guarantors of facticity, a term that can be translated or defined as fact-like-ness. On the other hand, metaphors challenge the similarity they claim to establish, in order to feature departures from preexisting states of affairs. On the basis of this distinction, the author argues that metaphor and metonymy can be used as instruments both for the large-scale interpretation of tensions in cultural change and for the micro-interpretation of tensions within particular texts. In addressing the functioning of the two terms, the author draws upon and critiques the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, Roman Jakobson, Christian Metz, Paul Ricoeur, Umberto Eco, Edmund Leach, and Paul de Man.<br>

  Abstract: Fans of Robert Segal will find him in classic form here, working the permutations and combinations of both mythical narratives and theorists that he has applied to them.

Closely examined, that is, they show themselves exemplifying classic mythical themes such as the son’s desire to kill the father. As interpreted by two major classical theorists, psychoanalyst Otto Rank, and myth-ritualist Lord Raglan, Segal works over the biblical text to show how the perspectives of both Rank and Raglan can be<br>

  Book Title: Aspects of Alterity: Levinas, Marcel, and the Contemporary Debate-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Every other is truly other, but no other is wholly other.This is the claim that Aspects of Alterity defends. Taking up the question of otherness that so fascinates contemporary continental philosophy, this book asks what it means for something or someone to be other than the self. Levinas and those influenced by him point out that the philosophical tradition of the West has generally favored the self at the expense of the other. Such a self-centered perspective never encounters the other qua other, however. In response, postmodern thought insists on the absolute otherness of the other, epitomized by the deconstructive claim every other is wholly other.But absolute otherness generates problems and aporias of its own. This has led some thinkers to reevaluate the notion of relative otherness in light of the postmodern critique, arguing for a chiastic account that does justice to both the alterity and the similitude of the other. These latter two positions-absolute otherness and a rehabilitated account of relative otherness-are the main contenders in the contemporary debate.The philosophies of Emmanuel Levinas and Gabriel Marcel provide the point of embarkation for coming to understand the two positions on this question. Levinas and Marcel were contemporaries whose philosophies exhibit remarkably similar concern for the other but nevertheless remain fundamentally incompatible. Thus, these two thinkers provide a striking illustration of both the proximity of and the unbridgeable gap between two accounts of otherness.Aspects of Alterity delves into this debate, first in order understand the issues at stake in these two positions and second to determine which description better accounts for the experience of encountering the other.After a thorough assessment and critique of otherness in Levinas's and Marcel's work, including a discussion of the relationship of ethical alterity to theological assumptions, Aspects of Alterity traces the transmission and development of these ~<br>

  Book Title: Tastes of the Divine: Hindu and Christian Theologies of Emotion-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS MICHELLE VOSS<br>
  Abstract: The intensity and meaningfulness of aesthetic experience have often been described in theological terms. By designating basic human emotions as rasa, a word that connotes taste, flavor, or essence, Indian aesthetic theory conceptualizes emotional states as something to be savored. At their core, emotions can be tastes of the divine. In this book, the methods of the emerging discipline of comparative theology enable the author's appreciation of Hindu texts and practices to illuminate her Christian reflections on aesthetics and emotion. Three emotions vie for prominence in the religious sphere: peace, love, and fury. Whereas Indian theorists following Abhinavagupta claim that the aesthetic emotion of peace best approximates the goal of religious experience, devotees of Krishna and medieval Christian readings of the Song of Songs argue that love communicates most powerfully with divinity. In response to the transcendence emphasized in both approaches, the book turns to fury at injustice to attend to emotion's foundations in the material realm. The implications of this constructive theology of emotion for Christian liturgy, pastoral care, and social engagement are manifold.<br>

  Abstract: The four distancing strategies discussed in the last chapter set fences around appropriate devotional feeling, but they also set the devotional community apart from persons suspected of inappropriate love for God. This dynamic is most clear with regard to rival religious groups. Bernard of Clairvaux projects perverse practices upon heretical groups, and later church officials view with profound suspicion unauthorized women who claim Christ as their lover. These moves anticipate the Fourth Lateran Council’s careful circumscription of the real presence and body of Christ to the institutional Church and its sacraments.¹ The rivalry of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas with other sects around<br>

  Abstract: The previous chapter has tracked the alterations in the conceptual architecture of rights across the eighteenth century in English: In the early decades of the century, rights understood in the most general sense were conjugated through an early modern juristic conception of “right,” where that concept was hinged to a claim and tied to an ethico-theological description of society. The purpose of a right (and of rights, therefore) was to uphold and protect both civic and religious institutions within which the subject appeared as a coherent and cohesive social entity. Although such entities could only, also, be political, it was<br>

  Abstract: The seeds of the aesthetic are buried deep in the work of Charles Sanders Peirce. The sprouts were, therefore, rather slow to show themselves. However, the concept of the imagination as framed by Kant and other German Enlightenment thinkers does emerge in the ground of his epistemology, ontology, and metaphysics. Peirce recognizes the important function of Kantian reproductive imagination as he develops a description of inquiry that underscores the continuity between bodily sensation and understanding, once again challenging the mind-body dualism to which the idealists and empiricists continually fell prey. A more radical claim emerges from this challenge, namely that<br>

  Book Title: The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER THOMAS M.<br>
  Abstract: The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence explores themes in classical American philosophy, primarily that of John Dewey, but also in the thought of Ralph Waldo Emerson, George Santayana, and Native American traditions. The primary claim is that human beings exist with a need for the experience of meaning and value, a "Human Eros." Our various cultures are symbolic environments or "spiritual ecologies" within which the Human Eros can thrive. This is how we inhabit the earth. Encircling and sustaining our cultural existence is nature. Western philosophy has not generally provided adequate conceptual models for thinking ecologically. Thus the idea of "eco-ontology" undertakes to explore ways in which this might be done beginning with the primacy of Nature over Being, but also including the recognition of possibility and potentiality as inherent aspects of existence. I argue for the centrality of Dewey for an effective ecological philosophy. Both "pragmatism" and "naturalism" need to be contextualized within an emergentist, relational, non-reductive view of nature and an aesthetic, imaginative, non-reductive view of intelligence.<br>

  Book Title: Labors of Imagination: Aesthetics and Political Economy from Kant to Althusser-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mieszkowski Jan<br>
  Abstract: This book is a major new study of the doctrines of productivity and interest in Romanticism and classical political economy. The author argues that the widespread contemporary embrace of cultural historicism and the rejection of nineteenth-century conceptions of agency have hindered our study of aesthetics and politics. Focusing on the difficulty of coordinating paradigms of intellectual and material labor, Mieszkowski shows that the relationship between the imagination and practical reason is crucial to debates about language and ideology.From the Romantics to Poe and Kafka, writers who explore Kant's claim that poetry sets the imagination freediscover that the representational and performative powers of language cannot be explained as the products of a self-governing dynamic, whether formal or material. A discourse that neither reflects nor prescribes the values of its society, literature proves to be a uniquely autonomous praxis because it undermines our reliance on the concept of interest as the foundation of self-expression or self-determination. Far from compromising its political significance, this turns literature into the condition of possibility of freedom. For Smith, Bentham, and Marx, the limits of self-rule as a model of agency prompt a similar rethinking of the relationship between language and politics. Their conception of a linguistic labor that informs material praxis is incompatible with the liberal ideal of individualism. In the final analysis, their work invites us to think about social conflicts not as clashes between competing interests, but as a struggle to distinguish human from linguistic imperatives.<br>

  Book Title: Intention Interpretation-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): ISEMINGER GARY<br>
  Abstract: "...an excellent and comprehensive discussion of a debate that was initiated in this century in William Wimsatt's and Monroe C. Beardsley's influential article 'The Intentional Fallacy.'...this is a splendidly conceived and very useful collection of essays. Readers will want to take issue with the arguments of individual authors, but this is to be expected in a volume at the cutting edge of a fertile philosophical controversy." --David Novitz, The Philosophical Quarterly "What is the connection, if any, between the author's intentions in (while) writing a work of literature and the truth (acceptability, validity) of interpretive statements about it?" With this question, Gary Isminger introduces a literary debate that has been waged for the past four decades and is addressed by philosophers and literary theorists in Intention and Interpretation. Thirteen essays discuss the role of appeals to the author's intention in interpreting works of literature. A well-known argument by E.D. Hirsch serves as the basic text, in which he defends the appeal to the author's intention against Wimsatt and Beardsley's claim that such an appeal involved "the intentional fallacy." The essays, mostly commissioned by the editor, explore the presuppositions and consequences of arguing for the importance of the author's intentions in the way Hirsch does. Connections emerge between this issue and many fundamental issues in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind as well as in aesthetics. The (old) "New Criticism" and current Post-Structuralism tend to agree in disenfranchising the author, and many people now are disinclined even to consider the alternative. Hirsch demurs, and arguments like his deserve the careful attention, both from critics and sympathizers, that they receive here. Literary scholars and philosophers who are sympathetic to Continental as well as to Anglo-American styles of philosophy are among the contributors.

My view is that naturalism, existentialism, phenomenology, and poststructuralism can all, with a degree of plausibility, claim themselves heirs to his thinking.¹ Nietzsche is a thinker whose texts open up “possibilities,” and all these modes of thought can be found prefigured and at work in the text I focus on in this paper,

  Abstract: In chapter 7 we saw how the category of the penultimate allows for a critical affirmation of human capability. This chapter employs a similar strategy regarding self-reflexivity and self-understanding, showing that the for-itself has a proper penultimate status in the life of faith and that the cruciform self is a self-interpreting animal. It is necessary to make this argument given our interpretation of sin as incurvature, which might seem to reinforce the Romantic-idealist interpretation of the fall as a

Plato is famous for his doctrine of Forms, of changeless eidetic features.

  Abstract: Let us assume for the sake of argument that the central claim of this book hitherto is correct: Chalcedonian Christology has a permanent importance for Christian theology. The first four chapters of this book sought, then, to articulate an understanding of the mystery of the incarnation in traditional terms by appeal to the notions of the hypostatic union, the two natures of Christ, and the discussion of Jesus’s being and existence as the Word made flesh. I have purposefully contrasted this approach with the modern subject-oriented Christologies of Schleiermacher and Harnack. These latter sought to circumvent the formulas of the<br>

  Book Title: John, Jesus, and History, Volume 2-Aspects of Historicity in the Fourth Gospel<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Thatcher Tom<br>
  Abstract: This groundbreaking volume draws together an international group of leading biblical scholars to consider one of the most controversial religious topics in the modern era: Is the Gospel of John-the most theological and distinctive among the four canonical Gospels-historical or not? If not, why does John alone among the Gospels claim eyewitness connections to Jesus? If so, why is so much of John's material unique to John? Using various methodologies and addressing key historical issues in John, these essays advance the critical inquiry into Gospel historiography and John's place within it, leading to an impressive consensus and convergences along the way.

  Abstract: Most scholars today concur that the Fourth Gospel includes both history and theology. Even many patristic interpreters, who often harmonized John with the Synoptics (hence apparently stressing history), recognized John as a “spiritual” Gospel, emphasizing its interpretive aspects. The Gospel clearly interprets theologically the eyewitness claim that apparently stands behind it (cf. 21:24); perhaps most conspicuously, in the Fourth Gospel as a whole the eyewitness claim of water and blood from Jesus’ side (19:34–35) is made to climax a motif of water running through the narrative (1:26, 33; 2:7 – 9; 3:5, 23; 4:10, 13 – 14; 5:2; 7:37 – 39; 9:7;<br>

Meanwhile, the Christian church soon advanced from being a persecuted minority to become the state religion of the Roman Empire, and eventually, in many ways, its successor. Once the age of martyrs gave way to Christendom, the sacralized political order on which Christendom rested would create tensions of its own and these, nine centuries after Irenaeus, provide the setting for the next work to claim our attention, Anselm of Canterbury’s

  Book Title: Moments of Silence-Authenticity in the Cultural Expressions of the Iran-Iraq War, 1980-1988<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatanabadi Shouleh<br>
  Abstract: The Iran-Iraq War was the longest conventional war of the 20th century. The memory of it may have faded in the wake of more recent wars in the region, but the harrowing facts remain: over one million soldiers and civilians dead, millions more permanently displaced and disabled, and an entire generation marked by prosthetic implants and teenage martyrdom. These same facts have been instrumentalized by agendas both foreign and domestic, but also aestheticized, defamiliarized, readdressed and reconciled by artists, writers, and filmmakers across an array of identities: linguistic (Arabic, Persian, Kurdish), religious (Shiite, Sunni, atheist), and political (Iranian, Iraqi, internationalist). Official discourses have unsurprisingly tried to dominate the process of production and distribution of war narratives. In doing so, they have ignored and silenced other voices.Centering on novels, films, memoirs, and poster art that gave aesthetic expression to the Iran-Iraq War, the essays gathered in this volume present multiple perspectives on the war's most complex and underrepresented narratives. These scholars do not naively claim to represent an authenticity lacking in official discourses of the war, but rather, they call into question the notion of authenticity itself. Finding, deciding upon, and creating a language that can convey any sort of truth at all-collective, national, or private-is the major preoccupation of the texts and critiques in this diverse collection.<br>

  Abstract: Since the publication of Descartcs’s
                  Discourse on Method(1637) andMeditations(1641) and Newton’sPrincipia Mathematica(1687), the mechanistic model has dominated natural science, The Cartesian-Newtonian paradigm enjoys cognitive hegemony in the modern world, displacing any aesthetic, religious, or philosophical claim to insight or knowledge. And long before the social sciences emerged, such thinkers as Thomas Hobbes and Adam Smith were modeling their treatises on the structure of political and economic society on the mechanistic paradigm, attempting to capture in human affairs what was being achieved in natural science: theoretical elegance and precision leading to predictive knowledge and causal control.<br>

Among these “other” contexts thanks to Stevens, I continue further to advance the claim elaborated previously (in

  Abstract: The world of mental health and illness is a strange place. It is strange, not because people are strange, but because it is essentially mysterious. What exactly do we mean by mental illness? How can a mind be ill? Indeed, how can something immaterial be either broken or mended? It is clear that whatever mental illness is, it is not the same as measles or influenza. It may be that some claim to have tracked down biological, neurological, or genetic causes for our psychological disturbances. But such explanations, whilst arguably telling us from where such experiences come from, do little<br>

  Abstract: The story of the possessed from Gadara is popular in art and fiction, in particular the demon’s claim, “for we are many.”² It implies not only the possible diversity of the satanic character, but also the power that stands behind him. The different characters discussed in this work are only a very small aspect of the satanic figure, but they were chosen to highlight the ambiguity of Satan’s nature and to express the diversity of his appearance in the story. The origins of Satan lay, as we have seen, in his function as the stumbling block and the adversary, he<br>

The answer to this question is not only a matter of historical truth.

  Abstract: The existence of evil in the world is regarded by most atheists as the principal objection to the existence of God, called by the Roman Catholic theologian Hans Küng the ‘rock of atheism’. By ‘evil’ is meant the fact of pain and suffering and the ‘problem’ that it poses for religious belief is not hard to see. How can evil exist in a world created by an omnipotent and omni-benevolent God? For the positive atheist this question exposes an insuperable inconsistency within religious belief, thereby invalidating the claim that any God exists.

Whether reading the local newspaper or the global online news, whether watching the latest film or listening to the newest music, violence of one sort or another seems omnipresent. The violence of our late-modern age, furthermore, seems embedded in competing claims about boundaries and identities and what some philosophers call our relationship to “The Other.” Some people cheerily claim that boundaries are (or soon will be) no more, since modern technologies are shrinking the walls and distances that separate us.

We have examined both the historical books of the Tanakh and the Gospel accounts in which an epistemological process is present, relevant, and persistent. Early on, we made the claim that this view should not be reduced to a religious epistemology, but that it covers knowing writ large. In this chapter, we want to argue that there is an extant view of scientific epistemology that provides us with an overlapping model of what we see in the Christian Scriptures.

Yet what we call things matters. For our classifying, and hence our naming, in part defines what we can and will perceive. This chapter investigates three approaches to naming the genre present in the speeches commonly known as “the confessions of Jeremiah” in order to uncover three responses to the dark times.

  Book Title: From Faith to Faith-John Wesley’s Covenant Theology and the Way of Salvation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Noble T. A.<br>
  Abstract: The very title of this volume makes a claim and extends an invitation. Simply put, the claim is this: John Wesley was an adherent of covenant theology. Consequently, a proper understanding of his theological thought - and of his soteriology in particular - is impossible apart from accounting for the influence of covenant theology on him. The invitation then, is to investigate Wesley's thought in light of this claim. Having started his research simply as an investigation into a rather curious distinction Wesley made among those to whom he gave spiritual counsel (some people, he said, have "the faith of a servant"; others have "the faith of a son"), Rodes soon realised that covenant theology was an immensely powerful influence on Wesley's thought, and that he was even able to significantly and creatively adapted it to the template of his evangelical Arminianism.<br>

Accepting this invitation is not without risk, as well-established conclusions regarding Wesley’s thought may need to be revised and their implications for praxis reconsidered. But neither is it without reward: namely, a new and deeper appreciation of the substantial theological underpinnings of his pastoral convictions and counsel.<br>

I critique his claim that religious martyrdom and self-sacrifice are simply ritualized rites of destruction that in the eyes of religious agents leave the impression of a religious heroism that transforms history. Since martyrs are also called heroes, I hypothesize that true heroism is marked by a particular kind of courage, hope, and an ethic of risk. I assume that true heroism is a necessary, though not a sufficient, condition for true religious martyrdom, and I<br>

Since knowledge derived from experience can never claim necessity, Kant concludes that such knowledge must be transcendental in origin. His account of how such knowledge is possible focusses on transcendental apperception and the order that it imposes upon the experience. We have seen, however, that his account fails to show that the categories can be derived entirely a priori, and that his final account of<br>

  Author(s): ABBOTT FRANK A.<br>
  Abstract: There are many analyses of Tractarianism – a nineteenth-century form of Anglicanism that emphasized its Catholic origins – but how did people in the colonies react to the High Church movement? Beating against the Wind, a study in nineteenth-century vernacular spirituality, emphasizes the power of faith on a shifting frontier in a transatlantic world. Focusing on people living along the Newfoundland and Labrador coast, Calvin Hollett presents a nuanced perspective on popular resistance to the colonial emissary Bishop Edward Feild and his spiritual regimen of order, silence, and solemnity. Whether by outright opposing Bishop Feild, or by simply ignoring his wishes and views, or by brokering a hybrid style of Gothic architecture, the people of Newfoundland and Labrador demonstrated their independence in the face of an attempt at hierarchical ascendency upon the arrival of Tractarianism in British North America. Instead, they continued to practise evangelical Anglicanism and participate in Methodist revivals, and thereby negotiated a popular Protestantism, one often infused with the spirituality of other seafarers from Nova Scotia and New England. Exploring the interaction between popular spirituality and religious authority, Beating against the Wind challenges the traditional claim of Feild’s success in bringing Tractarianism to the colony while exploring the resistance to Feild’s initiatives and the reasons for his disappointments.There are many analyses of Tractarianism – a nineteenth-century form of Anglicanism that emphasized its Catholic origins – but how did people in the colonies react to the High Church movement?

The death of Claude Lévi-Strauss in 2009 provides the obligation as well as the opportunity to engage in such an exercise of historical retrospect. Lévi-Strauss moved with characteristic creative aplomb across a remarkable range of potential disciplinary homes, but anthropology remained his home base, the place of comfort from which to discomfit other disciplines. The history of anthropology therefore has a particular claim to the movement he founded and popularized beyond its origins in Saussurean linguistics despite the fact that French structuralism has<br>

  Author(s) MAJEWSKI JOHN<br>
  Abstract: During the eighty years between the American Revolution and the Civil War, slavery was indispensable to the economic development of the United States.

  Book Title: Citizen Subject-Foundations for Philosophical Anthropology<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Steven<br>
  Abstract: What can the universals of political philosophy offer to those who experience the living paradox of an inegalitarian construction of egalitarian citizenship? Citizen Subject is the summation of +ëtienne BalibarGÇÖs career-long project to think the necessary and necessarily antagonistic relation between the categories of citizen and subject. In this magnum opus, the question of modernity is framed anew with special attention to the self-enunciation of the subject (in Descartes, Locke, Rousseau, and Derrida), the constitution of the community as GÇ£weGÇ¥ (in Hegel, Marx, and Tolstoy), and the aporia of the judgment of self and others (in Foucualt, Freud, Kelsen, and Blanchot)._x000D_ After the GÇ£humanist controversyGÇ¥ that preoccupied twentieth-century philosophy, Citizen Subject proposes foundations for philosophical anthropology today, in terms of two contrary movements: the becoming-citizen of the subject and the becoming-subject of the citizen. The citizen-subject who is constituted in the claim to a GÇ£right to have rightsGÇ¥ (Arendt) cannot exist without an underside that contests and defies it. HeGÇöor she, because Balibar is concerned throughout this volume with questions of sexual differenceGÇöfigures not only the social relation but also the discontent or the uneasiness at the heart of this relation. The human can be instituted only if it betrays itself by upholding GÇ£anthropological differencesGÇ¥ that impose normality and identity as conditions of belonging to the community._x000D_ The violence of GÇ£civilGÇ¥ bourgeois universality, Balibar argues, is greater (and less legitimate, therefore less stable) than that of theological or cosmological universality. Right is thus founded on insubordination, and emancipation derives its force from otherness._x000D_ Ultimately, Citizen Subject offers a revolutionary rewriting of the dialectic of universality and differences in the bourgeois epoch, revealing in the relationship between the common and the universal ~<br>

  Book Title: The Algerian New Novel-The Poetics of a Modern Nation, 1950-1979<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): ORLANDO VALÉRIE K.<br>
  Abstract: Disputing the claim that Algerian writing during the struggle against French colonial rule dealt almost exclusively with revolutionary themes,
         The Algerian New Novelshows how Algerian authors writing in French actively contributed to the experimental forms of the period, expressing a new age literarily as well as politically and culturally. Looking at canonical Algerian literature as part of the larger literary production in French during decolonization, Valérie K. Orlando considers how novels by Rachid Boudjedra, Mohammed Dib, Assia Djebar, Nabile Farès, Yamina Mechakra, and Kateb Yacine both influenced and were reflectors of the sociopolitical and cultural transformation that took place during this period in Algeria. Although their themes were rooted in Algeria, the avant-garde writing styles of these authors were influenced by early twentieth-century American modernists, the New Novelists of 1940s-50s France, and African American authors of the 1950s-60s. This complex mix of influences led Algerian writers to develop a unique modern literary aesthetic to express their world, a tradition of experimentation and fragmentation that still characterizes the work of contemporary Algerian francophone writers.<br>

Already in Mark hostility against Jesus is first aroused by his claim to exercise a prerogative—to forgive sins—that is God’s alone (Mark 2:7), and the actual plot against his life springs, as in John, from a Sabbath healing (3:6).

  Book Title: The God of All Flesh-and Other Essays<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hanson K.C.<br>
  Abstract: Biblical faith is passionately and relentlessly material in its emphasis. This claim is rooted in the conviction that the creator God loves the creation and summons creation to be in sync with the will of the creator God. This collection of essays is focussed on the bodily life of the world as it ordered in all of its problematic political and economic forms. The phrase of the title “all flesh" in the flood narrative of Genesis 9 refers to all living creatures who are in covenant with God – human beings, animals, birds, and fish – as recipients of God’s grace, as dependent upon God’s generosity, and as destined for praise and obedience to God. The insistence on the materiality of life as the subject of the Bible means that the difficult issues of economics and the demanding questions of politics are front and centre in the text. So the Pentateuch pivots around the Exodus narrative and the emancipation from an unbearable context of abusive labour practices. In a similar manner, the prophets endlessly address such questions of social policy and the wisdom teachers reflect on how to manage the material things of life and social relationships for the well-being of the community. This emphasis, pervasive in these essays, is a powerful alternative and a strong resistance against all of the contemporary efforts to transcend (escape!) the material into some form of the “spiritual". All around us are efforts to find an easier, more harmonious faith. This may be evoked simply because of a desire to shield economic, political advantage from the inescapable critique of biblical faith. Such a temptation is a serious misreading of the Bible and a critical misjudgment about the nature of human existence. Thus the Bible addressed the most urgent issues of our day, and refuses the “religious temptation" that avoids lived reality where the power of God is a work.<br>

That theological claim, moreover, is at the same time to be understood as an instrument of social construction, no doubt fostered and enhanced through intentional social practice.¹<br>

In the paper I defend the claim that Jaspers’ conception of „worldview“ unites motives from Wilhelm Dilthey and Max Weber, constructing a weberised Dilthey. After some conceptual clarifications I treat first the specific contribution of Dilthey and Max Weber to Jaspers’ theory, and discuss the latter afterwards. Finally, I show that despite its dissappearance in the later<br>

  Book Title: Love and its Critics-From the Song of Songs to Shakespeare and Milton’s Eden<br>
  Publisher: Open Book Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Movsesian Arpi<br>
  Abstract: This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton’s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin’amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur’s phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself – in short, the very things it resists. The book engages with some of the seminal literature of the Western canon, including the Bible, the poetry of Ovid, and works by English authors such as William Shakespeare and John Donne, and with criticism that stretches from the earliest readings of the Song of Songs to contemporary academic literature. Lively and enjoyable in its style, it attempts to restore a sense of pleasure to the reading of poetry, and to puncture critical insistence that literature must be outwitted. It will be of value to professional, graduate, and advanced undergraduate scholars of literature, and to the educated general reader interested in treatments of love in poetry throughout history.<br>

However, the genealogy of the concept in modern American anthropology may, as Regna Darnell shows (2001: 39, 40), be correctly traced back to Boas’s 1889 article, “On Alternating Sounds,” which drew attention to the ethnocentrism that can result when scholars from our speech community apperceive one sound in another supposedly primitive language as two alternating sounds (e.g., Inuit

The process of suppression results from the claim that postmodern writing blurs genres, transgresses them, or unfixes boundaries that conceal domination or authority, and that “genre” is an anachronistic term and concept.

While pseudonymity—what Kierkegaard elsewhere calls ”polyonymity” (

  Abstract: Best known as a child psychologist, Jean Piaget considered himself primarily an epistemologist who was engaged in empirical research on the development of knowledge. In this book, philosopher and psychologist Richard F. Kitchener provides the first comprehensive study in English of Piaget's genetic epistemology, or his theory of knowledge. Drawing largely on a careful perusal of Piaget's untranslated works, Kitchener presents little-known aspects of Piaget's thought and argues that, in fact, Piagest has been misunderstood and was completely justified in his claim to be an epistemologist rather than a psychologist.<br>

  Book Title: Sonata Fragments-Romantic Narratives in Chopin, Schumann, and Brahms<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Davis Andrew<br>
  Abstract: In
      Sonata Fragments, Andrew Davis argues that the Romantic sonata is firmly rooted, both formally and expressively, in its Classical forebears, using Classical conventions in order to convey a broad constellation of Romantic aesthetic values. This claim runs contrary to conventional theories of the Romantic sonata that place this nineteenth-century musical form squarely outside inherited Classical sonata procedures. Building on Sonata Theory, Davis examines moments of fracture and fragmentation that disrupt the cohesive and linear temporality in piano sonatas by Chopin, Brahms, and Schumann. These disruptions in the sonata form are a narrative technique that signify temporal shifts during which we move from the outer action to the inner thoughts of a musical agent, or we move from the story as it unfolds to a flashback or flash-forward. Through an interpretation of Romantic sonatas as temporally multi-dimensional works in which portions of the music in any given piece can lie inside or outside of what Sonata Theory would define as the sonata-space proper, Davis reads into these ruptures a narrative of expressive features that mark these sonatas as uniquely Romantic.<br>

  Book Title: Levinas and the Trauma of Responsibility-The Ethical Significance of Time<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Coe Cynthia D.<br>
  Abstract: Levinas's account of responsibility challenges dominant notions of time, autonomy, and subjectivity according to Cynthia D. Coe. Employing the concept of trauma in Levinas's late writings, Coe draws together his understanding of time and his claim that responsibility is an obligation to the other that cannot be anticipated or warded off. Tracing the broad significance of these ideas, Coe shows how Levinas revises our notions of moral agency, knowledge, and embodiment. Her focus on time brings a new interpretive lens to Levinas's work and reflects on a wider discussion of the fragmentation of human experience as an ethical subject. Coe's understanding of trauma and time offers a new appreciation of how Levinas can inform debates about gender, race, mortality, and animality.<br>

  Author(s): Ipgrave Michael<br>
  Abstract: Building a Better Bridgeis a record of the fourth "Building Bridges" seminar held in Sarajevo in 2005 as part of an annual symposium on Muslim-Christian relations cosponsored by Georgetown University and the Archbishop of Canterbury. This volume presents the texts of the public lectures with regional presentations on issues of citizenship, religious believing and belonging, and the relationship between government and religion-both from the immediate situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and from three contexts further afield: Britain, Malaysia, and West Africa. Both Christian and Muslim scholars propose key questions to be faced in addressing the issue of the common good. How do we approach the civic sphere as believers in particular faiths and as citizens of mixed societies? What makes us who we are, and how do our religious and secular allegiances relate to one another? How do we accommodate our commitment to religious values with acknowledgment of human disagreement, and how can this be expressed in models of governance and justice? How are we, mandated by scriptures to be caretakers, to respond to the current ecological and economic disorder of our world? Michael Ipgrave and his contributors do not claim to provide definitive answers to these questions, but rather they further a necessary dialogue and show that, while Christian and Islamic understandings of God may differ sharply and perhaps irreducibly, the acknowledgment of one another as people of faith is the surest ground on which to build trust, friendship, and cooperation.<br>

Similarly, identity formation and construction are based in narrative forms and functions (Georgakopoulou 2006; Taylor 2006).

  Book Title: Wittgenstein Reads Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Descombes Vincent<br>
  Abstract: Did Freud present a scientific hypothesis about the unconscious, as he always maintained and as many of his disciples keep repeating? This question has long prompted debates concerning the legitimacy and usefulness of psychoanalysis, and it is of utmost importance to Lacanian analysts, whose main project has been to stress Freud's scientific grounding. Here Jacques Bouveresse, a noted authority on Ludwig Wittgenstein, contributes to the debate by turning to this Austrian-born philosopher and contemporary of Freud for a candid assessment of the early issues surrounding psychoanalysis. Wittgenstein, who himself had delivered a devastating critique of traditional philosophy, sympathetically pondered Freud's claim to have produced a scientific theory in proposing a new model of the human psyche. What Wittgenstein recognized--and what Bouveresse so eloquently stresses for today's reader--is that psychoanalysis does not aim to produce a change limited to the intellect but rather seeks to provoke an authentic change of human attitudes. The beauty behind the theory of the unconscious for Wittgenstein is that it breaks away from scientific, causal explanations to offer new forms of thinking and speaking, or rather, a new mythology.<br>

It is less frequently noticed, however, that his vision of consciousness remained utterly traditional and bound to the idea of consciousness as the internal perception of “objects” of a certain type—the paradigm of clear and immediate perception.

  Book Title: Genuine Multiculturalism-The Tragedy and Comedy of Diversity<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): FOSTER CECIL<br>
  Abstract: While many modern societies are noted for their diversity, the resulting challenge is to determine how citizens from different backgrounds and cultures can see themselves and each other as equals, and be treated equally. In Genuine Multiculturalism, Cecil Foster shows that a society's failure to bridge these differences is the tragedy of modern living and that pretending it is possible to mechanically develop fraternity and solidarity among diverse groups is akin to seeking out comedy. Arguing that genuine multiculturalism is the search for social justice by individuals who have been trapped by ascribed identities or newcomers who have been shut out of perceived ethnic homelands, Foster details how this process, in essence, is the story of the Americas. Reconceptionalizing the terms of multiculturalism, he offers an intervention into Canada's claim that its definition and practice are based on recognizing equality of citizenship. Identifying genuine multiculturalism as an ongoing work in progress, rather than a tightly defined policy position, Foster challenges readers to imagine a greater and more harmonious ideal. A necessary theoretical reconsideration of diversity within society, Genuine Multiculturalism refocuses the debate about ideals and practices in modern societies.<br>

  Author(s): Mazlish Bruce<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging book one of the most esteemed cultural historians of our time turns his attention to major questions about human experience and the attempts to understand it "scientifically." Bruce Mazlish considers the achievements, failings, and possibilities of the human sciences-a domain that he broadly defines to include the social sciences, literature, psychology, and hermeneutic studies. In a rich and original synthesis built upon the work of earlier philosophers and historians, Mazlish constructs a new view of the nature and meaning of the human sciences.Starting with the remote human past and moving through the Age of Discovery to the present day, the author discusses what sort of knowledge the human sciences claim to offer. He looks closely at the positivistic aspirations of the human sciences, which are modeled after the natural sciences, and at their interpretive tendencies. In an analysis of scientific method and scientific community, he explores the roles they can or should assume in the human sciences. Mazlish's approach is genuinely interdisciplinary, and he draws on an array of topics, from civil society to globalization to the interactions of humans and machines, to inform his thought-provoking discussion of historical consciousness.<br>

According to this view, the mythical description of the cosmos as constructed from a variety of pure geometrical figures, which Plato records in the

  Book Title: Shattered Voices-Language, Violence, and the Work of Truth Commissions<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Phelps Teresa Godwin<br>
  Abstract: Following periods of mass atrocity and oppression, states are faced with a question of critical importance in the transition to democracy: how to offer redress to victims of the old regime without perpetuating cycles of revenge. Traditionally, balance has been restored through arrests, trials, and punishment, but in the last three decades, more than twenty countries have opted to have a truth commission investigate the crimes of the prior regime and publish a report about the investigation, often incorporating accounts from victims. Although many praise the work of truth commissions for empowering and healing through words rather than violence, some condemn the practice as a poor substitute for traditional justice, achieved through trials and punishment. There has been until now little analysis of the unarticulated claim that underlies the truth commissions' very existence: that language-in this case narrative stories-can substitute for violence. Acknowledging revenge as a real and deep human need,
      Shattered Voicesexplores the benefits and problems inherent when a fragile country seeks to heal its victims without risking its own future. In developing a theory about the role of language in retribution, Teresa Godwin Phelps takes an interdisciplinary approach, delving into sources from Greek tragedy toHamlet, from Kant to contemporary theories about retribution, from the Babylonian law codes to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Report. She argues that, given the historical and psychological evidence about revenge, starting afresh by drawing a bright line between past crimes and a new government is both unrealistic and unwise. When grievous harm happens, a rebalancing is bound to occur, whether it is orderly and lawful or disorderly and unlawful.Shattered Voicescontends that language is requisite to any adequate balancing, and that a solution is viable only if it provides an atmosphere in which storytelling and subsequent dialogue can flourish.

First, you know, a new theory is attacked as absurd; then it is admitted to be true, but obvious and insignificant; finally it is seen to be so important that its adversaries claim that they themselves discovered it.”¹ Something like this has already occurred with the theory advanced by Thomas Kuhn in the twenty years since the publication of

  Abstract: In his monumental 
                     Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature (1979) Richard Rorty painstakingly deconstructed the logical edifice of Western epistemology, leaving in its wake the dust of a thousand rarefied conversations. In later writings Rorty, among others, espoused a new pragmatism that emphasized local truths, community cohesion and civil conversation. Rorty and others did not claim that epistemology did not exist, but rather that epistemologies formulated and reformulated themselves in the interactional instabilities of local community life—all in a myriad of conversations that would edify the public.¹<br>

  Book Title: Aliens and Sojourners-Self as Other in Early Christianity<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DUNNING BENJAMIN H.<br>
  Abstract: Early Christians spoke about themselves as resident aliens, strangers, and sojourners, asserting that otherness is a fundamental part of being Christian. But why did they do so and to what ends? How did Christians' claims to foreign status situate them with respect to each other and to the larger Roman world as the new movement grew and struggled to make sense of its own boundaries?
      Aliens and Sojournersargues that the claim to alien status is not a transparent one. Instead, Benjamin Dunning contends, it shaped a rich, pervasive, variegated discourse of identity in early Christianity. Resident aliens and foreigners had long occupied a conflicted space of both repulsion and desire in ancient thinking. Dunning demonstrates how Christians and others in antiquity capitalized on this tension, refiguring the resident alien as being of a compelling doubleness, simultaneously marginal and potent. Early Christians, he argues, used this refiguration to render Christian identity legible, distinct, and even desirable among the vast range of social and religious identities and practices that proliferated in the ancient Mediterranean. Through close readings of ancient Christian texts such as Hebrews, 1 Peter, theShepherd of Hermas, and theEpistle to Diognetus, Dunning examines the markedly different ways that Christians used the language of their own marginality, articulating a range of options for what it means to be Christian in relation to the Roman social order. His conclusions have implications not only for the study of late antiquity but also for understanding the rhetorics of religious alienation more broadly, both in the ancient world and today.<br>

  Abstract: Given the flexibility of alien and foreign status as a trope, early Christians found further uses for it in addition to labeling themselves. As I have argued, the claim to alien status is a relational one, drawing a boundary that defines an outside in relation to an inside. In the traditional valorization of the alien topos (as seen in 1 Peter, Hebrews, and 
                  Diognetus), outsider and insider terms get reversed, so that, by claiming the name “alien,” Christians mark their insider status with a revalued language of alterity. But because of this relational dynamic, small differences in emphasis could produce<br>

  Book Title: The Machine Question-Critical Perspectives on AI, Robots, and Ethics<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Gunkel David J.<br>
  Abstract: One of the enduring concerns of moral philosophy is deciding who or what is deserving of ethical consideration. Much recent attention has been devoted to the "animal question" -- consideration of the moral status of nonhuman animals. In this book, David Gunkel takes up the "machine question": whether and to what extent intelligent and autonomous machines of our own making can be considered to have legitimate moral responsibilities and any legitimate claim to moral consideration. The machine question poses a fundamental challenge to moral thinking, questioning the traditional philosophical conceptualization of technology as a tool or instrument to be used by human agents. Gunkel begins by addressing the question of machine moral agency: whether a machine might be considered a legitimate moral agent that could be held responsible for decisions and actions. He then approaches the machine question from the other side, considering whether a machine might be a moral patient due legitimate moral consideration. Finally, Gunkel considers some recent innovations in moral philosophy and critical theory that complicate the machine question, deconstructing the binary agent--patient opposition itself. Technological advances may prompt us to wonder if the science fiction of computers and robots whose actions affect their human companions (think of HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey) could become science fact. Gunkel's argument promises to influence future considerations of ethics, ourselves, and the other entities who inhabit this world.<br>

The strangeness of the political position Rice is attempting commands attention. Are Rice’s efforts to realign Republican foreign policy with a civil rights agenda sincere?

  Abstract: “What are scopic regimes?” recently asked a curious, unnamed Internet questioner on

He nonetheless could claim that “the advantage of the concept of ‘scopic regime’ is that it supersedes the traditional distinction between technological determinism . . . and social construction. . . . In the case of scopic regimes, culture and technology interact.” And then,<br>

  Comparative Perspectives on “Redemption through Sin” from:

  Abstract: As writers, the Historians of Religions presented readers with a model impossible to copy. That is, while their creations were “about” religion, neither their writings nor the forms of religion they described were, in any direct sense, replicable by the reader. This irreproducibility, I suggest, echoes their very modernity as writers. The History of Religions, in form and in content, positioned itself to be unparalleled, unique, autonomous, a species of one—just as did modern art and the modern artist. This parallel is particularly significant because it was on this basis that the foundational claim for the autonomy of religion<br>

What is the relevance ofZarathustrafor Nietzsche’s later work? One might argue that the ecstatic poetry of Nietzsche’s enigmatic “gift” is actually a parody of mystical affirmations, or an ironic warning against overexuberant hopes and loves. Given Nietzsche’s attack on ascetic practices and mystical states in theGenealogy, such an interpretation cannot be dismissed. Yet, Nietzsche’s later writing, viewed with a discerning eye, also<br>

The difficulty in part lies in the fact that the terms “equipment” and “meditation” are used in a distinctive technical sense. Furthermore, why one would want to transform “logos” into “ethos” equally requires explanation. Hence the reader is alerted that reading this book will require a certain patience.

  Abstract: Cause and chance have been traditionally thought of as antonyms. This understanding goes back to the Greeks who held that knowledge of a cause ruled out the operation of chance, and vice versa. In early modern Europe, Calvin and Spinoza did their best to define contingency out of existence. In the eighteenth century, Leibniz, Montesquieu, and Hume followed suit. Outcomes that appear to be the result of chance, Hume wrote, may be the product of “the secret operation of contrary causes.”¹ Montesquieu makes a more extreme claim, insisting, “If the fortune of a battle, that is, a particular case, has<br>

  Abstract: That language and consciousness are intimately bound up with one another is a commonplace. How they interact is harder to ascertain. Post-Saussurian literary theorists claim perhaps too much for the priority of language over consciousness.¹ Philosophers concerned with this issue, such as Nietzsche or Wittgenstein, also acknowledge the impact of language on consciousness but stress the restrictions that linguistic structures and functions put on thinking. For example, in

Its violence exposed the hidden dependency of every way of life—economic, religious, artistic, philosophical—on a political sphere whose practices and disorders accumulate meaning almost imperceptibly over generations. If violence is not to rule public life, each domain must become aware of this dependency and alter itself to accommodate “history.” Even philosophers must learn to

  Book Title: I Am You-The Hermeneutics of Empathy in Western Literature, Theology and Art<br>

  Abstract: Important trends in contemporary intellectual life celebrate difference, divisiveness, and distinction. Speculative writing increasingly highlights "hermeneutic gaps" between human beings, their histories, and their hopes. In this book Karl Morrison identifies an alternative to this disruption. He explores for the first time the entire legacy of thought revolving around the challenging claim "I am you"--perhaps the most concise possible statement of bonding through empathy. Professor Morrison shows that the hope for thoroughgoing understanding and inclusion in another's world view is central to the West's moral/intellectual tradition. He maintains that the West may yet escape the fatal flaw of casting that hope in paradigms of sexual and aesthetic dominance--examples of empathetic participation inspired by hunger for power, as well as by love.<br>

  Abstract: Using France as the most representative case of a Catholic context, Bélanger argues that as French society became more secularized intellectuals replaced the clergy as arbitrators of justice and enlightenment. Catholic morality was consolidated by the scholastic tradition and confirmed by the Counter-Reformation, providing the foundation that allowed the establishment of a lay elite. Bélanger describes the progressive takeover of positions of influence by the new elite in Catholic society and examines arguments used by thinkers from the seventeenth to the twentieth century to legitimize their positions. In contrast, the Anglo-Saxon Protestant tradition, due to its emphasis on the priesthood of all believers, led to recognition of the individual's conscience as the sole judge of her or his deeds and failed to provide intellectuals with the basis for any claim to serve as moral leaders in political affairs.<br>

The role of intellectuals is derived from and legitimized by an ethical system that relied on reason to discover and explicate objective justice.

If there is an increase in the transnational flows of people, commodities, labour, and information, and if these trends are accompanied by the declining role of the state and the emergence of international institutions, what does this mean for our moral obligations to those beyond the traditional spaces of family, community, and particularly the nation? My interest in cosmopolitanism lies specifically at the intersection of what<br>

Although Terry Clark’s (1973) claim for a general shift in temperament in the Latin Quarter from cartesianism to spontaneism is less an explanation than a description of the effects of some other causal factors, it seems indisputable that a<br>

  Abstract: There is a tension in the ‘National Histories in Europe’ project that became clear at the first session of the Glamorgan conference from which this volume is derived. The tension – and it is a legitimate tension – is between, on the one hand, history as offering a disinterested, ‘scientific’ account of historical reality that makes a claim, however attenuated, to objectivity and, on the other, particular human solidarities as objects not just of study but of commitment.¹<br>

  Abstract: From the beginning, Freudian psychoanalysis stood apart from other theories of the unconscious in relating the emergence of unconscious mental formations directly back to events and fantasies that shaped the mind in childhood. Freud decisively rejected all metaphysical and dialectical accounts of the emergence of consciousness from a nebulous unconscious (theories which had their roots in the idealism of Hegel, Schelling and Schopenhauer). He rejected Breuer’s claim (derived from the Janet school) that the presence of ‘hypnoid’ dissociative states was a necessary condition for the repression of a representation.

  Author(s) Evans John H.<br>
  Abstract: The emergence of synthetic biology has led some commentators to raise some deep and abstract ethical issues. It has been repeatedly claimed, for example, that synthetic biology will teach people to accept a different notion of what it means to be human—a view I will call the teaching humanness (TH) claim. TH claims have been made about various scientific innovations over the centuries, as well as in more recent debates in public policy bioethics, where such claims are routinely made and then ignored. In this paper I first discuss why claims like this are ignored in public policy bioethics,<br>

Practically nonexistent, until the second half of the 1970s except for the presence of certain writers, it is now laying claim to a well-defined space within the “Canadian mosaic.” Symptomatic of this trend is the fact that publishing houses such as Coach House, Wallace, Québec Amérique, and others,¹ are publishing Canadian-Latin American authors in English and French translation. Apart from this activity, there are also publishing efforts in the Latin American ethno-cultural sphere itself, characterized by editorial criteria that vary from publisher to publisher; however, all these publishers give priority to the<br>

As the narrative approach has become more prominent it has, predictably, attracted its share of criticism, and there has been a fairly strong reaction against the idea that our lives can profitably be understood in narrative terms. The most common and forceful objection to this approach is often formulated as a kind of dilemma: either narrative theories really mean to claim that our lives are significantly like literary narratives or these views<br>

  Abstract: A central tenet of critical medical humanities is the claim that biomedicine does not hold all the keys to understanding the experience of illness, how responses to treatment are mediated, or how it outcomes and prognosis are revealed over time. We further suggest that biomedicine cannot wholly explain how illness may be expressed physiologically. So much that influences that expression derives from cultural context, emotional response, and how illness is interpreted and understood that this knowledge cannot be exhausted with the tools of biomedicine.<br>

  Book Title: The Ethics of Deconstruction-Derrida and Levinas<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Critchley Simon<br>
  Abstract: The Ethics of Deconstruction, Simon Critchley's first book, was originally published to great acclaim in 1992. It was the first book to argue for the ethical turn in Derrida's work and to show as powerfully as possible how deconstruction has persuasive ethical consequences that are vital to our thinking through of questions of politics and democracy. Rather than being concerned with deconstruction in terms of the contradictions inherent in any text - an approach typical of the early Derrida and those in literary criticism aiming to extract a critical method for an application to literature - Critchley concerns himself with the philosophical context necessary for an understanding of the ethics of deconstructive reading. Far from being some sort of value-free nihilism or textual free-play, Critchley showed the ethical impetus that was driving Derrida's work. His claim was that Derrida's understanding of ethics has to be understood in relation to his engagement with the work of Levinas and the book lays out the details of their philosophical confrontation.<br>

  Abstract: Psychoanalysis is an antiphilosophy. Despite the precision of this concept and this claim, their implications remain controversial. This book thus introduces the concept of antiphilosophy, speaks of its constitution and pertinence with respect to psychoanalysis, and examines the consequences of such a determination through a sequence of case-studies. Although the concept has some highly abstract aspects and a somewhat forbidding intellectual history, it is deployed here, first, as a kind of corrosive of received ideas, and, second, as an affirmative means of characterising psychoanalysis that captures something essential, if often elided, about the peculiar status of the practice.<br>

  Abstract: The book offers a reading of a group of authors and texts dating from 1750 to the early twentieth century and used as examples to illustrate a mode of reading and of interpretation. The most extensive reading offered is that of Rousseau, who is considered at length in an overview that includes the major fictional, political and confessional writings. In the case of Proust and of Rilke, the corpus is much less extended, although it claims to be representative of structures that recur in the work as a whole. No such claim is made for Nietzsche, where the reading of<br>

  Author(s) Watkin Christopher<br>
  Abstract: What does Gadamer mean by his claim that ‘art addresses us’? It is a signature claim of philosophical hermeneutics and follows directly upon Gadamer’s assertion of the phenomenological priority of meaning in the experience of art. Not only does this emphasise Gadamer’s dialogical approach to art but it is the culmination of his critique of aesthetic subjectivism. By asserting the primacy of meaning, philosophical hermeneutics affirms the ontic priority of those cultural horizons which shape a spectator’s consciousness and in which he or she must partake as a precondition of achieving transformed understanding. However, a central question remains unavoidable: what<br>

  Abstract: The multiplicity of configurations and the multiplicity of options within each configuration support the claim that theory indeed is a theoretical construction, or a mode of political thought in Freeden’s sense. Theories offer not just explanations for complex phenomena, but also an inclusive understanding of the phenomena. They do this by defining the political concepts and thus decontesting them. This is a point worth stressing: theories do offer explanations—that being their manifest function, after all—but on a prior and deeper level, they define political concepts for

  Author(s) Ananich Boris V.<br>
  Abstract: Diverse archival aims mirror diverse uses of the past in general. At one extreme are disinterested efforts to learn and understand what has actually happened; at the other, partisan zeal to fabricate a past that suits present needs—to forge an identity, to secure a legacy, to validate a conquest or a claim, to prove a preeminence. The role of archives in these contrary goals is symptomatic, indeed, crucial. The conflict is exemplified today in a widening gulf between established archival repute and emerging archival reality.<br>

I begin by examining his depictions of the divine feminine and his related claim that God is most perfectly witnessed in women. His argument is peppered by constant invocations and references to the deep existential intimacy between man and woman as reflected in the primordial myth of Adam and Eve’s creation.

  Abstract: The move to read big data in the humanities necessitates new forms of reading, new types of interpretation. As we consider macro-level readings of large corpora, visualization is especially helpful. The most effective way to draw meaning from large data sets is through visual forms and patterns. Stephen Ramsay (2011) makes a claim for “the primacy of pattern as the basic hermeneutical function” (xi), meaning the display of visual patterns is a form of interpretation. Rather than “translating” those patterns into textual form, humanists can retain them as evidence of reading. Ramsay maintains that visual forms do indeed constitute a<br>

Whether the Aborigines saw it in this light is extremely doubtful: the phrase ‘Debatable Land’ refers not so much to aboriginal beliefs, as to certain assumptionsof their white interrogators.

So a dictum becomes tempting: wherever mystery and freedom meet, a variety of faiths bubble up; wherever, therefore, people prize freedom they will support a significant presumption in favor of honoring that variety. Many give preliminary consent to such a dictum. But it quickly runs into difficulties.

  Abstract: Humanitarian groups have failed, Fiona Terry believes, to face up to the core paradox of their activity: humanitarian action aims to alleviate suffering, but by inadvertently sustaining conflict it potentially prolongs suffering. In

The author makes the controversial claim that aid agencies act as though the initial decision to supply aid satisfies any need for ethical discussion and are often blind to the moral quandaries of aid. Terry focuses on four historically relevant cases: Rwandan camps in Zaire, Afghan camps in Pakistan, Salvadoran and Nicaraguan camps in Honduras, and Cambodian camps in Thailand.<br>

  Abstract: Throughout this book my compass has been the claim put forward in chapter 3 that representation/aesthetics is prior to interpretation/hermeneutics and that it is better to investigate the writing of history from the perspective of representation than from that of interpretation. Interpretation is something one does with texts that already exist, and the phrase “interpreting 
                  the past ” can therefore never be more than a deconstructivist metaphor. So when the linguistic (or, rather, rhetorical) turn in contemporary philosophy of history put a premium on interpretation at the expense of representation, the result was what one might call an “etherealization” of<br>

  Abstract: Despite a lot of variation in the commentaries, from the earliest of them onward Antichrist was frequently recognized as the supreme adversary and herald of the final days in part by his 
                  resemblance to the true Christ. “For the deceiver,” writes Hippolytus, “seeks to liken himself in all things to the Son of God” (Antichrist 6 [GCS 1:7–8; ANF 5:206]). Born among Jews, he would send his apostles to the nations and convert multitudes through the working of miracles. He would claim to be the messiah and “sit in the temple of God, leading astray those who worship him<br>

  Abstract: The concept of redundancy employed in this essay is the one used in mathematics and linguistics to designate symbols that do not add information to a sequence.

  Book Title: A Companion to Friedrich Nietzsche-Life and Works<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Bishop Paul<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche looms over modern literature and thought; according to Gottfried Benn, "everything my generation discussed, thought through innerly; one could say: suffered; or one could even say: took to the point of exhaustion - all of it had already been said . . . by Nietzsche; all the rest was just exegesis." Nietzsche's influence on intellectual life today is arguably as great; witness the various societies, journals, and websites and the steady stream of papers, collections, and monographs. This ‘Companion’ offers new essays from the best Nietzsche scholars, emphasizing the interrelatedness of his life and thought, eschewing a superficial biographical method but taking seriously his claim that great philosophy is “the self-confession of its author and a kind of unintended and unremarked ‘memoir’.” Each essay examines a major work by Nietzsche; together, they offer an advanced introduction for students of German Studies, philosophy, and comparative literature as well as for the lay reader. Re-establishing the links between Nietzsche's philosophical texts and their biographical background, the volume alerts Nietzsche scholars and intellectual historians to the internal development of his thought and the aesthetic construction of his identity as a philosopher.

Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: The book’s eleven essays focus on poverty or economic disadvantage: one piece deals with available data on economic variables relating to crime and legal representation, the other ten directly or in passing endorse or reject the independence thesis. The quality of the essays is mixed. On the positive side, Jeremy Waldron quickly adapts an argument from the overinclusiveness of legal rules to reject indigence as a legal justification for property crime. Stephen Morse usefully rehearses and dismisses prevalent invalid inferences from economic disadvantage to criminal nonculpability. Loren Lomasky’s welfarist libertarian case for subsidizing legal representation of criminal defendants is nicely outlined. William Heffernan’s reliance on restrictions on justifications available to decision makers is a potentially fruitful move. At points some of the essays progress by bare assignments of burdens of proof rather than hard argument. Must dependence theorists have in hand a complete theory of distributive justice? Who must show that notions of authority bar judges from invoking controversial normative theories, at least when consistent with authoritative legal sources? Who must show that criteria of legal responsibility should include morally relevant psychological variables, such as stress, in addition to minimal normative and cognitive capacities? Sometimes the argument is too brief. Because legal rules need not advertise their background justifications, defendants often plausibly can claim that deviation from a rule of property law vindicates the rule’s justification. Thus, against Waldron, it is unlikely that the mere “logic” of property rights prevents indigence from being a legal justification for property crimes. More needs to be said. Brevity particularly mars Pettit’s “republican” defense of the dependence thesis in criminal sentencing. Because the defense requires that criminal sanctions aim at assuring nondomination of victims, indigence can ground different sanc~<br>

Author(s): Vidal Fernando<br>
Abstract: The staminal hypothesis was extremely successful and inspired curious elaborations. In 1719 a collection appeared of
            Essays on Providence and on the Physical Possibility of the Resurrection. Published in French, its claim to have been “translated from the English of Dr. B.” for a while turned Boyle into the presumed author. The book has been attributed to Jean‐François Bion, a French priest who converted to Protestantism after being chaplain to Huguenotgalériens.98Bion’s purpose was to elucidate Providence and resurrection physiologically. The will, he explained, has no influence on bodily processes such as the circulation of the blood but can control others (for example, breathing) that are just as essential to life and as much governed by general and immutable laws. The reason why some functions can be voluntarily directed is that they depend on an excess of fluids, with which we are free to do what we want. It is the same, Bion claimed, with Providence. God originally put in nature fluids that lack a determinate function, and these he uses occasionally to alter the course of nature without suspending its laws (see
                  , p. 18). Thus could He stop the movement of the sun and the moon so that Joshua could defeat his enemies (see Josh. 10:12–13) or (a physico‐theological favorite) make the iron axe float on the waters of the river Jordan.E<br>

Abstract: Michelle Rosaldo’s (
            1982,1973) studies of public speech in the Philippines, at the advent of Western influence, provide one splendid example of such work. Rosaldo argues that the native Ilongots’ traditional, flowery, indirect public speech style implicitly acknowledged their idea that no one person had a singular claim to the truth and that no one could do very much to enforce one version of the truth in a dispute between differing truth claims. When Western imperial powers overshadowed local rulers’ power, the speech style became more direct and forceful. The West brought the idea that there was one universal, single truth, and that there were powerful institutions that could enforce that single truth, even if not everyone accepted it as truth. These new collective representations—new notions of truth, power, and personhood—were inseparable from the change to a more direct, brusque, conflictive, Western style of public discourse.<br>

Abstract: I have no regrets. In retrospect, however, this approach allowed sociocultural anthropologists to dismiss linguistic anthropology as merely method, to adopt piecemeal many of its insights without necessarily identifying them as linguistic. I believe that the relative eclipse of linguistics or linguistic anthropology in many departments is due primarily to the success of this strategy of Durantis third paradigm.

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: Although an influential figure within German social theory for decades, Luhmann has never been an especially popular figure in American circles, perhaps because his theory is in actuality what many sociologists have accused Parson’s of being: a theory reducing social actors to nothing more than epiphenomena of their social system. Hence, Luhmann’s book consists of his application of concepts such as system/environment, medium/form, first‐ and second‐order observation, self‐reference and external reference and above all the distinction between psychic systems (systems of consciousness) and social systems (systems of communication) to the realm of art, thereby conceptually transforming it into the “art system.” One of the ironies in Luhmann’s analysis is that his claim for the “autonomy of art” is seemingly refuted by his own, wholly social, assessment of it. Indeed, reading Luhmann’s book is a little like watching Frankenstein at work: his conceptual apparatus renders the ostensibly organic associations we might have of art as being instead mechanical and clinical. For all of Parsons’s own romance with systems theory and cybernetics, his central concern was always with the cultural product of those systems, which he referred to variously as “instrumental activism” and “institutionalized individualism,” that is, the way in which differentiation led to the production of a more complex and sophisticated individualism within the societal community. This constituted Parsons’s standard for the evolution of societies. Luhmann, meanwhile, consistently held that social systems operate “behind the backs” of actors, operating to reduce complexity for such actors, on the one hand, while furthering systems imperatives, on the other. This contrast between mentor and student becomes most obvious in their respective views of culture: while Parsons never fully unpacked the concept of culture in his own work, his emphasis on values and norms opened the door to what today is known as t~<br>

Abstract: Chapter 9 of the

Calamy aimed to rebut charges, for instance, from Samuel Parker, James II’s bishop of Oxford, that the common claim that there were as many as 2,000 ejected ministers was a vast overestimate. This, Calamy says, “cannot but blacken their Memory hereafter, if they should not be clear’d by a just representation.” Though he acknowledges that calculations based on sketchy sources can never claim absolute accuracy, his list of over 2,400 ejected ministers more than vindicates the common assumption as to numbers.15<br>

Abstract: The incomprehensibility of the human being remains. Founded and required by the incomprehensibility of the One whose image and likeness man bears, it is bound up with theology. Nevertheless it does not belong entirely, or even foremost, to theology, because man must comprehend this very incomprehensibility, by opposing it to, and preserving it in front of, every other comprehension that he gains over every other thing—things that can become objects. Let us recall here Paul Ricœur’s brilliant statement: “the claim by knowledge to constitute itself raises the most formidable obstacle to the idea of revelation. In this regard, Husserl’s transcendental idealism potentially contains the very same atheistic outcome as Feuerbach’s idealism of self‐consciousness.”
         46In this sense, which is first of all negative, or rather denegatory, man’s incomprehensibility comes under the domain of philosophy.<br>

Abstract: McNeill, telephone interview, September 17, 2002, and Gemelli (n. 2 above), p. 208, n. 63, remembers quite vividly being invited to New York by Hugh Van Dusen of Harper & Row after McNeill’s 1964 National Book Award for
            The Rise of the West.Van Dusen asked McNeill if he had read any good books lately that he would recommend, and McNeill mentioned Braudel’sMediterranean,which he remembers reading circa 1959–60 and finding its powerful evocation of the sea’slongue duréecongruent with his own experiences in the Mediterranean during the war and in postwar Greece. McNeill remembers Van Dusen’s face going blank, as if he had never heard of Braudel and his book before. While McNeill cannot claim with certainty that he alone was responsible for introducing Braudel to Van Dusen, Braudel was soon on the Harper & Row drawing board—but this was after the second edition preface was written and revisions under way. George Huppert from the University of Illinois at Chicago was instrumental during Braudel’s 1968 Chicago visit in helping Braudel find a translator forLa Méditerranée(telephone conversation, September 21, 2002; George Huppert, “TheAnnalesExperiment,” inCompanion to Historiography,ed. Michael Bentley [London and New York, 1997], p. 874; and Gemelli, pp. 208–9). Braudel received a draft of the Routledge translation while in Chicago and consulted Huppert for his advice. Huppert found the Routledge translation untenable, called Van Dusen at Harper & Row, who flew to Chicago and signed Braudel to a new contract. Huppert himself contracted to find an English translator, but he was unsuccessful after some half‐dozen attempts, and it was Mme. Braudel who found Siân Reynolds, whose sample translation was warmly approved by Huppert. Harper & Row also contracted Orest and Patricia Ranum to proofread the translation.<br>

Abstract: In today’s situation of radical pluralism, an open attitude toward traditions for which there are objective differences is not only possible but, I would argue, necessary. To appreciate this claim, it is necessary, first of all, to acknowledge a distinction between, on the one hand, the understanding of itself that a community presents to others and, on the other, that held by its own adherents.
         62John Henry Newman describes this distinction with typical eloquence: “Defenders of Christianity naturally select as reason for belief, not the highest, truest, the most sacred, the most intimately persuasive, but such as best admit of being exhibited in argument; and these are commonly not the real reasons in the case of religious men.”63The depth and vitality of a tradition depends on maintaining such a “two‐dimensional” religious self‐understanding. The temptation to define one’s religion in purely oppositional terms threatens to suppress those reasons that are “the most intimately persuasive.” When one’s opposition to other religious communities wholly determines one’s religious self‐understanding, religion degenerates into an expression of identity politics. Yet the danger of an oppositional stance toward other traditions leading to such a one‐dimensional religious understanding is not serious when theological challenges are more or less peripheral to a religious community as a whole. In such a situation of “peripheral” pluralism, a community can get away with an oppositional or exclusivist attitude toward other traditions. A core of genuine self‐understanding will remain relatively unaffected by the polemics taking place at a community’s outer limits.<br>

Abstract: What’s the difference between a “limit” and a “boundary,” and does it make a difference? Does it matter, for example, that
      Grenzenin the title of Immanuel Kant’s major work on the philosophy of religion,Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft, is perhaps better translated as “boundaries” and not as “limits”? According to Patrick Bourgeois’s recent book,Philosophy at the Boundary of Reason: Ethics and Postmodernity, much hangs on this distinction. The book pursues three interlocking agendas, each concerning themes of interest to scholars of religion and ethics. The author’s primary agenda is to draw attention to what he sees as a neglected philosophical distinction within the Kantian critical philosophy crucial to a proper interpretation of the notion of the “limit‐boundary of reason” and to the ruinous effects the failure to apprehend this distinction unleashed within twentieth‐century philosophy. Second, he pursues an important new reading of Paul Ricoeur as a philosopher who gets the idea of the limit‐boundary of reason right in his hermeneutical phenomenology. Finally, Bourgeois tries to show how getting the distinction right makes it possible to extricate the positive elements of postmodern ethics (especially Emmanuel Lévinas’s recognition of the ethical claim of alterity) from deconstruction’s false philosophy of limit as closure. In Bourgeois’s view, deconstruction decenters meaning and subjectivity to so large a degree as to render responsible human agency ineffectual.<br>

Abstract: MacIntyre shows how narratives constitute social life: “I can only answer the question ‘What am I to do?’ if I can answer the prior question ‘Of what story or stories do I find myself a part?’ We enter human society, that is, with one or more imputed characters—roles into which we have been drafted” [
         13, p. 216]. While there continues to be argument over the claim that stories are lived before they are recounted and that life is stories being lived out, the work of Carr shows that this is so, for the overall temporal structure of action is narrative in character; life is an inchoate narrative [24]. Human reality is not just a sequence because it can be demonstrated that narrative coherence inheres in “even the most elementary experience or action” [24, p. 88]. Narrative coherence is “an essential structural feature of the very fact ofhavingan experience orperformingan action” [24, p. 88]. Hence, order is present in events even before a narrative is imposed on them, and “the real difference between ‘art’ and ‘life’ is not organization versus chaos, but rather the absence in life of that point of view which transforms events into a story bytellingthem” [24, p. 59]. This emphasis on activity is also found in MacIntyre: “Narrative is not the work of poets, dramatists and novelists reflecting upon events which had no narrative order before one was imposed by the singer or the writer; narrative form is neither disguise nor decoration” [13, p. 211]. For MacIntyre, human actions are themselves enacted narratives; for Carr, it is in living out a life that we achieve a “grasp” at the level of attempting to make meaning or sense of relationships [24]. According to Gare, following this line of thought shows us the following:
               
         Actions are lived stories. The more complex the action, the longer its duration and the more people involved, the more obviously this is the case. Actions such as building a community or developing our understanding of the~<br>

Abstract: Thus I would argue that while the analogical model continues to proliferate, there are other models that emerge from more localized studies. Collins demonstrates, for instance, how an emphasis on the interconnection of race, gender, and class has important ramifications for African American women who, by forcing courts to see them as doubly or triply oppressed, can claim better protection under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (
         1990, 224).16Similarly, Anne McClintock, in her brilliant analysis of Victorian imperialism, argues that race and gender “come into existencein and throughrelation to each other—if in contradictory and conflictual ways” (1995, 5). And it is the contradictory and conflictual relationship that McClintock stresses. Different forms of fetishization, such as the fetishization of white skin, national flags, and lesbians cross‐dressing as men, McClintock argues, cannot simply be lumped under “a single mark of desire without great loss of theoretical subtlety and historical complexity” (184).<br>

Author(s): Lee Hyo‐Dong<br>
Abstract: Taking my cue from Homi Bhabha’s twofold thesis that the colonial and postcolonial history has been characterized by the colonizers’ construction of a binary opposition between pure, homogeneous, and culturally superior Europe and the equally homogeneous but inferior and decadent other of Europe and that the traditionalist, nativist, and nationalist movements of anticolonial resistance have all more or less bought into that binary scheme repressive of hybridity and internal heterogeneity, I suggest the following sociopolitically concrete reformulation of the dialectic.
         42First of all, any claim of pure and homogeneous religious identity made today must initially be put within its proper postcolonial‐neocolonial context via a hermeneutic of suspicion and examined in regard to the degree to which it may or may not be stained with the enduring impact of the centuries‐long imposition of economic, political, and cultural master‐slave relations. For example, when today a European or Euro‐American Christian community calls for a return to the “pure,” “orthodox” tradition in total opposition to modernity—variously called “the world,” “the liberal nation‐state,” “the secular humanistic culture,” and so forth—and castigates feminist and other liberationist voices of resistance springing up both within itself and outside for having been contaminated by modernity, it is apropos to ask if that gesture of repudiation and return is an attempt to maintain an originary myth of pure and homogeneous identity in another package after modernity’s totalizing binary opposition of Europe and Other has been discredited and condemned. Especially, if that community today asserts once more the long‐standing Christian view that Christianity is the only true way, one is all the more drawn to wonder whether that assertion now camouflages a lingering residue of and an effort to perpetuate by other means the sense of culturally superior identity it enjoyed for so long, being at the center ~<br>

Abstract: While much of Frei’s work engages liberalism as its foil, his later work takes the shape of a mediating role between liberal and evangelical theology.
         55In so doing, he puts into effect the claim that the literal sense can include the range of concerns and perspectives across the theological spectrum of Christianity. As one recognizes that these diverse perspectives emerge from the literal sense—in other words, through a shared way of reading—one can recognize a unity within the differences of the church. The literal sense, clearly, is not only hospitable to Jesus Christ; at its best, Frei’s hope is that it enables Christians to be more hospitable to one another and to cultivate an alternative hospitality to its surrounding culture.56The plurality of interpretations in Midrash may thus model the hospitality created by the literal sense as a feature of what “reconstitutes” the Christian community in its distinctiveness and its unity.<br>

Abstract: Although they often go unnoticed and unread, occasionally footnotes themselves become objects of controversy. Recently a well‐known theorist (who will remain anonymous) submitted an essay to
      Critical Inquirythat included this footnote: “6. See Jacques Derrida.” It was obviously to be filled in later (or was it?), but one reader, vetting the manuscript for publication, took serious offense. He could not understand how he was to evaluate the merits of the claim in a sentence thus footnoted. Doesn’t the breeziness of the citation, its offhand and seemingly arrogant nature signal that the essay as a whole commits one of the sins of the well‐established author, that is, the need to skip serious, rigorous, time‐consuming research in order to reach for grand and majestic statements? And, if so, why include a footnote at all?<br>

Abstract: The question is, What criteria does the judge apply in reaching his verdict? I believe that there are two: a theoretical and a practical criterion. Both these criteria are fraught with problems, but I confine myself to just one of these. The theoretical criterion has to do with the striving for truth, where one must distinguish between truth claims and regimes of truth.
            56Religions quite rightly present truth claims, but any claim to possessing the truth, which is typical of exclusivism and inclusivism, is an obstruction to interreligious dialogue, if not to truth itself. Hence I cannot see how one can (want to) achieve interreligious dialogue from an exclusivist or inclusivist position. Striving for truth in dialogue of any kind is difficult enough in itself.<br>

Abstract: The appeal of this language of children’s agency is twofold. First, it helps the social sciences distinguish themselves from the otherwise dominant methods of developmental psychology, which, it is argued, start from the point of view of what children are not yet, namely, developed adults, rather than what they are and can do in and of themselves, as well as in their full cultural and individual diversity. While some would argue that this critique is unfair, nevertheless a stand is taken that you cannot understand childhood without understanding children as competent and diverse social actors. Second, and more important for our purposes, the notion of children’s agency is appealing because it suggests an alternative to how children have generally been understood throughout history. Children actively participate in their social worlds rather than being passive recipients of adult socialization. This claim expands and further develops the Enlightenment view beginning with John Locke and Jean‐Jacques Rousseau that “unenlightened” practices of child rearing ignore children’s distinctive human capabilities. What is added by the new social sciences perspective, however, is both an empirically precise method of stripping away easy adult preconceptions about childhood and, most important, a resulting and perhaps even unprecedented appreciation for children’s own social agency in all its fullness and complexity.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: lq.2006.76.issue-3<br>
Date: 07 2006<br>
Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: Over time, statements such as the LBR have been discussed and alternatives weighed, but librarianship’s discursive practice has, in recent years, largely constituted an orthodoxy that may not be sensitive or responsive to disputation. One voice of this orthodoxy is Robert Hauptman, who writes, “We are free to articulate anything we imagine” [
         30, p. 18], and “If there are more fundamental rights than freedom of thought, then anyone, naturally, can cite those rights when attempting to control what students may read in a class, what libraries may collect, and what Americans may access on the Internet” [30, p. 138]. His first idea is incorrect; there are, in fact, laws that limit what a person can say. Paradoxically, Hauptman also argues against research misconduct on the grounds of responsibility and public interest, but if we are indeed free to say anything we can imagine, we can lie and falsify with impunity. The positive ethos of research integrity is indisputable; violation of the ethos can cause harm. That positive ethos does, however, come into conflict with Hauptman’s first maxim. His second claim is puzzling; if there are more fundamental rights, then those rights probably should supersede a right to access to information. For example, a right to privacy trumps another’s “right” to certain of an individual’s personal information. A right to freedom from harm trumps a person’s “right” to libel another intentionally and with malice. Hauptman also proposes that, in combating censorship, the minority cannot dictate to the majority. However, Paul Ricoeur, arguing for the kind of normative ethics suggested here, says, “Whoever might be a victim must not be sacrificed to the benefit of some common good. This is the anti‐utilitarian point of the Rawlsian theory of justice” [31, p. 65]. It is obvious that the whims of the minority should not hold sway simply because they wish it to be so, but, likewise, the majority should not be able to cause harm to others o~<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: While acknowledging the genre’s limitations, Popkin also insists that the best achieve literary excellence by dramatizing the humdrum rhythms of academic research into meaningful stories—about physical and emotional experiences in the archives, for instance, or the links between historical research and larger issues. Such autobiography thus enriches the understanding of both the human condition and the past. Popkin argues in an excellent chapter that historians’ memoirs of the Holocaust are both transformative texts, through which authors question their “earlier senses of self” (224), and sources of original historical understanding. By defining themselves as scholars rather than as Jews alone, their authors suggest that all survivors did not come out of the war with strengthened Jewish identities. Whether one agrees or not that autobiographies alone could have yielded such insights, the chapter’s broader claim—that the genre illuminates dimensions that conventional scholarship may have missed—is tenable. But one wonders what exactly Popkin is driving at. Should historians simply grant the genre more respect? Engage in it? Use it less fearfully as a source?<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: In response to Patočka’s claim that Christianity has failed to adequately thematize what a Person is—that is, the Person that penetrates the soul with its glance without in turn being seen and that constitutes the soul as a responsible self—Derrida writes that such a reference to “inadequate thematization … seems to appeal to some ultimate adequacy of thematization that could be accomplished” (
      GD,p. 27). Let us remind ourselves of the fact that, in the tradition of responsibility, its Greek moment may come the closest to the ideal of full thematization because it demands knowledge of the reasons, the aim, the meaning of what is done and of the circumstances of one’s decisions or actions. Although Derrida emphasizes that we must be continually aware of the fact that whenever we do not sufficiently thematize whatresponsibilitymeans some irresponsibility insinuates itself into our actions, he also remarks that this is always and everywhere the case. No action, if it is to be a responsible action, is ever consciously or cognitively sufficiently determined. Derrida adds: “One can sayeverywherea priori and nonempirically” (GD,p. 26). If this is so, it is because an action must transcend knowledge to be responsible as well as to include knowledge of what responsibility means. Unless it is the execution of a preestablished theorem or norm, an action merits the titleresponsibleonly if it is also effectuated without full theoretical determination. It follows from this that the thematization of responsibility is, for structural reasons, always lacking—even in the case of the Platonic notion of responsibility rejected by Patočka on the basis that it makes responsibility a function of the knowledge of the good. This is even more the case for the heretically Christian conception of responsibility. Derrida observes that thematization
            
      is, if not denied, at least strictly limited in its pertinence by that other more radical form of responsibility that expos~<br>

Issue: 522064<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: If, as Koselleck has envisaged, history was elevated as the subject of its own absolute self‐knowledge—history itself a unified history of humanity, imperially gathering up all special histories into the unifying realm of the collective singular—it was also empowered by what Ricoeur calls a “hidden form of the same claim” that could act against its untenable status as self‐knowledge and singular time (
         MHF,p. 305). The historical present, now established as the perspective for all temporal formations, is centered as an absolute. Once the collective singular is discredited in its impossible universalizing mission to singularize the history of humanity, it turns to the singular historical moment, which is the now of the historical present. Even today, it insists on the developmental imperative and its familiar claim of a totalizing history; the “vocables of world history” and the imposition of odious comparisons promote programs of catching up with the parade of the historical present attained by modern Euro‐America (MHF,p. 305). The here and now is henceforth distinguished from times past, to be sure, but also from those different temporalities that exist immanently in the modern present but are hidden from it, as in the there and the then, since it is our time that provides both perspective and tribunal. The here and now of actual experience, our modernity, is our history, our time, and never theirs. The distancing of expectation from past experiences thus becomes the condition of asserting the difference of our self‐valorizing and self‐referring modernity and its superiority over both its antecedents and others. But the decision to shift the concept of modernity to the register of an absolute historical present eventually required misrecognizing the apparent contradiction that our time and place is characterized by its unique difference from others. Moreover, the change of index directs attention instead to generalizing the values our modernity embodies an~<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: This is not to argue against the kind of verification fundamental to scientific history, though it does side with Warnock’s observation that a positivist approach can miss the role of human imagination in not merely perceiving but also constructing reality. Rather, it is to argue for something besides the power of description at work in certain narratives, especially those that rise to the level of mythos and make a claim to religious authority. Smith’s narratives do not display fact to be assented to but draw the reader into a malleable reality by means of the malleable plots that traditionally provided the basis for Jewish and Christian ethos and ethic. It can be said that Smith was translating time, not text. Specifically, he translated biblical time in service to, he said, an “ushering in of the dispensation of the fullness of times … a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers … from the days of Adam even to the present time.”
         97Whatever his intention, the effect was to deploy the biblical text in a manner that radically subverted centuries of theologizing on who God is and how humans are to worship God.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: Against the first characterization of Advaita teaching, the recognition of the double‐voiced character of Śaṅkara’s interpretation of the
         anayatvamsutra (II.1.14)—that is, as internally constituted by the realist cosmological discourse that it subverts—suggests that the interpretation of theBhāṣya’steaching in terms of the illusionist doctrine ofmāyāvādais reductionistic. Moreover, well‐intentioned attempts to dissociate Śaṅkara frommāyāvādathat presume a monological conception of theBhāṣya’sdiscourse, attempts such as that of Srinivasa Rao mentioned above, end up effectively conceding the claim they set out to deny; their affirmation of the reality of the world typically appeals to a denial of substantial change, a claim that implicitly relegates changing, finite existences to the realm of the unreal.114As for the static and abstract conception of brahman, this notion can be seen as the result of the later tradition’s attempt to impose a rigid, categorical distinction between the concepts ofīśvaraand the highest (paraṃ) brahman. This effort to systematize Śaṅkara’s somewhat inconsistent, fluid, and intuitive use of the termīśvarawith respect to the various expressions for brahman effectively pulls apart the dialectical interplay between the personalistic and impersonalistic aspects of brahman in theBrahma‐sūtra‐Bhāṣya. What Hacker characterizes as an “illogical” combination of intuitive theism and intellectual monism can perhaps be better understood as an instance of what Michael Sells, in a discussion of apophatic language in the West, calls “a discourse of double propositions.”115A reading of theBrahma‐sūtra‐Bhāṣyathat appreciates the creative interplay among this text’s multiple voices preserves the vitality and intensity of theBhāṣya’sdiscourse on brahman, a liveliness of expression that we may assume more accurately reflects Śaṅkara’s religious vision.<br>

Abstract: Characteristic of this new attitude toward the past are the closing words of Sanders’s recently published volume,
         Adaptation and Appropriation(2006), in the Routledge Critical Idiom series. Opening her final paragraph with the claim that “We need then to restore to the subgenres or practices of adaptation and appropriation a genuinely celebratory comprehension of their capacity for creativity, and for comment and critique,” she concludes: “Adaptation and appropriation … are all about multiple interactions and a matrix of possibilities. They are, endlessly and wonderfully, about seeing things come back to us in as many forms as possible” (Sanders2006, 160). This is the rhetoric of hedonistic liberalism, celebrating multiplicity and pluralism for its own sake, for the choices it allows; it is Fredric Jameson’s postmodernity whose “relationship to the past is that of a consumer adding another rare object to the collection, or another flavour to the international banquet” (1998, 129). Typically, there is no word about the future re‐vision might help to envision, no sense of “memory as a means to liberation” (Greene1991b, 291), of the interlocking of memory and the feminist project, of looking back in order to move forward. On the left, concerns about the disappearance of the future and capitalism’s increasing monopoly on it are growing, as are laments about the loss of a sense of historical time as a teleology moving away from a past from which we could learn and into a future that would be different (see Gumbrecht2004, 120; see also Jameson2005). There are those who are bitter about it, complaining, as does Terry Eagleton inAfter Theory(2003), that “Over the dreary decades of post‐1970s conservatism, the historical sense had grown increasingly blunted, as it suited those in power that we should be able to imagine no alternative to the present” (Eagleton2003, 6–7).

Author(s): Scimeca Ross<br>
Abstract: Despite the increasing attention given to exploring the relationships between philosophy and librarianship, in‐depth discussion of the meaning of truth has received only scattered attention throughout the literature. At this point, however, it should be noted that the concept of truth is itself a contested term within philosophy. Therefore, for the purposes of this article, we will consider the term as it is used in ordinary language, and we will define the verity of a statement or a thought to cover conformity with fact and agreement with reality, accuracy, and correctness. Demonstrating how two people can claim truth about two contradictory statements provides the basis for considering why we have to look at the philosophical definitions of truth later in this article.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: What, then, is really at stake in her destruction of a private legal document before the signing of a public register? Perhaps she is acceding to Mrs. Clennam's wish to keep the secret from Arthur if, on reflection, she agrees that the truth would do him no particular good, or perhaps Amy herself is filling a void in his life without the risk of naming it just yet. But this merely helps the woman save face in the otherwise suddenly opened eyes of her victimized charge. Why
         wouldn'tthe truth have done him good after the long lie? And, anyway, do the dead have in their own right no claim on the living? Didn't Dickens for a moment see otherwise, in a flash of notebook inspiration potent enough to justify the contortions of the denouement, even while he later scrambled to smooth over that claim with an ameliorative vision of continuity rather than of rupture and return? What I am calling narratography is a way of listening in on these final exertions of the prose, transacted at the far margins of plot—and of eavesdropping, indeed, on their own scrambled figuration.<br>

Abstract: The principal difference that I want to stress here between the Augustinian mind and the mind postulated by neuroscience is that the coordination of outside and inside, in other words the interplay between the passivity of perception and the activity of attention, intervenes earlier in the former than in the latter. In Augustine, individual attention takes to orchestrating apprehension and remembrance as soon as a sensible impression touches one of the five senses. Edelman instead, in agreement with William James’s claim that “the thoughts … are the thinker,” believes that the self of “the first person is simply present” to the neuronal unfolding of thoughts but not an intentional witness to it.
         17Edelman postpones the coordinated operations of cortical organization and intentional attention to the stage when the integrated mental scene is collapsed into the subject’s propositional mental activity.18<br>

Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Augustine, “Reply to Faustus the Manichean,” par. 75. To the modern reader, these comments and their attention to character say frustratingly little that echoes the idea that war is justified and limited in principled ways. While it is true that Augustine shows little interest in questions such as noncombatant immunity, the
            jus in bello, and the related idea of human rights, I believe it requires little to draw out such ideas from his account. Intentionally killing innocent persons is symptomatic of a deeper set of disordered motives. Such killing is wrong on Augustinian terms because it flows from concupiscent affections. Others’ claim to be left alone is violated by persons who seek to subject them to their avaricious desires. As Babcock suggests, attending to how virtues restrain human impulses enables us to see how Augustine could speak to such modern concerns. Langan’s views on this matter are qualified, but he captures the general point when he observes that Augustine’s warnings against being motivated by revenge “point the way to a limitation of the horrors of war by focusing on the virtues and attitudes of warriors. This does not eliminate the need for a rule of noncombatant immunity, but it is reasonable to think that care to develop a regard for certain moral virtues and values among soldiers would contribute in an important and perhaps decisive way to the preservation of many of the values which the rules ofjus in belloare designed to protect.” See Hartigan, “St. Augustine on War and Killing: The Problem of the Innocent,” 195–204; Babcock, “Cupiditas and Caritas,” 47; Langan, “Elements of St. Augustine’s Just‐War Theory,” 32; Swift, “Augustine on War and Killing,” 369–83.<br>

Abstract: The reconstruction of theological ethics in the face of its critics requires, in terms of knowledge, replacing making with a multidimensional network of lateral connections. In terms of power, it replaces concern for unbridled forces with the relation between power and responsibility in world creation and orienting human life. What then about the most basic claim of value; that is, what ought to form the normative conviction of a theological and ethical vision? If we jettison here as well monocentric approaches, if we insist that we cannot define the good just around human flourishing or just around the divine, if we try to tread a path in and through but finally beyond anthropocentrism, theocentrism, or the current neohumanist focus on the finality of other human beings or even an ad hoc postmodernism, what do we have? This returns us, I think, to the elusive and tenacious ambiguity of human life that comes to expression in both religious and humanistic outlooks. It requires us to shift to a more existential level of reflection on responsibility and also the good we can and ought to serve.<br>

Abstract: Like many organisms, once a critical size had been reached, film studies effectively split into separate interest groups. In the midst of the videotape revolution,
         mediacame to serve as the common term to buffer cultural studies and film studies. For media studies inevitably belongs to the former while it includes the latter as one of its manifestations. If any discipline in the humanities can claim to be emergent it would surely be media studies. Always taken as an institution rather than a method, media studies encompasses—besides film, the first technological medium to win recognition in the academy—television, radio, and sometimes journalism, even public relations. Most importantly, it features new media at its cutting edge. Media studies effectively amounts to communications reborn in the postmodern era. A growing bibliography of media theory may satisfy skeptics about its seriousness, yet media studies has a difficult time, more difficult than film studies, proving itself to be methodical in any sustained manner.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: For Coleridge, I have argued, answering God’s claim is always a struggle. Prayer is the phenomenological concentration on being‐for‐God, “a conscious will‐effected sense of his presence” (N6155), as it is put in 1829. However, as we saw in the second section of this article (“
         Prayer and the Improper: Kant, Coleridge, and Kierkegaard”), such presence is, strictly speaking, unthinkable for the fallen “I.” As such, the thought of being‐for‐God is always cut against the grain of one’s being, will, and understanding. To respond, therefore, is to struggle with oneself, a struggle implicating one’s speech: prayer is also cut across the grain of language. As David Haney notes, there is a sense in which wordless prayer alone could be pure surrender.68Derrida is correct insofar as all the codes and words of prayer bear traces of predication, which, for Coleridge, are fatally intertwined with the understanding of an “I” separate from God. As Luther suggests, prayer “is a constant violent action of the spirit as it is lifted up to God. … We must all practice violence.”69Calling—replying—to God becomes a kind of violence practiced against oneself and one’s language, as is apparent in Coleridge’s description of God as an “Idea [that] worked in you, like the Memory of a Name which we cannot recollect and yet feel that we have, and which reveals its existence in the mind only by a restless anticipation and proves its prior actuality by the almost explosive instantaneity with which it is welcomed & recognized on its re‐emersion” (N4816).<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: The claim that Joyce is the culmination of Christian epic is less persuasive, and part 2 relies too heavily on the work of Gian Balsamo and Altizer. Franke’s contribution is to interpret linguistic repetition in
      Finnegans Wake(London, 1939) as a secular reformulation of negative theology and typology that cannot be definitively interpreted as the death of God. However, I suspect Franke accepts a historical trajectory in which secular literature displaces traditional religion as revelation. If anything, his theological interpretation of Celan, Stevens, and Joyce deconstructs our conventional notion of the secular and demonstrates that literature cannot escape theology. My concern is that we must be careful not to privilege such literature—as the fulfillment of literary or theological tradition—but recognize that Joyce speaks theologically as one voice among many. In short, Franke needs to clarify the role of Joyce in his theoretical argument about poetic language and his practical effort to promote meaningful dialogue. Presumably, Joyce illustrates the apocalyptic power of literature, but does he do so in a way that is representative or superlative in literary or theological terms?<br>

Abstract: D'Holbach, in his infamous treatise,
         Système de la nature(1770), echoed and amplified many of Spinoza's monist sentiments. Since the totality of nature is “but an immense chain of causes and effects that ceaselessly follow from one to the other,” it stood to reason that the self does not possess “independent energy, an isolated cause,” or “detached action” from its fellow beings. An empirical investigation of the natural world suffices to prove that “man is in each instance of his life a passive instrument in the hands of necessity.”51Nor is the divine afforded any greater latitude of thought or movement. While it is ironic that d'Holbach chose to present nature as a speaking and seeing goddess in the final pages of his treatise, he repeatedly stressed that nature should not be regarded as a subject, divine or otherwise, despite apparent indications to the contrary: “When I say that nature produces an effect, I do not at all claim to personalize it. … We cannot call nature intelligent in the manner of some of the beings it encompasses.”52<br>

Abstract: The model of the Prophet.—Third, it should be noted that invoking the early wars and the Prophet’s life as a sunna (exemplar) is not simple in Islam, not least because the Prophet is said to have received successively more militant revelations that, some theologians claim, abrogated earlier, more pacifist revelations on fighting. The net result, however, is ambiguous. The stage‐four warring injunction, as is well known, is to fight the unbeliever wherever he is found (Quran 2:191, 9:5). Yet conjoining verses specify that if he desists, then Allah is forgiving and merciful (2:192; see also 9:5, 8:61), and one should not show hostility except to oppressors (2:193). We know that in historical practice the Prophet entered into alliances with unbelieving neighbors and was commanded to honor pacts with them as long as the honor was reciprocal (9:4, 9:7–9). Other Quranic verses permit discernment of differences among unbelievers and impose limits on fighting. For instance, there are the famous injunction not to forcibly proselytize (2:256) and the mandates to offer protection to idolaters who request it (9:6), not to transgress limits while fighting (2:190), to accept offers of peace (8:61 and 4:90), and to fight the idolaters with proportionality (9:36 during the sacred months, 16:126–27 at any time: “If you have to retaliate, do so to the extent you have been injured, but if you forbear, that is best for those who bear with fortitude. Endure with patience”).31Then there are the different responses of the Prophet, as sunna, to polytheists as opposed to hypocrites. Although both are to be treated sternly by God (48:6), the Prophet himself is said to have carried out jihad (struggle) against polytheists by fighting and jihad against hypocrites by preaching and argument.32Nonetheless, the Quran leaves it to God to judge (30:42–46). Even in the eyes of Sayyid Qutb, grandfather of twentieth‐century Islamic revivalism, Muslims have an obligation to eliminate all authorities bes~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: Tillich construed the gift and form of prophetic criticism as nonobjective yet present. Grace as a gift cannot be fixed yet must address its recipients if it might give depth to immanent criticism. To avoid fixing the prophetic in a finite form and to prevent prophetic criticism from assuming a plastic and immovable shape in history, Tillich leaned toward intuitionism and the oracular as a way of construing grace as a nonobjective gift. To him, it seemed that the formlessness and nonobjectivity of the prophetic preserves the transcendent from being reduced to the immanent without remainder. This claim has some resemblance to Derrida’s articulation of the pure gift that has no presence. Yet the promise is a gift that anticipates the future and is eschatological in its scope. Indeed, this motion preserves the aleatoric and transcendent character of the prophetic, but such a nonobjectivity could be as apolitical as Tillich thought dialectical theology was by its insistence that God is always other than the world. Tillich wrote that such nonobjectivity and otherness lent itself an abstract character and had no truck with the life of the world.
         38These goals of Tillich’s must be upheld so that the prophetic can interact with the immanent political sphere. The pure gift needs to interact with the reciprocated gift. Putting together the features of the prophetic, we will see that the gift it offers to immanent criticism is a gift as promise. To proceed, we need to consider the phenomenon of promise.<br>

Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: The mode that is attributed to the Jew in Lévinas's essay is here called merely nomadic. It is nevertheless clear that the relationship between “man” and the “nomad” mirrors the relation of the anti-Semite to the Jew, as the “nomad” is presented as tied to technology and as such represents a threat to “man.” At the same time that it generalizes Lévinas's text, the opening of Blanchot's essay nonetheless manages to parallel the first paragraph of Lévinas's, even alluding obliquely to Heidegger's critique of flight in “Das Ding.” Within the body of the essay, Blanchot does take up specifically the category of the pagan, declaring that Gagarin's space flight is a threat to the pagan in all of us: he who is tied to enrootedness, to tradition, to his biological race, he who consoles himself among the trees over the evil of mankind. The Jew, however, is not mentioned. Even when Lévinas is paraphrased in the essay it is without specific citation, and he is referred to not as someone who speaks in the name of Judaism but as “the man with no fixed abode,” as a representative of the nomads (“C,” p. 13; “CS,” p. 269). In repeating Lévinas, Blanchot has insisted on resisting the move back to the proper, which Lévinas's essay performs in its emphasis on Judaism's message. Lévinas uses Gagarin's flight to lead back to the truth of Judaism, concluding his own essay with the claim that, like technology, Judaism “has demystified the universe” and, moreover, “has discovered man in the nudity of the face” (“H,” p. 259; “HGU,” p. 234). Blanchot uses Lévinas's essay to remind us that Gagarin tears us away from the proper in
         every sense. His omission of both Lévinas's name and of Judaism underscores the point that deracination as a moral concept would prohibit reappropriation of any kind. The message of Gagarin's speech from space is for no one to claim and for no one to own, that is, that “truth is nomadic” (“C,” p. 13; “CS,” p. 271). Blanchot has thus doubly displaced Lévinas'~<br>

I know how to end the script now. It ends with Kaufman driving home after his encounter with Amelia thinking he knows how to finish the script… . So. Kaufman drives off from his encounter with Amelia, filled for the first time with hope. I like this. This is good.”<br>

Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: In saying this, I am not arguing that Marlowe “appropriated” the sacred from its dominant institutional contexts. On the contrary, the rumors of devils appearing on the Faustian stage belie that model of the relationship between the dramatic and the theological in which the theater evacuates the spiritual content from theological forms only to stage those forms within a sphere of rational disenchantment that supposedly frames the experience of a play.
   41Such a model relies on a modern, indeed modernist, understanding of theater as a compartmentalized zone of experience where entertainment has no further end than its own production and consumption, and where aesthetic efficacy, if it exists at all, remains limited to art's ability to contain the contradictions of ideology. Theatrical representation clearly had a certain kind of autonomy in Marlowe's England, produced and consumed as it was in its own institutional space, yet at the same time, as I hope I have been able to show, that very representation could be understood by antitheatrical writers and theatergoers alike as an instrument that had theological ends. Another way to put this claim is to say that theater was not always understood as a disenchanted product of human agency. When the reformers argued that Satan staged theater pieces through the instrumentality of the magician to the end of creating beliefs in the audience that would augment his own power, they were quite capable of imagining that such spectacles were well-crafted illusions without needing to go on to posit that the devil was an ideological fiction. The rumors of the Faustian devils powerfully demonstrate that even representations that announced their own theatricality—even illusions that were institutionally marked out as such—could still be understood as having theological consequences. Those who believed that the devil came when Faustus called him may have been fully invested in their faith, but they were never so gullible as to believe ~<br>

Abstract: However, Larmore usually uses “commitment” in a much broader sense that allegedly applies to all mental states. Beliefs are not images or ideas felt with a certain vivacity, or acts of accepting propositions, but are instead dispositions with practical implications: behavior that expresses the belief “has to be such that the belief would have provided the individual
      a reasonto act this way” (77–78). Similarly, following Scanlon, Larmore holds that “every desire represents its object as something there is a reason to pursue” (78), even if it is easily outweighed. This claim is more troublesome because we experience some appetites without thinking that there is anything that would count in favor of the desire’s object before our attraction toward it. Their psychologicaldynamiscan also persist even when we believe that the apparent reason to which such desires respond is illusory, as the case of Swann’s love shows (182). These brute preferences or inclinations give us at best disjunctive reasons to satisfy them or to eliminate them (Mark Murphy,Natural Law and Practical Rationality[Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001], 75)—and this weak reason to satisfy them can thus be rejected outright rather than merely outweighed. That is exactly what distinguishes desires and emotions that involve strong evaluations: these motives respond to reasons that appear normative independently of being desired. Even if desires are bound up with beliefs given the wholism of the mental (92, 102), it does not follow that in every desire the “person obligates himself to behave, all else being equal,” in ways that accord with “the value accorded to the object of desire” (80)—as if a person who had no other desires but this one would rationallyhaveto act according to it.<br>

Abstract: This approach, however, is not altogether new. We must be careful not to presume—as Jasper does—“the impossibility of any systematic theology in a time of the unsystematic and aphoristic” (5). Fragment and system are not mutually exclusive. Aphorism acknowledges the apophatic, and a complex Neoplatonic system informs the negative theology that resonates with many of the essays in this volume. Here, it is encouraging that Jasper, Hass, and Kelly Van Andel all invoke Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Van Andel is correct that Coleridge’s theories of symbol and imagination, as well as his practice as a poet, challenge what often passes for literature and theology by celebrating “open ambiguity rather than closed certitude” (212). Coleridge fails to complete his system—his impossible quest for unity—but he nonetheless articulates (through symbol) a systematic method. To understand this, we must recognize the relation of Coleridge’s symbol to traditional allegory and negative theology via a more careful reading of
      The Statesman’s Manual(London, 1816) that considers (contra Van Andel’s overreliance on Thomas McFarland) the hermeneutic and biblical context of the symbol/allegory distinction in Coleridge’s lay sermon. This is a minor but important adjustment that reinforces the larger claim that the tensional practice of literature and theology can revitalize old truths, for “the renewal of traditions is often accomplished through discomforting processes of radical critique” (2).<br>

Abstract: This debate boils down to a moral debate. Realists claim that a moral commitment to a concrete group of real-life persons supervenes the infinite play of the signifier. They see constructionists as occupying a privileged, distanced, ocular place which ultimately devalues real world conditions, thus leading to political quietism. Constructionists are committed to an ideal of allowing the Other to be other. They see the very definitiveness which realists cherish as at least potentially the scholar’s own will to power, that is, the imposition of one’s own meaning onto the subsequently elided Other.<br>

Abstract: For example, a common view which finds expression among traditional and modern exegetes alike is that impurity symbolizes death.
            
                  Proponents of this theory point to the explicit connections between the skin disease17
               ṣaraʿat(conventionally translated “leprosy”) and references to death (Numbers 12:12) and mourning (Leviticus 13:45–46). These scholars also construe menstrual impurity (Leviticus 15:19–24) as stemming from the loss of life-fluid and for constituting a period of infertility. Unfortunately, this view is ill-equipped to explain why sexual relations defile (Leviticus 15:18),
                  notwithstanding the counter-intuitive claim that the loss of seed (even in coitus) is a kind of death.18
               
                  These theories suffer from the endemic weakness of Aristotle’s theory of categorization: any exceptional case undermines the assumption that category membership is defined by fixed criteria.19<br>

Abstract: Csordas’s claim for the privileged place of witchcraft holds to the extent that a people does identify witches as the unambiguously human inversion of normal morality that we call evil. But insofar as spirits and other nonhuman manifestations may sometimes be cited as part of a discourse on human culpability (nonhumans, like spirits, being an extension of humans), then the question of the centrality of witchcraft becomes an ontological question of what the boundaries of humanity and of human witches are. Witches are people, but are they wholly so, especially when they take on nonhuman forms? And what about evil agents, such as spirits, who take on human form? In fieldwork it has been explained to me that “spirits are people” but that spirits are also different from people and more akin to animals. We can interpret both claims as metaphorical (spirits are like people or spirits are like animals). But that glosses over the fact that these may also be regarded as literal statements, true at the time of their enunciation, in the same way that some Christians assert that Christ was both human and divine at given points in his existence. So, taken together with the alternating attributions of evil to both nonhuman and human agents of evil, I suggest that we take ethnographic account in particular cases of fuzziness in the identification of human and nonhuman, and of human and nonhuman evil. Witches, like zombies, are or were human but sometimes take nonhuman form and so constitute an ambivalence that straddles the two dimensions. That said, Csordas provides the most sophisticated critique and agenda regarding the current anthropological interest in morality to appear in years.<br>

Abstract: Despite these caveats,
   Contemplative Nationis highly recommended for scholars of Jewish studies, religious studies, philosophy, and theology. The book is an excellent example of how to apply hermeneutical theories to the study of Judaism, how to bridge the gap between continental philosophy and analytic philosophy, and how to expand the scope of Jewish studies by appreciating the nature of theological discourse. While Judaica scholars could use the book in university-level courses, and rabbis could apply its approach to synagogue life, the claim that “Israel” is a “contemplative nation” will hardly resonate with most Jews today. It is very doubtful that the book could “guide the way for [the] future” of the Jewish people’s survival (226), precisely because Jews today are overwhelmingly secular, and the culture in which Jews live, both in Israel and in the Diaspora, is anti-intellectual and antitheological. Furthermore, if Fisher is so keen on Philo, he should have also reminded his readers of the fate of Philo’s enterprise: it was no coincidence that Philo became one of the Church Fathers and that his exegetical/hermeneutical project was not adopted by the tradition that became normative Judaism. When “Israel” denotes a nation of divine contemplators, “carnal Israel” (namely “Israel” as a historical, cultural, and ethnic entity) is marginalized, denigrated, and persecuted. It is true that Jewish religious life is theological, but being Jewish cannot be reduced to contemplating God.<br>

Author(s): Lehnhof Kent R.<br>
Abstract: In these lines, we might find the rudiments of an early modern rationale for Levinas’s claim that
         autruiis always and only human. Perplexed by his anthropocentric stance, several of Levinas’s critics have asked why the “I” is not also ordained by the alterity of animals, or even plants. Though Levinas answers religiously (the human other bears “the trace of God,” whereas plants and animals do not), the human exceptionalism established in Lear’s speech is different. As Laurie Shannon has shown, it is a negative exceptionalism, predicated upon the underprovisioned condition of humankind. Whereas nonhuman animals are naturally “coated,” the human creature Lear considers is uniquely naked, compelled to case himself in secondhand skins, or “lendings.” Given Levinas’s insistence on the essential nudity ofautrui, Lear’s vision of “unaccommodated man” seems relevant. As Shannon remarks, the “poor, bare, forked animal” we are made to see in the play raises the question of whether any animal other than the human may fairly be deemed “naked.” See Laurie Shannon, “Poor, Bare, Forked: Animal Sovereignty, Human Negative Exceptionalism, and the Natural History ofKing Lear,”Shakespeare Quarterly60 (2009): 168–96.<br>

Abstract: Since the truth is proclaimed and not proven, it implies the “language of the naked event, which alone captures thought.”
            
                  Badiou describes it only in negative terms: “What imposes the invention of a new discourse, and of a subjectivity that is neither philosophical nor prophetic (the apostle), is precisely that it is only by means of such invention that the event finds a welcome and an existence in language. For established languages, it is inadmissible because it is genuinely unnamable.”116
               
                  But he gives us a hint as to how a language in which “event finds a welcome and an existence” might look when he says that all true names to which the subject of a truth lays claim are, like Jesus’s name (see Phil. 2:9), that is, above every name. “They let themselves be inflected and declared, just as mathematical symbolism does, in every language, according to every custom, and through the traversal of all differences.”117

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: This book about the conversation of philosophy itself connects with a number of conversations current in philosophy and religious studies. For one, Peperzak provides a compelling defense of the claim that philosophy is fundamentally a way of life and not only a scholastic practice of system building. In this, he joins a growing interest among neohumanists and continental thinkers in reviving premodern senses of philosophy as a spiritual practice, drawing off the earlier work of Pierre Hadot and others.<br>

Author(s): Gutterman David S.<br>
Abstract: The central claim is that religious narratives shape sociopolitical positions, a commonplace observation that Gutterman embellishes by asserting “that this religiosity often takes on a prophetic cast” (p. 49). Such assertions, however, are also quite common in studies of American religion and politics (think of Perry Miller, Robert Bellah, and Sacvan Bercovitch) and they would benefit from a more precise articulation of the relation between religion and politics. While he adroitly ranges over political material (especially in his insightful use of Hannah Arendt and Paul Ricoeur), Gutterman's grasp of other subjects is sometimes shaky. He claims that his approach displaces “the common view of the status of religion in American political culture” (p. 3), yet the two conventional methods he names—jurisprudential/Constitutional or policy‐oriented studies—scantly exemplify the range of understandings in either the academy or public life. Gutterman cites Alexis de Tocqueville as exemplifying a distinct “third mode of scholarship” (p. 3) that, in contrast to “a functional approach to American religiosity” (p. 8), underscores the importance of religion in American culture. Such functionalism may dominate political science, but this is far from the case in religious studies, history, or American studies, where the significance of religion is a given.<br>

Abstract: This debate eventually focused on the nature of revelation (letters 35–39), with Strauss having written that “there is an essential distinction between the thinking of the Middle ages, based on revelation, and the thinking of classical antiquity, not based on revelation” (78). Voegelin responded that both revelation and reason are part of a universal human knowledge that is understood concretely and experientially. This prompted Strauss to write back that claims of a universal human knowledge must reside in the realm of philosophy and not in Christianity. To understand Plato properly, one should not impose “biblical concepts,” since they are separate from Greek philosophy. Although Strauss and Voegelin did not resolve this debate, it does clarify and present challenges to both thinkers' philosophies: for Voegelin, the claim that the experience of the divine is the foundation of a universal, human knowledge requires some sort of demonstration in order for him to escape what Strauss referred to as “the desert of Kierkegaard's subjectivism” (88); for Strauss, the tension between reason and revelation suggests a permanent condition of human incompleteness that is unable to point to a right way of life, leading one into nihilism.<br>

Abstract: Walter Pater's theoretical "come-back" over the past forty years or so has been dominated by the competing claims of the new historicism and deconstruction, both of which discover prescient forerunners of their own, seemingly mutually exclusive, theoretical concerns in Pater's aesthetic criticism and in his historical novel Marius the Epicurean (1885). Yet despite their obvious differences, both critical approaches share one thing in common: the same post-humanist denigration of the trope of metaphor in favor of the seemingly more ethically responsive (because inclusive) trope of metonymy. In this essay I observe how the new historicism's and deconstruction's privilegings of metonymy as the prime trope of difference poses an immediate problem for ethical thought that, largely under the influence of Alain Badiou, has become increasingly cognizant of the need for a workable conception of sameness (or universality), traditionally supplied by metaphor. Accordingly, this close reading of the metaphorical dialectic of one of Pater's surprisingly underread Imaginary Portraits, "Sebastian van Storck" (1887), explores the basic charge against metaphor-namely, that it is an essentially "theological" trope insofar as it invariably pre-posits the "identity" that it modestly claims to have merely discovered. Employing the central figure of Sebastian's idealism- equation-I venture that, once rethought as a relation not of identity but of equivalence, metaphor is capable of shouldering the rhetorical burden of similarity without relinquishing its ethical claim as a primary producer of new differences in the world and is, hence, deserving of a central place in a post-deconstructive ethics.<br>

Abstract: Abstract: Vico's theory of metaphor is best understood as a monster in the tradition of classical rhetorical invention. It is the mutant offspring of metaphor characterized as "necessary" (an "ear" of com, for example) and metaphor characterized in terms of analogy. From the perspective of his method. Vico marries these apparently incompatible forms inherited from Aristotle and thereby identifies a third type of linguistic metaphor. I argue that the metaphor identifies a stipulatory definition taken out of context. In order to situate this claim, I outline Vico's genetic analysis and elaborate in general terms what metaphor and definition share. Most importantly. Vico insists that beings, actions, and events are linguistically identifiedin some particular diseursive context. Indeed, in many cases that context alone determines whether the expression can be called a definition or a metaphor. Like Cicero's ideal jurist, Vico's hero employs motivated words and realizes possibilities available to common sense. Henee Vico's theory of metaphor is both "constructivist"—language has the power to makes things—and "humartist"—it must do so in a form appropriate to history and culture. Vico's theory is consequently important to us because it challenges the proper/figurative distinction championed in the philosophy of language and adds a pragmatic dimension to contemporary views of metaphor at work in literary theory.<br>

Author(s): Abbott Don Paul<br>
Abstract: AbstractBeginning with Roland Barthes' “The Old Rhetoric: an aide-mémoire” (1964–65), semioticians have shown a remarkable interest in the history of rhetoric. Writers like Barthes, Tzevtan Todorov, Gérard Genette, and Paul Ricoeur have offered accounts of rhetoric's past that invariably concluded with rhetoric's demise and its replacement with semiotics. These writers typically portray rhetoric's history as one of a brief rise followed by a very long decline, a pattern, says Todorov, of “splendor and misery.” This essay examines the semioticians' predictions of rhetoric's demise as well as semiotics' attempt to claim elements of rhetoric as its own. The essay concludes by considering the present state of semiotics' aspiration to supersede rhetoric as a theory of language and human affairs.<br>

Abstract: Using data from an ethnographic study of
         tarot divination, occult claims to knowledge are analyzed and interpreted. Attention is focused on theproceduresparties to occult divination employ to claim and sustain what they regard as extraordinary knowledge. This view of occult knowledge stands opposed to efforts to discredit occult claims as unscientific or the result of psychosocial conditions like deprivation and marginality. Like knowledge in general, occult knowledge is a product of sociohistorical influences, interactional negotiation, and interpretation. The challenge for sociology therefore is the pursuit of the social interactional and historical processes whereby knowledge and interpretation are accomplished in everyday life.<br>

Abstract: Every text aims to seduce its reader. If the text at the same time lays claim to having scientific value, we readers must ask whether seduction stands in the way of truth. As a concept, seduction lies halfway between an assault and conversation. As opposed to assault, seduction conveys a dimension of voluntarily being swept off one's feet. As opposed to conversation, seduction implies that one loses one's senses for a moment. Who, then, is really subject and who is object in seduction? The thesis I will argue here is that the readership's or audience's only chance of taking on the role of subjects, in a textual seduction, is to lose their senses first. Rather than being an assault against scientific ethics, seduction is a necessary premise for a sensible conversation to take place.<br>

Abstract: Kauvar points out that in The Facts, Roth "demonstrates that what passes for fact
does not arrive at truth," and thus autobiography no more so than fiction can claim to
have an unmediated relationship with either "the facts" or "the truth," whatever those
terms may be said to represent (415).

Article Title: Against Wholeness: The Ego's Complicity in Religion<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263718<br>
Date: 12 1, 1958<br>
Author(s): Vergote Volney P.<br>
Abstract: Many students of religion suggest that wholeness or the attainment of an integrated self is an especially valuable goal whose attainment marks a moment of religious insight. Theoreticians like Jung, Allport, and Maslow strongly support this belief. Freud does not. To reconcile the two camps one must either drop Freud altogether or confine his critique of religion to an attack upon neurotic religion, or more exactly, religion based upon superego functioning. One could then claim that healthy religion is a function of the ego, e.g., the ego's tendency towards integrated functioning and the attainment of 'wholeness'. I argue that this ploy, which is itself a function of an egosyntonic desire for wholeness, is altogether wrong. It misrepresents Freud's ego psychology and it therefore misrepresents his critique of the ego's role in religion as well. First, his theoretical, as opposed to his literary, critique of religion is also a critique of certain characteristics of the ego. Second, these characteristics, especially the ego-syntonic drive towards feelings of wholeness, are functions of the ego's obedience to repetition compulsion. Third, the later texts on religion cannot be understood apart from their roots in Freud's earliest theory of ego functioning, especially the physicalist program he developed in his "Project" of 1895. The ego creates and takes part in religious dramas which present an illusory world of wholeness and completion of self. But as the seat of reality testing it must pierce the veils as quickly and as repeatedly as it weaves them.<br>

Abstract: Anthropologists have seldom avoided anecdotal data and included in their texts information about how they produce knowledge that they claim to be true. While considering fieldwork as the foundation of their discipline as well as their identity, they have removed this activity from analysis and overlooked its relationship with textualisation. This account of fieldwork in Quilombo Frechal (Maranhao, Brazil) purports to move from "participant observation to observation of participation" (Tedlock 1991), including in written texts the process of construction of anthropological knowledge. It attempts to represent the social reality of "Others" through an analysis of one's own experience in their world.<br>

Author(s): Jantzen Grace M.<br>
Abstract: Paul Helm's discussion of my book is a clear illustration of some of my central claims about Anglo-American philosophy of religion: he instantiates its undue preoccupation with beliefs, and its erasure of gender. In my reply I show how Helm conflates my objection to such preoccupation with the absurd claim that beliefs are unnecessary, and how he conflates philosophy of religion -- even rationality itself -- with its Anglo-American variants. He refuses to engage with the masculinism implicit both in his selectivity and in the boundaries he seeks to maintain around the discipline; boundaries which, I argue, need to be opened up for philosophy of religion to flourish.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i20008354<br>
Date: 9 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
Abstract: The first part of the essay explore's three features of Wolterstorff's account of God as a performer of speech acts: (1) the claim that God literally speaks, suggesting that this claim needs something like a Thomistic theory of analogy as an alternative to univocity and mere metaphor; (2) the claim that speaking is not reducible to revealing; and (3) the political implications of these claims, especially in relation to Habermasian theory. The second part focuses on the theory of double discourse, which seeks to make sense of the notion that God speaks to us through the human voices of prophets, apostles, and especially of Scripture, and seeks to show that a fuller account of the speech act by which God deputizes or appropriates human speech is needed. The final section suggests that Ricoeur and Derrida are not the threat to his theory that Wolterstorff takes them to be and that their emphasis on the text, rather than the author, makes sense in contexts where we have only the text to consult.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>
Issue: i20010333<br>
Date: 1 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Johnson Greg<br>
Abstract: This essay takes up the claim made recently by Simon Critchley in The Companion to Continental Philosophy that a "feature common to many philosophers in the Continental tradition" is the "utopian demand that things be otherwise." The general question I pursue has to do with whether or not such a claim includes movements within Continental philosophy that do not self-identify with the utopian (like critical theory). The particular question has to do with whether or not the movement of phenomenology is utopian or does it, because of its other commitments, view the utopian as the antithesis to its orientation, which makes that claim that phenomenology is utopian seem strange. My thesis is that phenomenology can be seen as a utopian tradition but that some account must be given that demonstrates this connection to the utopian. In particular, I argue that Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology provides an understanding of the utopian, which I call a non-conventional view, that is vastly different from the one assumed by most when they see or hear the word "utopian," which I lable conventional. I show that such a non-conventional understanding can be developed in a way that neither requires us to view the utopian solely as opposed to finitude and contingency, nor a form of thought and action from which we necessarily need to dissociate ourselves. It is this non-conventional view of the utopian that in the end enables us to understand how Continental philosophy in general and phenomenology in particular are important bearers of the utopian demand that things be otherwise.<br>

Issue: i210402<br>
Date: 4 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Kaye Howard L.<br>
Abstract: In the 1950s and 1960s Freudian theory was deemed to be a vital part of the sociological tradition, but since then it has fallen from favor, largely because of the simplifications and misinterpretations both by Freud's sociological critics and by his supporters. Chief among such misunderstandings is the tendency to view Freud's social theory as a variant of that of Hobbes, in which a selfish and asocial human nature is made social through the imposition of external constraints; these constraints, as Durkheim stated, eventually are "internalized" into the personalities of social beings. Against such a claim this paper argues that Freud's views differ profoundly from those of Hobbes and that the myth of the Hobbesian Freud has so distorted Freud's most fundamental concepts that their social theoretical significance has been largely obscured.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i20533165<br>

Author(s): van Woudenberg René<br>
Abstract: The idea that we can properly be held responsible for what we believe underlies large stretches of our social and institutional life; without that idea in place, social and institutional life would be unthinkable, and more importantly, it would stumble and fall. At the same time, philosophers have argued that this idea is strange, puzzling, beyond belief, false, meaningless or at any rate defective. The first section develops the alleged problem. The burden of this paper, however, is not to discuss the merits of this idea but rather to measure the damage in case the idea turns out to be defective indeed. This is done by substantiating the claim that this idea indeed underlies large and important stretches of our social and institutional life. Section 2 substantiates that claim by presenting the results of a web search on the use of what I call "deontological epistemic expressions", i.e. expressions in which deontological and epistemological notions (both broadly construed) are combined; examples are "obligation to believe", "not permitted to forget", "right to know". The ubiquitous use of these expressions, I argue, is linguistic evidence for the claim that the contested idea indeed pervades our social life. Linguistic evidence, however, can be frail and misleading. From the fact that we say that the shade is moving we cannot conclude that shades really exist; likewise it may not be permitted to conclude from the ubiquitous use of deontological epistemic expressions that there really are doxastic obligations (and hence doxastic responsibilities). The third section, therefore, moves beyond the linguistic evidence and discusses two social institutions, viz. education and law as we find them in modern Western societies, and argues that they cannot be made sense of unless the contested idea is in place. Educational and legal systems of course vary greatly throughout the Western world. Such differences as exist, however, are irrelevant for the claim I will be making in t~<br>

Author(s): Wurm Richard<br>
Abstract: The logic of Indonesian subjectless and tenseless expressions appears to have cultural implications, just as the use of tenses in English scientific writing entails much more than grammatical minutiae. A. L. Becker has pointed out that tense in English functions in a "coherence system" that pervades and transcends grammar. A parallel coherence system is suggested for Indonesian, based not on tense but on topic. Paul Ricoeur's distinction between LANGUAGE and DISCOURSE is the basis of the claim that Indonesian sentences cohere on the bond between grammatical subject and discourse topic. Examples are drawn from a number of contexts that call forth passive sentences in Indonesian. The article concludes on another suggestion by Becker. The Indonesian topic may be part of a larger deictic category of person, which may be related in discourse to orientation in space--both physical and social--of participants in the speech event. If this suggestion is correct, then the contrast between English and Indonesian coherence systems may be found in the opposition tense/time vs. person/space.<br>

Author(s): Thunder-McGuire Steve<br>
Abstract: Children, who are composers of meaning rather than merely handlers of art materials, proceed by strategies of generative praxis that include fictive play and autobiography and involve judgment that is critically reflective and imagination that is productive. The view of things that leads an art teacher to believe that a child is making meaningful art is one in which a child's judgment is a sign, or even a criterion of thoughtful involvement. When this reflective judgment is manifested, you see that a child is guided by an inner critic of their work, and the claim that "Michael is making art" says it all. As I interpreted the long self-sustained efforts of children composing artist books, I became most aware of the way in which children's desire to represent their stories merged with drawing and a developing schema in the same way lived experience and metaphor interchange and generate each other. This interchange is the living ground of the inner critic in children's meaningful art.<br>

Author(s): de Mello e Souza André<br>
Abstract: A large and increasing share of international humanitarian and development aid is raised from nongovernmental sources, allocated by transnational NGOs. We know little about this private foreign aid, not even how it is distributed across recipient countries, much less what explains the allocation. This article presents an original data set, based on detailed financial records from most of the major U.S.-based humanitarian and development NGOs, which allows us for the first time to map and analyze the allocation of U.S. private aid. We find no support for the common claim that aid NGOs systematically prioritize their organizational self-interest when they allocate private aid, and we find only limited support for the hypothesis that expected aid effectiveness drives aid allocation. By contrast, we find strong support for the argument that the deeply rooted humanitarian discourse within and among aid NGOs drives their aid allocation, consistent with a view of aid NGOs as principled actors and constructivist theories of international relations. Recipients' humanitarian need is substantively and statistically the most significant determinant of U.S. private aid allocation (beyond a regional effect in favor of Latin American countries). Materialist concerns do not crowd out ethical norms among these NGOs.<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mank~<br>

Article Title: HISTORY AND THE MANIFEST IMAGE: HAYDEN WHITE AS A PHILOSOPHER OF HISTORY<br>
Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services<br>
Issue: i23351874<br>
Date: 2 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Doran Robert<br>
Abstract: To claim that Hayden White has yet to be read seriously as a philosopher of history might seem false on the face of it. But do tropes and the rest provide any epistemic rationale for differing representations of historical events found in histories? As an explanation of White's influence on philosophy of history, such a proffered emphasis only generates a puzzle with regard to taking White seriously, and not an answer to the question of why his efforts should be worthy of any philosophical attention at all. For what makes his emphasis on narrative structure and its associated tropes of philosophical relevance? What, it may well be asked, did (or could) any theory that draws its categories from a stock provided by literary criticism contribute to explicating problems with regard to the warranting of claims about knowledge, explanation, or causation that represent those concerns that philosophy typically brings to this field? Robert Doran's anthologizing of previously uncollected pieces, ranging as they do over a literal half-century of White's published work, offers an opportunity to identify explicitly those philosophical themes and arguments that regularly and prominently feature there. Moreover, White's essays in this volume demonstrate a credible knowledge of and interest in mainstream analytic philosophers of his era and also reveal White as deeply influenced by or well acquainted with other important philosophers of history. White thus invites a reading of his work as philosophy, and this volume presents the opportunity for accepting it as such.<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'intéresse au conflit foncier à la Martinique. Il propose l'étude d'une grande propriété — « Providence » — ayant fait l'objet d'une occupation des terres de plus de vingt ans par des agriculteurs voulant ainsi faire valoir leurs droits à la terre. À travers ce conflit, on voit se préciser l'importance de l'espace en tant que porteur d'un langage capable de véhiculer la mémoire collective et de donner forme à l'identité. L'espace prolonge les termes du conflit originel entre maîtres et esclaves au travers d'une codification cadastrée toujours dotée d'efficacité, comme il sert de transmetteur de pratiques d'opposition et de résistance à un tel ordre incarné, devenant ainsi l'une des ressources fondamentales de la continuité identitaire du groupe des petits agriculteurs. This article focuses on the land property conflict in Martinique. The case study is "Providence", a large property that has been occupied for twenty years by a group of farmers who claim their rights to the land. In hee we can see how space is of crucial importance in providing the collective memory with words loaded with significations and contributing to the construction of identity. The memory of the old masters-slave conflict is embodied in space through an ever efficient social and racial codification. Space is also a tool to transmit a set of practises of resistance to this physical order and, in this way, becomes a fundamental resource to construct the collective identity of the group of small farmers<br>

Abstract: No one owns the concept 'culture' Anthropology's long-standing proprietary claim on the concept rests on three sorts of contentions — none of which are convincing Anthropology's overwhelmingly interpretive approaches to cultural materials have led to a preoccupation with the details of cultural materials at the expense of formulating explanatory theories This has, among other things, rendered fieldwork experience sufficient for professional credentials However, if the details are all that matter, then comparative and cross-cultural research, as well as most of the social sciences, make no sense Contrary to this view, it is proposed here that theories reveal which details matter Cognitive accounts of the sort we advanced in Rethinking Religion (1990) offer a firm theoretical basis for cross-cultural study of religious materials Other types of research concerning non-human primates, early childhood development, and various social and cognitive impairments also offer insight into culture (without relying on fieldwork studies)<br>

Article Title: Inside and Outside the EU's "Area of Freedom, Security and Justice": Reflexive Identity and the Unity of Legal Space<br>
Publisher: Franz Steiner Verlag<br>
Issue: i23676298<br>
Date: 1 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Lindahl Hans<br>
Abstract: "It is essential," Hans Kelsen asserts provocatively, "that one state also have one territory, that the territory of a state form a unity." What, then, determines the territorial unity a legal community necessarily claims for itself? And why is this claim to territorial unity irreducibly problematic? These questions are particularly pressing, both theoretically and practically, with respect to the European Union's "Area of Freedom, Security and Justice," set to be consolidated in the novel Constitution for Europe. Rejecting any attempt to make sense of legal space in terms of geography, this Paper argues that the spatial unity of the European Union emerges in the reflexive process by which this legal community stakes out a territory as its own. Probing the notion of an "own" legal space, this Paper points to, and offers examples of, a strong form of exteriority that is inside what the EU calls its own territory: "another Europe" is — literally — elsewhere. This strong form of exteriority arises in the very same representational process by which the EU constitutes itself as a unitary Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. In effect, an analysis of key legal texts reveals that Europe is the place the Union claims to be originally its own, yet also the place to which it has no direct access. Finally, these considerations are brought to bear on Article 64 (1) of the EC Treaty, which holds Member States responsible for maintaining law and order and safeguarding internal security.<br>

Abstract: This article concerns itself with the question of what constitutes a hymn, within the framework of the existing state church. This framework is defined as "religious pluralization", characterized by an individualized understanding of Christ, and the parallel development of a new interdenominational religious awareness, two trends which have been increasingly prominent since the days of post-Reformation Orthodoxy and the Enlightenment. "Pluralization" is intimately associated with a fundamental movement away from traditional forms of religious piety. The article attempts to describe the hymn as a figure of "tentative continuity"; that ist, the hymn is the means by which human beings symbolically express their religious perception of their own finiteness in history. The hymn can therefore claim a more universal validity than if it merely pinpoints a specific moment of human religious history. At this point, the article carefully examines several examples of older as well as of more modern hymnody.<br>

Abstract: This paper deals with clause linkage and the concept of "sentence" in French linguistics. We claim that the modern definition of "sentence" is deceptive, as it gives more importance to syntaxic features than graphic features. First, we dwell on recent history of the term "sentence", then we argue that syntaxic domains must be distinguished from graphic chunks we call "sentences". Finally, we take a look at how clause chaining and written segments interact with each other. Cette contribution s'attache à réévaluer la pertinence de la notion de phrase, entendue dans un sens graphique, pour traiter certains phénomènes de liaison de prédications à l'écrit. Nous revenons d'abord sur l'histoire récente de la notion de phrase, puis nous proposons de distinguer les unités syntaxiques et graphiques avant d'interroger les rapports entre liaison de prédications et segmentation graphique.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd<br>
Issue: i24439507<br>
Date: 10 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): CHRISTMAN JOHN<br>
Abstract: In this article I critically discuss a claim made by several writers in philosophy and the social sciences that for an individual to count as a person, a single personality, or the subject of a life, the experiences of the subject in question must take a narrative form. I argue that narrativity is a misleading and, in some ways of understanding it, implausible condition of what it is that adds unity to personhood and personality. I pursue this critique by considering canonical accounts of narrativity in philosophy and literary studies. I consider those connections between events that must hold for the sequence to be considered a narrative: causal, teleological, and thematic connections. I argue that for each of these, the condition that experiential sequences (for a given subject) must have this structure is empty: any life sequence that is reflected upon in an interpretive spirit can meet it. What the condition of narrativity amounts to, then, is the more basic requirement that the person must be able to look upon the factors and events of her life with a certain interpretive reflection, whether or not those factors and events have any particular narrative unity in a traditional sense.<br>

Author(s): Benjamin Roy<br>
Abstract: In this paper, I examine the influence of the Gospel of John on Joyce's aesthetic. My basic claim is that the gospel aided Joyce in charting a middle course between materialism (body without spirit) and spiritualism (spirit without body). After examining the temptations of flying too high (symbolism, mysticism, gnosticism) and flying too low (historicism, realism, materialism), I show how Joyce made use of the Johannine strategies of epiphany and realized eschatology to achieve a synthesis between these extremes. The essay is much indebted to two students of John—Rudolph Bultmann and Franz Mussner—who examined John's peculiar synthesis of fact and allegory. In addition, the scholar Jacques Aubert was indispensable for his analysis of a similar trajectory in Joyce's aesthetic.<br>

Issue: i24657854<br>
Date: 1 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): WOOD DAVID<br>
Abstract: What is eco-phenomenology? This paper argues that eco-phenomenology, in which are folded both an ecological phenomenology and a phenomenological ecology, offers us a way of developing a middle ground between phenomenology and naturalism, between intentionality and causality. Our grasp of Nature is significantly altered by thinking through four strands of time's plexity — the invisibility of time, the celebration of finitude, the coordination of rhythms, and the interruption and breakdown of temporal horizons. It is also transformed by a meditation on the role of boundaries in constituting the varieties of thinghood. Eco-phenomenology takes up in a tentative and exploratory way the traditional phenomenological claim to be able to legislate for the sciences, or at least to think across the boundaries that seem to divide them. In this way, it opens up and develops an access to Nature and the natural, one which is independent both of the conceptuality of the natural sciences and of traditional metaphysics.<br>

Abstract: This article examines Gadamer's claim that language is fundamentally metaphorical from the perspective of Ricoeur's complementary analysis of metaphor. I argue that Gadamer's claim can only be understood in relation to a broader understanding of metaphor in which metaphor is not regarded as secondary to literal meaning. From this context one is better able to understand the connection Gadamer makes between language and ontology, which is found in his statement "Being that can be understood is language."<br>

Abstract: Dooyeweerd remained faithful to Abraham Kuyper (1898/1943, 20) here, specifically to
the well-known, almost infamous passage from the Lectures on Calvinism·.
"Hence the first claim demands that such a life system shall find its starting-point in a
special interpretation of our relation to God. This is not accidental, but imperative. If such
an action is to put its stamp upon our entire life, it must start from that point in our
consciousness in which our life is still undivided and lies comprehended in its unity, — not
in the spreading vines but in the root from which the vines spring. This point, of course, lies
in the antithesis between all that is finite in our human life and the infinite that lies beyond
it. Here alone we find the common source from which the different streams of our human
life spring and separate themselves. Personally it is our repeated experience that in the
depths of our hearts, at the point where we disclose ourselves to the Eternal One, all the
rays of our life converge as in one focus, and there alone regain that harmony which we so
often and so painfully lose in the stress of daily duty."
Wiskerke (1978, 75ff.) called this semi-mystical view 'the heart condition' of the philosophy of
the cosmonomic idea (see also the interesting notes on pp. 259ff). Kuyper's statement in the
Stone Lectures is in part based on his interpretation of Ecclesiastes 3:11 ('[God] has put
eternity into man's mind'):
"That age is the world of the Eternal, from which time, and with time all the finite, was
born.... The age that lets you leap over the boundaries of the finite and envelops you in the
ocean of the heavenly and Divine... that awakens your faith as a wholly other, wholly
independent faculty of thought and reveals you to yourself as a wholly other, far richer and
brilliant being than the world ever allowed you to see in its mirror." (De Héraut 1781, 18-2-
1912; cited in Dutch by Wiskerke 1978, 79).
Wiskerke suggests that this semi-mysticism evinces some~<br>

Abstract: Les rapports entre islam et psychologie en Égypte sont ici étudiés sur le terrain, dans une association de conseil et de formation psychologique cairote dont les responsables revendiquent une expertise reposant sur un processus d'institutionnalisation de la psychologie plus que centenaire. Une seconde ressource normative invoquée au sein de l'association est la religion. En réponse à l'indétermination qui peut résulter de ces efforts de synthèse, les aspirations au statut de classe moyenne constituent le troisième élément à prendre en compte pour comprendre la façon dont ce discours psychologique évolue. Il est alors possible de s'interroger sur les influences extérieures s'exerçant sur la discipline, notamment à travers les objectifs thérapeutiques qui lui sont assignés. This article seeks to explore the links between Islam and psychology in Egypt, focusing on the example of a Cairo-based association proposing counseling and teaching. Its leaders claim an expertise based on a more-than-a-century-old process of psychological institutionalization. Religion is a second normative resource used by the association. To resolve the qualms resulting from these efforts to produce a synthesis between the two, a third element has to be taken into account: the life aspirations linked to the middle class status. Eventually, this case study provides an insight on the external influences that shape the discipline, notably in the light of the assigned therapeutic goals.

and that both governments faced difficult constraints, leading the authors to emphasize the
overall "complexity" of the situation.<br>

Abstract: While there is much writing on the nation as the subject of linear history, considerably less attention has been paid to the dimension of the nation as the always identifiable, unchanging subject of history. This unchanging subject is necessitated by the ascendancy of the conception of linear time in capitalism in which change is viewed not only as accelerating, but can no longer be framed by an ultimate source of meaning such as God. Ostensibly, linear history is the falling of events into the "river of time," but national history also posits a continuous subject to gather these changes. Such a subject is recognizable only by the spiritual qualities of authenticity, purity, and sacrality. The nation-state and nationalists stake their claim to sovereign authority, in part, as custodians of this authenticity. A range of figures, human and non-human, come to symbolize a regime of authenticity manipulable to some extent by nationalists and state-builders. This essay focuses on the instance of women in early twentieth-century China. Nationalists and cultural essentialists tended to depict women as embodying the eternal Chinese civilizational virtues of self-sacrifice and loyalty and to elevate them as national exemplars. The essay also examines cases of how women themselves may have perceived this role as exemplars and concludes that while there was considerable subversion in their enunciation of this role (to their advantage), there was sufficient reference to the prescriptive code of authenticity in their self-formation to sustain the regime of authenticity. The essay ends with some thoughts about the changing relationship between authenticity and intensifying globalization in the contemporary world.<br>

Article Title: Can Histories be True? Narrativism, Positivism, and the "Metaphorical Turn"<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342994<br>

Abstract: Narrativism, as represented by Hayden White and Frank Ankersmit, can fruitfully be analyzed as an inversion of two brands of positivism. First, narrativist epistemology can be regarded as an inversion of empiricism. Its thesis that narratives function as metaphors which do not possess a cognitive content is built on an empiricist, "picture view" of knowledge. Moreover, all the non-cognitive aspects attributed to narrative as such are dependent on this picture theory of knowledge and a picture theory of representation. Most of the epistemological characteristics that White and Ankersmit attribute to historical narratives therefore share the problems of this picture theory. The article's second thesis is that the theories of narrative explanation can also fruitfully be analyzed as inversions of positivist covering-law theory. Ankersmit's brand of narrativism is the most radical in this respect because it posits an opposition between narrative and causal modes of comprehension while simultaneously eliminating causality from narrativist historical understanding. White's brand of narrativism is more of a hybrid than is Ankersmit's as far as its theory of explanation is concerned; nevertheless, it can also be fruitfully interpreted as an inversion of covering-law theory, replacing it by an indefinite multitude of explanatory strategies. Most of the striking characteristics of both White's and Ankersmit's narrativism presuppose positivism in these two senses, especially their claim that historical narratives have a metaphorical structure and therefore no truth-value. These claims are hard to reconcile with the factual characteristics of debates by historians; this problem can be tracked down to the absence in "metaphorical" narrativism of a conceptual connection between historical narratives and historical research.<br>

Abstract: What is the use of writing poems against war if they reenact rather than alter the binaries and brutalities of the war imagination they claim to protest? Why does so much contemporary war poetry only compound war's depleting effect instead of offering us energy for resistance? In The Life of Poetry (1949), Muriel Rukeyser defines poetry as a vital but underused national resource for a culture dominated by war. As a creative transfer of energy, poetry complicates and resists habits of imagination that sustain war. Using Rukeyser's analysis to contrast a representative poem from the volume Poets Against the War (2003) to several poems by Forche, Celan, James Wright, Blake, Yeats, Oppen, and Levertov, this paper discusses ways in which poetry about war and wartime can provide useful, life-giving energy without replicating the very violences it claims to oppose.<br>

Abstract: Much recent commentary on the theory of international politics has focused on the analysis of change and the continuing vitality of political realism. This paper argues that the philosophical dilemmas posed by the concern with change and by the claim to political realism are intimately related. The argument is pursued in the context of contrasting traditions of political realism, of the antithesis between structuralism and historicism in contemporary social and political theory, and of recent tendencies and controversies in the literature on neorealist theories of international politics. The paper concludes that political realism ought to be understood less as a coherent theoretical position in its own right than as the site of a great many interesting claims and metaphysical disputes. As there is no single tradition of political realism, but rather a knot of historically constituted tensions and contradictions, these tensions and contradictions might be reconstituted in a more critical and creative manner. This involves an examination of the way the core categories of international political theory depend upon a particular formulation of the relationship between identity and difference-a formulation which must be refused.<br>

Abstract: Frank, Underdevelopment of Revolution, p. xii. Frank writes: "Dialectically integrated society and economy which today obliges the bourgeoisie—including its most nationalist sectors—to pursue policies which, however much development they may generate for the minority, condemn the majority of Latin Americans to ever-deeper underdevelopment, and the bourgeoisie itself to increasing dependence on and absorption into the metropolitan bourgeoisie of the neo-imperialist system." In his more recent work, Frank attempts to understand economic systems from a global rather than Eurocentric perspective, and argues that the modern rise of Europe may be seen as a mere blip on a world economic landscape dominated by Asia. See hisReOrient: Global Economy in an Asian Age (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998andFrank and B.K. Gills, eds. The World System: Five Hundred Years or Five Thousand? (London and New York: Routledge, 1993).). Interestingly, Frank also argues that his world systems theory has not taken adequate account of questions of "ecology and cosmology," and thus are perhaps too "humanocentric" as some critics claim (ReOrient, xxvi).<br>

Abstract: A claim associated with Leo Strauss, but one that could with some amendment of

Strauss and the analytical (he would have called them positivistic) theorists were in almost
all other respects diametrically opposed. See, for example, Leo Strauss, What is Political
Philosophy (Chicago, 1954); and Barry 'The Strange Death of Political Philosophy'.<br>

Issue: i345615<br>
Date: 6 1, 1958<br>
Author(s): Wittgenstein Daniel<br>
Abstract: This paper argues against causalism about reasons in three stages. First, the paper investigates Professor Davidson's sophisticated version of the claim that we must understand reason-explanations as a kind of causal explanation to highlight the fact that this move does no explanatory work in telling us how we determine for which reasons we act. Second, the paper considers Davidson's true motivation for regarding reasons-explanations as causal which connects with his claim that reasons are causes. He advocates anomalous monism in order to solve the mysterious connection problem. In assessing his proposed solution to this problem, the paper examines his `extension reply' to the charge that his token identity theory ultimately results in epiphenomenalism. The paper argues that only a reading of this reply makes for a stable anomalous monism but for this reason Davidson's compatiblist metaphysics is unfit for the task of solving the mysterious connection problem. Given that reductive accounts are incompatible with the special features of reasons explanations, the paper concludes that we must reverse the orthodoxy once again and eschew causalism about reasons and reason-explanations. Finally, the paper considers a possible way of recasting our understanding of causation so that the mysterious connection problem disappears.<br>

Author(s): Vidler Ken<br>
Abstract: I focus on Nietzsche's architectural metaphor of self-construction in arguing for the claim that postmodern readings of Nietzsche misunderstand his various attacks on dogmatic philosophy as paving the way for acceptance of a self characterized by fundamental disunity. Nietzsche's attack on essentialist dogmatic metaphysics is a call to engage in a purposive self-creation under a unifying will, a will that possesses the strength to reinterpret history as a pathway to "the problem that we are". Nietzsche agrees with the postmodernists that unity is not a pre-given, however he would disavow their rejection of unity as a goal. Where the postmodernists celebrate "the death of the subject" Nietzsche rejects this valorization of disunity as a form of Nihilism and prescribes the creation of a genuine unified subjectivity to those few capable of such a goal. Postmodernists are nearer Nietzsche's idea of the Last Man than his idea of the Overman.<br>

Abstract: Rational choice theory and the critical theory of Jurgen Habermas exclude important social categories from their analyses of strategic interaction. Successful strategic action in many contexts, however, depends upon the irreducibly intersubjective categories of the lifeworld. I defend this claim by analyzing the use of focal points to solve the multiple equilibria problem in coordination games, reconstructing both the generation of the salience behind focal points as well as the strategic rationality of using them. The goal of this reconstruction is to demonstrate the compatibility of what appears to be mutually hostile research traditions, validating the intuition that together they provide a better understanding of politics than either school can on its own.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i27646172<br>
Date: 12 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
Abstract: The kind of phenomenology that can be useful to theology will be a hermeneutical phenomenology, one that takes us beyond the Cartesian/Husserlian ideal of presuppositionless intuition. It will also be a phenomenology of inverse intentionality, one in which the constituting subject is constituted by the look and the voice of another. In light of these suggestions, the phenomenology of Jean-Luc Marion is defended against three critiques, namely that it compromises the boundary between phenomenology and theology, that the theology it serves is a bad one to boot, and that it has an inadequate account of the subject. At the heart of this defense is Marion's clear distinction between phenomenology as a description of possible experience, and theology as the claim that a certain kind of experience, namely revelation or epiphany, is not merely actual but veridical. Phenomenology says, If revelation occurs it will be in the form of a saturated phenomenon. Theology says, for example, the burning bush was an epiphany, or Jesus Christ is a revelation. The attentive reader should have no trouble distinguishing Marion's phenomenological analyses, which should be persuasive to believer and unbeliever alike, from his theological claims. Marion's account of the subject falls under the heading of inverse intentionality, and there are hints that vision is aufgehoben in the voice. The seer is first of all the one seen, but above all the one addressed, called forth into response-able being.<br>

Author(s): Wyschogrod Edith<br>
Abstract: Mass death resulting from war, starvation, and disease as well as the vicissitudes of extreme poverty and enforced sexual servitude are recognizably pandemic ills of the contemporary world. In light of their magnitude, are repentance, regret for the harms inflicted upon others or oneself, and forgiveness, proferring the erasure of the guilt of those who have inflicted these harms, rendered nugatory? Jacques Derrida claims that forgiveness is intrinsically rather than circumstantially or historically impossible. Forgiveness, trapped in a paradox, is possible only if there is such a thing as the unforgivable. "Thus, forgiveness, if there is such a thing," can only exist as exempt from the law of the possible. Does this claim not open the way for hopelessness and despair? More troubling for Derrida is his concession that forgiveness may be necessary in the realm of the political and juridical. If so, is not the purity of the impossibility of forgiveness so crucial for him, contaminated? In pointing to some of the difficulties in Derrida's position, I shall appeal to Vladimir Jankelevitch's distinction between the unforgivable and the inexcusable. I shall also consider the significance of repentance in the theological ethics of Emmanuel Levinas and Max Scheler. Forgiveness, I conclude, is vacuous without expiation, a position that can be helpfully understood in the context of Judaism's analysis of purification and acquittal in the Day of Atonement liturgy. I argue that what disappears is Derrida's assurance of the impossibility of forgiveness, a disappearance that allows for hope.<br>

Author(s): Smith Jonathan Z.<br>
Abstract: This essay makes explicit what lay behind the author's earlier casual observation that "Tillich remains the unacknowledged theoretician of our entire enterprise"—whether in the AAR or in North American studies of religion more generally. While the article does not make a narrowly (i.e., archivally verified) causal claim about Tillich's influence on the study of religion in the academy, it does point out three crucial roles Tillich's thought and practice played in the development of North American religious studies. (i) Tillich's understanding of religion as an "ultimate concern" provided a language deemed suitable to the new departments of religious studies in this country's higher education institutions (especially at state-run colleges and universities). (ii) Though not uniquely formative of the academy's longstanding discourse on symbolism, Tillich's interest in the symbol served as a legitimating vote of confidence about the worth of that discourse. Moreover, his understanding of the symbol (as that which "points to") ostensibly struck a balance between Eliade's onto-realistic and Geertz's more minimal fictive views of the symbol. (iii) Through his sustained interest in cultural institutions and products of cultural labor—more than through his theories about the relation between religion and culture (e.g., his method of correlation)—Tillich inspired the "dialogic fields" (e.g., Religion and Literature) and subsequent cultural and anthropological studies of religion. The author's earlier claim, then, was intended as a double critique: first, that the study of religion in secular public institutions should ground itself in a Protestant Christian theological project; second, that this influence should remain largely unacknowledged.<br>

Abstract: La stèle du Bronzo est gravée d'un oiseau "levé", en plein vol, la tête tournée vers l'extérieurs, superposé à un filon de quartz blanc; une crosse, également traitée en champlevé, lui barre le passage. En première lecture, une identification plausible du genre volatile semblait prévaloir et le colombidé emportait notre adhésion. Mais une analyse plus posée et un effort de déconstruction graphique du motif permettront cette fois de reprendre et d'affiner la reconnaissance, en décrivant les différents filtres autorisant tel ou tel rejet de catégorie ou d'espèce, pour ne conserver en dernier ressort que les meilleurs prétendants à la seule confrontation possible, celle qui oppose les corvidés aux colombidés. La représentation du Bronzo est en définitive équivalente en substance et en structure aux scènes figurées sur les stèles voisines dans lesquelles un phallus s'oppose qu tranchant d'une lame de hache (Mané Rutual), tandis qu'un cachalot affronte la coalition des animaux et des outils de l'homme (Table des Marchand). A "flushed" bird is engraved on the Bronzo stela, in full flight, its head turned to the exterior, superposed over a white quartz vein; a crook, equally treated in cut-away engraving, bars its passage. At a first reading, a plausible identification of the bird seemed to prevail and the Columbidae met with our approval. However, more deliberate analysis and an effort at the graphic deconstruction of the motif allows the identification to be reconsidered and improved, by describing the various filters authorising the rejection of such or such a category, finally preserving the best claimants to the only possible confrontation, opposing Corvidae to Columbidae. The Bronzo representation is equivalent in substance and in structure to the scenes on the neighbouring stelae where a phallus is opposed to the sharp edge of an axe blade (Mané Rutual), while a sperm-whale confronts the coalition of animals and human tools (Table des Marchand). However Bronzo is a ~<br>

Abstract: A formal claim was made in the mid-20th century that the goal of art conservation is to present the artwork as the artist intended it to be seen. Dispute over this claim among conservators and art historians involved differences of perspective on the relative roles of science and art history in the interpretation of artist's intent. A separate but concurrent debate among philosophers, art critics, and literary critics was sparked by publication of "The Intentional Fallacy," a scholarly article discrediting appeals to the intentions of artists and authors in art and literary criticism. In this separate debate, difficulty in the evaluation and application of artist's intent was traced to ambiguity of the term "intent." The author discusses 11 variations of its meaning and puts the issues surrounding artist's intent together in the contexts of art conservation. He also presents more recent viewpoints in the social sciences that associate issues of artist's intent with the role of the artist in the continued existence of the artwork. The writings of contemporary philosophers contribute useful perspectives on the essential nature of art and the autonomy of artworks from their creators. The author finds that the interpretation and application of artist's intent is an interdisciplinary task and that its evaluation in conservation contexts is limited to consideration of distinctive stylistic characteristics that demonstrate the correlated individuality of artists and their work. /// [French] Au milieu du 20e siècle, on prétendait que l'objectif de la restauration était de rendre aux oeuvres d'art l'aspect que l'artiste avait voulu leur donner.

Abstract: L'étude d'un conflit centré sur le maintien d'écoles élémentaires dans le dispositif de zone d'éducation prioritaire (ZEP) permet de clarifier les figures de montée en généralité dans les engagements et les mobilisations autour de l'école. La mobilisation que nous avons analysée en nous fondant sur les récits rétrospectifs de ses différents protagonistes montre la possibilité pour des mouvements locaux de s'articuler à des revendications non particularistes, sans toutefois oublier les motifs initiaux d'insatisfaction. Cet accès à une cause argumentée, au-delà du travail de médiatisation du mouvement, lui a donné sa consistance interne. En effet, à partir d'un ancrage localisé, ces formes d'action ont fait émerger des questions d'intérêt général que nous présentons et discutons. La clôture de la controverse montre cependant que si l'administration accède à la satisfaction de la revendication initiale des parents, elle méconnaît sa légitimité. /// The study of a conflict centered on whether to keep primary schools in the ZEP programme, gives some clear figures illustrating the more general nature of commitment and mobilization on school matters. Mobilization, which was analyzed from retrospective accounts of its various protagonists, shows how it is possible for local movements to take part in non-specific claims, without however forgetting the initial reasons for dissatisfaction. This means of access with a justified cause reaching beyond the mediatization of the movement, has given it an inner strength. In fact, these types of action, coming from a local base, have brought into light questions of general interest that are presented and discussed. However, the closing of debate shows that although administration meets the parents' initial claim with satisfaction, it refuses to recognize its legitimacy. /// Die Untersuchung eines Konflikts zum Erhalt von Grundschulen im Rahmen der sog.

Author(s): Zola Tanya<br>
Abstract: This paper does not intend to empirically establish whether Disability Studies is old or new; instead, it aims to uncover what the gloss "new" means in relation to mainstream sociology's rejection of such a claim and the repetitive articulation of it by Disability Studies. Conceptions of disability found in traditional sociological studies of disability-as-deviance are explored, turning first to the work of Goffman and then to a mainstream deviance text book. The paper then uncovers the values and assumptions that lie behind the social act of conceiving Disability Studies as a "new" field of inquiry. Thus, "new" is symbolic of an affirmation of inquiry into ablebodiedness as itself a culture in need of critical engagement. It is also a way to articulate the standpoint of disability as a means to provoke such inquiry. Further, "new" is a rhetorical device to highlight that many Disability Studies researchers are now challenging the mainstream approaches to the study of disability. /// Le but de cet article n'est pas d'établir empiriquement si les études de la condition des personnes handicapées ("Disability Studies") constituent un nouveau ou un vieux champ de recherche. Plutôt, cet article examine la signification du mot "nouveau" dans le contexte de la discussion de l'incapacité dans la sociologie contemporaine. Bien que la sociologie traditionnelle refuse de reconnaître que "Disability Studies" constitue une spécialisation nouvelle, les chercheurs dans ce domaine soulignent que le sujet est nouveau. Cet article examine alors les conceptions de l'incapacité trouvées dans les études traditionnelles, études où l'incapacité est comprise en tant que déviance. D'abord on examine la recherche de Goffman et l'analyse de l'incapacité présentée dans un des manuels standards sur la déviance. Ensuite, cet article découvre les valeurs et les suppositions qui se trouvent derrière l'acte social de concevoir "Disability Studies" comme un "nouveau" champ de recherche. Ainsi, on vo~<br>

Abstract: In Time, Narrative, and History, David Carr argues against the narrativist claim that our lived experience does not possess the formal attributes of a story; this conclusion can be reinforced from a semiotic perspective. Our experience is mediated through temporal signs that are used again in the construction of stories. Since signs are social entities from the start, this approach avoids a problem of individualism specific to phenomenology, one which Carr takes care to resolve. A semiotic framework is also explicit about a theme Carr handles implicitly: the status of representation. Representation is internal to signification, mediating our experience not just retrospectively but prospectively in the planning and execution of action. A model is presented in which the temporal organization of experience and action is formally coordinated with the temporal organization of narrative. The model is then applied to a historical event: John Batman's attempt in 1835 to purchase land from some Aboriginal tribes around what is now Melbourne. The meaning of this event is not located only in historical writing about it but in the semiotic constitution of the event itself. Changes of meaning emerge from relations between events as new events-in this case the Australian High Court's Mabo decision-align with old ones. Finally, a number of contrasts are indicated between this model and proposals made by Arthur C. Danto, Hayden White, F. R. Ankersmit, Fernand Braudel, and Paul Ricoeur.<br>

Abstract: The objective of this article is to articulate the hermeneutics of liberation in Ayi Kwei Annan's Two Thousand Seasons. Premised on an assertion that Two Thousand Seasons is divisible into three sections—the realm of the godhead, the realm of the ancestors, and the realm of the living—this article will argue that the protagonists of the novel use land, an abode of the ancestors, as a text through which they form themselves into a healing community. Reinterpreting African belief systems' claim of connectedness of the ancestors to the gods and the godhead, this article will assert that when the protagonists have authentic relationship with each other and their world, they constitute gods or creative forces and consequently have a glimpse of the godhead. Commencing by articulating African belief systems' concepts of godhead, gods, and ancestors, this article concludes by describing the hermeneutic project of the novel's protagonists.<br>

Article Title: Classical Otherness: Critical Reflections on the Place of Philology in Gadamer's Hermeneutics<br>
Publisher: Faculdade de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40014488<br>
Date: 12 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Renaud François<br>
Abstract: Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics rests largely on the concept of the classical. According to Gadamer, the classical stands for the continuity and the truth claim of the tradition, as transmitted by the written word. The normative character of the classical is directed against the neutrality and relativism of historicism: understanding does not occur primarily through distancing or methodological reconstruction but through belongingness to, and participation in, the past. The article shows how, given the central importance of dialogue and otherness in Gadamer's theory, the philosopher does not seem to fully do justice to the critical intention of its own dialogical and philological dimensions. On the other hand, it shows also how Gadamer's hermeneutical practice, notably in his rehabilitation of Plato, stresses the learning from otherness more explicitly than does his own theory, thus correcting, as it were, the latter. The article aims, finally, at demonstrating how, by unduly emphasizing the continuity (and sameness) in the encounter between past and present, Gadamer's theory undermines the importance of reconstructing the otherness and specificity of the classical text. /// A hermenêutica filosófica de Gadamer, entendida como uma defesa das humanidades, assenta essencialmente sobre o conceito de clássico. Segundo Gadamer, o clássico representa a continuidade e a pretensão à verdade da tradição tal como nos é transmitida pela palavra escrita. O carácter normativo do clássico em Gadamer constitui assim uma resposta crítica à neutralidade e ao relativismo do historicismo: a compreensão não acontece primariamente graças a um processo de distanciação ou reconstrução metódica, mas sim pelo facto de, desde logo, reconhecermos que temos pertença activa no passado. O presente artigo demonstra como, dada a importância central do diálogo e da alteridade na teoria de Gadamer, ofilósofo acaba por não fazer inteiramente justiça à intenção crítica inerente à dimensão dialógi~<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo visa expor efundamentar a necessidade de se articular, para além das diferenças que existam entre eles, os posicionamentos da hermenêutica de Hans-Georg Gadamer em relação às perspectivas abertas pela teoria crítica de Jürgen Habermas y Karl-Otto Apel, já que so assim se poderá adequadamente justificar a dinãmica do conhecimento humano bem como a sua constituiva dimensão critica. Mostra-se também como o debate entre Gadamer e Habermas logrou pôr a claw alguns dos mais importantes pontos de conexão entre ambos, o que nos permite aceder a uma perspectiva filosófica em que se associam o carácter histórico e flnito da razão e a dimensão crítica constitutiva da mesma. Desvanece-se, deste modo, a necessidade de se estabelecer uma alternativa insuperdvel entre "consciência hermenêutica" e "consciência critica ", ao mesmo tempo que se aclara a natureza da reflexão filosófica como sendo um procedimento interpretativo (hermenêutico) crítico em que, justamente por isso, ninguém pode aceder à pretensão de possuir a última palavra. /// This article seeks to establish the need of articulating the positioning of Gadamer's hermeneutics with the critical theory represented by Habermas and Apel. It is only on the basis of such an articulation that the dynamics of knowing can be seen to possess a critical dimension. The debate between Gadamer and Habermas succeeded in rendering explicit some of the points that enable us to envisage a philosophical perspective in which both the historicity of human reason and its critical dimension can be worked together. Thus, the need to establish an unsurpassable alternative between "hermeneutic consciousness" and "critical consciousness" simply disappears. At the same time, it becomes clear that philosophical reflexion itself consists of an interpretative procedure that is also critical in nature, along with the fact that no-one can claim to have the last word in this activity.<br>

Abstract: In this article, the author argues that the phenomenological revolution inaugurated by Husserl and Heidegger opens up new avenues for a radical rethinking of the God question. With Husserl's 'free variation of possibilities in imagination' and Heidegger's famous claim in Being and Time that 'for phenomenology possibility stands higher than actuality', the author discovers new resources for our understanding of both Being and God. In both cases, the article claims, we witness the surpassing of the traditional metaphysical priority of actuality over possibility. Then, in a second moment, the paper explores the notion of the 'God of possibility' from the perspective of three different hermeneutic circles: scriptural, testimonial and literary. The essay concludes with an analysis of the positive implications of the notion of the 'possible' (as posse and possest) for a new understanding of the God of eschatology. /// No presente artigo, o autor defende que a revolução fenomenológica inaugurada por E. Husserl e M. Heidegger abre novas possibilidades para um repensar radical da questão de Deus. A partir da 'livre variação de possibilidades na imaginação' de Husserl e afamosa pretensão de Heidegger em Ser e Tempo de que para a 'fenomenologia a possibilidade está acima da actualidade', o autor descobre novos recursos para a nossa compreensão quer do Ser quer de Deus. Tanto num caso como no outro, diz-nos o artigo, podemos testemunhar a superação da tradicional prioridade metafisica da actualidade sobre a possibilidade. Em seguida, num segundo momento, o artigo explora também a noção de um 'Deus da possibilidade' a partir da perspectiva de três círculos hermenêuticos diferentes: o escriturístico, o testemonial e o literário. 0 ensaio conclui com uma análise das implicações positivas da noção de 'possível' (como posse e possest) para uma nova compreensão do Deus da escatologia.<br>

Abstract: This paper takes up Richard Kearney's work The God Who May Be, specifically in the context of postmodern debates concerning epistemological claims regarding the other. Kearney's hermeneutics of religion attempts to forge a middle path between ontotheological philosophies of religion and various quasi-religious manifestations of postmodernism; however, my main concern is to address certain points of disagreement between Kearney and proponents of a deconstructive "religion without religion" principally Jacques Derrida and John D. Caputo. The main issue at stake is just how other God is, which is itself a specific case of a broader question concerning otherness per se. Caputo et al. claim that religious assertions about God are fundamentally undecidable, which means that they are "infinitely translatable" and "substitutable," that we can never tell what is a translation of what, but the ultimate point is that it "does not matter" The undecidable nature of religious claims includes the very claim that religion is a discourse about God, which is why deconstructive religion without religion is a messianic hope for "the impossible" devoid of any content. Kearney objects that such radical undecidability leaves us lost in the desert ofkhora with no way to distinguish, even imperfectly and provisionally, between God and Satan, good and evil, the widow and the terrorist. In this paper I claim that Kearney succeeds in finding this via tertia between the Scylla of dogmatism and the Charybdis of complete indeterminacy by thinking God in two important ways: as persona-prosopon (which avoids confusing God with khora or monstrosity) and as posse (which keeps us from dogmatism). /// O presente artigo toma em particular consideração a obra de Richard Kearney The God Who May Be, especificamente no contexto dos debates pós-modernos acerca do estatuto epistemológico da alteridade.

Abstract: Cet article présente une lecture de l'histoire de la Palestine telle qu'elle est perçue par les historiens arabes. Il aborde l'évolution de cette histoire à travers les étapes marquantes de la construction identitaire et nationale du peuple palestinien. On propose, notamment, une analyse de l'historiographie arabe moderne de la Palestine dans le sens où elle est conçue en miroir de l'histoire israélienne et comme outil de revendication de l'appartenance d'un peuple à une terre. L'année 1948, caractérisant l'expulsion (Nakba) des Palestiniens de leur terre, est un tournant décisif dans l'écriture et l'appréhension de l'histoire palestinienne: elle représente l'année de départ mais également celle du retour vers la construction d'une identité nationale, territoriale et historique. /// This paper presents a new reading of the Palestinian history as perceived by the Arab historians. It tackles the evolution of the history throughout the significant stages of the nation and identity building of the Palestinian people, and proposes an analysis of the modern Arab historiography of Palestine conceived as a mirror to the Israeli one, and as a tool for the claim of the lost homeland. The year of 1948 designating the Palestinian expulsion (Nakba) remains the turning point for all the writings and represents at the same time, the year of departure and of return for the construction of the national, territorial and historical Palestinian identity.<br>

Abstract: The critical discourse on U.S. military detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib prison has been dominated by Weberian-style arguments (a bureaucracy gone wrong, insufficient or badly applied administrative rules, or individuals acting as cogs in a machine). We argue that Michel Foucault's "security apparatus" provides a more insightful model for understanding the Abu Ghraib phenomenon. According to this model, the prison becomes a nodal point in an information-gathering nexus confronting unforeseen, emergent, and unclear events, a place where power is less disciplinary than improvisational, exercised through practical judgments about uncertain situations. The performance of such power at Abu Ghraib included the use of photography and acts that, we claim, resemble M. M. Bahktin's negative carnivalesque.<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: Cet article explore les dynamiques de l'échange communicationnel à l'époque de Stalin et son impact sur la formation de l'opinion. Alors que les journaux, qui présentent leurs auteurs dans un état solitaire de monologue intérieur, révèlent souvent des étendues d'ambiguité et de doute, une communication engagée, particulièrement entre personnes se faisant confiance, est beaucoup plus à même de donner naissance à des jugements et des opinions clairs, ce qui est de la plus haute importance sur le plan de la capacité critique. La riche correspondance personnelle de la famille Kravčenko-Spunde, famille de vieux bolcheviks engagés, montre à quel point un échange ouvert peut susciter et renforcer tant le soutien que la critique la plus âpre du système. Ces documents mettent en lumière un changement majeur, le passage d'un soutien quasi inconditionnel au régime stalinien à sa critique de « fossoyeur de la révolution » , condamnation qui émerge du débat politique tenu dans le cercle étroit de la famille. De plus, la défense d'un bien commun à l'encontre du discours public pousse les discutants à transcender leur cercle restreint et à chercher un contre-public indispensable pour lever le soupçon de particularité qui pèse sur les « biens » défendus au sein de ce cercle et pour confirmer ainsi leur caractère de « bien commun ». La tentative d'élargissement du cercle communicationnel mène à une nouvelle activité dans l'écriture mémorielle qui se propose aussi bien de dévoiler les mensonges du système que de révéler un héritage révolutionnaire distinct de la représentation officielle monopolisée par le régime. L'expérience des relations personnelles pendant la révolution joue un rôle essentiel pour cette revendication dissidente d'un héritage révolutionnaire. Camaraderie et confrontation unie face à l'ennemi pendant la guerre civile doivent être distinguées de l'énonciation et de l'élaboration d'opinions lors de débats publics. Seule cette seconde expérience, basée sur la récipro~<br>

Author(s): HOROLETS ANNA<br>
Abstract: Even though the European Union has become an "ever closer union" in economic and political terms, the problem of the emotional deficit of the EU identity calls for solutions. Metaphor offers an untypical yet interesting mechanism of overcoming the alien aura of the EU. Taking into consideration the cognitive value of metaphors, Antony Judge, the EU expert, designed the dynamic system of metaphors to articulate the new European identity. At the same time, in the candidate countries the alternative discourses of European identity emerge. Polish press makes use of the emotional potential of metaphors. With the help of metaphors Polish pubic discourse grounds the claim of the rightful and necessary belonging of Poland to the European Union thus engaging in symbolic politics. Moreover, through metaphoric images the relations between Europe and the "Self" are critically or ironically assessed. In an ambiguous period of accession negotiations these metaphors empowered Polish public to create their own conceptions of what the European identity is.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur Stephen<br>
Abstract: Inspired by Pierre-Jean-Georges Cabanis' claim in 1798 that physicians might learn forms of medical reasoning from les anciens rhéteurs, in this paper I explore intimate associations between medicine and rhetoric over the longue durée. Gravely susceptible to error, medical reasoning relies on signs and examples, both gleaned from experience and both the subject of rhetorical inquiry; like rhetoric, medicine reaches plausible conclusions from probable premises. Here, ranging from Hippocrates and Plato through Aristotle to early modern England, I argue that forms of inference developed and refined in the history of rhetoric offer ancient and early modern philosophers and physicians models and metaphors for their own forays into the probable.<br>

Article Title: GADAMER AND COLLINGWOOD ON TEMPORAL DISTANCE AND UNDERSTANDING<br>
Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services<br>
Issue: i40063719<br>
Date: 12 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): MARION MATHIEU<br>
Abstract: In this paper, we begin by suggesting an intuitive model of time embodying a notion of temporal distance that we claim is at work in Gadamer's hermeneutics, while it is rejected in Collingwood's theory of interpretation. To show this, after a brief review of the influence of Collingwood on Gadamer and of their disagreement over the possibility of recovering an author's intention, we examine in turn their answers to the problem of transposition, upon which the philosophy of Dilthey supposedly foundered. We show that Gadamer embraced the idea of temporal distance in his solution, which consisted in claiming that the distance between an author from the past and us is filled in by tradition, which opens access to the text for us, while Collingwood considered explanations of the actions of historical agents, and by extension understanding of a text, in intentional or rational terms. Furthermore, he thought that such explanations are not causal, and that the thoughts involved in them do not stand within the flow of physical time, which is involved in any notion of temporal distance. This is why Collingwood felt entitled to anti-relativistic conclusions about the recovery of authorial intentions, conclusions that prompted Gadamer to claim that "the dimension of hermeneutical mediation which is passed through in every act of understanding" escaped him. We then discuss the underlying notions of time at work in both Gadamer and Collingwood, showing that Ricoeur had a better appreciation of the issue, since he saw that Collingwood's moves parallel, up to a point, Heidegger's critique of "vulgar time," albeit with an entirely different result. We also point to the importance in Collingwood's thinking of his notion of "incapsulation."<br>

Abstract: Internet suscite beaucoup d'espoirs et de craintes. Certains prétendent que cet outil sera favorable à l'émergence de sociétés de la connaissance à condition de réduire préalablement la fracture numérique et cognitive. Cet article prend prétexte de cette idée pour évaluer quels sont les réels rapports de force qui se jouent entre croyances et connaissances sur la toile. Il montre, d'une part, que l'amplification de la diffusion de l'information est favorable à l'expression du biais de confirmation qui est un des mécanismes fondamentaux de la pérennité des croyances. Il souligne, d'autre part, qu'Internet est un marché cognitif très sensible à la structuration de l'offre et donc à la motivation des offreurs, ce qui confère un avantage décisif à l'empire des croyances contre celui de la connaissance. Ce dernier point est mesuré dans cet article de façon quantitative sur des thèmes de croyances diverses. The Internet is the source of many hopes and fears. Some claim that this tool will help lead to the emergence of knowledge societies if digital and cognitive gaps can be reduced beforehand. This article takes that idea as a basis to then evaluate what are the real power relations played out between beliefs and knowledge on the web. It shows that the amplification of the dissemination of information is conducive to the expression of "confirmation bias" which is one of the mechanisms which permit beliefs to survive. It also stresses that Internet is a cognitive market which is very sensitive to structuring of supply and therefore the motivation of suppliers, which confers a decisive advantage to the "empire of beliefs". This last point is measured quantitatively in this paper on various topics of belief.<br>

Article Title: From Poverty to Perversity: Ideas, Markets, and Institutions over 200 Years of Welfare Debate<br>
Publisher: American Sociological Association<br>
Issue: i387752<br>
Date: 4 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Zukin Fred<br>
Abstract: To understand the rise of market fundamentalism from the margins of influence to mainstream hegemony, we compare the U.S. 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act and the English 1834 New Poor Law-two episodes in which existing welfare regimes were overturned by market-driven ones. Despite dramatic differences across the cases, both outcomes were mobilized by "the perversity thesis "-a public discourse that reassigned blame for the poor's condition from "poverty to perversity." We use the term "ideational embeddedness" to characterize the power of such ideas to shape, structure, and change market regimes. The success of the perversity thesis is based on the foundations of social naturalism, theoretical realism, and the conversion narrative. In the poverty to perversity conversion narrative, structural blame for poverty is discredited as empiricist appearance while the real problem is attributed to the corrosive effects of welfare's perverse incentives on poor people themselves-they become sexually promiscuous, thrust aside personal responsibility, and develop long-term dependency. This claim enables market fundamentalism to delegitimate existing ideational regimes, to survive disconfirming data, and to change the terms of debate from social problems to the timeless forces of nature and biology. Coupling economic sociology with a sociology of ideas, we argue that ideas count; but not all ideas are created equal. Only some have the capacity to fuel radical transformations in the ideational embeddedness of markets.<br>

Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Waistell Jeff<br>
Abstract: This study investigates how business leaders dynamically narrate their aspirational ethical leadership identities. In doing so, it furthers understanding of ethical leadership as a process situated in time and place. The analysis focuses on the discursive strategies used to narrate identity and ethics by ethnic Chinese business leaders in Indonesia after their conversion to Pentecostal-charismatic Christianity. By exploring the use of metaphor, our study shows how these business leaders discursively deconstruct their 'old' identities and construct their 'new' aspirational identities as ethical leaders. This leads to the following contributions. First, we show that ethical leadership is constructed in identity talk as the business leaders actively narrate aspirational identities. Second, the identity narratives of the business leaders suggest that ethical leadership is a context-bound and situated claim vis-à-vis unethical practice. Third, we propose a conceptual template, identifying processes of realisation and inspiration followed by significant shifts in understanding, for the study of aspirational ethical leadership.<br>

Author(s): Gardner Sebastian<br>
Abstract: In this paper I sketch a reconstruction of the basic psychoanalytic conception of the mind in terms of two historical resources: the conception of the subject developed in post-Kantian idealism, and Spinoza's laws of the affects in Part Three of the Ethics. The former, I suggest, supplies the conceptual basis for the psychoanalytic notion of the unconscious, while the latter defines the type of psychological causality of psychoanalytic explanations. The imperfect fit between these two elements, I claim, is reflected in familiar conceptual difficulties surrounding psychoanalytic theory and explanation.<br>

Publisher: Berghahn Journals<br>
Issue: i40084882<br>
Date: 4 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Mitchell Joshua<br>
Abstract: Because Hobbes is understood to be a proto-liberal thinker, a great deal hinges on how we understand his writings. Does he contribute to the development of a purely secular political self-understanding, as many liberals today claim? And, by extension, does that mean that liberal thought today best stands on a purely secular foundation? What, then, should we make of the extensive theological speculation throughout his Leviathan! Here, I argue that to reconcile the seemingly purely secular claims in Leviathan with the obviously religious claims found there we must move beyond reading him in terms of what I here call 'the fable of liberalism', and comprehend Leviathan as a whole in terms of Reformation era debates between Protestants and Roman Catholics about the limits and purview of reason. Understood in that way we see his claims about 'reason' in a new and important light. Rather than being an inevitable development that comes to supercede honour and glory, as the fable of liberalism suggests, 'reason' is seen to have an historically contingent character, whose parameters are established by wagers about the meaning of religious experience.<br>

Article Title: 'Fire from Above, Fire from Below': Health, Justice and the Persistence of the Sacred<br>
Publisher: Berghahn Journals<br>
Issue: i40084883<br>
Date: 8 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Cochrane James R.<br>
Abstract: The essay refers to a concern for social justice in the origins of public health, borne in part by religious commitments, and to more recent expressions of a similar concern in debates about health equity. Equity, moreover, is affected by discursive power relations (dominant/hegemonic versus local/suppressed), which are discussed in relation to current research in the African Religious Health Assets Programme on the interaction of particular 'healthworlds' (a conceptual innovation) that shape the choices and behaviour of health-seekers. Two background theoretical positions guide the argument: Amartya Sen's claim that development is linked to freedom (including religious freedom); and, building on Sen's and Martha Nussbaum's human capabilities theory, an asset-based community approach to the building or reconstruction of public health systems. On this basis, it is argued that health systems and health interventions are just to the extent that they mediate between the necessary leadership or polity from 'above' (techné) and the experience and wisdom (métis) of those who are 'below', taking into account the asymmetries of power that this equation represents. Because difference and diversity are so often expressed in what we might reasonably call 'religious' terms, I specifically emphasize the continuing persistence of religion and, hence, the importance of accounting for its pertinence in social theory generally, and in relation to discourses of health and justice in the African context specifically. Acknowledging the ambiguities of religion, I nevertheless argue that an appreciative alignment between public health systems and religious or faith-based initiatives in health promotion, prevention and care is crucial to sustainable and just health systems in Africa.<br>

Abstract: Valentin Lebedev is a pioneer of space and earth science in Russia. He is also the first ethnographic diarist of outer space. In 1982, while "on orbit" for 211 days as a fieldworking cosmonaut, Lebedev produced a thickly descriptive account of the intimate sociality and technoculture of the Soviet space complex Salyut 7. Crafted to defamiliarize (ostranenie) a spaceworld that publics saw as flawlessly engineered and managed, the diary is an argument for the value of exospheric (exo-) surprise in human experience. But on another level, we learn that the surprise is on humans who would claim to conquer "space-as-itself"—a "zero gravity" environment of force fields both extremely inhospitable to life as we know it and also generative of life in all its expressions.<br>

Abstract: In the context of globalization, cultural anthropology gained a new momentum by highlighting the self-conscious persistence of cultural differences. Against the background of an ever increasing intensity of societal and economic entanglements, the vital claim of cultural differences must be a reflexive process associated with the idea that one's own culture is creative and adaptive to innovations. Anthropologists have defined a set of tools in order to describe these processes of cultural changes. These tools have the names of hybridization, creolization and domestication, but, in particular also of cultural appropriation. Historically cultural appropriation was mainly relevant in contexts of unequal power relations. Appropriation thereby became a strategy of the powerless, who used appropriation in order to undermine the structures defined by the powerful. Cultural appropriation can also be practised through mimesis, and thereby negates the authority of powerful actors. Cultural appropriation requires moments of negotiations and does not aim at definitive results, but merely at the transgression of boundaries. Well defined fields of cultural appropriation within anthropology are media studies and consumption. Empirical approaches to a more detailed documentation of appropriation can be the following: (1) Naming, (2) Contextualization, (3) Incorporation and (4) material transformation.<br>

Issue: i40100618<br>
Date: 1 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Špirit Michael<br>
Abstract: This article discusses the attitude of the Czech literary critic Václav Černý to his fellow critic and compatriot F. X. Šalda, that is to say, Černý's self-stylization, which was defined in polemical reference to Šalda, and also the way Černý 'broadcast' it or concealed it - the primary feature of his technique. Concerning the question of whether literary criticism is a science or an art, the author does not state that Šalda was correct in his Stance against Černý nor, for that matter, that Černý was correct in his against Šalda: the construct of Černý's 'Co je kritika, co není a k čemu je na světě' [What Criticism Is, What It Is Not, and Why It Exists at All] is just as valid as Šalda's claim. The article seeks to demonstrate that in particular it was in his conception of literary criticism that Černý needed to distance himself from Šalda. The fact that Černý could argue for his own method only thanks to Šalda's not having declared criticism a science is only seemingly a paradox. The article also points out parallels between Šalda’s Boje o zítřek and Černý's Osobnost, tvorba a boj, which are interesting particularly for the way the narrow correspondence between the two works then stands out and how Černý in fact barely discussed Šalda at ali. The affinity of the two critics emphasizes how important it was for Černý to stress the difference between himself and his predecessor in the very area in which he was in fact most similar to him.<br>

Abstract: This essay returns to the Dixie Chicks "incident" in order to reexamine the backlash against them. Their critics claim that patriotism and their contract with country music are at stake; I argue that the backlash is old-fashioned misogyny. My examination considers the concepts of prayer, patriotism, and the American Pledge of Allegiance. These words, though used loosely, are part of the central criticism of the Dixie Chicks actions. To accomplish my task, I turn, on the one hand, to Levinas and Heschel, and on the other to Hegel's reading of Antigone.<br>

Issue: i40115211<br>
Date: 1 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Marcus Ruth Barcan<br>
Abstract: In this paper some claims of Professor Ricoeur are challenged. (1) It is pointed out on historical grounds that counter to Professor Ricoeur's claim, most past philosophies are displaced, or ignored. The surviving canon is small and very selective. There is, therefore, substantial agreement on the large corpus which is rejected. (2) It is also argued that Professor Ricoeur's contrast between philosophy and the sciences is too sharp since in the history of modern sciences there are always conflicting theories existing in parallel. However, it is the case that in philosophy standards of "acceptability" are looser and not the rigorous ones of science. A philosophical theory may be appreciated for the problems it discloses, the richness and subtlety of its arguments, its strategies and the like despite acknowledged failings. Appreciation of incompatible theories is not irrational. (3) The claim is rejected that the seeming irrationality is resolved by viewing each system as wholly autonomous. (4) The apparent restriction of philosophy by Professor Ricoeur to global systems is also questioned. L'auteur conteste quelques affirmations du prof. Ricoeur. (1) Elle montre, sur des bases historiques, que beaucoup de philosophies passées sont écartées ou ignorées. Le canon retenu est petit et très sélectif. Il y a donc un accord substantiel quant au vaste corpus qui est rejeté. (2) Elle montre aussi que le contraste que le professeur Ricoeur établit entre philosophie et sciences est trop abrupt, puisqu'il y a toujours eu, dans l'histoire de la science moderne, des théories opposées qui coexistaient. Toutefois, il est vrai qu'en philosophie, les standards d' «acceptabilité» sont plus lâches et diffèrent de ceux, plus rigoureux, de la science. Une philosophie peut être appréciée pour les problèmes qu'elle pose, pour la richesse et la subtilité de ses arguments, ses stratégies ou d'autres choses semblables et ceci en dépit de ses insuffisances notoires.

Abstract: The present methodological debate about the need for a particular theological perspective when researching on the subject of contemporary church history raises central issues about the question of the validity of theology as a subject for scientific investigations. On the one hand, we should seek to avoid any dualtrack approach which would question the whole notion claimed by theologians to be advancing the cause of truth in a scientific manner. On the other hand, theology is a "thorn in the flesh" for the world of scholarship, since it seeks to guarantee openness as a central maxim in scholarly research, and to oppose any reductionist tendency which would pervert the secular methods of scholarly work by advancing the monopolistic claim of a systematic, ideological atheism. The right of theologians to propose their own special approach to theological questions should not be based on abstract principle, but is better defended-drawing on the researches of Itopper, Ricoeur and Marrou-as being in accordance with man's sinful nature and pragmatically meaningful. Drawing a distinction between the discovery of knowledge and assessment of its meaning can lead to a positive evaluation of experiences and their various connections. Any examination of experience, from a theological or ecclesiastical point of view, should not therefore be dismissed as illegitimate. Rather, it can add a valuable dimension in producing new horizons and perspectives. Of course, any such theological endeavour will still be subject to the rigorous disciplines of interdisciplinary discourse. Church history, as well as contemporary church history, is therefore in some ways competing with other historical disciplines. They are all attempting to make sense out of the welter of events by means of a theoretical ordering of experience. As such they provide a desirable, but by no means an exclusive, method of guiding men and women in their on-going search for insights into the nature of the world, man and Go~<br>

Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): SHOHAM HIZKY<br>
Abstract: The article seeks to revitalize the concept of tradition and re-claim its usefulness for contemporary sociological thought and research. Instead of ontological entity, tradition is defined here as an assigned temporal meaning, i. e., a symbolic activity in which various social groups attribute traditional qualities to certain sectors of life that are understood as binding together different times. The article analyzes two incompatible approaches with which tradition was hitherto conceptualized in sociology: (1) tradition as the anti-modern, and (2) tradition as synonymous with "culture." The analysis introduces a few middle-ground options that support the theory of tradition as assigned meaning. L'article entend redonner vie au concept de tradition en sociologie et montrer son utilité pour la recherche aujourd'hui. Il met en évidence les insuffisances des deux interprétations usuelles : tradition comme refus de la modernité et tradition rendue synonyme de culture. Il propose de voir dans l'appel à tradition une activité symbolique par laquelle des groupes sociaux divers attribuent des caractères « traditionnels » à certains aspects de la vie sociale regardés comme assurant un lien inter-temporel. Dieser Aufsatz setzt sich zum Ziel der Tradition in der Soziologie einen neuen Aufschwung zu geben und ihre Bedeutung für die heutige Forschung zu verdeutlichen. Er hebt die Unzulänglichkeiten zweier gängiger Interpretationsschemen hervor: Tradition als Verweigerung der Moderne und Tradition als Synonym für Kultur. Er schlägt vor, den Aufruf an die Tradition als symbolischen Akt zu begreifen, dem verschiedene soziale Gruppen traditionelle Werte im sozialen Miteinander beimessen, die als intertemporales Bindeglied fungieren<br>

Abstract: In attempting to achieve some form of mapping between consciousness (specifically, consciousness₆) and cognition, I distinguish between a weak and a strong version of the hypothesis, indicating a change in mode of thinking of a metaphoric-symbolic nature (Glicksohn, 1993). The weak version would claim that metaphors, symbols, analogies and images are used in an attempt to depict the experience, which is not easily translatable into words. The strong version would claim that metaphoric thinking is one of the hallmarks of the experience, and is used both in an attempt to depict the experience and also to convey to the reader, and possibly to induce in the reader, some of the qualities of that experience. My discussion of these two options is preceded by some comments on problems inherent in studying altered or alternate states of consciousness. I also discuss the relationships among physiognomic perception, cognitive dedifferentiation, and symbolic cognition.<br>

Abstract: Ce texte analyse l'image comme écriture, non seulement parce que la caricature camerounaise est un parfait mélange de l'image et du mot, du mot et du son (donc de la parole), mais aussi parce qu'elle s'immisce constamment dans l'espace pictural pour y introduire le mouvement. Elle est aussi politiquement un métissage du local et du global par son français créole, par son insistance à mettre l'accent sur les mécanismes, situés dans l'espace politique global, qui agissent sur les événements locaux. La caricature semble s'identifier à une rumeur saisie sur le vif qui, pour ne pas devenir mot discipliné, a absolument besoin de l'image pour continuer à être un événement, pour échapper au risque de devenir le double de la vie qui se présente comme son portrait. L'esthétique de cette écriture, qui s'obstine à faire de l'indiscipline le fondement de sa pertinence, repose essentiellement sur l'audace de dire, de montrer, ce qui ne devrait être ni dit, ni montré publiquement. Toutes choses que la caricature peut se permettre puisque, comme la rumeur, elle ne prétend pas reproduire le monde de façon mimétique; elle n'en produit qu'un double dont l'éthique permet de montrer ce que tout le monde sait mais que personne n'ose dire. /// Cameroonian caricatures are analyzed as a form of writing that mixes images and words. Through French Creole, these caricatures politically mix local and general issues by insisting on how politics in general affects the image to become an event. The aesthetics of this form of writing, which obstinately insists on indiscipline as the basis of its relevance, mainly resides in the boldness to speak up about, and show, what should neither be said nor shown in public. Caricatures can do this because, like rumors, they do not claim to reproduce the world through mimesis. They only produce a double for showing what everyone knows but no one dares say.<br>

Abstract: The claim of this essay is that those who study ritual should make fuller use than has been made so far of the literature in philosophy of art. The relevance of aesthetic theory to several questions currently being addressed in ritual studies will be shown, and a model based on what we call "ritual spaces" will serve as the basis for interpreting certain types of ritual. We apply our theory to the ancient Zoroastrian high liturgy, the Yasna. Implications of this interpretive model will also be explored; they include discussions on the following issues: the role of ritual language, the relationship of the various dimensions of ritual, and the basic functions of liturgical performance. The essay begins with analysis and concludes with synthesis.<br>

Abstract: Quelques questions philosophiques suggérées par la lecture du livre de J.-P. Jossua Lectures en écho. Journal théologique I, Paris 1976. Le recours à l'« expérience » devant la faillite des divers dogmatismes permet-il de donner un sens au témoignage de l'absolu? Le refus d'appuyer le christianisme à la culpabilité doit-il aboutir nécessairement à une revendication d'innocence sans intégrer l'apport des analyses de la flnitude et thématiser la condition de créature, inséparablement innocente et coupable? Penser que l'écriture est le lieu privilégié de manifestation du « je », n'est-ce pas recourir au postulat ontologique de la vérité comme fusion de la parole, du sens, du vécu, de la présence de l'homme et de sa vie? Some philosophical questions which arose from reading the book of J.-P. Jossua, Lectures en écho. Journal théologique I, Paris 1976. When faced with the failure of various dogmatisms, would not the recourse to "experience" by its very nature prevent "witness" from being an affirmation of the Absolute? By refusing to let Christianity lean on culpability, would one necessarily end up in a claim of innocence which would not integrate the contribution of analyses of limitedness and which would not come to grips with the condition of a creature which is inseparably innocent and culpable? By thinking that writing is the privileged place for the manifestation of the "ego", is one not resorting to the ontological postulate of truth as an amalgamation of word, sens, existence of man and life?<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i405284<br>
Date: 10 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): On-Cho Ng Sheldon<br>
Abstract: Textures of Time is a rich and challenging book that raises a host of important and hard questions about historical narrative, form, and style; the sociology of texts; and the core problem of ascertaining historical truth. Two that pertain to the book's main claims are of special interest to nonspecialist readers: Is register or style - "texture" - necessarily and everywhere diagnostic of "history"? Does a new kind of "historical consciousness" emerge in south India beginning in the sixteenth century, indeed as a sign of an Indian early modernity? Textures is not the first book to argue that historical discourse is constitutively marked by a peculiar style, but the claim is beset by difficulties that scholars since Barthes have detailed. Rather than textures of time - accounts of what really happened in history-what these works offer us may be only pretextures of time, textualized forms of a human experience that make claims about its degrees and types of truth through representations of various states of temporality. Instead of assessing, then, whether these works are history or something else like "myth," we might ask whether they invite us to transcend this very dichotomy, to try, that is, to make sense of historical forms of consciousness rather than to identify forms of historical consciousness. As for modernity, nothing in south Indian historiography from 1500-1800 remotely compares to the conceptual revolution of Europe. But why should we expect the newness of the early modern world to have been experienced the same way everywhere? Modernity across Asia may have shown simultaneity without symmetry. Should this asymmetry turn out to reveal continuity and not rupture, however, no need to lament the fact. There is no shame in premodernity.<br>

Author(s): Wing Nicolae<br>
Abstract: The conflict between formalist thinking and theories that view texts in their historical contexts serves as a starting point for the introduction of a cognitive view of literature. From this perspective language has full referential powers. The "referent" splits into two entities, however: things-in-themselves (in their material identity), which we cannot know, and things in their coded form, which are perceptually accessible. Readers' mnemonic potentials, a consequence of the bonding of perception and language, are adduced to show that texts originate in past interpretations of other texts and in personal experience and that consequently social forces and historical events are subsumed in the individual memory. In the cognitive light, memory becomes the ultimate metaphor, and the epistemological claim of realism regains its compelling force.<br>

Date: 1 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Wyschogrod David P.<br>
Abstract: Aristotle's distinction between phronesis, or ethical knowledge, and techne, or productive knowledge, is relevant both to Romantic and to modern discussions of the relations between aesthetic and ethical experience. Wordsworth and Coleridge try in different ways to negotiate between the two kinds of knowledge, advocating the ethical force of poetry while acknowledging its status as techne; in contrast, modern criticism tends either to accept the ubiquity of techne or to revive phronesis while undervaluing the tension between the two. Hans-Georg Gadamer and Emmanuel Levinas provide a way to link phronesis to aesthetic autonomy through the means-end unity of phronesis and the ethical claim of the other, although Gadamer overemphasizes the autonomy of the artwork and Levinas underemphasizes the ethical possibilities of the aesthetic. Wordsworth and Coleridge present the ethical encounter with the other as in tension with techne, but they also show that tension itself to be ethically significant.<br>

Issue: i225019<br>
Date: 12 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Travers Andrew<br>
Abstract: Analysis of a sequence of literary frames suggests that a heightened experience of interactional reality is also anomically constructive of the frame. In each of 16 frames, Durkheimian anomie neither destroys the frame's integrity nor renders its routine grounds unintelligible, as Goffman and Garfinkel would claim it must. Paradoxically, anomie ritually intensifies the frame. The selves in the paper's sequence of highly ritualized frames are not routine selves, however. They are 'strangers to themselves'. The analysis shows how Mead's 'I' can re-emerge from Goffman's ritual thinking - where the 'I' is collapsed into an interactionally-bound 'me' - as an original manifestation of great importance to interactants, and therefore to society as well. (Parenthetically it is also argued that selves need an element of rituality in order to be selflike and that it is interactional rituality which guarantees the evolution of social life beyond given frames, corpora, cultural repertoires, and collective representations.) The idea that interactants can be strangers to themselves is an advance on Goffman's and Garfinkel's accounts of interactional selfhood, but one that problematizes the prosecution of the interaction sociology that Goffman and Garfinkel pioneer, since strangers to themselves disappear in normal sociological appearances.<br>

Abstract: ‘The action turn’ stands over against ‘the linguistic turn’ that was a development in Western philosophy during the 20th century. Its most important characteristic is its focus on philosophy and language. Ludwig Wittgenstein’s influence is strong as the term follows from his claim that philosophical problems arise from a misunderstanding of the logic of language and his later comments on language games.

Abstract: Recently in environmental ethics some theorists have advocated narrative accounts of value, according to which the value of environmental goods is given by the role that they play in our narratives. I first sketch the basic theoretical features of a narrative accounts of value and then go on to raise some problems for such views. I claim that they require an evaluative standard in order to distinguish the valuable from the merely valued and that the project of constructing such a standard faces significant problems. I conclude by questioning whether narrative accounts of value really offer advantages over other pluralistic and context-sensitive accounts of value.<br>

Abstract: The academic study of Kabbalah has largely been limited to myth and symbol as the two viable forms of kabbalistic discourse. In this essay, I resist those limitations and explore two other possible literary forms: history and fiction. I do not mean history in any positivistic sense but closer to Steven Greenblatt's description of new historicism as cultural poetics. This suggests that literature not only reflects a historical setting but also creates that setting, constructing reality in its own image and directing it toward its desired ends. In looking at Lurianic Kabbalah as fiction, I raise the issue of the “real” and the “true” as it relates to fictive narratives more generally. This essay does not claim that the kabbalists in question did or did not intend to write cultural poetics or fiction. Rather, I use cultural poetics and fiction as possible lenses through which a nontraditional interested reader (i.e., one not invested in the literature as authoritative) can read these texts in a way that can speak to the contemporary world in which we live and think.<br>

Abstract: Such twentieth-century poems claim trans-American affiliation to canonical poems even as they rewrite them critically, just as Langston Hughes responds to Walt Whitman in “I, Too, Sing America” and Jean Toomer does in “Blue Meridian.” But Hughes's poem borrows from while resisting Whitman, in which “every atom belonging to me as good as belongs to you.” In his ambivalent homage to Whitman's poetics of recombination, Hughes insists on a remainder. Racial difference means that something is left over or left out of the full-throated equation of self and other,
         
               as in the gesture Senior and Hayes both make in their responses to Wallace Stevens.97<br>

Abstract: In an interview with Melissa Beattie-Moss, Jabbeh Wesley lamented the virtual nonexistence of significant literary figures in Liberia, writers who could be compared with those in Nigeria, Kenya, or other regions of Africa. But even those African writers understandably wrote about their own experiences, which were based on their confrontations with colonialism. Those who could be identified as her literary forebears in Liberia were mostly Americo-Liberians whose writing was a kind “settler d of literature, with American images, written in isolation of the environment and culture of Africa.” Sadly, her people, “the so-called elite, educated ones—frowned on anything African for a long time,” so in effect, she had no established literary figure to look up to (Beattie-Moss). Jabbeh Wesley has reluctantly accepted the honor of being the first truly Liberian literary figure—at least, one with an international profile.
         
               I am in no way making Jabbeh Wesley the Chinua Achebe of Liberian literature, nor does she claim to be. She acknowledges that she has benefited considerably from the many griots and oral narrators of her culture. But she is a pioneer; her four poetry collections address themes of war, love, globalization, feminism, African renaissance, diaspora identity, and much more.4<br>

Abstract: In their important volume on the history of the geography of continents cited above, Martin Lewis and Karen Wigen devote an entire chapter to the Eurocentric/Afrocentric controversy. Some new light is shed on this debate within this context. Europe, simply as a geographical designation, is already an ambiguous, if not spurious, notion. Its legitimacy is claimed through the invention of its past, and its projection of its meaning within the world is created by navigation of the Atlantic Ocean. The ideology of Europe is not put forward as a limited cultural meaning of thought, truth, or value. Rather, European cultural meanings are assumed to be the correlates of universal values and norms. It is precisely this view of Europe that is being rejected by the Afrocentric camp. In many respects, however, the Afrocentric proponents share many of the structural characteristics of their opponents in their desire to locate and specify the origin of normative human value. For the Afrocentric position, the locus of this value is the continent of Africa. As a matter of fact, the two camps often claim the same personages as members of their respective traditions.

Abstract: Is SPEP the city of God? This would be going too far. Not even the theological turn in French Phenomenology would make this claim. Dick Howard already threw in a troubling question: “diversification that perhaps gives more breadth than depth?” he asked. And there are plenty more troubling questions. SPEP is now a big operation. It has committees and subcommittees, multiple simultaneous sessions, blind review. All these developments are signs, perhaps inevitable ones, of its success, but all have familiar downsides: bureaucratization, diversification for its own sake, what Habermas would call
   Unübersichtlichkeit. This is what happens when outsiders become insiders, the antis become their own sort of establishment. You can't blame some of us for feeling nostalgic for our long-lost innocence, even though we all know—you don't have to be a philosopher of history to know this—that we can't go there. History has rendered a judgment, but Dick Howard said, “Historywilljudge.” That's one problem with history: It's always rendering judgments, but they are never final. You'd have to be at the end of history for that, and despite the claim of some philosophers, we aren't there yet. The slaughter bench of history looks very different today from the early 1960s, but it's still in some ways a slaughter bench. So how will the SPEP of the early twenty-first century look to the philosopher-historians of 2061—or is it 2062?<br>

Abstract: Another way of evoking the sense in which the person as fundamentally, if not adequately, what “I” refers to as a nonsortal reference is to consider the famous examples of teletransportation, as developed first by Derek Parfit but then marvelously elaborated on by Erich Klawonn, where through a glitch one finds oneself facing absolutely identical twins.
         
                  Initially it is a matter of facing the impossibility of distinguishing the ontological twins. Thus one might be convinced that the Leibnizian claim is false—that if we appear to be confronted with two cases of absolutely identical properties, then either we fail to single out the ultimate distinguishing property (where interchangeable places are not regarded as inherent distinguishing properties) or there is but one being there (a position to which Brentano was inclined). In short, one might well disagree that if there are two beings, there must be given distinguishing properties. But it is quite another thing to face, in the first person, one's, for example, James G. Hart's, ontological clone and have the indubitable blazing insight: “Whoever you are, and by whatever equal right you might have to call yourself James G. Hart, I am not you—and I apperceive you to be convinced that you are not me.” Here who one is, is not determined by properties or sortal determinations, which, by way of generously granting the hypothesis of the thought experiment, are identically the same, that is, have the same properties, in the two cases.31<br>

                  Faktizität und Geltung, it may lay claim to a third.”<br>

Abstract: I will borrow this idea here to illustrate how a new technology transforms in new ways our relations to the world and thus concentrate what I have outlined above. First, the cell phone may come close to being the early twenty-first century's almost universal technology. Social scientists claim that
            95 percent of the global population today has access to cell phones! Not all have cell phones; for example, in Bangladesh, “phone ladies” supplied with cell phones provided by the Grameen Bank service entire villages. But also the cell phone is a “leapfrog technology” in that it skips the long evolution of wired systems and can sprout up in remote and undeveloped territories. Maasai warriors can communicate in the bush with them. But I turn to the characteristics I have claimed for new technologies and provocatively compare these with Heidegger's hammer:
                  
            
                     
                  •
                     First, what of
                  readiness-to-hand? This part of Heidegger's still phenomenological description applies to both. In use, both the hammer and cell phone “withdraw” and become the embodied means of praxis, not its goal. Both have “assignments” and belong to complex relationships with the environment, and both reveal the worldliness of the world—but even without further description you no doubt are already aware that the size, shape, and reach of these assignments are vastly different. The hammer remains embodied bodily; the cell phone includes hermeneutic relations and alterity relations as well.
                     
                  •
                     In this latter context one can note that both the hammer and cell phone are multistable, but in vastly different ways. Classical hammers exemplified different uses through different, largely single-style designs: carpenters' hammers, cobblers' hammers, tack hammers, sledgehammers. Cell phones are deliberately multitask designed—audio phone, text cap~<br>

Article Title: Ethics and Religion in Continental Philosophy<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: At least of equal importance is Marion's notion of the saturated phenomenon:
            
                  
               35
               
                  There is nothing particularly religious about saturated phenomena. There are four kinds that are quite mundane: the historical event, the idol (work of art, especially a painting), the flesh (our experience of our own body), and the icon (the face of the other in the Levinasian sense).To the phenomenon that is most often characterized by a defect of intuition [ordinary objects of vision in which we intend more than we can see and Kant's rational ideas, for which no adequate experience can be given] … why would there not correspond the possibility of a phenomenon in which intuition would give
               more, indeed unmeasurably more, than intention ever would have intended or foreseen [e.g., Kant's aesthetic idea]? … [B]ut it is no longer a matter of the nonadequation of the (lacking) intuition that leaves a (given [metaphysical]) concept empty; it is a matter, conversely, of a failure of the (lacking) concept that leaves the (overabundantly given) intuition blind.
                        
                  36
                     
                  So far as the phenomenology of religion is concerned, the claim is simply that if a revelation or epiphany were to occur in the sense assumed by the Abrahamic monotheisms, its phenomenality would have to be of this sort, and moreover, it would be the saturated phenomenon par excellence insofar as it would involve all four types.37<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>
Date: 7 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: First of all, it might come as some surprise—not only for Janicaud but equally for Ricoeur scholars—to note that in a 2003 interview, Ricoeur mentions Deleuze as one of “the two thinkers” whom he “most admired.”
         
               There is little evidence in Ricoeur's writings that would actually support this claim, since Deleuze is hardly even mentioned by him and is never engaged in any sustained manner. Nonetheless, Ricoeur's remark does suggest that he would embrace the endeavor to bring Deleuze's work into dialogue with phenomenology, though I do not think that he would believe that such a dialogue could take place without the work of hermeneutics.21<br>

Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: For example, if one reads the polemical hyperbolic statement “It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God” (Mark 10:25, NRSV), then one hears a physical impossibility and an errant statement.
         
               Of course, there are several exegetical issues here, but in general, it will commonly be acknowledged that it is physically impossible for a camel to perform this task. Yet it is assumed by many that rich people can and do participate within the kingdom of God, in which case the claim that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God is not only an impossibility but a lie that is not intended to deceive. In the face of such a shocking or surprising incongruity, one is forced to look beyond the exaggeration for other truth(s) that might be indicated by the errancy, that is, to the idea that it is extremely difficult to enter the kingdom of God if one is driven by wealth alone.7<br>

Journal Title: Shaw<br>
Article Title: Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: shaw.34.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Einsohn Howard Ira<br>
Abstract: In the face of this chilling assessment, Shaw reached the only conclusion that made logical sense to him: life's invincibility, the core of Lilith's claim, “heralds a victory for evolution that is fully compatible with a defeat for mankind.”
         
               However distressing it may be to contemplate in the abstract, the conjunction of evolution's victory and mankind's defeat comported perfectly with his tragic consciousness. Beneath the antic pose he often presented sardonically to an all-too-credulous public, Shaw harbored the corrosive awareness that we mortals may never be able to synthesize the dualities that inescapably circumscribe the human condition—thought and deed, wisdom and power, body and spirit—in a way that both ensures the survival of the race and enhances the plight of the downtrodden. For Shaw, at his nadir, the issue was not that we lack individuals with the requisite qualities to meet developmental imperatives. We do not; the Life Force fills this need, everlastingly. Of more concern to him was the inescapable fact that gifted visionaries never seem to gain sufficient traction to alter the downward spiral of events decisively, once and for all. Either they are ignored altogether by an otherwise engaged multitude or the presiding authorities devise ever more diabolical means of neutering them or their accomplishments. Winter, spring, summer, or fall, they are always unwelcome.24
            
               As time marched on, the marriage of contraries Shaw longed to effect seemed less and less achievable, and this growing anxiety was reflected not just in his plays but in his prose writings as well. Bleakness enveloped him at every turn, with no reprieve in sight. In his considered judgment, if humankind was a hair's breadth away from dissolution, and this certainly seemed to be the case in his eyes, it is because we are our own worst enemy. If the species is irretrievably lost, Shaw concludes, we have no one to blame but ourselves. Fr~<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: The last twentieth-century utopist I will discuss is perhaps the most influential. Herbert Marcuse, a German immigrant of the Frankfurt school, wrote several books that explore utopian ideas. Although his ideas are Marxist, he draws most of his vocabulary from Freud and is considered a psychological utopian critic. He makes his claim, that capitalism causes dystopia, by using Freudian vocabulary to explain how social happiness would include more pleasure and the drive of
         erosin living, not only the fulfillment of a work ethic for its own sake. As a result, the key to Marcuse's positive utopia is the reeducation of desire: Individuals would then want a new lifestyle focusing on quality of life rather than quantity.

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Meta-Utopian Metatext:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: This opposition between the static and the dynamic—and the triumph of the latter in
         Finnegans Wake—is modeled by Sheldon Brivic in terms of Joyce's symbolic uses of gender within the novel: “The male story enacts conflict and decline, but the female one may be seen as showing discovery and development that proceed through the disintegration of the discourse of patriarchal coherence.”
               Yet one might suggest not so much that the novel is about gender difference as that it deploys gender difference to symbolize the dichotomy between the static and dynamic historical perspectives upon which it reflects. Brivic admits that his feminist reading of156
            Finnegans Wakeshould not claim to reveal the novel's “ultimate or real meaning”—and if (as he writes) the novel represents “history as progress through literary work” in a way that offers “freedom through the disintegration of stable identity,”
               then it may be that, in order to engage with that progressive idealism, such determining terminologies as157
            feminism—orUtopianism, for that matter—and all of the categorical polarizations they involve might no longer seem particularly relevant. A static Utopia has no need for Utopianists (perfect worlds do not need dreamers); and a dynamic Utopia—a world populated by such aspirants—would have no need for such deterministic, static, and outmoded categorizations. A progressive Utopia must be unfinished; it is not a state but a perpetual coming-into-state in which all of its subjects continue to dream, to hope, to aspire. This work of progress is, likeFinnegans Wake, an unendingwork in progress. It may at first seem incongruous that this Utopia of unceasing movement is also the Utopia of real, material place, but it is clear that one of the defining characteristics of material reality is that it never stays still.<br>

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: I would argue that constructing a convincing association of Utopia and architecture requires the following: social and political content; a significant level of detail in the description of what is proposed; elaboration of a positive transformation of social and political life as key to what is proposed or constructed; and, not least, a substantive—ethical and aesthetical—critique of the present informed by a critical-historical perspective. In short, a discernible utopian dimension of architecture or urbanism (no matter how partial the claim to Utopia may be) entails a sustained consideration of both
         social processandspatial closure. It is also important to underline that clarifying an understanding of architecture and Utopia is not about taste, indexing “likes” and “dislikes” relative to specific examples of each, or about relative levels of novelty or strangeness. Rather, a verifiably utopian dimension in architecture and urbanism is, in the first instance, suggested by literary Utopias (including architectural treatises), intentional communities, utopian studies, and specific works of architecture.
