  Author(s) WESTPHAL MEROLD<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal’s many insightful comparisons and contrasts between Emmanuel Levinas and Søren Kierkegaard prompt me to reconsider one aspect that continues to intrigue me—namely, Westphal’s characterization of the triadic relation found in each thinker. In “Kierkegaard and Levinas in Dialogue,” Westphal offers the following picture: “Whereas Kierkegaard would repeat Jesus’ summary of the Torah, that the first commandment is to love God and the second to love one’s neighbor as oneself (Mark 12:28–34), Levinas reverses the order. For him ethics is first, then religion, and the neighbor always stands between me and God, while for Kierkegaard religion is<br>

  Book Title: Thou Shalt Not Kill: A Political and Theological Dialogue-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sitze Adam<br>
  Abstract: In this fascinating and rare little book, a leading Italian feminist philosopher and the Archbishop of Milan face off over the contemporary meaning of the biblical commandment not to kill. The result is a series of erudite and wide-ranging arguments that move from murder and suicide to just war and drone strikes, from bioethics and biopolitics to hermeneutics and philology, from Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer to Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault, from Torah and Scripture to art and literature, from the essence of human dignity and the paradoxes of fratricide to engagements with Levinasian ethics. Less a direct debate than a disputation in the classical sense, Thou Shalt Not Kill proves to be a searching meditation on one of the unstated moral premises shared by otherwise bitterly opposed political factions. It will stimulate the mind of the novice while also reminding more advanced readers of the necessity and desirability of thinking in the present.<br>

  Abstract: In 1984, delivering a speech commemorating peace in Europe, Emmanuel Lévinas underlines how the West lacks “a sensibility in which the scandal of murder is not suppressed even when the violence is rationally necessary.”¹ If the vitalist mask of the subject holds war inevitable and even healthy, the rationalist mask holds it all the more necessary to secure peace. Intuiting that the two masks demonstrate a substantial complicity and distrusting an idea of peace that continues to be based on war, Lévinas elaborates a radical critique of violence that is based on an atypical reading of the sixth commandment—or,<br>

  Author(s) HAKER HILLE<br>
  Abstract: In her reading of Walter Benjamin’s “Critique of Violence,” Judith Butler provides a persuasive interpretation of the critical resources Benjamin mobilizes. She points out that Benjamin draws on an alternative Jewish tradition of understanding the commandment “Thou shall not kill.” In her analysis, the commandment is opposed to a principle of guilt and hence can become the basis for a critique of legal violence. Moreover, according to Butler, the commandment, as Benjamin conceives of it, constitutes the condition for a theory of responsibility that would be fundamentally concerned with the ongoing struggle with nonviolence.

  Abstract: It is less recognized than it should be that Theodor Adorno’s key noncategory of the
                  Bilderverbot, or ban on images, owes as much to overturning sigmund Freud’s argument concerning idolatry as it does to the biblical ban on images. Of course, both bounce their thoughts off the second commandment of Exod 20 (and Deut 5). Yet Freud’s interpretation runs the risk of replicating precisely what the ban seeks to overcome, for the abstraction he espies in the ban is precisely the move that reinstalls idolatry. For this reason, Adorno seeks to deploy the ban on images in a way that<br>

  Abstract: At the heart of Christian ethics is the biblical commandment to love God and to love one's neighbor as oneself. But what is the meaning of love? Scholars have wrestled with this question since the recording of the Christian gospels, and in recent decades teachers and students of Christian ethics have engaged in vigorous debates about appropriate interpretations and implications of this critical norm.<br>

  Abstract: My attempt thus far has been to craft Westphal’s intellectual narrative, and what I have found is that Westphal’s narrative is heavily theological. In fact, Westphal is so theological that I argue he is best read within this discourse, which is perhaps his proper home. The previous chapters have focused on how Westphal shapes his thinking and how it tacitly develops into a theology that appropriates philosophical reasoning to minister and guide the life of faith. Furthermore, his articulation of faith as a task of a lifetime, which compels the believing soul to continually enact the love commandment, has convinced<br>

  Abstract: This statement from Voltaire is readily cited to underline the sovereignty of the human being said to have been unleashed in the eighteenth century, when people broke free of religion and metaphysics. The human being, it is suggested, also determines the position of God and, if needed, for reasons of social control for example, may occupy His position argumentatively. Belief in God is no longer a theologically grounded, self-evident commandment; it is universally useful or, to use more modern language, ideologically fungible.<br>

Jesus responds: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.” The adaptation of this quotation appears as Jesus ends his response with the word “mind.” In the source text of Deuteronomy, Moses uses the word “might.” A couple of verses later in Matthew, Jesus quotes the Hebrew scriptures again.

The pessimistic view of the presence of ethics in the Gospel of John² does not apply to the Epistles of John.<br>

Abstract: Let us return to Hegel’s interpretation of Adam’s privilege in the book of Genesis. There, man has the power to name, to understand, and thus to dominate; but Adam exercises this privilege only upon the animals, never upon God or upon himself. Why do these two escape naming and thus escape the comprehension and, finally, the domination of man? That God would escape is conceived without any difficulty: the Creator is not easily understood, and thus named, by his creature. But why is it that man does not name himself? No interdict is brought to bear here. Nothing more than the second commandment is necessary, which forbids making “for yourself a graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above” (Exod. 20:4)—anything, therefore, that would claim to represent God through comprehension. But is man, too, “in heaven above”? Most certainly—for this is the decisive paradox—because that which is fitting for God (of whom no name, no image, and no concept can claim comprehension) is also fitting for man: man, and he alone among all the living, was created not “according to [his] kind” but “in [the] image … [and] likeness” of God (Gen. 1:24, 26). This paradox receives a precise commentary from Saint Augustine: “
         be renewed in the newness of your mind. That is not a makingaccording to kind[secundum genus], as if renewal were achieved by imitating a neighbour’s example or by living under the authority of a human superior. For you did not say ‘Let man be made according to his kind’ [secundum genus], but ‘Let us make man according to our image and likeness,’ so we may prove what your will is.”24Man remains unimaginable, because he is formed in the image of the One who admits no image whatsoever. By right, man resembles nothing, because he resembles nothing other than the One who is properly characterized by incomprehensibility, the One who David Tracy has named “the Incomprehensible‐Comprehensible God.”25Or again, if God remains incomprehensible, man, who r~<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: The JST account of Enoch’s theophany begins with God showing Enoch what will happen to the wicked among his grandson’s (Noah’s) generation. Their fate in this world and the afterlife not only causes the heavens to “weep, and shed forth their tears as the rain upon the mountains” but also moves God to weep. This mystifies Enoch, who asks, “How is it thou canst weep, seeing thou are holy, and from all eternity to all eternity?” The reply emphasizes God’s relationship to the earth’s inhabitants. Notwithstanding his “commandment, that they should love one another; and that they should choose me their Father … they are,” God explains, “without affection, and they hate their own blood.” After watching the devastation of the flood, Enoch’s attitude changes. In contrast to his initial shock that the Lord would mourn such as these, he now “wept over his brethren, and said unto the heavens, I will refuse to be comforted.” Enoch petitions God to promise that he will never again destroy the earth by flood. The JST provides: “the Lord could not withhold; and he covenanted with Enoch, and sware unto him an oath.” The promise is the familiar one, though it contains an additional element. God not only swears that “he would stay the floods,” but also that “he would call upon the children of Noah.” This additional promise echoes Smith’s characterization of Adam and Eve after their fall: separated from God but not out of the range of his voice. According to the JST, “the gospel was preached [unto Adam and Eve after their expulsion]; and a decree sent forth that it should be in the world until the end thereof; and thus it was.”
         84In the JST, human cooperation is a necessary element in the performance of this decree. In Smith’s cosmology, human communication with the divine is not only a necessary constant, but its message is that humans must assume responsibility for the execution of God’s plan for human salvation. This is more plainly evidenced by Enoch’s next request.<br>

Abstract: We must therefore expand Augustine’s political morality to subsume a wider range of political responsibilities and practices. For that project, his ideas provide a start. Indeed, as I hope to show, his ideas provide fruitful points of departure for considering the ethical dimensions of, and connections between, death, memory, and the desires that animate public culture. He reminds us that the morality of war is, in part, a morality of desire and love, and that human attachments can be rightly ordered when they stand within a network of differentiated relationships and institutional responsibilities. That fact alone ought to alert us to the importance of the affections and how they are mediated by social processes and cultural norms. For Augustine, the commandment to love is not simple and straightforward; it is structured by our social affiliations and our natural interactions. However distant Augustine’s views of citizen morality might seem, his ideas of moral formation have much to teach. And so let us consider the synergism between culture and the affections as these ideas help shape an understanding of moral formation (and deformation) in the res publica.<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Rather than simply reading Ricoeur’s work in chronological sequence to make this case, Hall aims for what he calls a “critical constructive interpretation” that will yield something like a “situated reading” of Ricoeur’s thought (4), one that will better demonstrate this thesis than Ricoeur’s own words do. Basically, the structure of the argument Hall proposes begins from what Ricoeur has to say about the idea of agency in relation to the understanding of selfhood. Hall then moves on to consider the narrative configuration of a meaningful existence that follows from this understanding. He then takes up questions that can arise regarding our practical experience and moral concerns from this perspective. It is the testimony of conscience that comes in at this latter level that brings in the theological perspective. It does so through a discussion of what Ricoeur has to say about the Golden Rule in relation to the love commandment and in relation to what Ricoeur calls a logic of superabundance, one that goes beyond any logic of equivalence. It is this idea of a possible logic of superabundance that leads in turn to a discussion of what Hall calls the economy of the gift and the poetic imperative that Hall sees in Ricoeur’s concept of a theonomy that stands over against Kant’s call for an autonomy that all too easily isolates people from one another. It is love that drives this poetic imperative, and what love calls for is something more than, not less than, justice.<br>

Article Title: Literary Unrest: Blanchot, Lévinas, and the Proximity of Judaism<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: Unlike Lévinas, Blanchot's concern for Judaism is not motivated by the practical concerns of reviving the tradition in the postwar context. He is free of the necessities of community leadership, free from any pragmatics concerning the tradition. For Blanchot, Judaism is a concept, one he has discovered through reading Lévinas along with Edmond Jabès and Franz Kafka. Its message is encapsulated in the commandment to Abraham in Genesis 12:
         Lech Lecha, “Go forth from your father's house.” Blanchot reads this commandment as a prohibition against putting down roots, not only in a particular place but also in any statement of the truth. Like Lévinas, Blanchot sees this counsel of dispersion as having fundamental importance in the post-World War II world, an importance that has little to do with the lived tradition and everything to do with developing a political position antithetical to fascism. Blanchot accepts Lévinas's depiction of Judaism and takes the idea a step further by reading Lévinas's principle of moral deracination as advocating absolute disappropriation. He writes inThe Infinite Conversation,
               
         there is a truth of exile and there is a vocation of exile; and if being Jewish is being destined to dispersion—just as it is a call to a sojourn without place, just as it ruins every fixed relation of force with
            oneindividual,onegroup, oronestate—it is because dispersion, faced with the exigency of the whole, also clears the way for a different exigency and finally forbids the temptation of Unity-Identity.24<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: Yet, although they maintain that the letter of the Word lacks the performative power to conjure devils, the reformers nonetheless argue that biblical texts, as well as signs made sacred by scriptural authorization, do have spiritual efficacy when deployed properly by preachers. Under the right conditions, such signs can produce or strengthen faith and prepare the believer to receive God's grace, which otherwise might run off, as it were, like rainwater on rocky ground. For the reformers, the Eucharist exemplifies the spiritual instrumentality of the letter. “Though it be a thing above [its] common and natural use,” Perkins explains, eucharistic bread, as an efficacious sign, has “the power and property…to seal and signify unto every believing receiver the body of Christ, [for] thereupon we have warrant from Christ's own commandment, ordinance, and example to use it” (
      Discourse of the Damned, 137–38). Such a spiritual impression is not produced automatically, however, but according to the inward attitude and intent of those who participate in the ritual (notex opere operato, that is, butex opere operantis). Perkins elaborates: “There is not any such force or efficacy of making us holy inherent or tied unto the external figures”; rather, all such efficacy is “an inseparable companion of true faith and repentance, and of such as turn unto the Lord.”13For Perkins, those who “turn unto the Lord” do so by using the Eucharist as a figure for interpretation, or an instrument of intellectual meditation that increases repentance and faith. The meditation on the spiritual significance of the sacrament is a special means of eschewing the materiality of the letter and dedicating the inward self to God, a dedication that in turn, the reformers argue, readies the believer to feel and know God's saving mercy.<br>

Abstract: Rosenzweig e Levinas pensano la Rivelazione di Dio nella storia richiamandosi su diversi aspetti, anche se con sottolineature specifiche. Per la tradizione ebraica il problema di Dio e della possibilità della sua rivelazione è di sapere come Egli agisca nei confronti dell'uomo. Per Rosenzweig, il riferimento alla vita vissuta apre la possibilità di un pensiero nuovo, dove il tempo diventa l'altro del soggetto. Allo stesso modo, per Levinas il soggetto e il suo potere richiamano, nell'incontro con l'altro, ad un Altro. Entrambi gli autori mettono quindi in risalto la centralità della chiamata dell'uomo all'obbedienza. Per Rosenzweig però, la Rivelazione di Dio è legata al comandamento dell'amore del prossimo, che è legato all'amore di Dio. Per Levinas invece, il rapporto con Dio si riduce al suo aver donato la legge agli uomini. Rosenzweig and Levinas reflect on the revelation of God in history drawing on different aspects of the question and offering different emphases. In both of these authors we recognize how it is central to Jewish tradition to reflect on the problem of God and on the possibility of his revelation by reflecting on the question of just how it is that he acts towards man. For Rosenzweig, a reference to life as lived opens the possibility of a new way of thinking where time becomes the 'other' that confronts the subject. Similarly, for Levinas the ability that the subject has to recall an encounter with the 'other' enables an openness to an encounter with the 'Other'. In each of these authors we witness a stress on man's call to obedience. However, for Rosenzweig, the revelation of God is linked to the commandment of love of one's neighbor, which is tied to God's love for us; for Levinas the relationship with God is reduced to his having given the law to men.<br>

Abstract: This article reviews Paul Ricœur's account of the dialectical opposition between justice and love. First, I explore the dissonances between the just and the good in the practice of justice. Secondly, a review of the different interpretations of the Biblical Golden Rule and the commandment of love is presented, considering how the creative tension between them and the supraethical dimensions of creation, revelation, and redemption revise and correct justice. Finally, I present a critique of this dialectical process while reconsidering — through several Levinasian propositions — the very conception of justice.<br>

Abstract: The five main arguments that Freud employs against the love commandment in "Civilization and Its Discontents" are examined in light of the psychological and ethical doctrines they presuppose. Freud's theory of narcissism is explored for its implications regarding psychological egosim, altruism, mutuality, universal love, and equality. A normative response to Freud's critique of the love commandment is sketched.<br>
