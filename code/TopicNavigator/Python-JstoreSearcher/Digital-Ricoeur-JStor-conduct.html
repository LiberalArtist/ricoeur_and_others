  Abstract: In his 1915 Flag Day speech, President Wilson argued that the flag was an emblem of the nation’s possibilities. That token reminded citizens that “national life” was created not by abstract ideals, but by the “actual daily endeavors of a great people to do the tasks of the day and live up to the ideals of honesty and righteousness and just conduct.”¹ His words tied behavior to national ideals—an association that heralded the actions of “sober, quiet” citizens, not “swashbuckler[s].”² His goal was to honor the quotidian nature of citizenship, those who did not attract attention to their patriotism<br>

  Abstract: The conduct of international relations has always involved skillful use of persuasive discourse. Relations between states might depend on factors such as military capability and natural resources, but the decisions made about the conduct of peace and war are also a result of the successes, failures, habits, and nuances of persuasive appeal among elites and publics alike. For the most part, however, academic research in international relations has not focused on the forms and effects of conversations, speeches, debates, narratives, or discourses in political practice. This systematic inattention to the role of words in foreign affairs is the result of<br>

More important, it is to “study . . . the structures that govern the instances of particular manifestations of the essence of that phenomenon. Phenomenology is the systematic attempt to uncover and describe the structures, the internal meaning structures of lived experience” (van Manen 1990, 10).

  Abstract: The discipline of practical theology is one that appears to be in constant redefinition in recent times, although there might at last be some consensus emerging. It was once regarded as the crown of theological study, placed toward the end of theological education for the ordained ministry. At this point in the process all the necessary “tips and hints” were added under the rubric

  Author(s) Segal Robert A.<br>
  Abstract: One of the most notorious aspects of ancient Greek myth was its frequent depiction of the gods as engaging in conduct that is morally problematic. The scandalous manner in which various myths portrayed the gods was doubtless one of the factors that made them popular in many social circles, but these same immoral depictions raised a number of serious intellectual and ethical questions that were debated at length throughout antiquity. The fundamental question was whether these common depictions of the gods were true. If so, the gods were often exemplars of vice rather than of virtue, and human morality was<br>

  Author(s) Peters Ted<br>
  Abstract: Systematic theology explicates the content of Christian belief, often by expanding the trinitarian structure found in the Apostles’ and Nicene Creeds. This content is normally termed
                     doctrine. The doctrinal content sits in the center, usually preceded by a section onmethodologyand followed by a discussion ofethics. The section on methodology consists of a prolegomenon that is occasionally called “foundations” or “fundamental theology.” The discussion of ethics, which sometimes appears in a work separate from the systematic theology itself, attempts to discern what conduct should flow from doctrinal belief.<br>

Images of mass annihilation, of the dead and dying that the term evokes are especially troubling, since genocidal killing, now endemic to the world of postmodernity, is envisioned as a slaughter of innocents.

  Abstract: In this book I conduct an investigation of important religious, theological, and psychoanalytic concepts, primarily through a reading of sublimation. Sublimation is a privileged term that is closely connected with the notion of the sublime, a Kantian term that also has psychoanalytic and theological connotations. Investigating sublimation and the sublime as important terms for theological discourse brings together psychoanalytic theory from Freud to Lacan, Kristeva, and Žižek along with more conventional philosophical discourses, including contemporary continental philosophy. To orient ourselves toward considering the significance of psychoanalysis for thinking about religious and theological topics, I will begin with a concrete example<br>

Most of those puzzles have to do with the problems of the justification of beliefs, putting philosophy in an auxiliary relationship to the project of knowledge.

Axinn considers these basic ethical questions within the context of the laws of warfare: Should a good soldier ever disobey a direct military order? Are there restrictions on how we fight a war? What is meant by "military honor," and does it really affect the contemporary soldier? Is human dignity possible under battlefield conditions?<br>

  Book Title: Mothers and meaning on the early modern English stage-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dunworth Felicity<br>
  Abstract: "Mothers and meaning on the early modern English stage" is a study of the dramatised mother figure in English drama from the mid-sixteenth to the early seventeenth centuries. It explores a range of genres: moralities, histories, romantic comedies, city comedies, domestic tragedies, high tragedies, romances and melodrama and includes close readings of plays by such diverse dramatists as Udall, Bale, Phillip, Legge, Kyd, Marlowe, Peele, Shakespeare, Middleton, Dekker and Webster. The study is enriched by reference to religious, political and literary discourses of the period, from Reformation and counter-Reformation polemic to midwifery manuals and Mother’s Legacies, the political rhetoric of Mary I, Elizabeth I and James VI, reported gallows confessions of mother convicts and Puritan conduct books. It thus offers scholars of literature, drama, art and history a unique opportunity to consider the literary, visual and rhetorical representation of motherhood in the context of a discussion of familiar and less familiar dramatic texts.<br>

Such issues can be of consequence to individuals, communities, states, transnational organizations, or any combination thereof. What makes them global is their sphere of reference and resonance. Do they register on scales of import or signifi-cance and consequence that require interpretation within a global as opposed to a national, transnational, regional, or local frame?<br>

  Book Title: The Fate of Saul's Progeny in the Reign of David-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Longman Tremper<br>
  Abstract: Cephas Tushima provides a thorough analysis of the fate of Saul's heirs, focussing on whether their tragedies were due to continuing divine retribution, coincidence, or Davidic orchestration. He concludes that David was unjust and calculating in his dealings with the Saulides and, like other Near Eastern usurpers, perpetrated heinous injustices against the vanquished house of Saul. Traditionally readers saw Saul as evil and David as a hero; but more recently scholars have written about Saul as a tragic character and David as a villain, turning the book of Samuel into deeply contested interpretive territory. Tushima provides analysis of the critical literature surrounding this contentious issue and contributes his own study that will prove important to the continuing debate. He assesses David's character by analysing how he treats the surviving children of his predecessor, drawing upon the provisions for justice in the covenant community in the book of Deuteronomy. He demonstrates a connection between Samuel and the Torah through themes and motifs, and develops theological conclusions from them on such issues as the impact of human conduct on the environment, marriage, monarchy and Zion theology.<br>

  Book Title: Metaphor, Morality, and the Spirit in Romans 8-1–17<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Robinson William E. W.<br>
  Abstract: In this innovative book, William E. W. Robinson takes the reader on a journey through Romans 8:1-17 using Conceptual Metaphor Theory and Conceptual Integration Theory. Robinson delineates the underlying cognitive metaphors, their structure, their function, what they mean, and how Paul's audiences then and now are able to comprehend their meaning. He examines each metaphor in the light of relevant aspects of the Greco-Roman world and Paul's Jewish background. Robinson contends that Paul portrays the Spirit as the principal agent in the religious-ethical life of believers. At the same time, his analysis demonstrates that the conceptual metaphors in Romans 8:1-17 convey the integral role of believers in ethical conduct. In the process, he addresses thorny theological issues such as whether Spirit and flesh signal an internal battle within believers or two conflicting ways of life. Finally, Robinson shows how this study is relevant to related Pauline passages and challenges scholars to incorporate these methods into their own investigation of biblical texts.<br>

I was approached by one of my students to see if I could help set up and conduct a project without incurring high financial cost, and so the study was initiated within the framework of a university training programme in qualitative research².

  Author(s) Howard Rebecca Moore<br>
  Abstract: Many researchers in writing studies resist quantitative research because they feel unprepared in statistical methods or lack the time required to learn and then conduct such research. This worry is hardly new, though. It has been repeatedly articulated by those struggling to develop research methods since the earliest days of our national conferences and journals (see Serviss, introduction to this collection). Members of our discipline, particularly WPAs, often employ qualitative or quantitative research, or a combination of the two, in response to local institutional need, but when those local questions are answered, they move on to the next issue.

  Abstract: A new language, referred to for the purposes of this paper as the information systems business language or ISBL, is being born in the world of business.

Its primary source language is English but it incorporates information systems (IS) concepts, definitions, symbols and gestures and is therefore not a subset of English.

  Abstract: Somewhere in the middle of his life, John Dewey penned a short tract titled “A Common Faith” in which he distinguished between organized “religion” and religiosity or a “religious” disposition. Whereas the former denotes a formal institution wedded to official doctrines and rituals, the latter involves practical conduct, an ethically and perhaps spiritually informed manner of leading one’s life.¹ Dewey does not reject religion per se but rather its tendency to sideline lived experience or to privilege orthodoxy over “orthopraxis.” Despite changed circumstances, his tract on the whole has stood the test of time.

  Book Title: In Search of the Good Life-A Pedogogy for Troubled Times<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): DALLMAYR FRED<br>
  Abstract: The great German novelist Thomas Mann implored readers to resist the persistent and growing militarism of the mid-twentieth century. To whom should we turn for guidance during this current era of global violence, political corruption, economic inequality, and environmental degradation? For more than two millennia, the world's great thinkers have held that the ethically "good life" is the highest purpose of human existence. Renowned political philosopher Fred Dallmayr traces the development of this notion, finding surprising connections among Aristotelian ethics, Abrahamic and Eastern religious traditions, German idealism, and postindustrial social criticism. In Search of the Good Life does not offer a blueprint but rather invites readers on a cross-cultural quest. Along the way, the author discusses the teachings of Aristotle, Confucius, Nicolaus of Cusa, Leibniz, and Schiller, in addition invoking more recent writings of Gadamer and Ricoeur, as guideposts and sources of hope during our troubled times. Among contemporary themes Dallmayr discusses are the role of the classics in education, proper and improper ways of spreading democracy globally, the possibility of transnational citizenship, the problem of politicized evil, and the role of religion in our predominantly secular culture. Dallmayr restores the notion of the good life as a hallmark of personal conduct, civic virtue, and political engagement, and as the road map to enduring peace. In Search of the Good Life seeks to arouse complacent and dispirited citizens, guiding them out of the distractions of shallow amusements and perilous resentments in the direction of mutual learning and civic pedagogy -- a direction that will enable them to impose accountability on political leaders who stray from fundamental ethical standards.<br>

  Abstract: A central theme guiding this volume is that politics is marked by everyday forms of innovation, what Gerald Berk and Dennis Galvan refer to as creative syncretism.¹ Focusing on this creativity, they argue, offers key insights into the nature and conduct of politics. What at first may appear to be fixed and rigid structures, such as rules and roles, interests and institutions, are in fact multiple and malleable elements of political life. This diversity allows actors to combine and recombine elements in pursuit of their political goals. The payoff from such an analytical move is twofold. First, attention to the<br>

  Book Title: Doing Justice to Mercy-Religion, Law, and Criminal Justice<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): Jung Kevin<br>
  Abstract: It is often assumed that the law and religion address different spheres of human life. Religion and ethics articulate complex systems of moral reasoning that concern norms, deliberation of ends, cultivation of disposition, and transformation of moral agency. Law, in contrast, seeks to govern human conduct through procedural justice, rights, and public good. Doing Justice to Mercy challenges this assumption by presenting the reader with an urgent conversation between the law and religion that yields a constructive approach, both theoretically and practically, to the complex role of mercy in our legal process.<br>

Moral discourse concerns itself with the appropriateness of conduct and action relative to situations. Rather than prevent changes in conduct and character, morality (at least in its cinematic forms) aims to control their flow and regulate their transformation (see Deleuze 1992 on control). The extent and effectiveness of these efforts can be recognized in the regularities of movement they produce. Ethics also involves movement and change, but it is concerned<br>

In circumstances in which historical agents—both groups and individuals—conduct themselves in what seems to observers and commentators to be a rational manner, the contribution of anxiety and fantasy to their conduct is usually taken to be negligible. Only when rational explanations are no longer considered sufficient will affects such as anxiety or unconscious fantasies play a major role in an historical analysis.<br>

Many investigations center on the relationship between levels of deprivation and ethno-racial composition as well as how this relationship shapes perceptions and patterns of disorder in given inner-city areas. The state possesses the right not only to manage immigration into its territories but also to define what is “disorderly” and therefore “inappropriate” conduct.

One way is to hire anthropologists and user experience researchers to conduct what is called user-centered design. This enables firms to better understand and anticipate the ways consumers might appropriate their products. Although fully predicting those uses is impossible, the premise of user-centered design<br>

  Abstract: Early on I was helped in my methodological decision making by the conventions of qualitative sociology. Some very general tools for working can be taken for granted. For example, the qualitative sociologist typically uses nonprobability sampling. If the researcher intends to conduct interviews, the interview format tends to be open-ended. The analysis usually emphasizes the perspectives of those whom one is studying, but also incorporates one’s own perspectives into analysis and documentation, the latter being the reflexive position described in chapter 3.<br>

  Author(s) Lydon Mary<br>
  Abstract: Initially it may seem strange to suggest that dreams contain ethical standards, as they often stage violence, murder, and perverse situations. To move beyond this apparent contradiction it is necessary to make the distinction between ethics and morals. Samurai warriors, gangsters, and politicians all possess ethical ideals dictating their codes of conduct. Both the gangster and the Samurai have codes of conduct based on the ethical standards of the groups with which these figures are affiliated. (In the case of politicians, this affirmation is less certain.) For example, a Samurai who chooses to commit

  Abstract: Fiction lies at the intersection of two fundamental modes of thinking. One is narrative, the set of cognitive operations that organizes and explains human agency and experience. Fiction does not necessarily fulfill all the conditions of narrativity that I have spelled out in chapter 1, but it must create a world by means of singular existential propositions, and it must offer, to the very least, an embryonic story.¹ The other mode of thinking is what we may variously call “off-line thinking,” “virtual thinking,” or “non factual thinking”: the ability to detach thought from what exists and to conduct mental experiments<br>

  Abstract: As the title suggests, something has changed in the relation between religion and politics as the twentieth century passed into the next. What precisely has changed is the subject discussed in this chapter. Is the demand emerging within Western democratic societies for a more conspicuous and visible “public role” to be played by religious faith, or at least for deprivatization of religious affiliation and conduct, justified and legitimate? What are the implications of acknowledging this transformation of our public space for our understanding of the nexus of religion, modern society, and politics?<br>

As soon as I arrived in Puerto Rico in the summer of 1995 to conduct an exploratory research on the circulation of spiritual practices between the island and the U.S. mainland, I realized that describing one’s dreams and asking others to interpret them is a common practice, even among quasi-strangers, as I was for many.

Abstract: For the two largest and most influential sections of eighteenth‐century Dissent, the Presbyterians and the Independents, the histories produced by Calamy and Neal remained founding texts throughout the eighteenth century and a key component of Dissenting culture. To make the work more accessible, Calamy’s bulky
      AbridgementandContinuationwere combined and condensed by another Dissenting minister, Samuel Palmer, and published in 1775 asThe Nonconformist’s Memorial.61“The Protestant Dissenters, of all denominations, have ever been wont to revere their memories,” Palmer said, “as the fathers of their interest, and the worthy pattern of their conduct.”62Over a thousand subscribers were listed in the first edition, including many of the leading ministers of rational Dissent. It was reissued in 1777 and 1778, and a new edition was published in 1802. There was also a continuing demand for Neal’sHistory of the Puritans. It was published in a new two‐volume edition in 1754, and a reissue of the first four‐volume edition appeared in Dublin in the following year. A further edition, edited by Joshua Toulmin with much additional material, was published in five volumes between 1793 and 1797.<br>

Abstract: This is where theories of feminist agency typically run into trouble, and Meyers’s view, despite its grounding in experience, is no exception. She argues that “what is important for women’s self‐determination is that, whether they choose to become mothers or not, they find discursive means to symbolize their particular relations to motherhood and through these self‐figurations resist their homogenization in matrigynist ideology” (54). Women are to consider “what it would be like to inhabit a proposed figuration by constructing scenarios in which the figuration guides their conduct and by viscerally imagining themselves acting out those scenarios” (55). She makes similar claims about the other cultural images she explores, and she always insists that such “discursive innovation is not by itself enough” (55). The problem arises not over the apparent similarity between these acts of imagination and the gender performativity Meyers rejects but over what else is needed.<br>

Abstract: To conduct the research, I first identified a teacher at Eternal Grace who was herself a member of the school’s faith community.
         5With the help of two project assistants,6I then observed and tape‐recorded the entirety of her 3‐month‐long Holocaust unit, interviewing her before and after the unit and following the reactions of a group of five students throughout. The students were selected for their adherence to the school’s faith—in Alan Peshkin’s (1986) terminology they were “believers” rather than “scorners”—and each was interviewed individually. The data sources included transcribed class sessions, interviews, collected curricular materials, written field notes, and copies of all student work. Using techniques from grounded theory (Strauss and Corbin1990), the transcriptions were coded for emergent categories of meaning. From them we rendered a portrait (Lawrence‐Lightfoot and Davis1997) of the religious master narratives at play and an interpretation of how they contributed to students’ understandings of the Holocaust (Schweber and Irwin2003).<br>

Abstract: It is important to recognize that national time and the time of capital are different, even though the distinction is rarely acknowledged in historical practice. National time, with a punctual calendar of commemorative days, holidays, and so forth, is externalized in the conduct of linear time and moves inexorably to the end of each year to be repeated endlessly every new year (in Japan there is still strict adherence to the imperatives of the imperial year). But the time of capital is more complex; it presents a smooth, unbroken surface that resembles national time, yet it also works to unify immense temporal irregularities—uneven time—in the sphere of production, circulation, and distribution—thus totalizing the various temporal processes resulting from the division of labor. If national time abstracts experience into a “single spatial consciousness,” as Hyun Ok Park proposes, providing a necessary homogenous and “transhistorical” “container,” housing the diachronic temporal processes of capital, capitalist time situates the global at the level of the everyday and local, unsettling and segregating it into heterogeneous units (Hyun Ok Park,

Abstract: The reason why some sort—perhaps a new,
         softsort—of transcendence of physical space and physiological function may be of relevance nowadays is that neuroscience does not explain human volition in terms of individual perfectibility but rather in terms of genetic endowment and epigenetic rules. It does not tell us what we should want but rather what the genetically and culturally acquired norms clustered in our brain will make us want. It therefore reduces individual choice to a matter of “selective advantage.” Jean‐Pierre Changeux, a pioneer of neuroscience, argues, for instance, that by being coded in the neural networks of individuals, certain “instructions for socially appropriate behavior” prevent them from engaging in antisocial conduct.6<br>

Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Just‐war morality calls forth the virtue of self‐restraint in that it requires citizens, policy makers, and military personnel to situate the use of force within a wider set of moral (and global) goods. The practice of war is not an intrinsic good but should be ordered to the ends of peace and justice in the international arena. As ordained to such ends, war should have peace and justice as goods that are ingredient within its pursuits. For these reasons, just‐war tenets impose a kind of asceticism on public officials, combatants, and ordinary citizens. Self‐restraint is explicitly required by the
         ad bellumcriterion of last resort and thein bellolimits on the conduct of war, and it is implied by the more general fact that war must be pursued in the light of moral ends. That latter idea requires citizens to situate their patriotic allegiances within a wider framework of moral purposes. Patriotic statements about the need to defend one’s homeland, for example, must be chastened by reasonable appeals to moral ends that should inform our conduct and character.68The habits of patriotism and allegiance—important to political motivation, civic identity, and public action—must be disciplined by the attention to a nation’s wider aims, relationships, and responsibilities in the global common good. Just‐war morality thus involves a spiritual exercise, demanding politicians, military planners, and citizens to organize their attitudes and practices according to the demands of fairness—including fairness to Others whose interests may not be one’s own.<br>

Abstract: This multidimensional idea of knowledge bears its fruit in a reconstruction of theological ethics. In very different ways the religions provide guidance for human living, not simply with reference to a center but by answering a range of questions as well as the complex interactions among these questions. The questions demarcate a “space” or environment of human existence determined by the problem of how one ought to live, say, as a Protestant Christian or a Reformed American Jew, a Shiite Muslim or a Tibetan Buddhist. “Morality” is a name for the placement and right conduct of human existence, an outlook and way of life marked by sensibilities and orientations. “Ethics” is the critical, comparative, and constructive thinking about this moral space by answering the question, how should one live a good life? and the various subquestions that problem poses. The validity of an ethics is determined by the scope and intensity of its ability to intersect with other outlooks and disciplines and redeem the pertinence of its claims. An ethics that can intersect with and engage a wider scope of outlooks and positions will attain relatively greater validity than rival options for guiding human lives. That criterion is, actually, what dictated the shape of this lecture. It is why I probed the structure of current lived reality and engaged various thinkers around the question of the formation of responsible existence.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: Faustus's investment in embodiment is less social, though, than epistemological: he implicitly denies the assumption that signification should dematerialize consciousness, and that “real” meaning should be fundamentally allegorical. Indeed, Faustus eschews allegorical interpretation. He never reads past the letter, as it were, to search for spirit; he never seeks what recedes beyond the textual mark as if it were the invisible, impalpable, transcendent truth. To read in that way is to perform faith. The old man, for instance, describes faith as the first step on an unfolding journey to salvation, calling it “the way of life / By which sweet path thou may'st attain the goal / That shall conduct thee to celestial rest” (5.1.37–39). The striking catachresis of the “goal” that becomes the boatman or the angel that will “conduct” the believer to “celestial rest”—not to mention the pun that makes “way of life” at once a method and a path with duration—emphasizes the strange requirement that faith places on the believer to seek in thought what is not only absent but also deferred beyond any end that he can conceive for himself. Faustus refuses this injunction to read the Word and the world allegorically, to perform faith by consuming representation like a Protestant.<br>

Author(s): Regan Ethna<br>
Abstract: Regan’s chief impetus for writing the book is the assumption that rights talk is anathema to theology. She addresses this assumption from several distinct perspectives: via definition, description, theological construction, and critical analysis. As a matter of defining human rights, Regan aims to show that one of the bases for the perceived opposition between theology and human rights lies in an overly narrow conception of the nature and scope of human rights discourse. Given her experiences working with street children in Trinidad, Regan rejects the view that human rights discourse merely defines human beings as atomistic, autonomous rights-bearers with few ethical imperatives. To correct the perception that human rights and theology are mutual antagonists, she articulates a definition of human rights as a “dialectical boundary discourse,” by which she means that human rights ought to be understood as a rich discourse that operates within a specified sphere. As a discourse, human rights consist in more than the lowest limits of ethical conduct. They express an intrinsic conviction that humans ought to flourish and that certain conditions can destroy, distort, or thwart the potential for human flourishing. Human rights discourse does not itself define human flourishing or delineate the conditions of human flourishing, but rather adopts a
      via negativa, drawing on examples from human experience to articulate conditions that prevent, disrupt, or damage capacities to flourish. In this way, human rights discourse adopts a role that Regan describes as “protective marginality,” not serving as ends in themselves but located at the margins of ethics, carving out a space within which ethical life may be possible, leaving the task of fuller development of ethics within this sphere to other discourses. By defining human rights as a dialectical boundary discourse of protective marginality, Regan shows that there is no necessary conflict between theological ethics and theo~<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 671448<br>
Date: 10 01, 2013<br>
Author(s): Feder Yitzhaq<br>
Abstract: It should be stressed, however, that the biblical treatment of pollution in all of its heterogeneity captures a richness of embodied experience which cannot be adequately represented in a schematic chart. In particular, it is not possible to determine a priority between the experiential schema and the emotion evoked by it. As noted above, emotional response is an inherent part of the perception of contagion.
      
               Furthermore, some sources of pollution do not conform so neatly to this analytic framework. In particular, though menstrual and puerperal blood are normal discharges, they had implications even outside the sacral sphere, namely in the strict ban on sexual relations.100
            
               Since sex with a menstruant involves the violation of the acceptable norms of conduct, being listed together with abominable sexual acts such as bestiality and incest, and entails divine punishment (Leviticus 18:19, 20:18), it fits the stain-of-transgression model in this regard. The severe ramifications entailed in the case of sex with a menstruant apparently stems from the extreme repulsion felt towards this behavior.101
            
               But rather than contradicting the existence of distinct types suggested above, this case should serve as a reminder that the various types of pollution are ultimately derived from attitudes towards the body in all of its multifarious possibilities—not from a rigid disembodied logic.102<br>

Abstract: Yet the “Tallensi recognize the existence of evil. They experience and give vent to envy, greed, hate, and malice” (
         1987:212). As it turns out, for Tallensi, the locus of evil, and certainly of misfortune, is Destiny. It is “thought of as a component of a person’s personhood” that is effective from birth, but unlike the Azande hereditary witchcraft substance it is “chosen” by a person prenatally (149). Evil predestiny accounts for a condition or conduct counter to customary norms and is “apt to be adduced where there is a difficult or impossible moral dilemma to be resolved” (153), precisely where other African societies might invoke matrilineal witchcraft (Ashanti), ancestral ghosts (Ndembu), lineage sorcery (Zulu), or spirit attack (Hausa). The Tallensi thus serve as a prime example of the limitations of a study of witchcraft as an approach to evil, precisely by showing not its absence but how it reappears in a different cultural pattern that is equally critical to understanding morality.<br>

Abstract: Architectural periodicals were major promoters of this new standard of architectural drawing production. The first American architectural magazines emerged in the late 1870s.
         
               Few working drawings, however, were reproduced in the journals until the very late 1890s, when they began to appear in profusion.62
            The Brickbuilder,
            Architectural Review(Boston), and (two decades later)Pencil Pointsplayed an especially significant role in disseminating the new model of practice.
               Magazines also gave unprecedented attention to other aspects of the conduct of day-to-day architectural activities—from the size of drawing sheets to the spatial organization of architects' offices.63
            
               The new focus on production reflected profound changes in architectural professional ideology.64
            
               The rigor of architectural professionalism was now judged by the architect's adherence to a standard design sequence, from the first ideas to a full set of working drawings, and eventually, to the built structure. This sequence was quite strictly prescribed.65<br>

Abstract: Paul Eakin, who reasons that although in writing the self,
in constructing its fictions, autobiographers come "to understand the self they sought to
express as necessarily a product of self-invention," language is a powerful agent whose
capacity "to fashion selfhood is not only successful but life-sustaining, necessary to the
conduct of human life as we know it" (190-91)

Abstract: The Phenomenology says that every knowledge is a perspective knowledge, because every knowledge is situated in a time and in a space. The human's embodiment discloses a perspective overview on the world. The paper claims the aim to analyze how the sexual and gender dimensions, which are incarnated in a determinate body, are present in the qualitative research, specifically into the ethnographic observation. First for all, we hypothesize that the gender is a border for the access into a field and not in other, so to be man or woman is not neutral for the knowledge of a specific social context. Moreover, the performative dimension of the gender, which shows the norms that pre-exist and that conduct the role's interaction (i.e. the role's gendered content and the role's gendered language) is another tie in the participant observation. The awareness that all the knowledge is gendered, requires to the fieldworker to play a double competence (ability). The researcher must use the self reflexivity to point out his gender identity and his background on this theme: he must point out his background frame relatively to the gender, his gender behaviour's expectations in the interaction, and his correlated opinions. The researcher, moreover, must know that exist a cultural mainstream about the gender, but that the concrete gender playing is based on the interaction in a concrete frame. So, we have a lot of concrete ways in which the gender is embodied. The researcher on the field, so, must enter in a knowledge's circulation in which must point attention to: the epistemic interdependence, i.e. the knowledge borns in the symbolic interaction between the researcher and the subject; the gendered nature of the communicative interaction between the researcher and the subject; the negotiable nature of the concrete managing of the gendered role in the interaction.<br>

Abstract: Finke, p. 41: "Mystics took disciplines designed to regulate and subject the body and turned
them into what Michael [sic] Foucault has called 'technologies of the self,' methods of
consolidating spiritual power and authority, perhaps the only ones avalaible to women. Foucault
argues that individuals often effect by their own means a certain number of operations on their
bodies, souls, thoughts, and conduct-all to transform themselves and to attain a certain state of
perfection, happiness, purity, and supernatural power. Although he is describing the medieval
Catholic discipline of confession, he might just as well be describing the lives of many medieval
mystics. Michel de Certeau takes Foucault's argument about technologies of the self even further,
and argues that these mechanisms, which he calls "poaching," enable those subjected to
disciplinary technologies to manipulate and evade them, or even shape them to their own ends, by
seeming to conform to them. To understand how self-torture could become a technology of the
self, a means of empowerment we must understand the place of torture in medieval society."<br>

Publisher: OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS<br>
Issue: i24232498<br>
Date: 7 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Frobert Ludovic<br>
Abstract: It is the purpose of this paper to present a reassessment of the works of the first nineteenth century French Utopian Socialists. It is well known that their contributions have been highly criticised, from both the economic and social point of view and the political or ethical one. Recent commentators, mostly historians and philosophers, have, however, underlined the realistic ambition and the reformist spirit of those approaches. This paper aims to develop this perspective. Indeed, it is my intention to defend the idea that the realism of utopia can be even better characterised by economists: the analyses of Leroux, Enfantin, Chevalier, Buchez or Considérant can be interpreted in terms of development. We study more specifically the initial flowering between 1830 and 1835 of the writings of the Saint-Simonians (Enfantin, Chevalier, Pereire), the works of the dissidents (Buchez, Leroux) and those of the main supporters of Fourier (Considerant, Transon, Lechevalier). We will conduct our survey proceeding from the notion of 'vision' proposed recently by Robert Heilbroner. We then examine whether these socialist pioneers really worked in order to elaborate a 'vision' in terms of 'development'.<br>

Abstract: Les années 1960 sont à part. Elles représentent pour les uns une rupture, pour les autres un tournant ou une cassure, mais peu importe le mot utilisé: le constat est unanime. Cette décennie marque pourtant une étape passée un peu inaperçue dans l'histoire du protestantisme français faute d'une étude d'ensemble. Ouverture œcuménique, contestations internes, crise des mouvements de jeunesse et crise théologique, mutations des comportements et des mœurs, émergence de nouvelles structures, montée en puissance du protestantisme évangélique... Comment interpréter cette décennie de révolutions pour le protestantisme : enrichissement ou éclatement? The 1960s stand apart. Some see them as a rupture, others as a turning point or a break: whatever the word used, the verdict is unanimous. Yet, for lack of an overall study, this decade is a somewhat neglected stage in the history of French Protestantism. Ecumenical progress, internal conflicts, crises in youth movements, theological crisis, changes in behaviour and conduct, emergent new structures, the rising influence of evangelical Protestantism... How should this decade of revolutions for Protestantism be interpreted: enrichment or fragmentation? Die sechziger Jahre stehen für sich. Die einen deuten sie als Bruch, die anderen als Wende oder Einschnitt, aber es kommt auf das benutzte Wort nicht an: die Feststellung ist einstimmig. Dabei markiert dieses Jahrzehnt ein Stadium in der Geschichte des französischen Protestantismus, das mangels einer Gesamtuntersuchung fast unbemerkt blieb. Ökumenische Öffnung,interne Streitigkeiten, Krise der Bewegungen innerhalb der Jugend und theologische Krise, Veränderungen der Sitten und Verhaltensweisen, Erscheinen neuer Strukturen, starkes Wachstum des Evangelikalismus... Wie ist dieses Jahrzehnt der Umwälzungen und Umbrüche im Protestantismus zu deuten, als Bereicherung oder als Auseinanderbrechen?<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the conduct and evaluation of interpretive research in information systems. While the conventions for evaluating information systems case studies conducted according to the natural science model of social science are now widely accepted, this is not the case for interpretive field studies. A set of principles for the conduct and evaluation of interpretive field research in information systems is proposed, along with their philosophical rationale. The usefulness of the principles is illustrated by evaluating three published interpretive field studies drawn from the IS research literature. The intention of the paper is to further reflection and debate on the important subject of grounding interpretive research methodology.<br>

Abstract: The myth of an economy where nobody could have a predominant position, has lost its credibility. The presentiment of a high risk of social explosion makes companies undertake tentative moral legitimation. Thus, a new paradigm develops according to which the firm has to care for the satisfaction of public interest if "it wants to try to win forgiveness" for misbehavior towards the decorum rules of the atomicity of competition. Thus, there is a wave of "business ethics industry" building up. However, the stock exchange performances considered as ethical, are not different from others! The market does not seem to be able to say why it might be interesting to invest in stock considered as ethical. Moreover, opinion polls reveal a very significant discrepancy between the characterization of "the responsible company" as defined by itself or by notation agencies and, on the other hand, the hierarchy of criteria according to the answers of polled people. When companies and agencies favor sustainable development and good governance, rejecting child labor and so on, polled people consider that the paramount criterion of ethical conduct is personnel management. The problem is right here. Such is the view of a positively critical economist, situated at the point where macroeconomics meets corporate management.<br>

Abstract: Cf. Adam Smith's notion of the 'impartial spectator', as he articulates it in the sixth
edition of The Theory of Moral Sentiments. Smith proposes that 'we endeavour to
examine our own conduct as we imagine any other fair and impartial spectator would
examine it', arguing that the only way people can properly assess their motives and
sentiments is if they 'remove [themselves]... from [their] own natural station' (Part III,
ch. 1). This distance can be gained only by attempting to look upon our sentiments and
motives 'with the eyes of other people, or as other people are likely to view them', as he
says. See Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, ed. D.D. Raphael and A.L. Macfie
(Oxford, 1976 [6th edn. 1790]), pp. 109-10 ff., 154-6.<br>

Author(s): Jenco Leigh Kathryn<br>
Abstract: How can we conduct cross-cultural inquiry without reproducting the ethnocentric categories that prompt critique in the first place? Postcolonial and comparative political theorists have called into question the "universal" applicability of Western liberal political norms, but their critiques are drawn most often from competing Western discourses (e.g., poststructuralism) rather than from the culturally diverse traditions of scholarship whose ideas they examine. In contrast, I suggest attending to these culturally situated traditions of scholarship, especially their methods of inquiry, in addition to their substantive ideas. This method-centered approach reinterprets cross-cultural engagement, not as a tool for modifying existing parochial debates on the basis of "non-Western" cases, but as an opportunity to ask new questions through alternative frames of reference. Examining the interpretive methodologies of two classicists, I show how their methods offer not only new ideas but also new methods for the practice of political and cross-cultural theory.<br>

Abstract: Secularization-a loosening of the religious hold on human conduct-is a multiple process. At one time animated from the exterior, it nowadays proceeds from Christianity's internal development. It can assume the form of a positive appreciation of the secularization of some activities (political, scientific, moral). It can operate even within the strictly religious domain: deritualization, desacralization, demythicization. These transformations are to be studied within the framework of the interactions between religion and civilization. /// La secularización, como retroceso de la empresa religiosa en las conductas humanas es un proceso múltiple. A veces animado desde el exterior hace actualmente el objeto de un desarrollo interno del cristianismo. Puede tomar el aspecto de una apreciación positiva del laicismo de ciertas actividades (política, científica, moral). Puede ejercerse hasta en el dominio propiamente religioso: desritualización, desacralización, desmitización. Se han de estudiar esas transformaciones en el cuadro de las interacciones entre religión y civilización. /// Die Säkularisation als Rückgang der religiösen Einflussmacht auf das menschliche Verhalten ist ein vielfältiges Prozess. War sie früher Anregungen von aussen unterworfen, so handelt es sich heute um eine Entwicklung im Innern des Christianismus. Sie kann die Form einer positiven Einschätzung der Verweltlichung gewisser Aktivitäten annehmen (Politik, Wissenschaft, Ethik) und sich sogar im eigentlichen religiösen Bereich auswirken: Deritualisierung, Desakralisierung, Entmythisierung. Diese Veränderungen sollen im Rahmen der Interaktionen zwischen Religion und Zivilisation untersucht werden. /// ское поведение, - это процесс разнообразный. Приведенная в движение извне, она становится в настоящее время предметом внутреннего развития христианства. Секуляризация некоторых деятельностей (политической, научной, моральной) приобретаег аспект позитивной оценки. Она осуществляется в чисто религиозной сфере~<br>

Abstract: This article presents material from my ethnographic study in Śringēri, south India, the site of a powerful 1200yearold Advaitic monastery that has been historically an interpreter of ancient Hindu moral treatises. A vibrant diverse local culture that provides plural sources of moral authority makes Sringeri a rich site for studying moral discourse. Through a study of two conversational narratives, this essay illustrates how the moral self is not an ossified product of written texts and codes, but is dynamic, gen dered, and emergent, endowed with historical and political agency and an aesthetic capacity that mediates many normative sources to articulate "appropriate" conduct. In so doing, the essay shows the value of including oral narrative in ethical inquiry, especially in narrative ethics, which, for most part, has focused on written sources.<br>

Abstract: L'examen des diverses acceptions du concept de besoin dans la littérature philosophique et psychosociologique, notamment chez Tarde, Halbwachs et Chombart de Lauwe, révèle de nombreuses ambiguïtés qui proviennent des rapports d'implication réciproque que le besoin noue avec le désir ou l'aspiration, de ses fondions et de ses résultats parfois contradictoires. Par lui-même insuffisant, ce concept prend toute sa signification, comme spécification de la motivation, à l'intérieur d'une théorie de la conduite. The examination of the various acceptations of the concept of need in philosophical and psychosociological literature, notably Tarde, Halbwachs and Chombart de Lauwe, reveals many ambiguities which stem from the interrelations of reciprocal implication that need ties in with desire or aspiration in its sometimes contradictory functions and results. By itself insufficient, this concept takes all its signification, as specification of motivation, inside a theory of conduct.<br>

Abstract: A community, in the same way as an individual, can follow as a normal way of behaviour — or as a wanted criteria for behaviour — for all future circumstances to decide discretionally, «case by case», or to define in a moment in time the rule (or a set of rules) that must be valid for the future. To define rules in a community has been indicated by some authors (Geoffrey Brennan and James M. Buchanan particularly) as a way to exit from a situation of a war of every man against every other man, as in the Hobbesian jungle, on one side, and from a situation dominated by a Leviathan on the other. This in a perspective where rules of a common living have been set through a social contract. The rules established through this contract would also form the criteria for a just conduct, in the end therefore for criteria of justice. The essay analyzes the situations and the conditions in which constraining oneself can be rational, even as it is not definible that in all circumstances constraining is more rational than not constraining oneself, that it is more desirable to have rules rather than discretionary decisions, the definition of ways of behaviour rather than the pre-definition of outcomes. As for what concerns the problem of justice, it is indicated how through a contractarian and constitutional procedure rules can be put by unanimous consent, but the problem of the foundation of the same rules remains unresolved. Rules do not seek truth, but only express values accepted by the counterparts in a certain moment in time, and have individuals as sources of these values.<br>

Abstract: This paper considers how companies use their own mass communication media to create, with the aid of metaphors, a legitimizing image of their practices. The analysis is based on the example of two banks, both of which undertook massive staff and cost reductions between 2001 and 2003. Downsizing measures like theirs are often met with resistance if they conflict with the interests, values or worldviews of stakeholders. Companies approach this threat of resistance by building a linguistic façade of legitimacy that suggests conformity with prevailing ideas of good or correct managerial conduct. Our metaphor analysis, which covers all publicly accessible texts of the two banks' own mass communication, identifies nine metaphoric concepts, which we further condense into three persuasive meta concepts: concealing metaphor, euphemistic metaphor, and urgency and control metaphor each fulfil different persuasive functions and vary systematically according to the conditions surrounding the managerial practice.<br>

Abstract: Através de urna abordagem metodológica centrada na reflexão dialética, o presente artigo tem como principal objetivo questionar urna suposta essencialidade natural ou cultural da natureza humana associada as experiencias religiosas e ao sagrado. Este tema constitui uma aporia, pois a religiosidade do ser humano pode ser concebida como fenómeno cultural e natural, humano e sobre-humano, social e individual. Além da indagação sobre a naturalidade ou culturalidade da religião no ser humano, algumas perguntas colocadas no artigo, designadamente na problematização, visam acirrar o pensamento critico sobre esta temática em torno da essencialidade da natureza humana, tais como: a religiosidade é um fenómeno humano, natural e atemporal ou é social, cultural e temporal? É um fenómeno racional ou consciente enquanto alimento da esperança? Tendo em conta que a religiosidade está associada a determinados valores, será racional porque os fins das práticas respondem as convicçôes e aos ditos valores e porque o sentido da experiencia religiosa está inscrito ñas formas de linguagem e de conduta, bem como nos valores que as motivam? Through a methodological approach centered on reflection and dialectics, the main purpose of this article is to inquiry a hypothetical natural or cultural essence of human nature, which is associated with religious experiences and the sacred. This theme is an aporia, because the religiosity of the human being can be conceived as a cultural and natural, human and superhuman, social and individual phenomenon. Besides the questioning about natural or cultural religion in human beings, some questions placed in the article, namely in the questioning part, aim to sharpen critical thinking on this subject around the essence of human nature, such as: Is the religiosity a human, natural and timeless phenomenon, or it is social, cultural and temporal? Is it a rational or conscious phenomenon to feed hope? Given that religiosity is associated with certain values, w~<br>

Abstract: Deux tendances radicalement différentes semblent se partager la production historiographique médiévale. L'une, inaugurée par l'Histoire ecclésiastique d'Eusèbe et dominée par les réflexions que lui a consacrées saint Augustin (et de loin la plus importante), s'attache à retracer le destin des hommes appelés à se rassembler au sein de l'Église afin d'être portés vers un avenir qui doit leur permettre de sortir de l'histoire et de se retrouver à la fin des temps au sein de la Cité de Dieu. L'autre, renouant avec la tradition antique rejetée par l'historiographie chrétienne, se consacre à une communauté définie qu'elle pourvoit d'une origine et d'un passé qui fondent son identité et son existence présente, mais qui semblent en même temps constamment menacées par la fiction. Après avoir rappelé le point de vue de saint Augustin, et afin de mettre en lumière cette double orientation, cette étude s'appuie principalement sur l'historiographie des îles britanniques : à l'Histoire ecclésiastique du peuple anglais de Bède répond en effet l'Histoire des rois de Bretagne de Geoffroy de Monmouth. La critique adressée à ce dernier par Guillaume de Newburgh au seuil de son Histoire des choses anglaises, s'en prenant au caractère fictif des événements attribués au roi Arthur et aux prophéties de Merlin, éclaire de manière exemplaire le sens de l'opposition entre une histoire devant aboutir au ciel et celle qui trouve son assise sur la terre. Two conceptions, radically different, seem to share the medieval historiography. The first (and far most important) one, initiated by Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History and dominated by the reflections saint Augustine has devoted to it, recalls the destiny of human beings who should put themselves together under the conduct of the Church, in the expectation of a future which will allow them to get out of History and find themselves at the End of Times inside the City of God. The other one, linked to the tradition produced in Antiquity but rejecte~<br>

Abstract: Une théorie de la justice peut-elle être métaphysiquement neutre? John Rawls, aussi bien dans l'article de 1985 « La théorie de la justice comme équité: une théorie politique et non pas métaphysique » que dans son Libéralisme politique (1995) a soutenu qu'une théorie de la justice qui s'applique à une société libérale démocratique ne doit s'appuyer sur aucune doctrine comprehensive, mais doit au contraire s'en tenir à des règles de la vie politique et de la répartition des biens qui soient métaphysiquement neutres. Prenant le contre-pied de la position de Rawls, cet article tente de montrer non seulement qu'une telle neutralité ne se vérifie pas dans la construction rawlsienne, lorsqu'il s'agit notamment de justifier les droits de l'homme, mais encore que cet « échec » est ce qui conserve à la théorie de Rawls toute sa force critique par rapport aux doctrines rivales comme l'utilitarisme. Is it possible for a theory of justice to be metaphysically neutral? John Rawls, in his paper published in 1985 and titled "Justice as Fairness: Political, not Metaphysical", as well as in his book Political Liberalism published in 1995, defended the thesis that a theory of justice which is supposed to be applied to a liberal and democratic society should not be rooted in a comprehensive doctrine, but, on the contrary, must be confined to a formulation of rules of political conduct and repartition of goods which is metaphysically neutral. From an alternative standpoint, this paper is an attempt to show that such neutrality is not verified in Rawls' argumentation, especially when human rights' justification is concerned, and that this failure in implementing neutrality is what helps to preserve all the critical strength of Rawls' theory as compared to other doctrines as utilitarianism.<br>

Abstract: L'extension des prérogatives des victimes au procès pénal suscite depuis de nombreuses années de vifs débats, aussi bien en France qu'aux États-Unis. À partir de l'examen du travail doctrinal entrepris par les juristes dans ces deux pays, depuis les années 1980, l'article met en évidence le « répertoire normatif » avec lequel ceux-ci envisagent la place des victimes au procès. Ce répertoire est structuré autour d'une série d'attentes concernant tant le déroulement du procès pénal (l'objectivité du jugement, l'équité du procès, le juste dosage des souffrances) que ses finalités. L'article montre comment le débat autour des victimes contribue à retravailler ces attentes et comment se dessinent, sur la base de ce répertoire commun, les lignes de fracture et de rapprochement entre juristes. Il esquisse de nouvelles perspectives sur la façon dont ce travail doctrinal s'articule avec des politiques pénales marquées traditionnellement par l'opposition entre des positions répressives et libérales. The extension of victims' prerogatives in criminal proceedings rises many years of heated debate, both in France and the United States. By studying the doctrinal work undertaken by lawyers in both countries since the 1980s, the article highlights the "normative repertoire" with which they consider the role of victims in a trial. This repertoire is structured around a series of expectations for both the conduct of criminal proceedings (objectivity of judgment, fair trial, and reasonable amount of suffering) and its purposes. The article shows how the debate around victims helps reshape those expectations and how the lines of division and rapprochement between lawyers are drawn. It points how this doctrinal work articulates with penal policies traditionally marked by the opposition between repressive and liberal stances.<br>

Abstract: In the same line of argument as House's, Stephen Halliwell states in
         Aristotle's Poeticsthat pity and fear refer specifically to the “capacity to sympathize with the sufferer.” He emphasizes that “Aristotle does not derive this sympathy from an undifferentiated sense of humanity: instead, he takes it to be rooted in a felt or perceived affinity between the subject and the object of the emotion.” In that regard, tragic characters “have to be within the reach of an audience's compassion” (175–79). When we see actors perform on stage, we become direct witnesses to their fate. In narratives, the poet/novelist achieves the same effects by providing us with realistic details that bring the characters to life so that we can begin to know them. In B. L. Ullman's understanding, “pitiful and fearful situations are better produced by the structure of the story than by actual scenes on the stage. But those, who through such scenes produce not fear but mere sensationalism, have nothing to do with tragedy” (26). Stories become relevant to readers or audiences in the totality of their elements, through which the story reflects plausible events to the readers themselves. Paul Ricoeur's understanding of the function of poetry, as indicated in the epigraph, goes to the core of the relation of narrative and ethics. Poetry enables the imagination to piece together, in ways acceptable to human flourishing, bits of human conduct, the elements of our happiness and misfortune. He explains in “Life in Quest of Narrative,” that by “means of poetry we learn how reversals and fortune result from this or that conduct, as this is constructed by the plot in the narrative” (23). Ricoeur differentiates between phronetic (prudential), and theoretical/scientific understanding of human nature. Narratives provide the former, while science provides the latter. In line with Ricoeur, Richard Kearney states in “Narrative and Ethics” that “what is peculiar to the ethical quality of narrative unders~<br>

Abstract: Furthermore, children come to us fully immersed in “divine mystery,” Shaw observes. They have a “conscience,” which is nothing other than the inborn urge to prefer the good over the bad and the right over the wrong.
         
               From the moment they make their entrance, Shaw maintains, humans naturally lean toward the commendable. For this reason, in the Shavian universe of enlightened child rearing, totalitarian haranguing from pious elders about proper conduct is both unnecessary and undesirable. To be sure, the young need appropriate nurturing in order to acquire a foundational moral code they can subsequently amend as they mature. Youths do have to be socialized developmentally; they do need to be grounded in the ways of civilized life. Otherwise, the transition to adulthood may prove difficult for them. No one denies this, including Shaw. But, he insists, youngsters come into the world with all the equipment they need to pursue rectitude. Hence, they should not be prisoners in their homes, their schools, or their places of worship. Instead, we should spare them the reign of terror that traditionally accompanies childhood by creatively harnessing their innate tendency toward the worthy. So Shaw asserts.41<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: One way to ensure a verifiable utopian dimension to works of architecture and urbanism (in addition to keeping the four elements introduced earlier in mind) would be to stay close to German sociologist Karl Mannheim's (1893–1947) definition of Utopia. Doing so provides claims to Utopia for architecture and urbanism with terms of criticism by which they could be analyzed more closely and carefully. In this way, the incongruence of such claims with Mannheim's definition of Utopia (and those of others) might be more readily ascertained: “However, we should not regard utopia as every state of mind which is incongruous with and transcends the immediate situation (and in this sense, ‘departs from reality’). Only those orientations transcending reality will be referred to by us as utopian which, when they pass over into conduct, tend to shatter, either partially or wholly, the order which prevails at the time.”
         
               Divergence from Mannheim's definition is most explicitly observable in the degree to which most so-called utopian movements in architecture and urbanism collapse under the burden of their own ideological hollowness, confirmed by their inability, in Mannheim's words, “to shatter, either partially or wholly, the order which [prevailed] at the time … as [they pass] into conduct.”14
            
               As Manfredo Tafuri (1935–1994) observed, the reproduction function of architecture is all but inevitable, captured as it is within the cultural norms of the building industry in particular but more generally within the prevailing sociopolitical and economic conditions of capitalism, which led German philosopher of hope Ernst Bloch (1885–1977) to believe that to be “true,” as he called it, architecture would have to wait for radically transformed conditions to be renewed. In fact, when considered in this way, the utopian prospect of modern architecture was all but nonexistent; more so, it was rarely if ever the issue.15<br>
