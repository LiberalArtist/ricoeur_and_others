  Up from Theory: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1d10hh7">Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy</a><br>
  Abstract: When I first began to study rhetoric, some forty or so years ago, the terms “substance” and “theory” occupied privileged positions in disciplinary consciousness. “Substance” referred to content or subject matter, and in this pre-postdisciplinary scheme of things, scholars were supposed to work within bounded and clearly differentiated domains of inquiry. A discipline, that is, needed to have a proper subject, and since scholarship demanded rationally refined, systematically organized abstract principles that stood above and apart from particulars, the study of an academic subject required the use of “theory.” In the quasi discipline then known as speech (

  CHAPTER 3  Mortification, an Interactional Perspective: from:

  Abstract: Yo tengo mortificaciones; tu tienes mortificaciones; todos tenemos mortificaciones!We all have minor and major troubles that beset us. This chapter discusses a single concept,mortificación,but the method of examination can be used to clarify other terms relating to people’s well-being. What is taken up in these pages is the intentionality of consciousness of the emotion calledmortificación,the experience of being mortified. The consciousness of mortification is experienced in the consciousness of body and in social interaction, what the phenomenologists call intersubjectivity. What is presented in these pages is not new, since it is well known in the<br>

  CHAPTER 13  Final Thoughts: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7ztb3t">Nosotros</a><br>
  Abstract: There are several goals in this chapter. One goal is to cover some of the main findings by linking them back to some basic ideas from phenomenology. Another goal is to connect some of what has been uncovered in the previous chapters to the work of others. In the latter part of the chapter some consideration is given to applications in mental health. For example, it is noted that bracketing from phenomenological philosophy finds applications in mental health work, particularly in the study of empathy. Specifically we note that empathy is used by Husserl to understand the consciousness of another<br>

  On Negritude from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1bmzkq4">Symposium of the Whole</a><br>
  Author(s) DEPESTRE RENÉ<br>
  Abstract: ʺNegritudeʺ was—from one of its directions—a culmination of Surrealist concepts of an alternative consciousness ʺopposed to the values of Europeʺ and ʺviolently departing once and for all from the ways of thinking and feeling which have made life no longer bearable.ʺ (Thus: André Breton, the master of French Surrealism, in his preface—1943—to the Martinican poet Aimé CésaireʹsNotebook of a Return to the Native Land.)The young French-speaking black poets (Césaire, Senghor, et al.) who launched the movement in the 1930s tied all that tothisparticular culture or network of cultures—ʺA frica,ʺ then colonized—<br>

  Abstract: What Lame Deer says here of the resonance and meaning of ʺordinary, common thingsʺ among the Lakota (Sioux) had burst into Western consciousness as well—if not as the common practice he implies, then as a central issue of poetics from the first Romantics to the later modernists and ʺpostʺ-modernists. Thus Blake, for example, in 1802 (ʺA Letter to Thomas Buttsʺ), writes:<br>

Elaine Scarry writes that “we make things so that they will in turn remake us, revising the interior of embodied consciousness.”¹ Certainly, those particularly expressive technologies that are entailed in the practices of writing and the fine arts do, indeed, “remake” us as we use them—but how much more powerful a revision of our embodied consciousness occurs with the inauguration of perceptive technologies such<br>

  Chapter 6  A Critique of Gadamer’s Aesthetics from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pp75p">Gadamer’s Repercussions</a><br>
  Author(s) KELLY MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: There are three main critiques through which Hans-Georg Gadamer develops his conception of aesthetics, which has a central role in his philosophical hermeneutics, which in turn is his principal contribution to philosophy in the twentieth century, all of which he amazingly witnessed. He offers a critique of the philosophy of art which regards art as a lie and that denies it is capable of making truth claims; a critique of aesthetic consciousness as an alienated abstraction from the experience of truth in art; and a critique of the subjectivization of modern aesthetics, which he traces back to Immanuel Kant’s

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.20851/j.ctt1t304z1">Framing French Culture</a><br>
  Author(s) West-Sooby John<br>
  Abstract: The link between scientific discovery and empire building was never more evident than in the latter decades of the eighteenth century. During that time, as Mary Louise Pratt has noted, the 'international scientific expedition' became 'one of Europe's proudest and most conspicuous instruments of expansion'.¹ For Pratt, this period coincided with the emergence of a new version of Europe's 'planetary consciousness' — one which was characterised by 'the construction of global-scale meaning through the descriptive apparatuses of natural history'.²<br>

  EPILOGUE: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287fz7">To Make the Hands Impure: Art, Ethical Adventure, the Difficult and the Holy</a><br>
  Abstract: This book, fittingly, concludes with “the book.” The voice immediately preceding belongs to Levinas, excerpted from “Signification and Sense” (also translated as “Meaning and Sense”). In the first section of this rather difficult essay from 1964, Levinas wants to think through receptivity as the means by which he have access to meaning, and also the role of metaphor (as that which “carries something away”) in describing, but therefore also seeming to falsify or “overload” the date empirically given to our senses. Aslant Husserlian theories of intuition, and other intellectualist models of consciousness from Plato through Hume to the logical positivists,<br>

  EIGHT  Metaphor and the Anxiety of Fictiveness: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287gfz">Figures of a Changing World: Metaphor and the Emergence of Modern Culture</a><br>
  Abstract: Some of my previous remarks may suggest that our basic human impulse to metonymize or demetaphorize attained to its most triumphant moment in the Christian culture of the High Middle Ages. There if anywhere the unconscious and mechanical prejudices of language and perception were most fully reinforced by the flowering of a highly sophisticated and articulate cultural consciousness fashioned in the same mode and shaped by the same prejudices. But this is just what needs to be questioned.<br>

  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287n15">Myth and Scripture</a><br>
  Author(s) Green William Scott<br>
  Abstract: This is a book about how scholars make sense of what we study.¹ As a field of research whose primary focus is a fixed and finite set of data, biblical studies innovates less by discovering new objects of study than by finding fresh ways—or refining old ways—to examine its basic subject matter. Scholars investigate by designing categories of analysis and interpretation to achieve understanding. Regular assessment of the value of these categories—however recondite it may appear to a field’s outsiders—provokes scholarly self-consciousness and thereby strengthens the quality of research and advances knowledge.<br>

  Book Title: Documenting Ourselves-Film, Video, and Culture<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Sherman Sharon R.<br>
  Abstract: What happens when we turn the camera on ourselves? This question has long plagued documentary filmmakers concerned with issues of reflexivity, subject participation, and self-consciousness.
         Documenting Ourselvesincludes interviews with filmmakers Les Blank, Pat Ferrero, Jorge Preloran, Bill Ferris, and others, who discuss the ways their own productions and subjects have influenced them. Sharon Sherman examines the history of documentary films and discusses current theiroeis and techniques of folklore and fieldwork.<br>

  5  Door into the Light: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130jbjp">Passage to the Center</a><br>
  Abstract: In “Tradition and the Individual Talent,” Eliot calls the auditory imagination a feeling for language that unites the most primitive and civilized minds.¹ Heaney’s
                  Northseeks a similar union by exposing both minds to the light of consciousness. As part of this process of exposure, Ulster’s pattern of violence forces him to confront the tragic origins of culture. However, raised as it is inNorthto a vision of malevolent transcendence, tragedy is finally unthinkable. Were it not for the innate rage for order of tragedy, the potency of disorder would consume all meaning—even tragic meaning. Tragedy therefore promises<br>

  6  A Poet’s Rite of Passage: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130jbjp">Passage to the Center</a><br>
  Abstract: Robert Frost observed that poetry begins in delight and ends in wisdom. When asked in an interview whether the same could be said of a poet’s career, Seamus Heaney responded by saying that a poet “begins in delight and ends in self-consciousness.”¹ In their claims about poetic practice, both Frost and Heaney embrace the commonplace notion that poets first begin to find a voice by delighting in language. Beyond this, their statements also suggest that such playful indulgence leads, or should lead, not only to a greater command of language but to a more pervasive and subtle knowledge of the<br>

  8  Parables of Perfected Vision: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130jbjp">Passage to the Center</a><br>
  Abstract: “Without needing to be theoretically instructed, consciousness quickly realizes that it is the site of variously contending discourses,” Heaney remarked in
                  Crediting Poetry(13). Within the context of his Nobel lecture, Seamus Heaney’s observation reminds the reader that even the apparent innocence of childhood is in fact nothing less than a school “for the complexities of his adult predicament.” In a profound sense, Heaney’s insight at once harkens back to the narrow limits of his first world, as well as the nexus of forces that constitutes its ground. At the same time, it illuminates Heaney’s artistic passage beyond his home,<br>

  Introduction to Part Five from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wwwrr">God--The World's Future</a><br>
  Abstract: Theology is an ongoing task with which Christians are never finished because something new is always placed on its agenda. Although it is the thinking discipline whereby faith seeks to understand itself, it is also a part of the church’s ministry. Its peculiar ministry is to provide intellectual leadership. The present work in systematic theology has sought to explicate the significance of the gospel so that what Christians say is intelligible within the context of modern and emerging postmodern consciousness. Thus, a methodological foundation was laid, scriptural symbols explicated, doctrinal content clarified, and hypothetical reconstruction begun. In turning now to<br>

  2  Suffering and Peace from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wzvhj">Tastes of the Divine: Hindu and Christian Theologies of Emotion</a><br>
  Abstract: In the work of Jyoti Sahi, a contemporary Indian Christian artist who resides near Bangalore, the peaceful sentiment has a special place among the
                  rasas. Much of Sahi’s work explores the interplay of opposites in relation to Indian culture and religion. His bookThe Child and the Serpent, for example, looks for symbols of unconscious structures (the serpent) and their birth into consciousness (the child). His use of Jungian psychology grounds his keen interest in Hindu art and mythology in pre-Aryan themes and rituals, so that he draws inspiration both from high Sanskritic culture and from Dalit and Tribal folk<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wzwk2">Givenness and God: Questions of Jean-Luc Marion</a><br>
  Author(s) Alweiss Lilian<br>
  Abstract: The aim to lay knowledge on a foundation that is free of doubt is historically associated with the philosophy of Descartes. Moreover, with his observation that only one proposition escapes doubt—namely, the famous
                  cogito, ergo sum:“I am thinking, therefore I exist”—it is claimed that Descartes inaugurated a philosophy of consciousness (Bewußtseinsphilosophie). It is important to note that Descartes’s original contribution to philosophy does not so much consist in advancing the proposition itself (it can already be found in the writings of Augustine), but in making themetaphysicalclaim that the ego holds rank of afirst principle<br>

  Abstract: Toward the end of his reflective philosophical journal
                  The Inward Morning, Henry Bugbee recalls a searing moment in the mid-Pacific during World War II when he served as captain of a minesweeper.² He recalls bringing down kamikaze pilots close enough that he and the crew of his small vessel could see the incoming pilots face-to-face. As that memory floods his present consciousness, he asks, pen in hand and eight years later, if it is not true that “we were not enemies,” though by all accounts they would have been. And he follows by asking how, if “we were not enemies,”<br>

  Abstract: For kabbalists in the late Middle Ages, in consonance with contemporaneous patterns of Christian and Islamic piety but especially the former, the body was a site of tension, the locus of sensual and erotic pleasure on the one hand, and the earthly pattern of God’s image, the representation of what lies beyond representation, the mirror that renders visible the invisible, on the other. Given the intractable state of human consciousness as embodied—not to be understood, as I will elaborate below, along the lines of Cartesian dualism of mind/body but rather in Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenological sense of the embodied mind/mindful body—<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x02dr">Rethinking God as Gift: Marion, Derrida, and the Limits of Phenomenology</a><br>
  Abstract: A concise way of defining phenomenology is to say that it is characterized by two questions: What is given (to consciousness)? and How (or according to what horizon) is it given? While what is given may not necessarily be a gift, it is already evident from the framing of this definition that the question of the gift will not be irrelevant in this context. Just how that is so will become clearer in later chapters. For the moment, however, it is sufficient to note that the reading of the gift that Marion propounds aims to be a strictly phenomenological one,<br>

  4  Refiguring Givenness from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x02dr">Rethinking God as Gift: Marion, Derrida, and the Limits of Phenomenology</a><br>
  Abstract: Phenomenology has been broadly characterized as the study of phenomena as they give themselves to consciousness, but clearly there are many interpretations of what such a study might entail. For Husserl, it seems phenomenology aims to observe what is given in presence to consciousness; for Heidegger, phenomenology has as its object the uncovering of what gives itself in “presencing”; for Levinas, phenomenology, in its failure, alerts us to what gives by exceeding conscious thematization. Paying heed to each of these three styles as well as others, Marion develops his phenomenological approach. In doing so, he maintains that what he achieves<br>

  Author(s) Bosco Mark<br>
  Abstract: The above sentiments of the Second Vatican Council’s
                  Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern Worldcapture a transitional moment in the Catholic Church’s attitude in its relationship with modernity. This shift is seen most remarkably in the language of the Council, what Jesuit historian John W. O’Malley notes is a change from “the rhetoric of reproach” so prevalent in documents from previous church councils to an embrace of the “rhetoric of affirmation and invitation.” The rhetorical change in attitude that permeates the Council documents was matched by a new formulation of the Church’s consciousness of itself since the<br>

  Divinity and Alterity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0741">After God: Richard Kearney and the Religious Turn in Continental Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) MURCHADHA FELIX Ó<br>
  Abstract: Divinity and alterity have haunted phenomenology since its beginnings. At phenomenology’s margins Rudolf Otto described God as the “wholly other.”¹ This otherness of God and the divinity of otherness came into sharp relief in Husserl’s transcendental phenomenology, where God’s transcendence is bracketed as much as the alterity of the other in the reduction of intentional consciousness.² This is a move replicated in Heidegger’s “reduction,” to use the vocabulary of Marion which is employed in this volume by Kearney and Manoussakis, where the question of God depends on the analytic of

  Abstract: In the preface to the second edition of the
                  Science of Logic, Hegel refers to “the peculiar restlessness and distraction of our modern consciousness.”¹ Although the tone of this statement makes it sound like something to be avoided or at any rate minimized, a moment’s reflection tells us that for Hegel, it is one of modernity’s irreducible and most definitive components. Superficial though it may be, restlessness is nonetheless also the forerunner of negativity, what he calls elsewhere the “seriousness, the suffering, the patience and work of the negative.”² Finally, for Hegel, this restlessness is the active dimension without which<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenologies of the Stranger: Between Hostility and Hospitality-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: What is strange? Or better, who is strange? When do we encounter the strange? We encounter strangers when we are not at home: when we are in a foreign land or a foreign part of our own land. From Freud to Lacan to Kristeva to Heidegger, the feeling of strangeness-das Unheimlichkeit-has marked our encounter with the other, even the other within our self. Most philosophical attempts to understand the role of the Stranger, human or transcendent, have been limited to standard epistemological problems of other minds, metaphysical substances, body/soul dualism and related issues of consciousness and cognition. This volume endeavors to take the question of hosting the stranger to the deeper level of embodied imagination and the senses (in the Greek sense of aisthesis). This volume plays host to a number of encounters with the strange. It asks such questions as: How does the embodied imagination relate to the Stranger in terms of hospitality or hostility (given the common root of hostis as both host and enemy)? How do we distinguish between projections of fear or fascination, leading to either violence or welcome? How do humans sensethe dimension of the strange and alien in different religions, arts, and cultures? How do the five physical senses relate to the spiritual senses, especially the famous sixthsense, as portals to an encounter with the Other? Is there a carnal perception of alterity, which would operate at an affective, prereflective, preconscious level? What exactly do embodied imaginariesof hospitality and hostility entail, and how do they operate in language, psychology, and social interrelations (including racism, xenophobia, and scapegoating)? And what, finally, are the topical implications of these questions for an ethics and practice of tolerance and peace?<br>

  Book Title: Edgar Allen Poe: A Phenomenological View-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): HALLIBURTON DAVID<br>
  Abstract: The book begins with a methodological chapter that sets out the assumptions and procedures of the approach. This is followed by analyses of Poe's major works, exploring such special problems as Poe's treatment of the material world, including technology; the interrelation of body and consciousness; poetic voice; attitudes toward women; and the will to affirmation, plenitude, and unity. The center of interest is neither Poe's biography nor environment but always the meaning of Poe's words. Because these works are shaped by a single imagination and because they are experienced in time, as a process, each work has its own "way of going." The aim of the interpretation is to find this way and go along with it; to live each work dynamically, as it "happens," while tracing its interaction with other works.<br>

  Author(s) LANCE VICTOR<br>
  Abstract: The essays contained in this volume are contributions to that intense and self-conscious assessment of the perspectives, resources, and terms by which contemporary literary criticism has sought to justify its validity, its function, and its historical legitimacy. If literature itself seems in our time to have lost its innocence, if neither its subjective nor its objective character is self-evident but demands of its readers a sharp awareness of its modality, it has by this challenge called forth a breathtaking variety of systems of critical discourse; indeed, it has created a pre-eminence of theoretical consciousness that may tend, at times, to<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x1dm4">Failure and Success in America: A Literary Debate</a><br>
  Abstract: In a world where justice appears to be the most one can ask for, there is no room for forgiveness and much space for the particular cruelties practiced in the name of the war against wickedness. Significantly, those who stress justice often turn it most harshly upon themselves. According to Paul Ricoeur in

  Abstract: To be saved by silence in order to arrive at the silence offered by total absorption into God’s consciousness or the self’s core: this solution to the babble of the objective world has not gone unnoticed by a number of American writers. Injoy to leap away from combative individuality toward the democratic spirit held in common; to have the inferior absorbed into superior being; to replace the limitations of the phenomenal with the endless space and light of the noumenal.

  Abstract: Edgar Allan Poe’s
                     Eurekaof 1848 fulfilled the dearest wishes of its author’s gothic soul by cleansing the universe of all matter (that basic fact of human failure) through the return to the purity of the primal Thought. The result is an apocalypse with a happy ending—for the Poe-narrator at least, if not for the rest of us—since consciousness ends where it began: with itself alone, and all because God’s plan has been carried through without a flaw.<br>

  Abstract: The Meiji period was a time of intense social and cultural transformation. The acceleration of history and endless renewal of fashion created a sense of disjuncture and difference that allowed Meiji Japan to imagine itself as the victim of a deformative process of cultural loss and foreign invasion. Fashion is above all else a ritual of forgetting that celebrates novelty and obliviousness to the past.¹ Pierre Nora argues that a memorial consciousness emerges under just such conditions wherein society becomes deeply absorbed in its own transformation and renewal. According to Nora, this condition is “one that inherently values the new<br>

  Abstract: We take a big leap at this point, a metaphoric leap, a leap that is no leap at all. We move from relatively simple cascades of computing neurons to our existential experience of consciousness. In the last chapter, we worked up some of the tools we need to achieve conscious thinking. We kept it simple, but the rudiments were there.

  Abstract: It often happens when you approach them, that what you thought were pinnacles become thresholds. We have worked through the metaphor of consciousness (subjective genitive, the metaphor that consciousness is). Our A = B has issued in symbolic thinking and it has assumed the echoic properties of sentient awareness. We may be inclined to think that our individual minds are the be-all and end-all so far as metaphor is concerned, that metaphor can’t do any better than produce self-reflexive thinkers like ourselves. But in truth, it may just be getting started. It is still expanding and taking on new forms.<br>

  Abstract: Ludwig Wittgenstein’s question and sardonic remark on thinking quoted at the beginning of the first chapter underscores the fact that by current Western standards, thinking remains a more inaccessible mystery than either consciousness or intelligence, and this in spite of its immediate accessibility and ostensive prevalence throughout all human societies at the very least.¹ It is not surprising, then, that the origin and genealogy of thinking is not a prominent concern in philosophy or the human sciences, or that the relationship between the evolution of hominid thinking and hominid evolution has never been seriously examined.

  Author(s) Hartley Tom<br>
  Abstract: It is often said that the journey is more important than arriving at the destination. Life as a political activist has posed many challenges, with many twists and turns, and it has often been uncomfortable. If there is one thread that holds this experience together, it is my political aspiration for a thirty-two-county united and independent Ireland. I cannot tell you when this aspiration entered my consciousness, yet it has always been there in my living memory, and it is probably fair to say that my own aspirations and political experience are reflective of the journey of the Northern nationalist<br>

  Abstract: Souvenir of Canada,Coupland’s first explicit reading of the national consciousness, begins with an aerial vision of the country’s unpopulated, wild northern lands. Gazing at the enigmatic landscape, the writer lists places that, apart from the colonial act of naming, appear to be untainted by human intervention (‘Hudson Bay and the Ungava Peninsula, Ellesmere Island, Baffin Island’) and starts the work of rethinking his own relationship with geography. Cocooned in the memory of one or many aeroplane cabins – an interchangeable tourist space emblematic of modernity’s uninhibited penchant for constant motion – Coupland attempts to connect the knowable and malleable (sub)urban reality<br>

  Abstract: Like many Egyptians, I have witnessed religious practice and consciousness evolve over the past two decades across generations inside my family, within my wider social setting, and in Cairo as a whole. My experiences within Muslim communities in Canada and the United Kingdom have sensitized me to the strength of similar patterns of religious identification in these communities. Perhaps contrary to the expectations of many westerners, Cairenes are becoming more religiously observant and more consciously Muslim, than they were in the 1940s, 1950s, or 1960s.

In this new context the question of Christian identity assumes a new and urgent importance and finds expression in, among other things, a concern to articulate the uniqueness of the gospel.

Within philosophy, phenomenology is as diverse as its practitioners. Indeed, Moran (2000: 3) in an introduction to philosophical traditions of phenomenology finds it important to warn readers not to overstate the degree to which phenomenology “coheres into an agreed method, or accepts one theoretical outlook, or one set of philosophical theses about consciousness, knowledge, and the world.” Some of this diversity continues to be a feature of anthropological uses of phenomenology, as we show here.

  Abstract: In anthropology, the sacred has long been viewed as a unique register of human existence that is at times intimately associated with human suffering in its various forms and manifestations. Often enfolded within such orientations to the potential sacredness of human suffering are associated moral experiences and ethical concerns. Whether understood in the context of painful rituals of initiation, in the light of pain-induced transformations in consciousness, in the context of particular salvational orientations to loss, illness, human finitude, and death, or in the tendency to view suffering as a means of sacrificing one’s own desires for the benefit of<br>

  Author(s) Bergo Bettina<br>
  Abstract: This essay addresses two problems whose outcome indicates the site where a dialogue between phenomenology and Nietzsche might begin. The first problem can be posed as a question: What is the “biology” to which Husserl refers in Appendix 23 of the
                     Crisis(published in 1936) and which is set forth as the “universal ontology”? The second problem concerns embodied consciousness and its life-world. If phenomenology was to serve as the foundation for all scientific endeavors, how then could biology be equated with ontology, and what relationship other than derivative could biology have to phenomenology?<br>

  Abstract: “This universal
                  a prioriof correlation between experienced object and manners of givenness,” Husserl confided two years before his death, “affected me so deeply that my whole subsequent life-work has been dominated by the task of systematically elaborating on thisa prioriof correlation.”¹ The discovery of this universal a priori, which is none other than that of intentionality, signifies that every being, whatever its meaning, points toward a subjective system of lived experiences; that every being, whatever its region of origin, is the object of a consciousness, or again that its objectivity is phenomenality itself. Thus the intentional analysis<br>

  Abstract: Justifying religious faith through thinking consciousness: this is arguably the highest aspiration of the philosophy of religion. Whether this aspiration is itself justifiable, however, is another question. Can religious faith be grasped and grounded, so that its content is justified by the necessity of the philosophical concept? Does religious faith have its telos in philosophical consummation? Or does there remain some residual opacity that philosophy cannot penetrate, some otherness that philosophy cannot reconcile within its own conceptual scheme? How should philosophy approach a reality that claims to be an irresolvable scandal for philosophical thinking?<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzjvj">A Philosophical Anthropology of the Cross</a><br>
  Abstract: In chapter 7 we saw how the category of the penultimate allows for a critical affirmation of human capability. This chapter employs a similar strategy regarding self-reflexivity and self-understanding, showing that the for-itself has a proper penultimate status in the life of faith and that the cruciform self is a self-interpreting animal. It is necessary to make this argument given our interpretation of sin as incurvature, which might seem to reinforce the Romantic-idealist interpretation of the fall as a

This way of thinking takes its departure from a Latin American experience that no longer fits the attempts to establish a place for Latin America<br>

Fundamental to this project were the supposedly empirical sciences of physical anthropology, such as physiology, phrenology and craniology.

It becomes an anthropological duty to explain that individuals make communities and create traditions, likewise to champion those social environments in which such individuality is recognized and respected, and to declaim against those which bury individual worth under a weight of so-called traditional or revelational or institutional knowledge and practice.

  Book Title: Lex Crucis-Soteriology and the Stages of Meaning<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress, Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Loewe William P.<br>
  Abstract: What is the true story of God and humankind, and how does that story become a saving story? These are pivotal questions that constitute the narratives Christians tell about themselves, their values, and how the Christian life is to be lived. In shaping those stories into a coherent, intelligible framework that provides comprehensive meaning, soteriology—the doctrine of redemption—developed as a keystone to Christian consciousness. This study investigates that development of the soteriological tradition. Employing Bernard Lonergan’s notion of the stages of meaning as a hermeneutic, the volume traces the origins of soteriology in the early Christian tradition represented by Irenaeus to its establishment as a systematic theory in Anselm, Aquinas, and subsequent developments in the Protestant tradition of Luther and Schleiermacher. The author concludes with a constructive exploration of Lonergan’s own work on the question of soteriology that overcomes the modernist distortions that hinder Schleiermacher’s account and offers an articulation of the dynamics of Christian conversion that opens onto the social, cultural, and political mediations of redemption necessary for the contemporary age.<br>

  Abstract: Phenomenology as a twentieth-century philosophy has since its classical beginnings been portrayed as a subjective philosophy and frequently claimed to be antiscience. I argue that both characterizations are false or distortions of phenomenology, and so a modification of classical phenomenology is needed, and that is postphenomenology. This chapter follows that trajectory in a somewhat different way. The late twentieth century began to see two science paradigm shifts in the Kuhnian sense.

In fact, speech had played a substantial role in silent films for nearly two decades. Dialogue intertitles and character-written inserts allowed cinematic representations to extend beyond the pictorial exterior and into the linguistic consciousness of characters. Silent film dialogue, however, brought more than a symbolic image of individual consciousness to the cinema.

  Abstract: Until now, psychology has barely dealt with the topics of historical consciousness and historical thought. Although the discipline has given thorough attention to other forms of thought—to other forms of the construction of reality—there is no distinctive tradition with the theoretical or clinical objective of establishing a psychology of specifically historical acts of meaning-construction. Seen properly, this is astonishing.

Today, the study of narrative concatenates throughout the humanities and the social sciences, and the problems raised by such analyses for our conception of history, along with the historical consciousness of the individual, are profound. Further, there are now many distinct and well-articulated orientations toward narrative: realist, phenomenological, psychodynamic, cognitive, textual, and rhetorical among them.

                  Culture of Narcissism, Christopher Lasch calls our attention to the way in which unremitting self-awareness has become the bane of modern society. We long, he suggests, for the “suspension of self-consciousness.” Modern man, “imprisoned in his pseudo-awareness of the self … would gladly take refuge in anidee fixe, a neurotic compulsion, a ‘magnificent obsession’—anything to get his mind off his own mind.”¹ A similar idea can be found in a recent book by Christopher Bollas titledBeing a Character: Psychoanalysis and Self-Experience. Believing that mental health demands a tolerance for a variety of inner states,<br>

  Author(s) Seixas Peter<br>
  Abstract: A common complaint about history education in both North American and European schools is that it consists predominantly of the memorization of factual information. There is thus a huge gap between the practices of school history and the notions of “historical consciousness” that inform this volume. My purpose in this chapter is to articulate a conception of historical consciousness that might be of use in the reform of the practice of history in the schools, in order that pedagogy might serve more purposefully to develop students’ historical consciousness.<br>

  Abstract: Today, historical consciousness is frequently taken as a “central category of historical didactics.”¹ There is nevertheless a lack of empirical investigations on how historical consciousness looks in different age groups and regions in concrete terms, and above all, on how it develops.² Current developmental and social psychological research includes the topic of historical consciousness mostly with reference to adults, and not, however, to children. Yet we have a comprehensive store of investigations that deal with basis competencies of historical consciousness, such as investigations on cognitive development in general, on moral development, on the development of the ability to change perspectives,<br>

  Abstract: “Dysconscious racism” is a form of racism that tacitly accepts dominant white norms and privileges. It is not the

Uncritical ways of thinking about racial inequity accept certain culturally sanctioned assumptions, myths, and beliefs that justify the social and economic advantages white people have as a result of subordinating others.

  Author(s) MAHONEY MARTHA R.<br>
  Abstract: Race is a phenomenon always in formation. Therefore whiteness, like other racial constructions, is subject to contest and change. Whiteness is historically located, malleable, and contingent. Arguments about the contingency of white privilege, and its dysfunctionality for white working people, may seem counterintuitive. Most writers emphasize what whites gain—the existence and benefits of privilege—or what whites lose—the costs of change for whites—rather than looking at transformative interests for whites. Yet some struggles that brought antiracist consciousness to the defense of shared class interest succeeded, historically, even under the formidable difficulties of formal segregation, and fomentation of<br>

  Author(s) FLAGG BARBARA J.<br>
  Abstract: Racial identity is not a central life experience for most white people, because it does not have to be.¹ Like members of any socially dominant group, white people have the option to set aside consciousness of the characteristic that defines the dominant class—in this case, race. Thus whiteness is experienced as racelessness, and personal identity is conceived in a race-neutral manner. However, race plays quite a different role in the lives of people of color in this society. It is, again as a consequence of existing social structures that define and give meaning to racial identity, a central facet<br>

  Abstract: The most striking characteristic of whites’ consciousness of whiteness is that most of the time we don’t have any. I call this the
                  transparencyphenomenon: the tendency of whites not to think about whiteness, or about norms, behaviors, experiences, or perspectives that are white-specific. Transparency often is the mechanism through which white decisionmakers who disavow white supremacy impose white norms on blacks. [See also Chapters 15, 35, and 97. Ed.] Transparency operates to require black assimilation even when pluralism is the articulated goal; it affords substantial advantages to whites over blacks even when decisionmakers intend to effect substantive racial justice.<br>

  Abstract: The “reduction,” or

Husserl’s first published text to propose the concept is the first book of theIdeas, published in 1913.¹ It certainly would not be difficult to show that the reduction is already present in an inchoate fashion in the 1905–1906 lectures on the theory of consciousness,² and we can suspect that the reduction is presentin nucefrom theLogical Investigationsonward.

  Book Title: Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Ethical Self-Christology, Ethics, and Formation<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Elliston Clark J.<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s work has persistently challenged Christian consciousness due to both his death at the hands of the Nazis and his provocative prison musings about Christian faithfulness in late modernity. Although understandable given the popularity of both narrative trajectories, such selective focus obscures the depth and fecundity of his overall corpus. Bonhoeffer’s early work, and particularly his Christocentric anthropology, grounds his later expressed commitments to responsibility and faithfulness in a “world come of age." While much debate accompanies claims regarding the continuity of Bonhoeffer’s thought, there are central motifs which pervade his work from his doctoral dissertation to the prison writings. This book suggests that a concern for otherness permeates all of Bonhoeffer’s work. Furthermore, Clark Elliston articulates, drawing on Bonhoeffer, a Christian self-defined by its orientation towards otherness. Taking Bonhoeffer as both the origin and point of return, the text engages Emmanuel Levinas and Simone Weil as dialogue partners who likewise stress the role of the other for self-understanding, albeit in diverse ways. By reading Bonhoeffer “through" their voices, one enhances Bonhoeffer’s already fertile understanding of responsibility.<br>

For Bloch human consciousness is “the subject matter of history . . . reality itself.” To ask why something happened or how it happened and under what conditions is a “common law of the mind,” Bloch avers, an “instinctive need of understanding.” Historical facts are psychological facts in the sense that however “brutal” are external forces, “their action is weakened or intensified by man and his mind.” Man’s mind is not always conscious, logical, or rational, Bloch continues; it can be explained neither<br>

  Abstract: Freud’s reading of Jewish history, centered around the return to group consciousness of the long repressed memory of the primeval Father, did not end with Moses or the Hebrew prophets. Yes, Moses created the Jews and Judaism by restoring the Father to them alone, through his own person and in the teaching of the one omnipotent God of the universe. Following his death this revelation was repressed in turn, only to reemerge from its state of unconscious latency in the teachings of the prophets, which would become the common patrimony of the entire Jewish people.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter focuses on the idea of wilderness in the poetry of Robinson Jeffers and Gary Snyder, consequently ignoring other writers and poets whose work also reflects that concept. The selection of Jeffers and Snyder delimits an otherwise impossibly large field, and there is some reason to think that the choice is sound since “ecological consciousness seems most vibrant in the poetic mode. The poetic voices of Jeffers and Snyder, so rare in modern poetry but frequently found in primal people’s oral tradition, are a virtual cascade of celebration of Nature/God and being.”¹ We have already argued that Modernism—or,<br>

Yet paradigmatic revolution—a profound change in consciousness, however foolish that idea seems—is in the wind, and humankind may be on the brink of a postmodern age. Of course such qualifiers as anti-or posttend to obscure the central issue: Modernism.¹ Crucially, the idea of wilderness appears to undergird a new paradigm for understanding humankind as embodying natural process grown self-conscious. The wilderness paradigm might be viewed as only an outgrowth of the environmental movement<br>

  Abstract: Wallace Martin’s response to “Literary Criticism and Its Discontents” is anything but naive. Its most sophisticated device is to posit my invention of a “naive reader” and to suggest that I would place the New Critics and their heirs in that category. But when I see the movement of criticism after Arnold as exhibiting an anti-self-consciousness principle or being so worried about a hypertrophy of the critical spirit that that spirit is acknowledged only by refusing it seminal or creative force, I am not alleging naivete but “organized innocence,” or the privileged assignment of some given, intuitive (in that sense<br>

For Schleiermacher, the New Testament and human consciousness provided jointly authoritative testimony to the being of God, but Schleiermacher was well aware of the predilections of his age, particularly the growing skepticism about biblical authority and the increased confidence in the deliberations of the rational mind.

  Abstract: Social concern and involvement is undoubtedly one of the major indicators of the changing ethos of the evangelical movement in the twentieth century. Take the example of North America, where the evangelical movement has been influential not only in the Protestant church but society as a whole. From evangelicals’ balanced approach to soul-saving and social services, to the “Great Reversal” completed during the fundamentalist-modernist controversy of the 1920s and 1930s, to the re-emergence of the sense of social responsibility among evangelicals since the 1970s, the rise of American evangelicals’ social consciousness and commitment is quite dramatic.

  Abstract: The three main authors discussed in this chapter – Feurbach, Marx and Freud – subscribe to the wishful-thinking school of atheism. They maintain that the fundamental purpose of religion is to make human life more bearable by making the suffering endured more understandable; and that the believer achieves this by projection: by transforming the natural human desires for protection and self-affirmation into the consolations provided by a benevolent deity. Each of them – and here we should also include Nietzsche – believed therefore that the religious consciousness was self-deceiving because the impulse to faith was in fact generated by powerful<br>

  Book Title: Radical Embodiment-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Nikkel David H.<br>
  Abstract: "Radical embodiment" refers to an anthropology and an epistemology fundamentally rooted in our bodies as always in correlation with our natural and social worlds. All human rationality, meaning, and value arise not only instrumentally but also substantively from this embodiment in the world. Radical embodiment reacts against Enlightenment mind-body dualism, as well as its monistic offshoots, including the physicalism that reduces everything to component matter-energy at the expense of subjectivity and meaning. It also rejects certain forms of postmodernism that reinscribe modern dualisms. David H. Nikkel develops the perspective of "radical embodiment" by examining varieties of modern and postmodern theology, and the nature and role of tradition-in terms of linguistic and non-linguistic experience, the religion and science dialogue on the nature of consciousness, and the immanent and transcendent aspects of God.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf0ht">Radical Embodiment</a><br>
  Abstract: In creating humankind God sculpted “the earth being,” according to the etymology of “Adam,” the Hebrew word for “humanity” used in Genesis 2. The portrait of humankind painted by the scriptures of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam regards the human person as a psycho-somatic unity. Scientific evidence increasingly points to the truth that human beings are fundamentally embodied in nature, contrary to the Greek-influenced mind-body dualism that has reigned for most of Western theological and philosophical history. In this chapter I will highlight the significance of our embodiment relative to evolutionary biology and to the nature of consciousness in light of<br>

For both Levinas and Derrida, Western conceptions of human identity and personhood post-Descartes are deeply disturbing. In placing the

  Abstract: An engagement with the themes of the hermeneutical self and the ethical difference is undertaken in a comparative religious framework. In the aftermath of colonialism it implies an attempt to overcome the Western tradition of individual consciousness from Descartes to Husserl. In this tradition the thinking subject (knowledge of the self) takes on an ever-increasing importance in the theory of knowledge. In this philosophical development, the thinking subject has been prioritized, while sidestepping human life embedded within socio-historical locations and ethical practices. To improve on this shortcoming, I undertake a comparative religious-ethical study concerning interpretation and ethical self in dialogue<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf16n">The Hermeneutical Self and an Ethical Difference</a><br>
  Abstract: Dilthey in his later years came to appreciate Husserl’s (1859–1938) teachings, which avoid psychological reasoning and articulate the importance of the idea of evidence and a methodological procedure in cognitive analyses. Husserl’s
                  Logical Investigations, published in two volumes in 1900 /1901, created phenomenology, including a new insight into hermeneutical theory. Husserl takes issue with Dilthey’s notion of worldview associated with historicism, because he believes that Dilthey depends on knowledge of historical relativity, causing the absolute validity of any particular life-interpretation, religion, or philosophy to disappear. The formation of a historical consciousness destroys “the belief in the universal validity” undertaken<br>

Through the words of many cultures and religions, human thought and consciousness is embedded within diversity, plurality, and entanglement with the Other. Human religious experience and discourse cannot escape social situational, determination and life connection, which refers to the socio-historical location of human experience and social discourse. Given this, religion is an eminently social and cultural thing, implementing its spiritual meaning connected with the depth of human spiritual life: the ultimate concern.

  Author(s) Mathews Jeanette<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter I suggest that the form-critically identified laments of the Hebrew Bible can be understood via the performance concept of “framing.” In art, drama, and literature the frame lifts the work or event to a heightened consciousness and provides a context for practitioners and audiences to interact. My interest is in the link between frame (form) and content. I argue that the lament form provides a literary framework for the expression of anguish by empowering those who are suffering to name their pain, despite the constraints of the form that generally culminate in a leaning towards hope.

  Abstract: This chapter looks at the early development of the theological ethics of Karl Barth. Because of his significant wrestling with the problems of modern theology and ethics in the early twentieth century, the early years of Barth’s thinking (1916–31) provides an important point of departure for our study. Barth rejects the anthropocentric “immanent frame” of liberal theology, by shifting theology away from personal religious consciousness toward a genuine search for the divine trinitarian
                  Other; his method is deconstructive and critical before it becomes constructive and positivist. With this in mind, two important points must be stated about Barth’s early<br>

The central aim of this paper is to account for the role of imagination epistemologically as it relates to moral action. Exploring<br>

  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hughes George<br>
  Abstract: Emmanuel Falque's The Wedding Feast of the Lamb represents a turning point in his thought. Here, Falque links philosophy and theology in an original fashion that allows us to see the full effect of theology's "backlash" against philosophy. By attending closely to the incarnation and the eucharist, Falque develops a new concept of the body and of love: By avoiding the common mistake of "angelism"--consciousness without body--Falque considers the depths to which our humanity reflects animality, or body without consciousness. He shows the continued relevance of the question "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" (John 6:52), especially to philosophy. We need to question the meaning of "this is my body" in "a way that responds to the needs of our time" (Vatican II). Because of the ways that "Hoc est corpus meum" has shaped our culture and our modernity, this is a problem both for religious belief and for culture.<br>

All that separates Don Quixote and Scheherazade is a thin layer of self-consciousness about the fictional nature of their shared enterprise; Scheherazade understands that the truths she tells her husband are embedded in fictions, while Quixote believes that the fictions he tells himself are derived from the truth.

Their posthumous names were chosen from a limited predetermined pool; their descriptors were derived from set phrases in the classical tradition; and their identities were explicitly categorized as being like this cultural hero or that sage official in antiquity. In other words, postmortem remembrance was a process of pouring new ancestors into prefabricated molds or stamping them with rigid cookie cutters. Public Memory in Early China is an examination of this pouring and stamping process. After surveying ways in which learning in the early imperial period relied upon memorization and recitation, K. E. Brashier treats three definitive parameters of identity—name, age, and kinship—as ways of negotiating a person’s relative position within the collective consciousness. He then examines both the tangible and intangible media responsible for keeping that defined identity welded into the infrastructure of Han public memory.<br>

  Book Title: Forms of Life-Character and Moral Imagination in the Novel<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): PRICE MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Martin Price writes here about ways in which character has been conceived and presented in the novels of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Beginning with chapters that cogently argue the artistic value of character, Price then deals with the different forms character has taken in individual novels. His first discussions center on authors-Jane Austen, Stendhal, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, and Leo Tolstoy-who define individuals by their adherence or opposition to social norms. The next chapters deal with novelists for whom the moral world is largely internalized. The characters of Henry James, Joseph Conrad, D.H. Lawrence, and E.M. Forster live in society and act upon it, but the authors are particularly concerned with the confusions, terrors, and heroism that lie within consciousness. The last chapter uses novels about the artist by James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Thomas Mann in order to apprehend the process by which experience is transformed into art.<br>

  9  James: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1dr37p0">Forms of Life</a><br>
  Abstract: In his later novels, Henry James leaves some crucial portion of his action, and of his characters, indeterminate. He does this, in part, by giving us characters’ conscious responses—at a somewhat shallow level of awareness—without accounting for their deeper motives or even, in some cases, indicating whether the surface awareness is consistent with what lies below. By a shallow level I mean only that the principal action of his novels takes place close enough to the surface of consciousness to alert us to meanings that are almost evident and therefore the more frustrating for their elusiveness. We are<br>

  Abstract: Hermeneutics belongs to multiple histories and so cannot be made into any one thing that begins and ends and suffers conceptual revolutions along the way, although in our effort to make sense of hermeneutics this is very much the sort of story we are apt to be looking for and inevitably come to rely on. Thus in the second part of

  Abstract: Firewalking is certainly one of the most dramatic activities that take place at the many classes, seminars, and workshops attended by the increasing number of Americans who hope to bring about a “New Age” of peace, unity, and higher consciousness through personal growth and spiritual transformation. By the 1980s a wide range of belief systems, social causes, and healing practices, whose origins lay in the counterculture of the 1960s, had come together under the general rubric of New Age phenomena.

  Chapter 2  THE SOCIOLOGICAL CHALLENGE OF REFLEXIVITY IN BOURDIEUSIAN THOUGHT from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ffjq3f">The Anthem Companion to Pierre Bourdieu</a><br>
  Author(s) Susen Simon<br>
  Abstract: The main purpose of this chapter is to examine Pierre Bourdieu’s conception of reflexivity. The concept of reflexivity plays a pivotal role in Bourdieu’s attempt to develop a ‘critical sociology’ (
                  sociologie critique), often referred to as ‘reflexive sociology’ in the Anglophone literature. Based on a thorough textual analysis of his key works, the chapter aims to demonstrate that the following twelve elements are particularly important to Bourdieu’s conception of reflexivity: (1) ‘science’, (2) ‘vigilance’, (3) ‘consciousness’, (4) ‘self-awareness’, (5) ‘critique’, (6) ‘self-objectification’, (7) ‘distance-taking’ (8) ‘rupture’, (9) ‘epistemology’, (10) ‘historicization’, (11) ‘understanding’ and (12) ‘emancipation’.

  Book Title: Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fiction-Explorations in Readers' Engagement with Characters<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): CARACCIOLO MARCO<br>
  Abstract: A storyteller's craft can often be judged by how convincingly the narrative captures the identity and personality of its characters. In this book, the characters who take center stage are "strange" first-person narrators: they are fascinating because of how they are at odds with what the reader would wish or expect to hear-while remaining reassuringly familiar in voice, interactions, and conversations. Combining literary analysis with research in cognitive and social psychology, Marco Caracciolo focuses on readers' encounters with the "strange" narrators of ten contemporary novels, including Bret Easton Ellis's
      American Psycho, Haruki Murakami'sHard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, and Mark Haddon'sThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. Caracciolo explores readers' responses to narrators who suffer from neurocognitive or developmental disorders, who are mentally disturbed due to multiple personality disorder or psychopathy, whose consciousness is split between two parallel dimensions or is disembodied, who are animals, or who lose their sanity.A foray into current work on reception, reader-response, cognitive literary study, and narratology,Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fictionillustrates why any encounter with a fictional text is a complex negotiation of interlaced feelings, thoughts, experiences, and interpretations.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gr7dkd">Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fiction</a><br>
  Abstract: After arguing that “strange” narrators can be employed as tools for phenomenological investigation, this chapter places this investigation into a broader perspective by looking at the animal narrators of Andrzej Zaniewski’s Rat (1995; originally published in Polish in 1993) and Marie Darrieussecq’s
                  Pig Tales(1997; originally published in French in 1996). My analysis should be read against the background of larger discussions on animal consciousness in fields such as cognitive ethology (Griffin 2001) and animal studies (see, e.g., Wolfe 2009). To what extent are nonhuman animals capable of conscious experience, and how are we to know their conscious states in<br>

  Author(s) Lunn Helen<br>
  Abstract: Two major discourses of change in the 1960s, student revolt and black consciousness, were introduced to South Africa primarily through, literature, music, and individual agency. The knowledge transfer helped to define and transform resistance to apartheid from liberal expressions and values to ideologically informed New Left activism. The impact of this shift and the forms it took had highly significant long term outcomes for South Africa, but the perception of South Africa as an isolated place disconnected from early forms of globalization has become a self reflective trope and the significance of links with global changes are not recognized.<br>

  Abstract: It began with a memo. Its original title (‘Some Thoughts in Response to Dottie’s Thoughts on a Women’s Liberation Movement’) suggests the spirit in which it was written. Carol Hanisch, a community organiser for the Southern Conference Educational Fund, was responding to a memo by another staff member. Like so many other activists in the civil rights movement, the antiwar movement, and the New Left, this colleague did not view the fledgling women’s liberation movement as truly political.

However, it was in the Europe of the twentieth century – one of the most violent periods of human history – that the tragic form significantly developed. ‘Modern European Tragedy’ examines the consciousness of this era, drawing a picture of the development of the tragic through an in-depth analysis of some of the twentieth century’s most outstanding texts.<br>

  Abstract: It will hardly appear surprising that a selection of the key texts of European twentiethcentury drama should include a work by Eugene O’neill, being yet another response to the emergence of the twentieth century’s tragic consciousness. Of course he was American, but the matrix of his work is deeply rooted in European culture and theatrical research, with a pessimistic anthropology and a probing of behaviour based on depth psychology (one of the major axes of twentieth-century thought), embedded in a formal structure that is original and innovative compared to the currents of commercial Broadway theatre.¹<br>

  Author(s) Susen Simon<br>
  Abstract: Men can be distinguished from animals by consciousness, by religion, or anything else you like. They themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistence, a step which is conditioned by their physical organization. By producing their means of subsistence men are indirectly producing their actual material life. (Marx and Engels, 2000/1977 [1846]: 177)<br>

  Book Title: The Resounding Soul-Reflections on the Metaphysics and Vivacity of the Human Person<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Kimbriel Samuel<br>
  Abstract: It is surely not coincidental that the term “soul" should mean not only the centre of a creature’s life and consciousness, but also a thing or action characterized by intense vivacity (“that bike’s got soul!"). It also seems far from coincidental that the same contemporary academic discussions that have largely cast aside the language of “soul" in their quest to define the character of human mental life should themselves be so – how to say it? – bloodless, so lacking in soul. This volume arises from the opposite premise, namely that the task of understanding human nature is bound up with and in important respects dependent upon the more critical task of learning to be fully human, of learning to have soul. The papers collected here are derived from a conference in Oxford sponsored by the Centre of Theology and Philosophy and together explore the often surprising landscape that emerges when human consciousness is approached from this angle. Drawing upon literary, philosophical, theological, historical, and musical modes of analysis, the essays of this volume vividly remind the reader of the power of the ancient language of soul over against contemporary impulses to reduce, fragment, and overly determine human selfhood.<br>

  Abstract: Dresden, the winter of 1828–29. In the final months of a life not wanting in notoriety, Friedrich Schlegel (born 1772) delivers a set of curious lectures “concerning in particular the philosophy of language and words.”¹ They are the third part of a trilogy, collectively christened the Philosophy of Life
                  (Philosophie des Lebens),² which argues that the Divine telos of the soul, “the full and living centre of consciousness,”³ lies in the restoration of the imago Dei.

  Abstract: If the epistemology of the signatories, the agents, of the racial contract requires evasion and denial of the realities of race, the epistemology of the victims, the objects, of the racial contract is, unsurprisingly, focused on these realities themselves. (so there is a reciprocal relationship, the racial contract tracking white moral/political consciousness, the reaction to the racial contract tracking nonwhite moral/political consciousness and stimulating a puzzled investigation of that white moral/political consciousness.)

  Author(s) Macdonald Graeme<br>
  Abstract: Like the first law of thermodynamics, literary fiction requires momentum. Fiction relies on propulsive devices: basic units of charge that power action, event, and consciousness, calibrated by laws of narrative motion and physical, material impressions of kinetic and potential energy transference. (These need not involve tales of actual motion or much, if any, movement—consider Beckett’s minimalism or the generic predicates for entropy in naturalist writing.) Fiction requires and is measured through potential—what fuels its psychosocial dynamics, the impetus of plot and character development, and its chronotopic ability to traverse multiple times and spaces.

Most imported Irish cultural elements have, historically, been systematically mediated through mass cultural forms; that is, they have entered into American consciousness as artifacts of commodity culture. That this has been occurring for at least 150 years is clear from recent research into the tourism industry in Ireland, which has been promoting itself actively since the end of the Great Famine.

Heidegger’s approach falls in the line of his teacher, Edmund Husserl, the founder of Phenomenology. Husserl understood Phenomenology to be comprehensive philosophy; it is at least permanent prolegomenon, acknowledged or not, to any philosophy. Phenomenology comes from two Greek terms,phainomenon, appearance, andlogos, essence.

Onnie Jay Holy, inWise Blood, could represent all those literalists who cling to the assurance of the understanding: “You don’t have to believe nothing you don’t understand and approve of.

She wrote of herself: “I am a Catholic peculiarly possessed of the modern consciousness, that Jung describes as unhistorical, solitary, and guilty.” Likewise her characters comprise a gallery of misfits isolated in a present and sentenced to a lifetime of exile from the human community. In O’Connor’s fiction, the past neither justifies nor even explains what is happening. If she believed, for example, in the importance of the past<br>

  Abstract: Consciousness does not cover the entire field of our mental life. There is another area of mental activity that we glimpse in what we recall of dreams, in slips of the tongue, and more dramatically in behavior under hypnosis. This area, the unconscious, resists being known or spoken; and to bring it to consciousness we encounter resistance or repugnance and feel a sense of exertion.¹ Because of its resistance to becoming conscious knowledge, the unconscious has a paradoxical nature. It is both there and not there, both known and not known. “The unconscious, Lacan says, is knowledge; but it is<br>

At the very least they were the culmination of an acute consciousness of crisis in the West.

Instead of restricting his role to deflating metaphysics, which, as he saw it, assumed a universe governed by the commanding self-consciousness of a thinking subject (Derrida’s charge against Husserl), Derrida turned to Jewish tradition and, at different moments, to Nietzsche in order to stake a far wider claim for his philosophy.

We shall still be considering the psychological genesis of the text or film as the site, or model, for the symbolic patterning of a text, undoubtedly in the case of Žižek, to some extent also in that of Deleuze.

  Abstract: Since my first lectures at the Collège de France more than thirty years ago, my aim has been clear: to take up the challenge of molecular biology and apply its paradigms and methods to a study of the brain and its most highly integrated functions, such as consciousness and thought. So where do we stand all these years later? Let us try to establish some new facts and some research perspectives for the decades to come.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npzng">Edmund Husserl's Freiburg Years</a><br>
  Abstract: In our expositions of Husserl’s researches into time-consciousness and intersubjectivity, we repeatedly encountered the idea of passive constitution. It is now time to take up this idea, which marks a major phase in the development of Husserl’s thinking. The idea of passive synthesis will lead us to his idea of genetic phenomenology.

  The Vortex Beneath the Story from:

  Author(s) Mitchell Juliet<br>
  Abstract: The widespread diffusion of psychoanalysis into myriad therapies coincides with the relative weakening of its own center as a clinical practice and theory that emanates therefrom. Psychoanalysis is a discipline that demands the hard work of fifty minutes of daily free association from the patient and the suspension of consciousness from the analyst in order to listen to unconscious effects that, despite all their differences, somewhere as humans (as analyst and analysand) they share.<br>

  Freud’s Theory of the Mind and Modern Functional Imaging Experiments from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nq728">Whose Freud?</a><br>
  Author(s) Rothman Douglas L.<br>
  Abstract: What relations are there between Freud’s theories of the mind and modern functional brain imaging experiments? To anchor this question, we present two statements from Mark Solms’s recent article about the nature of consciousness.¹ First, Solms emphasized Freud’s definition that “mental processes are in themselves unconscious,” arguing the relevance of this definition to modern controversies about brainmind-consciousness. We are willing to accept a moderate form of this position, in which the unconscious is acknowledged to contribute significantly to mental processes. The second quotation is less familiar: “psychoanalysis and PET scanning study one and the same underlying object: the mental apparatus<br>

  Foreword from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1p5f2w5">The Only Mind Worth Having</a><br>
  Author(s) Williams Rowan<br>
  Abstract: Becoming a child again: the first reaction may be a feeling that this would be wonderful—no responsibility, no battling with expectations, no long memories of failure and ambiguity. But when Jesus of Nazareth tells us to become like children, and when spiritual masters urge us to connect with the “child mind,” they are not being nostalgic or sentimental. They are drawing our attention to something we all instinctively recognise. There is something that our habitual adult consciousness has lost or buried, and it must be found, not as a comforting reinstatement of half-forgotten happiness but as a breakthrough to<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1p5f2w5">The Only Mind Worth Having</a><br>
  Abstract: Eastern thought has long understood the value of the child mind in the adult seeker for spiritual maturity. The child mind is seen as a place of surrender, alertness, and nakedness. It is seen as a space where there is little if any self-consciousness; there is no judgment of others. It is a time of humility. It involves an awareness of the person’s nothingness—where the person is no -thing. The child mind recognizes the person’s smallness and yet connection in the scheme of things, and in Eastern practices it is seen as a state that can be developed through<br>

  Abstract: Poets and poetry have been drawn on already throughout this book for certain poets seem able to articulate so well aspects of the child mind. This chapter explores why this might be and focuses on the characteristics of the language of poetry. For as a form of expression poetry usually communicates authenticity. Poets speak and write of a way of looking at the everyday with a sensitivity that can take the hearer and reader beyond that everyday into another level of consciousness. Perhaps there are ways that some poetry can tap directly into the unconscious of the reader or hearer<br>

  Abstract: This contemporary tale (origin unknown) contains the care worn adult whose vision and senses are blunted. As all these are stripped away the light begins to return and the image of God returns as a small child ready to play. Play, creativity, and the imagination are not only aspects of childhood but are characteristics of the spirit of the child that remain still potentially available in the adult. In absorbed play and concentrated creativity self-consciousness can be forgotten and the disguise or the false self is left behind. Play can also be a way to integrate the shadow and all<br>

  Abstract: Thomas Merton was constantly struggling with the question of identity, and in his search for spiritual integrity and thereby maturity he engaged in a continual struggle to be free from an imprisoning and distorting self-consciousness that plagued him and, he believed, all human beings to a greater or lesser extent. He included in this searching both grace and psychology and he saw that these could work together, sometimes being in conflict. Merton was searching for full identity in Christ and for what spiritual maturity might mean, and from glimpses of his work the suggestion in this book is that he<br>

  Abstract: Though the previous chapters have used mega-novels’ relationships to several nonfictional genres to examine how their detailed accumulation of the facts of real life can overload readers’ attention capacities and subsequently prompt them to modulate their methods of text processing, cruft is not limited to the small-scale cases of the incoherent word, the irrelevant datum, the passing moment of consciousness. The following three chapters will examine how mega-novels’ incorporation of elements from other literary genres produces more extensive but equally pointless cruft, inducing the same characteristic frustration and boredom to provoke a similar reorientation of attention.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1rrd9dn">Screening Motherhood in Contemporary World Cinema</a><br>
  Author(s) AYOB ASMA<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary bollywood filmmakers are increasingly questioning the links between the depiction of women, patriarchy, and national discourses that were considered normative in the early 1900s. The representation of mother figures in popular Bollywood films¹ has changed considerably over the years. This paper explores the representations of “ diasporic” mother figures as portrayed in popular films post-1990 and takes into consideration the effects of feminist consciousness, which, in turn, has been fuelled by globalization. Indian diaspora audiences are increasingly engaging in processes of identification with the themes of Bollywood films. As Gokulsing and Dissanayake rightfully note, diasporic Bollywood films promote modernization,<br>

  Abstract: My aim here is to inquire why and how some recent literary histories have come to be written or rewritten. I consider this inquiry important because it challenges us to understand our own desire for historicity, our sense of our own mortality; not only because we are conscious of a nuclear possibility, but because in this century we have become conscious of the readiness of human beings to end the lives of others. We live with the consciousness of what has been repressed, and despite our desire to expose the repressed, there always remains a remnant that eludes us. This<br>

  Abstract: M.D.: Whether we are dealing with textual or be-yond-textual subterfuges, Mallarmé appears as the presiding consciousness of a constellation of poeticians of the blank exploring the alternance of absence in presence and for whom the spaces and silences between words matter at least as much as words themselves or the things they designate. Mallarmé’s poetry is geared towards the creation of paradoxical objects which cancel themselves as soon as they are named (one is reminded of his «absent tomb», his «flights which have not fled» and the «abolished bauble of sonorous uselessness» of his aptly de-titled «Sonnet allégorique de lui-même»

  CHAPTER 5  Bernard Lonergan: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wq8z40">The Three Dynamisms of Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: Bernard Lonergan (1904–84) was, in my estimation, the premier Roman Catholic theologian of the twentieth century. Basically a Thomist, he nevertheless displayed remarkable creativity in the areas of epistemology, method, and historical consciousness.¹ His contribution to a theology of faith hinges upon two conversions: religious and intellectual. Accordingly, after briefly characterizing a third kind of conversion, the moral one, which is less important here for a theology of faith, this chapter shows the impact of religious and intellectual conversion.² The first two sections discuss the interaction between

  Book Title: The Illiberal Imagination-Class and the Rise of the U.S. Novel<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): Shapiro Joe<br>
  Abstract: Through close readings of the works of foundational U.S. novelists, including Charles Brockden Brown, Hugh Henry Brackenridge, Catharine Maria Sedgwick, James Fenimore Cooper, and Harriet Beecher Stowe, Joe Shapiro demonstrates that while voices of economic egalitarianism and working-class protest find their ways into a variety of early U.S. novels, these novels are anything but radically dialogic; instead, he argues, they push back against emergent forms of class consciousness by working to naturalize class inequality among whites.
      The Illiberal Imaginationthus enhances our understanding of both the early U.S. novel and the history of the way that class has been imagined in the United States.<br>

  Author(s) Sullivan William<br>
  Abstract: The United States, as has been said for at least 100 years, is different from Europe. And it has been different, it has been said over and over again, because of the importance of the doctrine of laissez faire in the United States. This has been a society in which mobility and expansion (perhaps we could call it the frontier thesis in many ways) have played the role that politics and political negotiation and conflict have played in European societies. So, as it has often been noted, even labor in the United States never had an estate consciousness; rarely, in<br>

  Abstract: In the chapter “Temporality,” found in the third part of
                  Phenomenology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty recalls that starting in his first book,The Structure of Behavior, his concern is specifically to understand the relation between consciousness and nature and to link together the realist and idealist perspectives—that is, to link the point of view of a consciousnessconstitutingthe object to the point of view of a consciousnessconstitutedby the objective world and inserted into it.¹ Consciousness and the world, the inside and the outside, sense and non-sense, had for him never been separate beings that required an external<br>

  Abstract: Is philosophy ready to take account of the sudden emergence and factuality of the event, which since Plato has been defined as a thought of the generality and invariance of essence? Such is the very general question with which I would like to begin. As Husserl recalls at the very beginning of his lectures on the phenomenology of internal time-consciousness, the question of time and its contingency has always constituted the most crucial challenge for philosophy, marking the limits of its enterprise to intellectually possess the world because, as the very stuff of things, time seems to escape radically from<br>

  Abstract: As already noted, this consciousness is the poetic heart of the
                  Iliad. This heart, however, beats not in the verses but in the lapses, pauses, and silences that scan and pierce the poem like a “clearing” suddenly opening and immediately closing in the universe of force, in which force contains its limit as its own oblivious surface. This means that contrary to what Arendt believed, one can never “really” escape this consciousness, and “reality”—which coincides with our notion of the possible—is not infinite in the sense of it being limited by an impossible toward which at least one<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3scx">American Poetry</a><br>
  Abstract: In a lecture presented at the Library of Congress in 1948, T. S. Eliot acknowledges so early an acquaintance with Poe that he cannot be sure whether his own work has been influenced by him. He then distances himself from his predecessor by focusing on Poe’s relation to the French Symbolists Baudelaire, Mallarmé, and Valéry.¹ This detour through another country and another language is the standard reading of the Eliot-Poe connection: Poe’s insistence on the poem as a formal artifact, as well as his critical self-consciousness, influenced the French Symbolists, who in turn influenced Eliot. Clearly, Eliot shares the Symbolists’<br>

  Abstract: Pushkin was possessed of a richly mythopoetic consciousness. He was also, as numerous friends attest, intensely superstitious. Indeed, for a poet of Pushkin’s range and energy, it is not surprising that some of his finest works are motivated thematically on the dual and interpenetrating notions that myths can, literally, come to life and that forces beyond one’s control can prearrange one’s destiny. Yet Pushkin never made the connection between certain crucial myths (or beliefs, superstitions) and his own unfolding biography

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxsj7q">The Superstitious Muse</a><br>
  Abstract: One of the more fascinating aspects of Nabokov’s artistic method is the way he “covers his tracks” when referring to potential intertextual sources or “ influences.” He prefers his readers to believe that each work has emerged fully formed from the broad forehead (as opposed to dark loins) of his Zeuslike consciousness. Or so the prefaces to his novels, with their disclaimers as to matters of genealogy and their repeated references to the “Viennese delegation,” would have us think. It is not that Nabokov hesitates to engage in intertextual punning or name-dropping, which practice clearly enriches the links within his<br>

  Abstract: Humans are storytelling creatures. We tell stories throughout our lives—about ourselves, our families, our communities, our past, and our future. Some stories we tell aloud to others and some we tell to ourselves, within the confines of our own consciousness. Through the stories we tell about ourselves, we constitute our identities because it is through our stories that we organize the events of our lives—disparate in time and place—into a coherent form. For example, stories allow us to create a causal relationship between different events, or to make certain events central and others secondary. The story is<br>

These range from the navigational acuity of flocks of birds, to the poetics<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt20d87sf">Levinas and the Trauma of Responsibility</a><br>
  Abstract: On levinas’s reading, formal conceptions of time depict a neutral order within which we experience events and beings. These accounts correlatively naturalize a subject who comprehends and controls her surroundings. When Levinas identifies the deformalization of time as central to his philosophical work, he is thus engaged in the critique of the image of subjectivity presupposed by formal conceptions of time. Starting in the late 1960s, Levinas describes time’s “meaningful content somehow prior to form” as traumatic: a responsibility for the other imposed on the subject, which consciousness is always too late to assimilate as a phenomenon (OUJ 232).<br>

  3  The Method of An-Archeology from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt20d87sf">Levinas and the Trauma of Responsibility</a><br>
  Abstract: Levinas’s prominent use of the concept of trauma provokes the question of how responsibility can be thematized at all, given its status as a trace rather than a phenomenon—an experience that can be unproblematically represented by consciousness. Through its rhetorical peculiarities, his philosophical style reflects his claims about the subject’s encounter with what exceeds, frustrates, or otherwise interrupts conceptualization. This chapter will analyze Levinas’s method of “saying and unsaying,” with particular attention to his repudiation of narration in
                  Otherwise than Being. Given that narration is one way to reduce the lapse of time to a unified representation, this methodological<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt20d87sf">Levinas and the Trauma of Responsibility</a><br>
  Abstract: Levinas’s critique of narrative and the conception of the narrating subject that underlies it leads him to the issue of how time is synchronized in the philosophy of history, where the process of abstraction from the singular other is most prominent. By interpreting the significance of disparate events and integrating them into a coherent account, the disciplinary approaches of history typically assume a formal conception of time, in which a linear chronology can be represented by consciousness. In other words, past events are treated as intentional objects. This synchronization of time entails generalizing from people’s experiences, selectively emphasizing certain elements<br>

I just gave a quick overview of the “hybridization” of conservatism and liberalism at the beginning of the nineteenth century (and earlier) as

  Author(s) Dahlstrom Daniel O.<br>
  Abstract: One of Kenneth Schmitz’s major and undoubtedly lasting accomplishments is his demonstration of the distinctive contribution made by Karol Wojtyla to philosophy. In Schmitz’s masterful expositions, Wojtyla’s philosophical project comes alive as an effort to understand action phenomenologically and realistically, as something that proceeds from and reveals, not consciousness, but the whole person “as a being among other beings.”¹ In this connection, among other things, Schmitz corrects a common misunderstanding of the extent of Wojtyla’s philosophical debt to Scheler’s thought. To be sure, Wojtyla plainly acknowledges the importance to him of both Scheler’s critique of Kant’s ethics and its basis<br>

  Abstract: The phenomenon of human efficient causality reveals itself most completely in the conscious act of the person.¹ Thus, in 
                     The Acting Person, Wojtyła’s analysis of human causality is preceded by his theory of consciousness. Wojtyła’s treatment of human consciousness clearly manifests his methodological and epistemological assumptions that result in his philosophical differences from classic phenomenology and modern idealism, as well as from twentieth-century neo-Thomism. But before giving a detailed account of Wojtyła’s mature theory of human efficacy, it is necessary to present the main principles of his theory of consciousness.<br>

Yet this once noble conception seems absent from most present-day discussions of similar topics. Terms such as consciousness, subjectivity,

Wood explains: ‘Phenomenology could never have had any interest unless its descriptions of the structures of consciousness had a value that went beyond their being an accurate account of subjective phenomena. That value lay in what was always assumed to be the epistemological and ultimately ontological significance of consciousness’ (1989: 324–25).¹ Indeed, in theory, phenomenology was to<br>

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Sanders Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: The science fiction genre maintains a remarkable hold on the imagination and enthusiasm of the filmgoing public, captivating large audiences worldwide and garnering ever-larger profits. Science fiction films entertain the possibility of time travel and extraterrestrial visitation and imaginatively transport us to worlds transformed by modern science and technology. They also provide a medium through which questions about personal identity, moral agency, artificial consciousness, and other categories of experience can be addressed. In The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film, distinguished authors explore the storylines, conflicts, and themes of fifteen science fiction film classics, from Metropolis to The Matrix. Editor Steven M. Sanders and a group of outstanding scholars in philosophy, film studies, and other fields raise science fiction film criticism to a new level by penetrating the surface of the films to expose the underlying philosophical arguments, ethical perspectives, and metaphysical views. Sanders's introduction presents an overview and evaluation of each essay and poses questions for readers to consider as they think about the films under discussion.The first section, "Enigmas of Identity and Agency," deals with the nature of humanity as it is portrayed in Blade Runner, Dark City, Frankenstein, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Total Recall. In the second section, "Extraterrestrial Visitation, Time Travel, and Artificial Intelligence," contributors discuss 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Terminator, 12 Monkeys, and The Day the Earth Stood Still and analyze the challenges of artificial intelligence, the paradoxes of time travel, and the ethics of war. The final section, "Brave Newer World: Science Fiction Futurism," looks at visions of the future in Metropolis, The Matrix, Alphaville, and screen adaptations of George Orwell's 1984.<br>

The judicious use of the subjective camera is an especially effective technique when appropriately modified to evoke alien perspectives, those radically unlike our own.

  Abstract: Freud has often been credited, if not with an actual “discovery” of the unconscious (which he had the wisdom not to claim entirely for himself), at least with the introduction of a revolutionary idea of its nature and function. It is less frequently noticed, however, that his vision of consciousness remained utterly traditional and bound to the idea of consciousness as the internal perception of “objects” of a certain type—the paradigm of clear and immediate perception.

  Abstract: Immigration, including the role of immigrants in Canadian culture, became a national issue by the summer of 2001, when Statistics Canada reported an ethnic and demographic makeover under way. The impact was analogous to the point in Hegelian analysis when Eve had to teach the facts of life to a rationalist and self-centred Adam, an archetypal Bad John. Just like the exemplary Adam, Canada was coming to know itself as a tragic hero: it was ageing and dying but wanted to live forever. As a self-consciousness, it had to realize that it was ultimately a

  Abstract: There is then perceptually a problem with Canada as a practical and pragmatic entity, and there are problems in the way that we as citizens and critics imagined multiculturalism and its achievements. A being or consciousness is – in Hegel’s sense – in need of a tragic ending that offers an escape. The classical strain of thought in Western philosophy privileges acts and forbearances that are moral and ethical, qualities that we associate with the supersensible and with God, the absolute, the unchangeable, reason, and rationalism in a world that we thus treat as if it is the product of dual systems<br>

  Author(s) Palmer R. E.<br>
  Abstract: Philosophical hermeneutics takes as its task the opening up of the hermeneutical dimension in its full scope, showing its fundamental significance for our entire understanding of the world and thus for all the various forms in which this understanding manifests itself: from interhuman communication to manipulation of society; from personal experience by the individual in society to the way in which he encounters society; and from the tradition as it is built of religion and law, art and philosophy, to the revolutionary consciousness that unhinges the tradition through emancipatory reflection.<br>

  Book Title: The Uncertain Sciences-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mazlish Bruce<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging book one of the most esteemed cultural historians of our time turns his attention to major questions about human experience and the attempts to understand it "scientifically." Bruce Mazlish considers the achievements, failings, and possibilities of the human sciences-a domain that he broadly defines to include the social sciences, literature, psychology, and hermeneutic studies. In a rich and original synthesis built upon the work of earlier philosophers and historians, Mazlish constructs a new view of the nature and meaning of the human sciences.Starting with the remote human past and moving through the Age of Discovery to the present day, the author discusses what sort of knowledge the human sciences claim to offer. He looks closely at the positivistic aspirations of the human sciences, which are modeled after the natural sciences, and at their interpretive tendencies. In an analysis of scientific method and scientific community, he explores the roles they can or should assume in the human sciences. Mazlish's approach is genuinely interdisciplinary, and he draws on an array of topics, from civil society to globalization to the interactions of humans and machines, to inform his thought-provoking discussion of historical consciousness.<br>

  I  On the Prehistory of Hermeneutics from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bfxq">Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics</a><br>
  Abstract: The development of explicit hermeneutical reflection bears the signature of modernity. As shown above with reference to Nietzsche and Habermas, what distinguishes the modern world-picture is its consciousness of being perspectival. As soon as it becomes evident that worldviews do not merely duplicate reality as it is in itself, but are instead pragmatic interpretations embraced by our language-world, then hermeneutics comes into its own. Only with the advent of modernity has this occurred. For this reason, it is hardly accidental that the Latin word
                  hermeneuticafirst emerges in the seventeenth century. Yet modern insights can be traced back to antiquity,<br>

  VII  Hermeneutics in Dialogue from:

  Abstract: If anything is universal in philosophical hermeneutics, it is probably the recognition of one’s own finitude, the consciousness that actual speech does not suffice to exhaust the inner conversation that impels us toward understanding. Gadamer ties the universality of the hermeneutic process to the fact that understanding depends on this ongoing conversation: “That a conversation occurs, no matter when or where or with whom, wherever something comes to language, whether this is another person, a thing, a word, a flame (Gottfried Benn)—this is what constitutes the universality of hermeneutic experience.”¹ Only in conversation, only in confrontation with another’s thought<br>

  Abstract: The argument between Derrida and Gadamer has made at least one thing clear: the charge brought against the universal search for truth and understanding is universal perspectivism, as Nietzsche inscribed it in philosophical consciousness. What is the point of striving for understanding, when everything is perspectival and historically conditioned? Often Gadamer has himself been viewed as the spokesman for historical relativism, since he had written that we do not understand better, but only differently. What would it mean to talk about the universality of understanding differently? Ultimately, does it not destroy the whole notion of truth?<br>

  Abstract: Christian faith evokes diverse and sometimes competing images and associations. For some, it conjures up a fairly coherent, albeit complexly interrelated array of experiences, dispositions, attitudes, and beliefs. For others, faith names not so much the defining subjective features of religious consciousness as the objective content of Christian religion. Faith is thus construed as a set of doctrines, a peculiar body of teaching and instruction. In short, faith is a divine “deposit” — with the church or the Bible acting as its repository.<br>

  Book Title: On the Nature of Consciousness-Cognitive, Phenomenological, and Transpersonal Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): HUNT HARRY T.<br>
  Abstract: What is the relation between mystical experience and ordinary consciousness, between the principles of modern physics and the patterns of perception in all moving creatures, between our human self-consciousness and the more primary sentience of protozoa? This book pursues an inquiry into consciousness that ranges from ancient Greece to empirical neuro-psychology to the experiential traditions of introspection and meditation. Harry Hunt begins by reviewing the renewed interest in ordinary consciousness and in altered and transpersonal states of consciousness. He then presents competing views of consciousness in cognition, neurophysiology, and animal psychology, developing a view of perceptual awareness as the core of consciousness potentially shared across species. Hunt next brings together the separate strands of neo-realist approaches to perception and thought, the phenomenology of imagery and synesthesia, and cognitive theories of metaphor. He develops an original cognitive theory of mystical experience that combines Buddhist meditative descriptions of consciousness and Heidegger's sense of Being. In relating both of these to James J. Gibson's views on perception, he avoids the various "new age" supernaturalisms that so often blight the transpersonal literature. Other themes include the relation between consciousness and time; the common perceptual-metaphoric rooting of parallels between consciousness and modern physics; and the communal basis of transpersonal states as reflected in a sociology of mysticism and a reinterpretation of parapsychological research.<br>

  2  Cognition and Consciousness from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32btm9">On the Nature of Consciousness</a><br>
  Abstract: Cognitive psychologists and neuropsychologists like Marcel (1983ab), Humphrey (1983), Baars (1988), Weiskrantz (1988), and Schacter (1989) now understand consciousness as a formal system or capacity involving the direction, choice, and synthesis of nonconscious processes. This movement, however, has also been answered with renewed versions of the traditional functionalist and behaviorist rejections of the study of consciousness as anything other than an incidental by-product of computational capacity (Dennett, 1991). Consciousness is seen as private and hence outside scientific scrutiny, confabulated and deluded in its pretended access to cognitive process, and ultimately nonfunctional. Such a rejection is in fact central to the<br>

  3  Consciousness as Emergent: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32btm9">On the Nature of Consciousness</a><br>
  Abstract: There is a widespread agreement among those psychologists who see consciousness as a causal system in its own right that its qualitative features are somehow “emergent” from underlying neural processes. That said, however, all major questions remain. Is consciousness, in the sense of a primary or immediate sentience, only emergent at a particular level of central nervous system complexity, as most investigators certainly would agree for self-referential symbolic processes? If so, is primary awareness regionally localized? Or, with the artificial-intelligence (AI) community, would any computational system of sufficient “cross-reference” also perform the basic functions attributable to consciousness? On both views,<br>

  Abstract: Even if we conclude that consciousness is an emergent property of neural connectivity, it soon becomes clear that certain areas of complex nervous systems show especially dense interconnections. These “zones of convergence” become the obvious candidates for any more specific neural localization of consciousness, especially in relation to its capacity for immediate synthesis. Before pursuing the various candidates for such zones, it is important to consider what such attempts can and cannot explain. I have stressed that both in the evolution of the nervous system and in ontogenetic neural development, functions seem to be nascently present before the appearance of<br>

  Abstract: If consciousness is always enacted behaviorally in a world and neuronal connectivity instantiates consciousness but does not necessarily explain it, there is every reason to hope that we might come to understand both self-referential consciousness and the primary sentience it reorganizes by studying their likely points of evolutionary emergence. Any attempt, however, to infer forms and levels of consciousness in the activities and sensitive attunements of organisms simpler than ourselves runs immediately into one of the most fundamental debates of modern science. The issue of animal consciousness clearly pits the basic criteria of theoretical parsimony and availability of methodological verification<br>

How curious that it is this recent. In so doing, he also addressed the relationship between consciousness and physical reality in ways which have not yet been fully assimilated. James’s work informed subsequent schools of thought that are generally held to be antithetical — in psychology, functionalism and behaviorism as well as the Gestalt tradition; in philosophy, Wittgenstein as well as Husserl, Heidegger,<br>

After all, it was the initial attempts at empirical laboratory research on visual imagery that were heralded as a “return of the ostracized” (Holt, 1962) — the beginning of modern psychology’s renewed interest in consciousness. Holt, among many others, hoped for a cognitive theory that would include the full range of phenomenological and clinical studies of imagistic states along with a laboratory science of imagery.

These have been understood as a reconstitution on the level of symbolic cognition of presence-openness as the basic structure of perception in motile sentient creatures. Horizonal openness and the flow gradients of the ambient array are “real,” “existent,” and inherent to the structure of sentience, but would only be realized as such, as felt meaning for its own sake, on the human level.

  Abstract: We have begun to consider consciousness in terms of its “with” — as the socially shared forms of awareness in self-referential symbolic beings. In addition, since symbolic cognition reuses the here-there, whence-whither dimensions of the array, this human “with” extends into the envelope of flow shared by all sentient motile beings. It remains to turn our attention back toward the “in” of consciousness. Human consciousness is inseparable from a being-in-the-world. The life worlds of sentient creatures are also “in” the physical universe as understood by modern physical science. Accordingly, we would expect the being of sentient creatures to be broadly<br>

Vedanta and aspects of Buddhism picture a “unified field” comprising physical reality and consciousness, both of them based on minute particle energies in vibration. The difference, of course, is that even the most speculative of physicists, who understand consciousness as a subatomic quantum reality, are nonetheless deriving mind from the principles of the physical universe.

  Book Title: Philosophy of Communication-  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Butchart Garnet C.<br>
  Abstract: To philosophize is to communicate philosophically. From its inception, philosophy has communicated forcefully. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle talk a lot, and talk ardently. Because philosophy and communication have belonged together from the beginning--and because philosophy comes into its own and solidifies its stance through communication--it is logical that we subject communication to philosophical investigation. This collection of key works of classical, modern, and contemporary philosophers brings communication back into philosophy's orbit. It is the first anthology to gather in a single volume foundational works that address the core questions, concepts, and problems of communication in philosophical terms. The editors have chosen thirty-two selections from the work of Plato, Leibniz, Hegel, Husserl, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Benjamin, Lacan, Derrida, Sloterdijk, and others. They have organized these texts thematically, rather than historically, in seven sections: consciousness; intersubjective understanding; language; writing and context; difference and subjectivity; gift and exchange; and communicability and community. Taken together, these texts not only lay the foundation for establishing communication as a distinct philosophical topic but also provide an outline of what philosophy of communication might look like.<br>

His omnipresence in current memory studies owes much to the work of Jan Assmann, himself the author of a classic work on memory theory.

  Abstract: The affective in dance grows out of its lived ground, a ground that is present in all forms of dance, regardless of whether the dance is performed for others or not. The aesthetically affective arises (in any dance) when the lived ground, the full body consciousness, is vitalized. It is thus that I may actualize the aesthetic when I take pleasure in my dance for myself, but I am not engaged in dance as art until my dance is expressed for others and its aesthetic values are realized between us.<br>

  Book Title: Black Intersectionalities-A Critique for the 21st Century<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rocchi Jean-Paul<br>
  Abstract: Black Intersectionalities: A Critique for the 21st Century explores the complex interrelationships between race, gender, and sex as these are conceptualised within contemporary thought. Markers of identity are too often isolated and presented as definitive, then examined and theorised, a process that further naturalises their absoluteness; thus socially generated constructs become socialising categories that assume coercive power. The resulting set of oppositions isolate and delimit: male or female, black or white, straight or gay. A new kind of intervention is needed, an intervention that recognises the validity of the researcher’s own self-reflexivity. Focusing on the way identity is both constructed and constructive, the collection examines the frameworks and practices that deny transgressive possibilities. It seeks to engage in a consciousness raising exercise that documents the damaging nature of assigned social positions and either/or identity constructions. It seeks to progress beyond the socially prescribed categories of race, gender and sex, recognising the need to combine intellectualization and feeling, rationality and affectivity, abstraction and emotion, consciousness and desire. It seeks to develop new types of transdisciplinary frameworks where subjective and political spaces can be universalized while remaining particular, leaving texts open so that identity remains imagined, plural, and continuously shifting. Such an approach restores the complexity of what it means to be human.<br>

  Abstract: Until recently, the issue of the nature of consciousness was almost exclusively in the hands of philosophers. As the various sciences of the mind progress and accumulate new data, more empirical light is being shed on the phenomenon of consciousness (see, for example, Velmans 1991; Dennett and Kinsbourne 1992; Lahav 1993; Marcel and Bisiach 1988). Although we are still at a very early stage of the scientific understanding of the human mind, I think that the attempt to examine what current scientific knowledge can tell us about that phenomenon is worthwhile.<br>

  7.1  On the Difficulty of Keeping Consciousness Intact: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkgzz">Mindscapes</a><br>
  Author(s) Carrier Martin<br>
  Abstract: The aim of Lahav’s paper is to secure a home for consciousness. This home should rest on scientific foundations and at the same time accommodate the philosophical intuitions traditionally associated with this notion. I am fully sympathetic to this project, and I believe that Lahav’s approach is interesting and viable. Lahav argues for an account of consciousness that identifies conscious mental events by the role they play in the cognitive architecture, that is, functionally. What he rejects is a qualitybased view of consciousness according to which conscious mental events are distinguished by some internal qualitative property.<br>

  11  Supervenience, Emergence, and Realization in the Philosophy of Mind from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkgzz">Mindscapes</a><br>
  Author(s) Kim Jaegwon<br>
  Abstract: How is the mental related to the physical? Answering this question is the mind-body problem. The three concepts that have often and prominently been invoked in recent discussions of the mind-body problem are those of “supervenience,” “emergence,” and “realization.” Some have claimed that mentality—in particular, consciousness and intentionality, are “emergent properties,” properties that emerge from complex configurations of physical/biological events and yet are irreducible to them. In the heyday of positivism and reductionism, emergentism used to be ridiculed as an example of unsavory pseudo-scientific doctrines, not quite as disreputable as, say, neo-vitalism, with its entelechies or

  Book Title: Contemporary Culture-New Directions in Art and Humanities Research<br>
  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zijlmans Kitty<br>
  Abstract: Are the humanities still relevant in the twenty-first century? In the context of pervasive economic liberalism and shrinking budgets, the importance of humanities research for society is increasingly put into question. This volume claims that the humanities do indeed matter by offering empirically grounded critical reflections on contemporary cultural practices, thereby opening up new ways of understanding social life and new directions in humanities scholarship. The contributors argue that the humanities can regain their relevance for society, pose new questions and provide fresh answers, while maintaining their core values: critical reflection, historical consciousness and analytical distance.<br>

  Author(s) Seifrid Thomas<br>
  Abstract: What I mean to indicate by my somewhat cryptic title is a certain tension or distance, perhaps introduced by our retrospective gaze but possibly present in Shpet's thought itself, between two different kinds of philosophical projects that unfold within his works: between, on the one hand, Shpet's several insightful theorizations on the nature of semiotic phenomena and their role in human culture; and, on the other, a project that is present throughout but less evident, which I would briefly summarize as an attempt to elaborate a model of selfhood that is grounded in linguistic consciousness and to establish its ontological<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wr0tj">Out of the Margins</a><br>
  Abstract: The rise of written vernacular as a new literary language, in China as in the West, was inevitably the result of a long process of the interaction and interpenetration between the forces of written culture and those of orality and of a gradual confluence of literary consciousness with oral sensibilities.¹ In the cultural context of early premodern China, the persistent transmission and textualization of the
                  Shuihustory cycles was a major part of the interface between oral and written traditions. With modern knowledge on the nature of oral culture and the relationship between orality and writing, we can now pay<br>

  Author(s) Min Anselm Kyongsuk<br>
  Abstract: As we speak of reunification, North and South, as we Koreans have been increasingly doing in recent years, it is crucial to approach the issue comprehensively by considering as many dimensions of its challenge as we can, rather than narrowly focusing on immediate political issues. Reunification requires more than the establishment of a single government on the peninsula; it demands a long period of preparation and adjustment as well. It demands not only the unification of political, military, and economic systems and institutions but also the elimination of those elements of national consciousness that militate against reunification in many areas<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wr2rg">Christianity in Korea</a><br>
  Author(s) Kim Byong-suh<br>
  Abstract: Sociological studies have often found that institutional disorganization and the loss of the social function of religion may occur when society becomes modernized. Peter Berger summed it up thus: “The impact of modernity on religion is commonly seen in terms of the process of secularization, which can be described as one in which religion loses its hold on the level both of institutions and of human consciousness.”¹ Berger’s harsh assessment may well describe the state of the Korean Protestant church today. For the last forty years, a startling wave of modernization accompanied by industrialization, urbanization, and rapid social mobility have<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wrcc6">From Darkness To Light</a><br>
  Abstract: THE 1920S BOLSHEVIKS sought to turn the universities into “construction sites” for the fabrication of the New Man. The young state was determined to have the institutions of higher education function as the meeting place of the working class and its consciousness. Inevitably, the old intelligentsia proved an obstacle, insisting on civic liberties, occupying the universities, and refusing to turn them over to the proletariat. Lenin set the tone for the Bolshevik enterprise when he summarily rejected the idea that education could be indifferent to class. “The very term ‘apolitical,’” he said in November 1920, “is a piece of bourgeois<br>

  Chapter Five  The Odd Triangle: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rrpr">Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher</a><br>
  Abstract: From Augustine to our own era, introspection is inextricable from “self-consciousness,” which in turn is integral to and, in some sense, coincident with various understandings of selfhood. Simply, self-consciousness is enacted through self-reflexivity, and in this process of self-awareness, identity emerges. But the word “reflexivity” has a more circumscribed history. Reflexivity appears as a paradigm of understanding the self during the early modern period, coincident with the preoccupation with optics and the birth of a new physics of light. “Reflexivity” was first applied to cognitive introspection, in referring to “thought as bending back upon itself,” in the 1640s, when theologians,<br>

  Chapter Six  Who Is the Subject? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rrpr">Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher</a><br>
  Abstract: Freud’s thinking about the ego combines several formulations, which begin with early modernist principles. In some sense, he draws an alliance with Descartes’s meditation, “I am a thinking thing,” as the “true” center of his identity. Indeed, the modernist endeavor to define personal identity begins by recognizing that the self cannot be derived, but instead, the Cartesian
                  cogitans—the end point of the skeptic’s query—serves as the starting point of self-consciousness.¹ Accordingly, to the extent that “identity” has a definition in the Freudian universe, it must be that which can be identified; that is, the conscious ego examines and<br>

  Abstract: MY TITLE intends no metaphor in its linking of language and economy. Words, as social instruments, exemplifying what Marx calls “practical consciousness,”¹ act upon a reality which they make as much as find. If the real is in a real sense made through words, those words needs must tend to complexity, not least because speakers inherit a language always “already occupied”² by prior and unknown users and usage. Since verbal instrumentalists work with a partially known instrument, and in circumstances not of their own design, they, to adapt Marx, are practically unconscious concerning large portions of their practice.

  Abstract: There is more to be said about the status of history in Sri Lanka than to call it a disposition toward the past, cultivated by a monastic scholarly tradition concerned with chronology and chronicles, and favored by Sinhala Buddhists. There is a shade to history that was introduced into South Asia as part and parcel of European colonialism which has had its different and differentiating effects on South Asians. Most significantly, I believe, colonialism hybridized what I shall now qualify as traditional historic consciousness, which was part of “a way of being in” the world, with a modern¹ European historical<br>

  CHAPTER 6  “Routes/Roots”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7t6x1">Mappings</a><br>
  Abstract: Thinking geopolitically about identity is a “spatial practice,” to echo Michel de Certeau in
                  The Practice of Everyday Life. It involves maps and mapping, routes and routing, borders and bordercrossings. As a form of relational spatialization, however, it incorporates the opposing dimensions of the homonym routes/roots. Traveling is a concept that depends upon the notion of stasis to be comprehensible. Routes are pathways between here and there, two points of rootedness. Identity often requires some form of displacement—literal or figurative—to come to consciousness. Leaving home brings into being the idea of “home,” the perception of its identity as<br>

  CHAPTER FIVE  The Meta-utopian Language Problem, or Utopia as a Bump on a -log- from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztgwq">Russian Experimental Fiction</a><br>
  Abstract: That language and consciousness are intimately bound up with one another is a commonplace. How they interact is harder to ascertain. Post-Saussurian literary theorists claim perhaps too much for the priority of language over consciousness.¹ Philosophers concerned with this issue, such as Nietzsche or Wittgenstein, also acknowledge the impact of language on consciousness but stress the restrictions that linguistic structures and functions put on thinking. For example, in
                  Tractatus Logico-PhilosophicusWittgenstein writes: “The limits of my languagemean the limits of my world.”² Perhaps these restrictions are best characterized by tautology, the ultimate, absurd limit of language, an indication of<br>

  CHAPTER SIX  Meta-utopian Consciousness from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztgwq">Russian Experimental Fiction</a><br>
  Abstract: A consideration of consciousness provides an appropriate end point for understanding the interaction between aesthetic experiment and ideological critique in meta-utopian fiction. In its challenge to exclusivist modes of social imagination and practice there emerges in this art a different mentality characterized by an insistence on balancing public and private modes of discourse, a love of ideological play, and an acknowledgment of the thinking, discerning person. The meta-utopian consciousness is built on a distinction between apparent ideological differences (for example, the looking-glass war between modes of realism) and significant valuative oppositions and choices (for example, between didactic and ludic art,<br>

Precisely where the structuralist enterprise attempts to usurp the task of hermeneutics, as Paul Ricoeur points out, it oversteps its limits as a science.¹ On the other hand, philosophies of language that begin from the thinking subject and postulate a prelinguistic consciousness<br>

  Abstract: Whiteside shows how Merleau-Ponty overcame these problems by grounding political reasoning in a theory of consciousness that emphasized both its individuality and its need for socially created meaning. After explaining Merleau-Ponty's modifications of the views of Sartre, Aron, and others, the book investigates how he applied his political theory in editorial exchanges with Communists and liberals. Throughout this study, Whiteside traces and criticizes the changes in the philosopher's concept of Marxism and points to his many ideas that bear on current controversies in political theory.<br>

  Abstract: The Skeptic Dispositionwas written in the early eighties during the heyday of deconstruction and reader-centered criticism. The scene has changed, but the critical orientation represented by these “movements” has not disappeared. Rather it has been sublimated and to an extent transformed in the “ideology critique” that dominates literary studies at this moment. The most enduring effect of deconstruction has been the subversion of all universalist or foundationalist claims to truth. In the Marxist canon, ideology has as one of its principal meanings “false consciousness,” which is a kind of universalizing thought that conceals the particular, self-interested (class) motives that<br>

  Book Title: Neverending Stories-Toward a Critical Narratology<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tatar Maria<br>
  Abstract: In these compelling new essays, leading critics sharpen our understanding of the narrative structures that convey meaning in fiction, taking as their point of departure the narratological positions of Dorrit Cohn, Grard Genette, and Franz Stanzel. This collection demonstrates how narratology, with its attention to the modalities of presenting consciousness, offers a point of entry for scholars investigating the socio-cultural dimensions of literary representations. Drawing from a wide range of literary texts, the essays explore the borderline between fiction and history; explain how characters are constructed by both author and reader through the narration of consciousness; show how gender shapes narrative strategies ranging from the depiction of consciousness through intertextuality to the representation of the body; address issues of contingency in narrative; and present a debate on the crucial function of person in the literary text. The contributors are Stanley Corngold, Gail Finney, Kte Hamburger, Paul Michael Ltzeler, David Mickelsen, John Neubauer, Thomas Pavel, Jens Rieckmann, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, Judith Ryan, Franz Stanzel, Susan Suleiman, Maria Tatar, David Wellbery, and Larry Wolff.<br>

  Abstract: Investigating autobiographical writing of Mary McCarthy, Henry James, Jean-Paul Sartre, Saul Friedlander, and Maxine Hong Kingston, this book argues that autobiographical truth is not a fixed but an evolving content in a process of self-creation. Further, Paul John Eakin contends, the self at the center of all autobiography is necessarily fictive. Professor Eakin shows that the autobiographical impulse is simply a special form of reflexive consciousness: from a developmental viewpoint, the autobiographical act is a mode of self-invention always practiced first in living and only eventually, and occasionally, in writing.<br>

The following discussion is limited to a description of two distinct models of explanation, the “scientific” or “covering law” model and the historical or “processive” model and an analysis of how these two models are ‘parodied’ respectively by Shaw and Proust in their particular acts as writers, their philosophic acts of explanation.<br>

At the very begining, it was said that the transition from possibility to actuality occurs only as the “leap” of freedom. But before freedom could be described, it was necessary to analyse its precursors: angst, reflection, and consciousness. And a brief preliminary summary of some aspects of freedom was required in order to clarify the nature of angst. Now those aspects must be explored and exposited in detail.

  Book Title: Philosophy of Merleau-Ponty-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Matthews Eric<br>
  Abstract: In this clear and comprehensive account of Merleau-Ponty's thought Eric Matthews shows how Merleau-Ponty has contributed to current debates in philosophy, such as the nature of consciousness, the relation between biology and personality, the historical understanding of human thought and society, and many others. Surveying the whole range of Merleau-Ponty's thinking, Matthews examines his views about the nature of phenomenology and the primacy of perception; his account of human embodiment, being-in-the-world, and the understanding of human behaviour; his conception of the self and its relation to other selves; and his views on society, politics, and the arts. A final chapter considers his later thought, published posthumously. The ideas of Merleau-Ponty are of immensely important to the development of modern French philosophy. Matthews evaluates his distinctive contributions and relates his thought to that of his predecessors, contemporaries, and successors, both in France and elsewhere. This unrivalled introduction will be welcomed by analytic philosophers and cognitive scientists as well as all students taking courses in contemporary continental philosophy.<br>

He died, after all, in 1961, at a time when the social and cultural situation and the preoccupations of philosophers were very different from those of the end of the twentieth century and the beginning of a new millennium. Is he not simply a representative of a now outmoded “humanism”, a philosophy of the “subject” and of the phenomenology of consciousness?

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qcpp5">Dark Traces of the Past</a><br>
  Author(s) Straub Jürgen<br>
  Abstract: The relationship between historical studies and psychoanalysis remains a concern that is open and full of tensions, in both a positive and negative sense. Particularly the question, what would distinguish a psychoanalytically oriented study of historical realities and the consciousness involved with these realities—that is a historical psychoanalysis—upon which this present volume focuses, has not been satisfactorily answered. Scepticism and fear of contact dominate on both sides. Here and there ignorance prevails, and at times there is a definite sense of helplessness concerning how a productive dialogue could even be initiated between historical studies and psychoanalysis, given the<br>

  Author(s) Straub Jürgen<br>
  Abstract: It seems certain today that the term “present” encompasses far more than a merely present identity of the self. Assuming that present time equals pure presence, and stating thereby that it be nothing more than itself, means to underestimate—or neglect—Edmund Husserl’s² differentiation of

  Author(s) Irving Andrew<br>
  Abstract: From a distance it may seem that the dialogue between money and imagination is located in mind, consciousness and cognitive capacity rather than materiality and body. Indeed, the material body of money is seen as less important than the semiotic value attached to certain objects by way of the brain’s ability to invest substance with meaning and purpose. ‘Money’ – suggests Norman O. Brown – ‘is inorganic dead matter which has been made alive’ (1970 [1959]:245). The discarded bodies of different material substances, often with little practical utility, such as clay, shells, teeth, stones, paper and beads are brought to<br>

  Author(s) Marchand Trevor H.J.<br>
  Abstract: Despite anthropology’s long-standing fascination with the spaces and places of people’s lives, Gupta and Ferguson rightly identified a surprising lack of ‘self-consciousness about the issue of space in anthropological theory’ (1997b:33). In general, space has been dismissed as a preexisting natural category within which societies are distributed and humans are politically, economically and socially organized: in other words, an infinite three-dimensional emptiness containing bounded places. Euclidean notions of space as homogenous and extensible have permitted passive contemplation of a distanced ‘there’, safely separated and reified as a static entity rather than a changing and socially contingent phenomenon. Until recent decades,<br>

  Abstract: In

But fascinating above all since for most Western readers Ghosh’s book will be like the exploration of a strange and unknown territory.

I presented the vignettes with little commentary, almost like pictures at an exhibition, but I also intended that they should serve to introduce the ethnography’s theoretical aim: to provide, by means of narratives, ‘portraits’ and elicitations, a concrete demonstration of people’s strategies as they negotiate their social world and their own place within it.

  Abstract: One of Thomas Bernhard’s most historically specific plays,
                  Vor dem Ruhestand(Eve of Retirement, 1979) is also one of his most ritualistic. A play of “doubleness” and unsynthesizable tensions, it is both realistic and metaphoric, structured both causally and cyclically. Steeped in public history, it simultaneously ritualizes history through private memory. This doubleness—the coexistence of historical and ahistorical consciousness, of development and stasis, time and timelessness—is, no doubt, central to Bernhard’s work as a whole; and it is knowingly, indeed pointedly used by Bernhard in this play to both reflect and implicate the history and memory of his<br>

  Abstract: From the beginning, Freudian psychoanalysis stood apart from other theories of the unconscious in relating the emergence of unconscious mental formations directly back to events and fantasies that shaped the mind in childhood. Freud decisively rejected all metaphysical and dialectical accounts of the emergence of consciousness from a nebulous unconscious (theories which had their roots in the idealism of Hegel, Schelling and Schopenhauer). He rejected Breuer’s claim (derived from the Janet school) that the presence of ‘hypnoid’ dissociative states was a necessary condition for the repression of a representation.

Apparently, “Baba” (an endearing term that people used for Muktananda that means “Father”) could, by simply touching people, catapult them into another realm of consciousness.

  Book Title: Externalism-Putting Mind and World Back Together Again<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Rowlands Mark<br>
  Abstract: The externalist conception of the mind was one of the most significant developments in the philosophy of mind in the second half of the twentieth century. Despite its central importance, however, most recent work on externalism has been very technical, often making the basic ideas and principles difficult for students to grasp. As well, comparatively little work has been done to situate externalism in the history of philosophy, in either analytic and continental traditions. Mark Rowlands remedies both these problems, presenting a clear and accessible introduction to externalism that is grounded in wider developments in the history of philosophy. Rowlands discusses Sartre's radical reversal of idealism and the Husserlian views that prompted it; Wittgenstein's attack on the assimilation of meaning and understanding to an inner process; Putnam's and Burge's thought experiments and the externalism about content to which those experiments gave rise; the scope and limits of content externalism; and the extension of externalism to consciousness.<br>

  CHAPTER 5  The attack on the inner from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.cttq46qk">Externalism</a><br>
  Abstract: Sartre’s attack on the idea that consciousness has contents is, in effect, an attack on the idea that the mental possesses features that are hidden, inner and constituted or revealed by the individual’s inwardly directed awareness. This attack is continued by the Austrian philosopher, Ludwig wittgenstein.¹ Although developing wide-ranging arguments concerning mentality in general, the focus of Wittgenstein’s concern is items such as meaning and understanding – meaning something by one’s use of a sign and understanding something by way of someone else’s (or indeed your) use of a sign. Accordingly, I shall focus, at least initially, on these.<br>

  Abstract: We begin by summarizing what we said yesterday. The first and fundamental point was that the analysis of human development in terms of spontaneous operations that become differentiated, combinations of differentiated operations, the grouping of combinations of differentiated operations, and finally the grouping of groups, runs into a limit. The dynamism of consciousness leads to a differentiation between operations that regard the ultimate – religious acts, the activities we perform when we say Mass, meditate, recite the breviary – and on the other hand the activities of studying and teaching, of eating and recreation. They tend to form – and the more they<br>

  Author(s) STRAWSER MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: The ‘signature narrative thesis’ serves particularly well in explaining how personal identity gets constituted through one’s reflective consciousness or understanding, although it leaves open the question of how reflective consciousness itself is constituted (cf. Davenport 2012: 2–3). Is the ‘self’ identical to the narrative form of a person’s understanding, or is there a deeper self than that which emerges on the reflective level? In contrast to this narrative view, according to recent scholarship the phenomenological tradition unanimously affirms that the core self is to be found in pre-reflective consciousness. Further, Kierkegaard has not only been suggested to be significant<br>

  Abstract: Between the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a transition occurred in modern fiction as writers became increasingly reliant on the visual. In his study
                  Fiction and the Camera Eye, Alan Spiegel argues that this new visual consciousness in the novel was symptomatic of the shift from a theological to a scientific understanding of the world, meaning that, in modern fiction, ‘truth’ can only be revealed through sensory experience rather than authorial intervention.¹ In an uncertain modern world, Spiegel suggests, an author is no longer an authority; the common practice of pausing action in the novel to allow for exposition was<br>

  Abstract: The novel appearance of
                  al-ʿarabin Umayyad-era poetry as a term of self-reference points decisively to the period when ideas of Arab communal consciousness gained wide acceptance to articulate a shared identity, but the verses alone do not explain why early Muslims during the later first/seventh century chose the name ‘Arab’ to identify themselves. The wordal-ʿarabappeared as an understood byword for the large collective – but where did early Muslims find the word and why did it become their ethnonym? These questions are important because peoples’ choice to identify as ‘Arabs’ would not have been idle: Arabness replaced<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1bh2j7h">Imagining the Arabs</a><br>
  Abstract: Thus far, we have traced the sociopolitical drivers of Arab ethnogenesis to the second/eighth century, and we found that the exceptional conditions of early Islam fostered a new idea of ‘Arab community’ as a means for Conquerors to uphold their elite status once the initial burst of conquests had passed. The Conquerors’ towns (
                  al-amṣār) bear striking parallels to the conditions which catalyse ethnogenesis, but the process of creating shared consciousness of Arab community was nonetheless uneven as a consequence of various obstacles impeding the capacity of Arabness to reconcile the Conquerors into one integrated family.

  Abstract: Western philosophy has had a continuous engagement with the problem of subjectivity and with the self as a locus of both consciousness and experience – a question that is deemed to be open to understanding, analysis and philosophical reflection – ever since the first moments of institutional philosophy in Ancient Greece. The notion of the self has been an object of inquiry, a problem and a locus for posing questions concerning knowledge, action and ethics since Antiquity. Plato and Aristotle in different ways inquired of the self in terms that we understand today as personhood and personal identity, viewing the<br>

  Abstract: Aesthetics is one of the most intellectually stimulating and enriching fields of philosophical inquiry. This statement may sound a bit strange to anyone who is easily impressed by the longevity of ancient metaphysical problems or by the cutting-edge verve of recent empirically informed debates in the theory of consciousness, or by the applicative promise and popular demand of business ethics, and so tends to dismiss aesthetics as peripheral to philosophy. Yet, as Frank Sibley, one of the important early analytic aestheticians of the twentieth century, has observed, aestheticians encounter ranges of concepts wider than and inevitably inclusive of those studied<br>

  Author(s) Cronin Ciaran<br>
  Abstract: The adjective ‘unconscious’ designates a quality that can be found in psychical processes such as imagining, remembering, thinking, feeling, desiring, wishing and acting. The processes which exhibit this quality differ from those with the quality ‘conscious’ in that the former are not present in the current field of consciousness but nevertheless remain psychologically effective, indeed, often far more so than the processes which have the quality of being conscious. The substantive, the ‘unconscious’, expresses the fact that psychological phenomena are not confined in principle to conscious experiences but are profoundly shaped by unconscious forces. In psychoanalysis, this concept also designates<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, I argue that Sartre’s philosophical system instigates the ontology of ‘pure’ immanence that underpins micropolitics and that is carried forward by Merleau-Ponty, Foucault and Deleuze. But is there indeed such a thing as a Sartrean system, a total

  Abstract: The previous chapters open a set of questions about the relationship between time and self-consciousness, an axis which has received too little attention within literary studies.¹ This neglect is all the more surprising since the idea of self-consciousness itself has played such a central role in the characterisation not only of contemporary fiction but of the more general social and discursive condition of the contemporary world. In prolepsis, we find on one hand a kind of temporal self-distance – a form of reflection which involves looking back on the present, from one’s own point of view or that of another – and<br>

  Abstract: When it comes to the internal consciousness of time, the novel picks up where philosophy leaves off. But does the novel therefore 
                  know something about time which is beyond the reach of philosophy? Perhaps knowledge of time is in some way the domain of philosophy, so that wherever it is that the novel goes with time, by being beyond the limits of philosophy, it cannot be an adventure in knowledge as such. There are two intimately related questions about knowledge involved in this. The first is the oldest question of all, the question of the relationship between philosophy and literature,<br>

  Abstract: The argument about the relationship between time and narrative is now coming into focus. It begins in the Kantian notion that we have no access to things in themselves, but only, as phenomenology holds, to things as they are experienced, apprehended in consciousness, thought about, or understood. But the concept of consciousness cannot be taken for granted. Philosophy in general, both in the phenomenological and in the Anglo-American analytical traditions, has turned to language in order to investigate the realms of experience, perception, thought and understanding. If consciousness is fundamentally linguistic, it follows that we ought to be able to<br>

Ideas exist in juxtaposition, contradicting each other at certain levels and complementing at others. The exploration of the interrelationship between these planes and layers of culture, as well as those of consciousness and selfhood, are what fuels art and literature and what occupies the psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of our culture is still the irresistible promise of Enlightenment rationality: that the world is there to be explained and bettered. The raw<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, we have looked at some themes concerning the role of consciousness in thinking differently. To similarly examine the role of the unconscious and nonconscious is, however, more problematic. The lack of insight we have into our mental life below the conscious level, and the seeming antithesis between mental functioning at such levels and social structures, makes the mapping of the former to the latter difficult. The problem has, however, already been addressed by theorists who have attempted to unpack the Freudian unconscious in political terms and it will be useful to canvas such attempts before moving<br>

This may still leave us with the uneasy feeling that something the ‘given’ was meant to suggest has dropped out of our story, namely, the way in which our perceptions and especially our bodily sensations are not only what we

These intentional objects of consciousness are themselves mutually constituted by the perspectives of subjects so that the world and the subject are interdependent. The subjectivity involved here is expressed in a body whose comportment towards the world maps the shape the world takes for the subject and thereby maps the content of such subjectivity itself.<br>

  Book Title: The Lacanian Left-Psychoanalysis, Theory, Politics<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stavrakakis Yannis<br>
  Abstract: In recent years psychoanalysis – especially Lacanian theory – has been gradually acknowledged as a vital resource in the ongoing re-orientation of contemporary political theory and analysis. Of particular note is that the work of Jacques Lacan is increasingly being used by major political philosophers associated with the Left. This indicates the dynamic emergence of a new theoretico-political horizon: that of the ‘Lacanian Left’. However, this has yet to be properly conceived and structured as a field. The Lacanian Left is the first book to bring it into academic consciousness and to draw its implications for concrete political analysis in a systematic way. It offers:• An accessible mapping of its main contours. • A detailed examination of the points of convergence and divergence between the major figures active or at the periphery of this terrain, including Slavoj h the central Lacanian notion of ‘enjoyment’, The Lacanian Left puts forward innovative analyses of political power and authority, nationalism, European identity, consumerism and advertising culture, de-democratisation and post-democracy. It will be of value to everyone interested in exploring the potential of psychoanalysis to reinvigorate political theory, critical political analysis and democratic politics.<br>

In 1977, Robert Champigny published a philosophical study of mystery stories titled
                  What Will Have Happened, a tense form that creates a conjunction between a prospective present and the retrospective future. Speaking of the investigative sequence of a mystery story or detective fiction, what makes aesthetic sense for Champigny ‘is<br>

A foundational argument here is Roman Ingarden’s discussion of temporal perspective in

  Abstract: Joseph Conrad’s reputation predominantly rests on his proto-modernist exploration of the individual male consciousness. Throughout his fiction, protagonists such as Charlie Marlow, Lord Jim, Razumov and Axel Heyst are preoccupied with (frequently failed) quests for identity, isolated figures grappling with a troubled psychology, trying to make sense of their situation in a hostile or unwelcoming community. In this context, parties (other than political ones) do not immediately spring to mind as familiar locations or sources for Conrad’s narratives, and when they do occur they are not always markers of social harmony in his work.¹ His emphasis on the relationship between<br>

S.

  Abstract: What does Gadamer mean by his claim that ‘art addresses us’? It is a signature claim of philosophical hermeneutics and follows directly upon Gadamer’s assertion of the phenomenological priority of meaning in the experience of art. Not only does this emphasise Gadamer’s dialogical approach to art but it is the culmination of his critique of aesthetic subjectivism. By asserting the primacy of meaning, philosophical hermeneutics affirms the ontic priority of those cultural horizons which shape a spectator’s consciousness and in which he or she must partake as a precondition of achieving transformed understanding. However, a central question remains unavoidable: what<br>

  Abstract: The controversy is severe; provocative research is evolving rapidly—and for the humanities the stakes are higher than usual. To the study of cultural history and the teaching and criticism of imaginative literature, this revolution under way in the neurosciences is not just another chance to play with terminology and imperfectly understood perspectives borrowed from other disciplines. With potential to destabilize and transform so many commonplace assumptions about the nature of thinking and the dynamics of consciousness, twenty-first-century neuroscience challenges basic conventions about the structure and continuity of the mind and the self, conventions that subtend not only everyday humanist<br>

  Book Title: Moving Consciously-Somatic Transformations through Dance, Yoga, and Touch<br>
  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Fraleigh Sondra<br>
  Abstract: The popularity of yoga and Zen meditation has heightened awareness of somatic practices. Individuals develop the conscious embodiment central to somatics work via movement and dance, or through touch from a skilled teacher or therapist often called a somatic bodyworker. Methods of touch and movement foster generative processes of consciousness in order to create a fluid interconnection between sensation, thought, movement, and expression. In Moving Consciously , Sondra Fraleigh gathers essays that probe ideas surrounding embodied knowledge and the conscious embodiment of movement and dance. Using a variety of perspectives on movement and dance somatics, Fraleigh and other contributors draw on scholarship and personal practice to participate in a multifaceted investigation of a thriving worldwide phenomenon. Their goal: to present the mental and physical health benefits of experiencing one's inner world through sensory awareness and movement integration. A stimulating addition to a burgeoning field, Moving Consciously incorporates concepts from East and West into a timely look at life-changing, intertwined practices that involve dance, movement, performance studies, and education.

  Abstract: Submerged in the marvel of breath and movement, soma is our tacit body of nature and primordial dance. Soma is not the body we see, but the body we experience. Thus to test experience, we can trace our somatic tendencies through dance. We become the dance and its record, viable in psychology of form and perception. We cultivate consciousness and memory in the ways we move, registering correlative emotional attunements. We absolutely cannot escape the

                  Creative Evolution(on account of its movement being oneappliedto still images rather than being immanent to them), Deleuze correctly realizes how central the moving image nonetheless is to Bergson’s philosophy. Yet this is clear in Bergson’s own testimonies: “When I first saw the cinematograph I realized it could offer something new to philosophy. Indeed we could almost say that cinema is a model of consciousness itself. Going to the cinema turns out to be a philosophical experience.”²<br>

When people vegetate persistently, their brainstems keep basic functions going (circulation, respiration, digestion) but they do not display what we generally like to think of as consciousness: they are considered alive and cannot be killed/let die without a lot of legal wrangling, but they do not demonstrate critical kinds of awareness or independent capability.

  Abstract: To grasp the paradox of instant and flux in moving images could be compared to the vain attempt in philosophy to locate the instant within the flow of consciousness. Identifying the paradoxical instant is therefore a problem where the phenomenology of time meets with classical attempts to specify the ontology of cinema. Attempts at identifying this paradoxical instant have resulted in describing both film in analogy with human perception and film in analogy with machine perception beyond and independent of the subject. In this chapter I will depart from the point of intersection between phenomenology and cinema, which illuminates the<br>

What Kath Weston has called the “time claims” of our world-historical moment dictate, in part, our sense of self, and our own sense of time shapes those claims in turn.¹We act on time, and time acts on us.

Scientists from any discipline are all the more willing to make fun of his naïveté because his discourse makes claims to rigor. Either that or the philosopher simply abdicates in the face of scientific advances and reproduces in his own way the reductionist, even eliminationist naturalism that positivist knowledge makes available to him. In which case he can no longer even be a philosopher, for he is only vulgarizing by acquiescing to fatalistic determinism.<br>

  Author(s) NEVES MARCELO<br>
  Abstract: Like Talcott Parsons and Niklas Luhmann, Habermas holds that social evolution entails heightened system complexity (
                  Communicative Action,2:155ff.). Unlike his colleagues, however, he affirms that increases in social complexity are mediated by a “developmental logic” whose structure corresponds to the way moral consciousness evolves in stages (esp.Communicative Action, 2:174ff.;Evolution, 69 94, 95 129;Rekonstruktion, 129 143;Moral Consciousness). Contra Luhmann’s (1975, 2003) systems theory, Habermas argues that mounting complexity and the social differentiation that accompanies it depend on “learning mechanisms.” In this sense, his position is that differentiation can represent either “evolutionary processes” or stagnation (Rekonstruktion, 133–134, 230;<br>

  Abstract: François Hartog explores crucial moments of change in society's "regimes of historicity," or its ways of relating to the past, present, and future. Inspired by Hannah Arendt, Reinhart Koselleck, and Paul Ricoeur, Hartog analyzes a broad range of texts, positioning

He tracks changing perspectives on time in Chateaubriand'sHistorical EssayandTravels in Americaand sets them alongside other writings from the French Revolution. He revisits the insights of the French Annales School and situates Pierre Nora'sRealms of Memorywithin a history of heritage and today's presentism, from which he addresses Jonas's notion of our responsibility for the future.<br>

  Abstract: Drawing on Immanuel Kant's and Hannah Arendt's ideas about reflective judgment, Lara argues that narrative plays a key role in helping societies acknowledge their pasts. Particular stories haunt our consciousness and lead to a kind of examination and dialogue that shape notions of morality. A powerful description of a crime can act as a filter, helping us to draw conclusions about what constitutes a moral wrong, and public debates over these narratives allow us to construct a more accurate picture of historical truth, leading to a better understanding of why such actions are possible.<br>

  Author(s): BASSO ELLEN B.<br>
  Abstract: An especially comprehensive study of Brazilian Amazonian Indian history, The Last Cannibals is the first attempt to understand, through indigenous discourse, the emergence of Upper Xingú society. Drawing on oral documents recorded directly from the native language, Ellen Basso transcribes and analyzes nine traditional Kalapalo stories to offer important insights into Kalapalo historical knowledge and the performance of historical narratives within their nonliterate society. This engaging book challenges the familiar view of biography as a strictly Western literary form. Of special interest are biographies of powerful warriors whose actions led to the emergence of a more recent social order based on restrained behaviors from an earlier time when people were said to be fierce and violent. From these stories, Basso explores how the Kalapalo remember and understand their past and what specific linguistic, psychological, and ideological materials they employ to construct their historical consciousness. Her book will be important reading in anthropology, folklore, linguistics, and South American studies.<br>

  Abstract: Nineteenth-century Mexican architecture is widely recognized as eclectic. Especially from about 1880 to the first decade of the twentieth century, Mexican cities exhibited buildings of multiple stylistic tendencies, including neoclassical, Baroque, neo-Gothic, and art nouveau, indicative of a cosmopolitan consciousness. Sometimes an architect would employ various styles in a single edifice. As in the study of colonial Mexican architecture, scholars have attempted to classify the architecture of the period with little success: the buildings consistently elude traditional stylistic classifications.¹<br>

  Author(s) BARRATT ALEXANDRA<br>
  Abstract: Devotion to the Trinity was growing in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries: ‘In 1334 Pope John XXII set aside the first Sunday after Pentecost as Trinity Sunday. Increasing devotion to the Trinity can also be seen in the many prayers addressed to the Trinity’.¹ Theology, however, did not necessarily keep pace. In his study of the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, Thomas Marsh has claimed: ‘In spite of the formal, notional acknowledgement of the doctrine, a real understanding of God as Trinity practically disappeared from the Christian consciousness of the Middle Ages’.² This sweeping condemnation, however, ignores the notable contribution<br>

  Author(s) Burnett Jacob<br>
  Abstract: Franz Kafka (like the rest of us) faces the disappearance of the millennia-old Transcendent Center from European consciousness. In the absence he does not find cause for despair but from it discovers a new dimension of existence. Through the deployment of underlying narrative “strange loops” (to borrow a term from Douglas Hofstader), Kafka’s work, in particular 
                  The Castle (Das Schloss, 1926), constructs an art that can survive the disappearance of a grounding center. His novel is an endless stairway on which, discovering that we are not lamed by the absence of God, we walk briskly on to meet ourselves in<br>

  Book Title: Love Poetry in the Spanish Golden Age-Eros, Eris and Empire<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): TORRES ISABEL<br>
  Abstract: This work engages with a broader evaluation of early modern poetics that foregrounds the processes rather than the products of thinking. The locus of the study is the Imperial 'home' space, where love poetry meets early modern empire at the inception of a very conflicted national consciousness, and where the vernacular language, Castilian, emerges in the encounter as a strategic site of national and imperial identity. The political is, therefore, a pervasive presence, teased out where relevant in recognition of the poet's sensitivity to the ideologies within which writing comes into being. But the primary commitment of the book is to lyric poetry, and to poets, individually and in their dynamic interconnectedness. Moving beyond a re-evaluation of critical responses to four major poets of the period (Garcilaso de la Vega, Herrera, Góngora and Quevedo), this study disengages respectfully with the substantial body of biographical research that continues to impact upon our understanding of the genre, and renegotiates the Foucauldian concept of the 'epistemic break', often associated with the anti-mimetic impulses of the Baroque. This more flexible model accommodates the multiperspectivism that interrogated Imperial ideology even in the earliest sixteenth-century poetry, and allows for the exploration of new horizons in interpretation. Isabel Torres is Professor of Spanish Golden Age Literature and Head of Spanish and Portuguese Studies at Queen's University, Belfast.<br>

  Book Title: Love and Death in Goethe-`One and Double'<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Dye Ellis<br>
  Abstract: Goethe, in association with his younger Romantic compatriots the Schlegels, Novalis, Fichte, and Schelling, struggled with the subject-object dichotomy, and tried to bridge the gap between self and other, consciousness and nature. His theory and practice prefigured the Romantics' determination to display and interrogate the linguistic and cultural structures informing their own thinking and modes of representation--what Goethe calls one's "Vorstellungsart." His work exploits, subverts, and supplants inherited conventions and signs, demonstrating with virtuosic irony that literature is a system of texts, pre-texts, and pre-established but dynamic conceptual models. 'Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double"' explores Goethe's use, in a wide range of his poetry and prose, of the theme of 'Liebestod' (love and death) and related embodiments of the paradox of unity in duality. Ellis Dye also examines Goethe's use of other themes related to love and death--the 'femme fatale', the 'vagina dentata, Frau Welt', the Lorelei, venereal disease, the 'Lustmord' --and considers issues of selfhood and individuation as well as the possibility that the love-death theme contains an implicit gender bias toward the existential fact of personal separateness. Poems, plays, and novels are dealt with, nevertheless, as works of art, not only as illustrations of an idea or as points of intersection in a system of rhetorical conventions, and are examined for intellectual cohesiveness, elegance, and integrity of design as well as special meanings and effects. ' Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double" ' explores the meaning of the central theme of Romantic poetry in the works of the most important Romantic poet of all. Students of literary culture, both the lay reader and the Goethe specialist, will be enlightened by its approach and find pleasure and instruction in its revelations. Robert Ellis Dye is professor of German at Macalester College.<br>

  Abstract: In the dogged struggle between progressive and conservative forces that, in varying intensity, took place in every genre in French-Canadian literature during the time between the end of the First World War and the 1960s, poetry proved to be the driving force of innovation. It managed to overcome the ideology and aesthetic perceptions of the past and, until the beginning of the 1960s, became French Canada’s dominant genre.

  Abstract: If, for twentieth-century writers, the question of authorship and its relationship to the authority of a ‘writing subject’ has posed considerable problems, then writing the life of the self – encapsulated perfectly, if in reverse order, in the very term auto-bio-graphy – makes these issues even more acute. The practice of autobiography necessarily confers on the autobiographical text an implied truth value upon which the weight of contemporary theory since existentialism and structuralism has cast considerable doubt. Unmoored from the Cartesian certainties of consciousness, contemporary autobiography stages an interplay between facts and imaginative creativity, replacing the original ‘confessional’ status of<br>

It ranges from reasoned intellectual argument to the travel essay, specializing, as Philip Lopate puts it, in misadventure, to the personal essay, which constitutes, in Samuel Johnson’s felicitous phrase, ‘a loose sally of the mind’.² To essay is to test out a position, and the essayist, according to Theodor Adorno, writes in full consciousness of the fragmentary nature of his art, seeking a utopian illumination through its practice yet acutely aware that his gesture can only ever be provisional and incomplete.³ For Adorno, the essay’s incompleteness is a mark of subversive thought, a<br>

  Abstract: When applied to explicit or implicit (cognitive) statements about the “placement” of man in his environment, human rational faculties are often inadequate in the decipherment and revelation of an esoteric content. Humanity’s integrative roots with the universe and the creation of a graspable consciousness, as a means of orientation in time and/or space (in the concrete, but also in the dimension of ontological reality) embrace the totality of the past with the help of symbols, rituals, ceremonies and myths.

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: Theories are always, in some way, about their theorists. While Luhmann’s variant of mutant functionalism is not palatable to American tastes, his theories are as reflective of late‐20th‐century European sensibilities as Parsons’s were of mid‐20th‐century America or Bellah and Geertz’s of the upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, some art critics have warmed to Luhmann’s book as an exemplar of one of the newer “cool” theories of art; that is, those that challenge more subject‐centered and humanist theories and aim to accommodate the growth of new mediums such as digital art and cyberspace. But in any conception of art that includes culture, the medium is only as good as the meaning it conveys. And it is the meaning of art that is sorely lacking in Luhmann’s appraisal. Paul Ricoeur once wrote that “materialism is the truth of a world without truth.” It might then be said of Luhmann’s conception of the art system that it is the truth of art without meaning.<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”

Abstract: Scholars and their students interested in the field would do well to begin with these studies, despite some unevenness in period, place, and theme. Developments in the twentieth century, for example, are not well served, especially as their globalization bursts all traditional boundaries in the discipline, making a historical perspective essential to an understanding of ongoing transformations in literate life everywhere, not just in the West. Similarly, the absence of illustrations undermines the potential value of these books as introductions to the history of reading. Much of the work here depends on the material objects that readers actually had; without images of them, the reader develops less of a sense of the field. Finally, the exclusion of the essays on correspondence from the original collection is deeply regrettable; Chartier’s summary of their implications in the introduction hardly does justice to them, especially to the important study of the 1847 postal survey by Dauphin and two other colleagues. The translations are generally accurate, but the indexes are barely adequate.<br>

Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau. For reading the current essay, my particular thanks to Catherine Desbarats, Eric Jabbari, James Ron, and Michael Wasser, as well as to Tim Rowse, Desley Deacon, Ann Curthoys, and John Docker for helpful suggestions. I am of course solely responsible for the content. The research for this essay was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. 1 Jean Comaroff and John L.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M. Larson, "'Capacities and Modes of Thinking': Intellectual Engagements and Subaltern Hegemony in the Early History of Malagasy Christianity," AHR 102 (October 1997): 969-1002; Richard Elphick and Rodney Davenport, eds., Christianity in South Africa: A Political, Social, and Cultural History (Berkeley, Calif., 1997); and many other works discussed in David Chidester, Judy Tobler, and Darrel Wratten, Christianity in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography (Westport, Conn., 1997). The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86.

This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject.

There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76.

Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm).

The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 448 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh a series of rather peripheral white missionaries. Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843. The LMS Directors overturned the dismissal and censured Philip. 37 An interesting point of contrast is provided by Janet Hodgson, "A Battle for Sacred Power: Christian Beginnings among the Xhosa," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410.

Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work. Taylor is of course a Christian Hegelian, whose view of the emergence of the modern self is certainly influenced by Hegelian dialectics, in however inexplicit a fashion.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Abstract: For instance, Hans Urs von Balthasar’s provocative account of the Eucharist: Hans Urs von Balthasar,
            Theodramatik(Einselden: Johannes, 1980), 3:363–78. Von Balthasar’s use of dramatic conceptuality seems to satisfy these demands by offering the Eucharist as a phenomenon that is surprising and free yet deeply imbedded within the economy of creation as a drama. Also of significance would be Bernd Wannenwetsch,Political Worship: Ethics for Christian Citizens, trans. Margaret Kohl (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004).<br>

Abstract: In sum, this is one of the most important books on selves or the practical side of personhood in the last decade. It is also well written; the particular arguments are virtually always clear, and it is not too hard to keep track of their role within in the larger argument of the book. Some portions rise to an almost literary style and provide a rich survey of key ideas in twentieth-century French philosophy, while others engage quite originally with scholarship in moral psychology and theories of self-knowledge that will be more familiar to analytic readers. This work also complements the more detailed ethical theory on Larmore’s other books. Despite its relative inattention to volitional aspects of practical identity, and some questionable moves in the critique of authenticity, then, this work is still highly recommended.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: Critchley uses the term in a discussion of Levinas and politics. Noting that government tends to become tyrannical when left to itself, Critchley commends the way Levinas’s ethical ideas can cultivate forms of “dissensual emancipatory praxis” that “work against the consensual idyll of the state, not in order to do away with the state or consensus, but to bring about its endless betterment” (“Five Problems in Levinas’s View of Politics,” 183).<br>

Abstract: Closely related to the philosophical problem of consciousness of time was the question of the meaning of time and duration in psychology and in literature. Although Mooij mentions William James's notion of “specious present” in passing, he fails to explicate James's perception of time, which attempted to provide an empiricist account of our temporal concepts through the influence of John Locke (p. 197). Apart from this caveat, the book's strength lies in its perceptiveness and breadth of interpretation of the history of the concept of time. Mooij's accuracy in comprehending and in transmitting the essence of such difficult and complicated philosophies is remarkable.<br>

Abstract: Both

They are indispensable readings for students of political philosophy in their examination of transcendence, philosophy, and politics. By seeing Voegelin as a postmodern thinker and by showing his exchange with Strauss, both of these books provide us with a broader context to understand Voegelin's political philosophy. As part of the University of Missouri Press' new series, bothFaith and PhilosophyandEric Voegelin's Dialogues with the Postmodernsprovide intellectually provocative and serious-minded secondary works on Eric Voegelin and his ultimate place in political philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Abstract: In nearly thirty densely argued pages, Gottfried Weber (1832) analyzed four measures from Mozart's"Dissonance" Quartet; the "ear" subjects each note and chord to multiple possible interpretations. This paper examines Weber's interpretive practice in light of his theory of harmony, considering his cognitive teasing of potential meanings from the perspective of philosophical notions of consciousness (Kant and Fichte) and the poetics of self-reflective subjectivity proposed by the Early Romantics (F.Schlegel and Novalis) in their critiques of linguistic representation, temporality,and subject-object relations.The Early Romantic conception of irony and allegory brings the subject fully within the fold of linguistic representation, as does Weber,marking a key moment in the history of the representation of listening by music theory.<br>

Abstract: It is argued that autobiographical texts, such as life-historical interviews, provide the richest possible source of information about a person's temporality and a culture's historical past. It is proposed that time-consciousness can be inferred from such texts. To this end, ethnographic and other studies of Australian Aboriginal time-consciousness were used to construct a seven-part model of patterned-cyclical time-consciousness. Turning these seven attributes of patterned-cyclical time-consciousness into their opposites yields seven features of one-dimensional, ordinary-linear time-consciousness, thereby establishing a structured temporal polarity. A lexical-level, content-analytic methodology, Neurocognitive Hierarchical Categorization Analysis (NHCA), is introduced, in which folk-concepts of time from
         Roget's International Thesauruswere used to construct wordlist indicators for 9 of the 14 definitional components. Then, using NHCA for a comparative analysis of texts consisting of life-historical interviews, earlier results of an empirical study were brieflv re-presented. Australian Aborigines, compared to Euro-Australian controls, used a significantly smaller proportion of words for an index of ordinary-linear time but a higher proportion of words for an index of patterned-cyclical time, indicating a time-consciousness that is primarily patterned-cyclical rather than linear. Females were less linear and more patterned-cyclical than males in both cultures. These cross-cultural results contribute predictive validity to the proposed polarity of time-consciousness. Implications for the culture-and-cognition paradox and its resolution in dual-brain theory are addressed.<br>

Abstract: This essay investigates the roots of a growing impass in contemporary architecture vis a vis the economic, technological, social and political developments of our advanced or late-capitalist society. It focuses upon architecture's apparently diminishing capacity to address our present human condition, yet argues that the problems responsible for the "crisis" of architectural thought and design in general have evolved as the result of historic processes, and therefore the impass can only partially be explained with the short-comings of modern architecture or the 'short sighted' attitude of the architects themselves. Nevertheless, it also argues that architecture, in spite of its now rather limited transformative capacity, should persistently attempt to reveal, rather than mask or otherwise escape, its fundamental relatedness to material processes; that is, to the modes of production and consumption on which social and political power relations are predicated. To be able to do so, and thus to foster a more liberating "form" of human environment, the profession needs first of all a strong political self consciousness, while aiming at a practice of critical inquiry.<br>

Abstract: Despite the significant impact of the awareness of perspectival relativism on the religious imagination, recent philosophers and theologians have rarely subjected epistemological relativism to careful scrutiny. This paper attempts to overcome the current theological impasse by a careful exploration of the metaphysical implications of relativism. The central thesis of the essay is that truth is relative because meaning is contextual and being is relational. Contextualized meaning and relational being join to form relative truth disclosed through symbolic awareness. The roots of contemporary relativism lie deep within eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophical movements and are inseparably entangled with the psycho-social pluralization endemic to the process of modernization. The efforts of Neo-orthodoxy, polytheism, and the scientific study of religion to resolve dilemmas posed by epistemological relativism are inadequate. What has gone unnoticed is that the discovery of truth's relativity is the realization of its inherently dialectical character. This insight begins to emerge when it is recognized that meaning is contextual and context is semiophantic. Principles identified in Hegel's logic, in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of temporality, and in Ricoeur's and Gadamer's hermeneutics disclose that meaning assumes form through dialectical interrelationship in which co-implicates mutually constitute each other. The synchronic and diachronic dimensions of relationality reveal the inexhaustability and perpetual revisability of meaning. The problem of semantics, however, is inseparable from the question of ontology. Ontological reflection leads to the conclusion that being itself is dialectical-fundamentally social or essentially relational. Determinate identity is born of ontological intercourse with otherness. Relations are not external and accidental, but are internal and essential to being itself. Identity and difference, unity and plurality, oneness and manyness are thoroughly corelative, joined in a dialectical relation of reciprocal implication. This pluralized unity and unified plurality is the ontological matrix of truth's relativity. Symbolic awareness is the interface of contextual meaning and relational being. The density of constitutive relations and the nascence of concrete actuality engender a dissonance between manifest and latent content in the reflection of being in consciousness. The polysemy of symbols captures the polymorphism of being in a way that establishes the need for a constant process of decipherment in which we reformulate our notions in order more fully to penetrate synchronic and diachronic relations that are ontologically definitive. By maintaining the tension between the revealed and the concealed, symbolic awareness insures that knowledge always evolves through ceaseless reinterpretation. For symbolic consciousness, truth, as being itself, forever becomes. The essay concludes with the suggestion that the wedding of a relativistic epistemology and a relational ontology in a symbolics of the religious imagination reopens the possibility of constructive theological reflection in a pluralistic age.<br>

Abstract: The focus of contemporary studies in religion on methodology can be explored as the recognition of a fundamental epistemological problem. This paper is first an acknowledgment that we do not have an adequate conceptuality to render intelligible inward turning and then an experiment with the meaning of intelligibility. The dispossession of consciousness as the sole place and origin of meaning constituting an intellectual aporia is presented as an experience of the subversion of the subject by the discovery of the unconscious in depth psychologies and the discovery of the transcendence of the subject in foundational theologies. Taking account of this duplex expression of what lingers in disguise behind the scripts of ordinary life is defined as a fundamental exigency in the further development of human understanding and theological reflection.<br>

Abstract: Recent study of the nature of textuality as such opens new insights for the study of the Bible. Although individual parts of the Bible have oral antecedents, the Bible as a whole has existed only as a text, and a unique kind of text, folded back on itself out of communal memory as no other book has been. A text is a monument. Textuality establishes a special relationship between discourse and death. Spoken words are exchanges between living persons. The text presents its message as well if its author is dead as it does if he or she is alive. Print is even more bound to death than writing is. In comparison with oral performance-delivery of an oration, song-a text physically has certain special alliances with past time. All texts come out of the past. Literature as text is psychologically retrospective: its effects typically include an element of nostalgia. Because of its future orientation, culminating in the closing words of Revelation, "Come, Lord Jesus" (as against typical narrative closes such as "They lived happily ever after"), the Bible has an unusual relationship to textuality: it is not literature in the way other texts are. Typical narrative plot structures existence retrospectively: the story is organized back from the conclusion. This retrospective organization is maximized by writing, which tightens plot and makes more of re-cognition, a kind of return to the beginning (the past) and hence a cyclic pattern. In addition to being related intimately to death, writing and print are also limitlessly fecund, the central forces in the evolution of consciousness, once they appear. The fecundity of writing and print, like other fecundity in human existence, is achieved by passage through death. "Unless the grain of wheat dies." The Word of God in the Person of Jesus Christ is conceived of by analogy with the spoken word. The Father speaks the Word, the Son (eo verbum quo filius); he does not write the Word, who would then by biblical attestation be not life but death: "The letter kills, but the spirit [pneuma, breath, producer of speech] gives life." The Son passes through death to resurrected life. The written text, also God's word, must also be resurrected-by interpretation, by being inserted into the lifeworld of living persons. Hermeneutics is resurrection and in common Christian teaching demands faith. Study of the textuality of the Bible-which presumes but is not the same as study of the text of the Bible-opens many new theological questions and / or gives new contours to old questions.<br>

This "yen for becoming" is felt at all ages, and is in fact recognized as associated with the realization of the profoundest aspirations of man. Its origin is detected in early childhood. It is deeply rooted in the associative trend of thought and action, a trend which tends to perpetuate itself in the direction of unending abundance and novelty. The process assumes passage from awareness to memory, and even to the subconscious. The thought of the moment dips into the past, awakens memories, even those seemingly forgotten, reactivates all that is pertinent for the creation of new structures. It is believed that this tendency is essentially dynamic, endowed with energy which drives toward endless realizations. Nothing dies in the subconscious, as Freud pointed out. Each past experience is apt to return into consciousness and engage in a double process of homogenization and heterogenization, of convergent and divergent currents. Here the combinations, or commutations and permutations, are indefinite, an array which defies any computer. Creativity calls into play all energized experiences, present and stored, cognitive and affective, perceptual and conceptual, sensory and motoric, verbal and non-verbal, taxonomic and functional, real and symbolic; it constantly provokes new patterns. The richer the content of experience, the greater the possibility of innovation. The creative construction starts with the activation of readily available knowledge, the elements of which trigger related material in the memory and the subconscious. The movement is derived from active associations that continue to connect the units, and is oriented toward specific goals, leading to eventual syntheses, which may be expressed in either action or discourse. Here we face an unfurling, which coincides with interpretation, the unlocking of the new meaning built from the past upon the first meaning. This event, really never-ending, is a basic condition of life; it stimulates the spirit in a posture of perpetual emergence.<br>

Abstract: Euro-American theories of psychotherapeutic intervention focus on therapist behavior or the therapeutic relationship, conceived in dyadic terms. The cultural prototype is individualistic and rationalistic: a one-to-one conversation in which the patient discloses and discusses innermost feelings in regular office visits. This may be appropriate for modern Euro-Americans. However, anthropological research finds that in many traditional healing systems, intervention is communal, it utilizes dramatic ritual ordeals and altered states of consciousness rather than rational conversations, and the healer-patient relationship may be less central. This article argues that the latter approach is not ignorant of psychotherapeutic principles; it has its own (however opposed to Euro-American assumptions they may be). Understanding this paradigm clash broadens our understanding of what psychotherapeutic intervention is. It also allows clinicians and policy makers to support traditional peoples in their own efforts at self-healing. Examples will be drawn from the author's work on the healing ceremonies of the Native American Church among contemporary Navajos.<br>

Abstract: A recurrent misconception about the concept of utopia fails to realize fully that its essential endeavor constitutes a speculative act involving the distribution of power and resources. Consequently, utopian desire is closely linked to structures of power and can be manipulated by interests in positions of influence within these structures. It is these connections to the machinations of power that bring utopian visions their potential for social/political influence. However, these same types of links also provide avenues for these conceptions to be cynically influenced in ways that can usurp individual autonomy. The role of power and utopia can be analyzed in the formative process of a specific social structure as well as in their contribution to the conception of a common heritage or history. The "historical perspective" often serves as the foundation for the production of propaganda seeking to capture the imagination of a populace either to instigate positive social change or to legitimize an oppressive regime. Through the lens of Collingwood's philosophy of history, this article investigates the connection that the "historical consciousness" has to the attributes of power and utopia as well as the role that this relationship plays in the formation of a collective mentality. In short, it studies the essential characteristics of the bond between individuals that allows a community or collective to perpetuate itself. It also explores how the attributes of power and utopia can use latent historical perceptions to strengthen the process of ideological integration that underlies any social action or formal structure of authority.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in confusing motives with causes; irrationalism, which advocates a "liberté d'indifférence", basing itself on the same premise as rationalism, and confusing motives with causes, is wrong in seeing the negation of the very existence of motives as the one way of saving human freedom. Both views disregard the fact that human action is impossible and cannot be understood without motives and that this, in turn, does not mean a determination of man in a mechanical way, for motives are not a part of nature but rather an organic element in a specific human situation—voluntary action. Human freedom is the freedom peculiar to a finite being immersed in time. Both those who stress passivity and receptivity and those who stress the dynamic creating ability of the self are wrong; both those who thought that freedom is possible only on the basis of clear and distinct motives and that action is nothing but the end of deliberation (St. Thomas) and those who thought that freedom is possible only by an irrational emergence of the vital ego (Bergson) or by negating the existence of any previous determination of the self (Sartre) are mistaken. A true human decision is composed of two elements; given motives and values on the one hand, and non-intellectualist spontaneous choice on the other. Duality is peculiar to human action. This is made more explicit in dealing with the more fundamental involuntary elements; character, sub-consciousness and life. Man acts freely from a finite and determined point of view; he acts in a clear and transparent way on the basis of confused and amorphous data; he lives his freedom when thrown into life. Necessity is inherent in man; it is one of his modes of being. There is no "inner freedom" on the one hand and "objective" causal necessity on the other. This conception of human action as both activity and passivity is reminiscent of Merleau-Ponty's statement in his "Philosophie du perception": "Le monde est déjá constitué, mais aussi jamais complètement constitué.... Il n'y a donc jamais déterminisme et jamais choix absolu, jamais je ne suis chose et jamais conscience nue". There is no dilemna between determinism and irrationalism, just as there is none between extended substance and thinking substance; there is dialogue.<br>

Abstract: "La dérive d'une vie," that of the hero in En rade, is metaphorized by the dérive of narrative, composed of a complex network of metaphors. In 1893, Paul Souriau proposed that metaphor makes a fleeting representation pass into the unconscious. Dreams and hysteria, states in which the unconscious holds sway, are of considerable importance in this text. An analysis of the way that metaphor works will shed light on the relationships between dream and reality, and between consciousness and the unconscious in general. The double fil of extended metaphor is also metaphorized as a bifurcating road, the road of narrative and the labyrinthine path the hero's thoughts take. In fact, route or chemin is not only a metaphor for the text and for extended metaphor itself, but also for the complex pathways of the nerves and brain. If the road or path of narrative is also a representation of nerves/brain, then retracing these pathways of metaphors would be a way of following the text's attempt to dissect the brain and uncover the links between dream and reality, the double sphere of activity that characterizes this novel.<br>

Abstract: This article argues that Iris Murdoch makes a distinctive contribution to the agenda of theological humanism by formulating a revised theology of culture. Specifically, the article claims that Murdoch provides a compelling apologia for religious life in a secular world in two ways: by defending the significance of individual consciousness, and by retrieving an idea of the religious depth of morality. In doing so, Murdoch's work challenges antihumanist currents in modern and postmodern thought, offers an alternative to confessional forms of religious reflection, and revises previous theologies of culture (such as Tillich's) by giving priority to the ethical dimension of human life.<br>

Abstract: In his famous paper, What Is It Like To Be A Bat?, Thomas Nagel argues against a reductive physicalist account of consciousness by highlighting what he calls "the subjective character of experience". In this paper I will argue that Nagel's insight is important for understanding the value placed on patient autonomy in medical ethics. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience brings with it the necessity for an epistemological humility with respect to the lives of others and what can be said to be "right" for them. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience lies at the heart of empathy and our capacity to make decisions that genuinely reflect respect for the patient's autonomy. Through the example of a case involving extreme medical intervention, I identify some impediments to the proper recognition of autonomy. These kind of cases highlight the significance of affective responses with respect to the subjective character of experience, and, by extension, to our capacity to imagine and act in accordance with another's perspective. I argue that affective responses are appropriate and needed considerations in the case where one must attempt to assume another's perspective in order to respect autonomy. I conclude that understanding that experience has an irreducibly subjective character is essential to respecting patient autonomy.<br>

Abstract: Der Begriff der Dialektik, der zur Beschreibung einer derartigen Verbindung zwischen
Ursprung und Ziel gern reserviert wird, wäre hier unangemessen, weil er die Differenz unter-
schlägt, die Trieb und Mythos wie Unsichtbares und Sichtbares trennt. Freuds Deutung bringt
den Mythos im Trieb zum Verschwinden, aber umgekehrt den Trieb im Teufel zur Präsenz. Die
kulturtheoretischen Erzählungen der Psychoanalyse verschaffen dieser Präsenz eine Bühne, die
nicht nur der Vorführung des Teufels, sondern auch der Demonstration der eigenen erkenntnis-
kritischen Leistung dient; vgl. dazu H. Böhme: Fetischismus und Kultur, a.a.O. [Anm. 9] 408ff.<br>

Abstract: Interestingly enough it appears that the structural features of reconciliation show a re-
versed version of the structural features of evil. Resolving the evil I do toward the other re-
quires that I am able to say what I have done wrong (the reverse of silence and the
tinspeakable), that I recognize my guilt (which is incompatible with splitting) and that I ask for
forgiveness (which is very shameful, but may résolve shame when penitence is accepted and
forgiveness is given); see Glas (in press); Muφhyand Hampton (1988); Volf (1996).<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: In Matter and Memory, Bergson examines the relationship between perception and memory, the status of consciousness in its relation to the brain, and more generally, a possible conjunction of matter and mind. Our reading focuses in particular on his understanding of the evanescent presence of the present and of its debt vis-à-vis the "unconscious" consciousness of a "virtual" past. We wish to show that the Bergsonian version of a critique of "the metaphysics of presence" is, for all that, an offshoot of a Platonic type of metaphysics. It is true that Bergson departs from traditional stand-points on the side of a self-sufficient and original present and a form of presence to which the transparency of consciousness would confer the character of immediate evidence. All the same, it can hardly be claimed that his rehabilitation of the past and the unconscious opens up new perspectives on how forgetting and death are bound up with the work of memory.<br>

Abstract: This article reviews and integrates recent theories of addiction drawn from a diverse set of disciplines-consumer behavior, medicine, sociology, psychiatry, and psychology-to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the etiology of addiction and other compulsive consumer behaviors. Interpretive material from personal interviews with addicted and nonaddicted drug users is then used to illustrate the consciousness of addictive consumption. Two a priori themes-serial/simultaneous addictions and personal crises/role transitions-and five emergent themes-relapse, deception, dysfunctional families, suicide, and boundaries-are discussed.<br>

Abstract: Este trabajo está dedicado a todos los que, como Maximilian M. Kolbe (1894-1941), son capaces e dar su vida por otros, sin pedir nada a cambio, sin furia y sin rencor, tan sólo porque su idea de Dios omprende a la humanidad. Kolbe murió en un «búnker de inanición» del campo de exterminio de uschwitz. Entregó voluntariamente su vida a cambio de la de otro prisionero que era padre de familia. l suplicio del hambre (inanición absoluta) duró catorce días, en los que fallecieron seis condenados; uego, una inyección letal liquidó a los tres moribundos restantes, que «tardaban» demasiado. Así acabó olbe. La pena se dictó como castigo colectivo por la fuga de otro preso del bloque

Abstract: I argue that meaning or significance per se, along with the capacity to be conscious thereof, and the values, motives and aspirations, etc. central to the constitution of our intrinsic personal identities, arise, as indeed do our extrinsic social identities, and our very self-consciousness as such, from socio-cultural structures and relations to others. However, so far from our identities and behavior therefore being determined, I argue that the capacity for critical reflection and evaluation emerge from these same structural relations, the more complex and quintessentially human aspects of our behavior being explained not in terms of responses to stimuli but as choices reflecting our evaluation of meaningful or significant alternatives. Finally I provide theoretical grounds for accepting the existence of other subjects and give a holistic, as opposed to a dialectical, account of the way individuals may challenge and change the very socio-cultural ways of relating to and interacting with others so central to constituting their capacities and identities.<br>

Abstract: In his theory of communication Schutz exhibits a significant tension between two fundamental perspectives, phenomenology and pragmatism, and in the long run he fails to reconcile the contradictory implications these perspectives have with regard to his model of interaction. The main problem seems to be the notion of sense-constitution. Schutz develops two distinguishable accounts of constitution: an egological one and a model based on the phenomenon of direct interaction of empirical subjects. Two key concepts are related to these different modes of constitution: the model of appresentation with regard to language, symbols and signs, and the model of synchronisation as triangulation of streams of consciousness and outward action sequences. They are analyzed as significant for two different methods and two different theories of communication. I propose some reasons for Schutz's insistence on a phenomenological account of the ego and the constitution of sense, and offer a brief sketch of an alternative strategy that is implicit in Schutz's theory.<br>

Abstract: Cogito, as the first principle of Descartes' metaphysical system, initiated the modern philosophy of consciousness, becoming both the source and subject of modern Western philosophical discourse. The philosophies of Maine de Biran, Kant, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and others developed by answering the following questions? Is consciousness substantial or not? Does consciousness require the guarantee of a transcendental subject? Is Cogito epistemological or ontological? Am I a being-for-myself or a being-for-others? Outlining the developmental history of the idea of Cogito from Descartes to Sartre is important for totally comprehending the evolution and development of Western philosophy.<br>

Abstract: This article examines some of the discursive practices through which residents of West Virginia coal-mining communities negotiate the emically defined role of "neighbor." Notions of personhood privilege the synaptic, the contextual, and the relational. The ontology informing these discursive practices is contextualized within the historical conditions of their lives as working-class. Data and analysis contest essentialized notions of 'Appalachia', working-class consciousness, and social 'identity'.<br>

Abstract: The view of language is greatly changed from early modern philosophy to later modern philosophy and to postmodern philosophy. The linguistic question in early modern philosophy, which is characterized by rationalism and empiricism, is discussed in this paper. Linguistic phenomena are not at the center of philosophical reflections in early modern philosophy. The subject of consciousness is at the center of the philosophy, which makes language serve purely as an instrument for representing thoughts. Locke, Leibniz and Descartes consider language from a representationalist point of view. To them, language itself is idealized and represents thought as if it were thought representing itself. Like the structural linguist Saussure, the founders of phenomenology and analytical philosophy give much attention to the logical or static structure of language, and stick up for the representationalism of early modern philosophy. However, their successors refuse to accept this attitude, meaning the final collapse of representationalism. /// 从早期现代哲学到后期现代哲学再到后现代哲学，在语言观上产生了重大的 变化。早期现代哲学以唯理论和经验论为典型形式。语言现象没有成为该时期哲学 反思的中心问题; 意识主体处于哲学的中心，这使得语言仅仅充当着表象思想的工 具。洛克、莱布尼茨和笛卡尔都从表象论的角度看待语言，在他们那里，语言本身 被观念化了，它们表象思想，就像思想在表象它自身。正像结构语言学家索绪尔一 样，现象学和分析哲学的创始人关注的都是语言的逻辑结构或静态结构，他们延续 了早期现代哲学的表象论，但他们的后继者拒绝接受这种态度，而这意味着最终突 破表象论。<br>

Abstract: Throughoput its history, "ideology" (the concept and theory) served as social science's foil, an opposing standard against which it defined its own knowledge-as-truth. As social science since mid-century has undergone changes in its idea of itself and its methods of inquiry, the theory of ideology has served as register, visably recording these changes. Works by the structuralists and poststructuralists, especially Althusser and Foucault, forced upon social theorists a profound rethinking of power and its operations and moved "ideology" away from the theory of false consciousness towards a view of ideology as cultural practice. For some, ideology theory is obsolete (due to its classical roots as "false consciousness") or redundant (due to its links to "culture"). Despite the merits of these arguments, a provisional argument on behalf of ideology theory is offered.<br>

Abstract: This study employs hermeneutics to illuminate a musical life history. I Made Lebah was a unique individual who lived during a violent and creative time of Bali's history. This paper explores his life through the lens of hermeneutics and identifies music stages through segmented, progressive hermeneutical arcs within his lifelong arc of experience. A consciousness of historical situatedness and an enabling appropriation allowed him to master a number of Balinese music styles and assume the title, "great teacher." The people he worked with, including composers Lotring and Colin McPhee and his lifelong friend, Agung Mandra, all affected him and helped him to acquire a self-awareness, a rapid learning and internalization process, and a sensitivity to reflective hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: John Blacking's suggestion that some music transcends its social function by creating worlds of virtual time opens the way to a deeper understanding of the ontology of music. For Blacking, "music that is for being" enhances human consciousness by heightening temporal experiences. Music's power to affect our consciousness of time stands at the heart of an ontology of music. By examining music s relation to limit experiences such as trance and ecstasy, in which time itself appears to be transcended, I intend to argue that music's mode of being is the ground of its social, cultural, and even spiritual efficacy.<br>

Abstract: A theory of the embodiment of action is proposed. Reflections on relations between human intentions, the human body and the notion of agency lead us to argue that phenomenological analysis is not sufficient for such a theory. Our consideration, that the most fundamental level of embodied agency is that of life itself, brings us to the philosophy of biology and the theory of the organism: briefly, certain parts of the natural environment are intrinsic to the constitution of organisms and, in their more sophisticated configuration, as agents. Action is embodied in the sense that certain physiological processes are internal in relation to it and play a constitutive role in its performance. The way in which environment, context and consciousness affect and constitute the nature of agency at personal and sub-personal levels is elaborated. We see that human agents perceive and act upon their world through a complex shifting between those levels. A summary of the ways in which the social sciences can be enriched by this more comprehensive view of human agency provides the basis of justification for claiming Actor-Network Theory (ANT), originally developed by sociologists studying science and technology, as a promising framework for the continuation of this reasoning.<br>

Abstract: This article explores the nature of historical forgetting in the Philippines through the lens of Pierre Bourdieu's notion of forgetting as misrecognition, which is invested with power and struggle. The notion is concretized in the context of Reynaldo Ileto's discussion of the Schurman Commission, which was tasked to gather information about the Philippines as part of the United States' pacification campaign. Because historical forgetting is rooted in the structure of society itself, policies concerning language and education are imbued with power and class dimensions. The necessity of change in consciousness is enmeshed in the broader politics of social change, which is thus the context of the debate on the critical role of English in the Philippines. The political imperative to forget is inherent in—and partly sustains—the fundamental structure of social relations in the Philippines.<br>

Abstract: Sartre's theory of the imagination is important both as an alternative to the idea that the imagination consists of images contained somehow in the mind - the "illusion of immanence" — and as an early formulation of Sartre's conception of consciousness. In this paper I defend Sartre's theory of imaginative consciousness against some of its critics. I show how difficulties with his theory parallel a perennial problem in Sartre-interpretation, that of understanding how consciousness can negate its past and posit possibilities beyond the facticity of its situation. In this short essay I will not provide a detailed exposition of Sartre's theory of the imagination. Rather, I provide the basis of an interpretation of this theory that emphasizes the role that the past plays in imaginative consciousness.<br>

Abstract: The article advances an interpretation of the self as an imaginary object. Focusing on the relationship between selfhood and memory in Sartre's The Transcendence of the Ego, I argue that Sartre offers useful resources for thinking about the self in terms of narratives. Against interpretations that hold that the ego misrepresents consciousness or distorts it, I argue that the constitution of the ego marks a radical transformation of the conscious field. To prove this point, I turn to the role of reflection and memory in the creation of the self. Reflection and memory weave past, present and future into a consistent and meaningful life story. This story is no other than the self. I propose to understand the self as a fictional or imaginary entity, albeit one that has real presence in human life.<br>

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Abstract: Recent events indicate that self-interest and technicism today triumph over social consciousness; yet educators naturally turn to the humanities as an antidote to positivism and technical domination, even as humanities scholars are increasingly defensive, struggling to hold on to their enclaves. For those committed to the practice of freedom in education the humanities are of vital interest, particularly when they are defined as works that are articulations of some human consciousness thrusting into the world. After giving examples of works that may be classified as "humanities" according to this definition, the following essay discusses teaching situations and literary works which might free persons for awareness of human possibility, for authentic talk and widening perspectives. The humanities must be presented not as monuments to be revered but as works to be shared by students and applied to their own life situations. Students grounded in their "everydayness" can be awakened by Freiré's dialogical method, awakened to crítical consciousness and to the possibility of praxis in a world they share.<br>

Abstract: In a first section, the renewed interest in historical consciousness among social scientists and historians is discussed, which resulted in a clearer understanding of how historical memory functions and of the diverse ways in which historians use references to the past. Against this background, Paul's use of history in the letter to the Galatians is analysed in a second section. The apostle is not interested in recording the past, but develops, in the light of his own experiences in preaching the gospel among gentiles, an alternative perspective on Israel's past. By taking the figure of Abraham as his point of departure, he argues for a more inclusive understanding of Israel's history, which enables him to provide a theological justification for the equal status of gentile believers in the community of faith.<br>

Abstract: Since the early 1990s, the concept of historical consciousness has been central to didactic research in Sweden. It has mostly been used as a theoretical framework on a macro-level or as an attempt to identify students' historical consciousness. This article applies the theoretical concept of historical consciousness to tangible source material:history textbooks from the twentieth century. It focuses on whether Swedish history textbooks for lower secondary school have articulated contexts that may be conducive to developing historical consciousness. The article employs a number of theoretical concepts—narratives, multichronology, identity, and values—in order to analyze perspectives that can be utilized to trigger historical consciousness.<br>

Abstract: Seeking to understand the manifest in relation to the implicit and the unstated-the unconscious of the conscious-this paper focuses on the elusiveness of social consciousness in a transitional colonial society with a rich heritage of its own. The issue chosen for examination is that of widow marriage and the period is confined to the last three decades of the nineteenth century. Progressively convulsing the upper caste, mainly middle class, Hindu society, the issue was one that epitomised the interplay of conflicting emotions, values and ideas that characterised men's consciousness about women during this seminal phase of Indian history.<br>

Abstract: Psychology has uncritically adopted the individual person as its object of study without examining the concept and role of personhood within contemporary society and Western culture more generally. We examine three perspectives that challenge this familiar and unexamined object of our disciplinary inquiry: (1 ) Critical Theory's concept of the bourgeois individual as psychology's subject of ideology; (2) Poststructuralism's challenge to the concept of personhood as an integrated and self-present center of consciousness and action; (3) System Theory's alternative epistemology in which relations rather than entities have primacy. Each perspective introduces a concept of personhood that significantly differs from our present understanding of psychology's subject and that lays the foundation for a new subject of psychological inquiry: a multicentered, multidimensional subject.<br>

Abstract: In attempting to achieve some form of mapping between consciousness (specifically, consciousness₆) and cognition, I distinguish between a weak and a strong version of the hypothesis, indicating a change in mode of thinking of a metaphoric-symbolic nature (Glicksohn, 1993). The weak version would claim that metaphors, symbols, analogies and images are used in an attempt to depict the experience, which is not easily translatable into words. The strong version would claim that metaphoric thinking is one of the hallmarks of the experience, and is used both in an attempt to depict the experience and also to convey to the reader, and possibly to induce in the reader, some of the qualities of that experience. My discussion of these two options is preceded by some comments on problems inherent in studying altered or alternate states of consciousness. I also discuss the relationships among physiognomic perception, cognitive dedifferentiation, and symbolic cognition.<br>

Abstract: If nations are "imagined communities" as many theorists like to define them, then they need an ideology to create a cohesive imagination. In modern times, the project of writing "history" has been an important instrument in the service of this ideological purpose of justifying and reproducing the modern nation-state as the predestined and legitimate container of collective consciousness. School textbooks, at least in South Asia, have long been among the most exploited media for the presentation of the history of the national collective. This essay is a study of school textbooks in Bangladesh. It looks at narrative representations of selected episodes from the past, both pre- and postindependence, in order to reflect on how they construct "history". Through this work I endeavor to relate textual images to issues of community relations and identity by identifying and sharing the ways in which the audience for nationalist discourse is created, nurtured, and secured through symbolic means.<br>

Abstract: Rousseau opposed both traditional and modern (empiricist) thinking when he made self-love the cornerstone of his system. Other modes of thought treat self-consciousness as constituted primarily by temporal desire. Rousseau raises love, for him the suspension of desire, to a position of ontological primacy in regard to self-consciousness. Like Pascal, he throws the empirical existence of the self into radical question and finds it to be as insubstantial and empty a concept as the Western tradition has found it-from Ecclesiastes and Socrates on. Rousseau declines the moralistic reproof of the self, however, and emphasizes its insubstantiality as its one strength, although a fictional one. The self exists only in the mode of a hypothesis (the fictional "as if"): it is a failure at being. But to amour (and to pitié) it makes all the difference and is worthy of their support.<br>

Abstract: Literary historians have persistently regarded The Education of Henry Adams as a "paradigmatic" text. While "historical explanations" stress the book's historical achievement, "critical explications" portray it as a failure of historical consciousness that achieves its success in the ahistorical arenas of aesthetic integration and imaginative projection. To relate the products of "explication" with the aims of "historical explanation," I regard the work's true "paradigm achievement" as an inquiry into "historical being." For Adams this achievement embodies disciplinary formulation and professional commitment and thus coordinates historical speculation and self-cultivation. One must assess the ethical density and cultural significance of the text before explaining its historical identity. The Education, despite its origin in epistemological chaos, makes the past eternally relevant to the present; for it is a personal and theoretical discovery of how the narrative structures of history and selfhood create the possibilities of individual and social life.<br>

Abstract: «At the basis of the literary act is a consciousness of language. Whether or not the writer is given to abstract reflexion, there is in literature itself a metaliterary dimension.» In his article on the Evolution of Literary Theory, Tzvetan Todorov examines the relation between the «discourse on Literature» and the object of that discourse: literature. Whereas exegesis concerns itself with the Elucidation and explanation of an historically given object, theory itself constitutes its object. Theory then is in turn seen to be historically informed. From the Poetics of Aristotle, through the medieval hermeneuts, the Renaissance concern with genres, Todorov traces the development of the theoretical discourse which proposes literature as its object. Only in the romantic period is a theory of literature, in the strict sense, elaborated. In the 20th century this theory is further influenced by other emergent disciplines :Marxism, psychoanalysis etc. The final pages of Todorov's paper consider in detail the impact of structuralism, particularly in France, on the literary theoretical discourse. He concludes with reference to the changes taking place currently. According to Todorov, it is in the «idea of genre» that the «transformation will take place.»<br>

Abstract: Using a broadly Aristotelian framework I propose poetic form as a means for distinguishing historicities. I analyze Sakalava performances of possession by royal ancestors as the creative production of a kind of history, distinguish it from a dominant occidental model of history, and elaborate the chronotope on which it is based and the heteroglossia and historical consciousness it enables. I argue that Sakalava spirit possession has a strongly realist bent and suggest the interest of poiesis for anthropological analysis and comparison more generally.

Abstract: Cultural cognition is the product of two different sorts of meaning: (a) the (objective) semiotic organization of cultural texts or models, and (b) the (subjective) processes of meaning construction through which cultural symbols become available to consciousness as "experience." This article proposes a way to bridge these two kinds of meaning by considering how cultural knowledge is grounded in sensory experience. Several cognitive processes (schematization, synesthesia, secondary intersubjectivity) are proposed for linking the objectively available schemata found in cultural practices and the processes of meaning construction by which individuals appropriate symbols to consciousness. The nature of the relation between public symbols and individual experience is discussed in relation to a number of current issues in post-structuralist culture theory.<br>

Abstract: Offering a “pharmacological” perspective, this essay elaborates on the Chilean Roberto Bolaño's novel
         2666. It discusses narrative imaginaries that regraph cultural experiences and spaces of self-consciousness as they emerge from singular global south networks. In2666, the Mexican-U.S. border region operates as a fraught site through which a global aesthetics of sobriety gains shape and texture, a phenomenon upon which Bolaño's text depends for its critique of Western academic knowledge. From there, I consider how a “pharmacological” problematization of Western culture can reshape our perspective of the constitution of a global modernity.<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: In short, it is exposure to the experientially inspired and theoretically casual atmosphere of those early SPEP meetings—where neglected topics and unorthodox modes of thinking and speaking were encouraged in an undisciplined way—to which I owe the most. Of course, SPEP grew up. It has experienced its share of embarrassing upheavals, as the heavy presence of its own versions of the social and political prejudices in the larger culture became too obvious to ignore. But it is now a major event—the four-day anchor for a week-long convention that takes over hotels, runs multiple concurrent sessions, fosters satellite groups, and often follows established lines of discussion. Some even call it the alternative APA. Yet I am sure that as long as lifeworld experience continues to trump whatever it is currently fashionable to say about it, grown-up SPEP will retain enough of its original vitality and intellectual generosity so that another generation of aging academics will have cause to repeat our present thank-yous in another fifty years.<br>

Abstract: Our plight, then, is not simply that we are all in the same boat, let alone on the same ocean. Yet we are still bound by the responsbility of inhabiting the same planet. What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: For, if phenomenology renounces its search for the absolute and for foundations, then it must give up seeing itself as a single and self-contained discourse. The minimal phenomenologist renounces monolinguism and is no longer the master of only one discourse. Instead, he or she must practice a mixed discourse. To do this is to practice diglossia, to become a code-switcher. In its ordinary sense, the practice of code-switching refers to the passage from one language or dialect to another one in the course of a single conversation, for instance, when the conversation moves from an informal to a formal setting or when it moves from one topic to another. But in the phenomenological context, this would involve the ability to shift from a phenomenological discourse to its “others,” whether they might be Freudian energetics, Deleuzian aspects, Badiouan events, and so on. This practice of translation or code-switching has perhaps always been the role of the phenomenologist, if it is accepted that phenomenological reflection does not begin from itself but is nourished by a life that precedes it and gives rise to it.<br>

Abstract: In this work, I argue that creative metaphors are formed when some persistent problem, caused by an inadequacy in preexisting knowledge, descends into the collective unconscious, is reconfigured unconsciously in novel ways, and then reemerges back into consciousness where the impasse is resolved by the metaphorical expression of new knowledge. To develop this position, I (1) review and critique some well-known language-based studies of metaphor, (2) summarize psychoanalytic and depth psychological approaches to the psyche as one way to overcome the shortcomings of the language-based scholarship, (3) relate C. G. Jung's account of the psyche and his related notion of synchronicity to creative metaphors, (4) graft a quantum physics approach to material reality back onto Jung's work as a provisional structure of the collective unconscious, and finally, (5) offer some suggestions about how creative metaphors might work psychologically.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: In
         Towards a ‘Natural’ Narratology(1996), Monika Fludernik reconstitutes narrativity on the basis of experientiality, i.e., humanity's embodiedness in the world, and claims that incomprehensible texts can be made more readable if one attempts to narrativize them. Since Samuel Beckett's short prose work “Lessness” is one of the most enigmatic texts of the twentieth century, it serves as an ideal test case for this new narratological paradigm. “Lessness” does indeed lose its initial strangeness if one reads this piece as narrative. Moreover, although a “natural” narratological analysis paves the way for a new interpretation of “Lessness,” the new paradigm provides only a partially satisfying analysis of it. To make the text fit into the new consciousness-oriented paradigm, Fludernik's quasi-universal naturalizing mode has to ignore certain aspects such as the mechanical structure of “Lessness.” Beckett's later prose work challenges narrativization and the “natural” narratological project. A reading of “Lessness” should be liberated from the confines of experientiality and instead concentrate on the role of chance and chaos. Beckett's text must be located in a counterworld, a limbo between signifier and signified. One should allow this limbo world to seep into the “real world” and not attempt to explain this different counterworld by means of “real-world” knowledge.<br>

Abstract: Drawing upon recent ideas from the cognitive sciences, this paper is an interdisciplinary exploration of the representation of consciousness in McEwan's novel
         Enduring Love, focussing on overlapping manifestations of Theory of Mind ranging from altruism to violent pathology. Through techniques such as intertextuality, the use of paratexts, and the juxtaposition of scientific and literary discourses, McEwan constructs this novel as a Theory of Mind creating a demanding and appealing reading experience that mirrors the doubt and uncertainty of the characters as they strive to understand each others' minds. McEwan's deep interest in science and what it can and cannot tell us about human nature is a potent theme inEnduring Love. This article argues thatEnduring Loveexposes and exploits the unique potential of literary narrative to represent our intense desire to engage with other minds, both highlighting the fact that we are designed by nature to read and to misread minds, as well as the capacity of the novel to communicate the raw feel of human experience in a way that eludes scientific discourse.<br>

Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>
