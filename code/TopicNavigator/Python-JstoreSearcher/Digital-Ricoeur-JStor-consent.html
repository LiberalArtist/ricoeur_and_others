  2  Competing Metaphors of Insurance and Investment from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt16wd0hf">Invoking the Invisible Hand</a><br>
  Abstract: Privatization promised a policy revolution born in the legitimating discourses of Social Security. In this spirit, advocates of privatization, who made their case through multiple congressional hearings beginning in earnest in the mid-1990s, pressed the logic of the rights claims asserted by the original supporters of Social Security. They, too, saw Social Security benefits as a right secured by a worker’s contributions, but advocates rebuked government control of these contributions as usurping the title to an individual’s property. Since rights rested properly with their bearers, any break in this connection by another party without the full consent of the rights<br>

  8  The Hermeneutics of Faithful and Fitting Doctrinal Development from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt12878jm">In Defense of Doctrine</a><br>
  Abstract: While the Lord tarries, doctrine develops. The progress and growth of ideas is an inevitable historical reality, even in religious traditions purportedly rooted in divine revelation. In post-critical Christian theology, attitudes toward this phenomenon are undergoing considerable change. Once met with contempt and anxiety from Protestants and Roman Catholics alike, the idea of postcanonical doctrinal development nowadays meets with a far more favorable, even enthusiastic consent in both circles. Evangelicals, however, meet with the prospect of doctrinal development in the tension between two poles: an unwavering commitment to the supreme authority of God’s unchanging word (
                  sola scriptura) and a need<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x16m7">Karl Jaspers: An Introduction to His Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Schelling, as Jaspers reminds us, once said that “although man, at the beginning of his existence, finds himself thrown, as it were, into a stream (
                  gleichsam in einen Strom geworfen) that … overpowers him completely, still he is not required to allow this stream to simply wrench him loose and carry him along passively like an inanimate object.”¹ Without his consent he is brought into a world that he does not understand. Naturally he must try to “adjust” to the situation. Buthow?² Knowledge of the good life is not innate but acquired through experience. But at the outset he<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19dzd84">Studi su Max Weber</a><br>
  Abstract: Nell’accingerci ad esaminare il tema dei rapporti tra l’interpretazione dei testi e la comprensione dell’agire - tema di fondamentale importanza per la riflessione ermeneutica odierna, come attestano le ricerche che negli ultimi vent’anni sono state ad esso dedicate¹ - sarà opportuno iniziare con il chiedersi che cosa possa esservi di comune tra l’insieme di atti mediante i quali penetriamo il significato dei prodotti dell’attività linguistica che siamo soliti individuare come “testi” ed i processi che ci consentono di cogliere il senso del comportamento di quanti, fuggevol­mente o in maniera costante, entrano nel nostro orizzonte di vita e fini­scono con l’influenzare<br>

  Chapter 7  The Spectre of Trotsky from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbwzh">Sartre Against Stalinism</a><br>
  Abstract: After completing ‘Matérialisme et révolution’, Sartre’s quest continued. Philosophically and politically dissatisfied with the PCF, he wished to establish a revolutionary alternative. Yet Naville’s anti-Stalinist materialism was clearly not what he was looking for. In this context a major influence was his fellow-editor of
                     Les Temps modernes, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, who was usually the author of editorial statements signed ‘T.M’., to which Sartre gave his consent,¹ apparently recognising that Merleau-Ponty was more politically sophisticated than he was. Merleau-Ponty was not a Trotskyist, but he had had a number of friends and contacts in the Trotskyist movement since before the war.²<br>

  Chapter 10  Strange Fruit: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbzsw">Beyond Rationalism</a><br>
  Author(s) Feldman Allen<br>
  Abstract: At no other time more than in the present day has individual, social and institutional memory come under such concerted pressure, critique and exposure as a fragile foundation for truth and facticity. This current reluctance to authenticate social memory is intimately tied to well-known postmodernist depredations, which profoundly disenchanted the authority of tradition and authenticity, and emptied core institutionalised myths of their temporal and semantic continuity. As institutionalised memory fails to provide overarching master narratives that can win cultural consent, it has also become increasingly disjunctive with previously unnarratable history and experience. Consider the synchronic fictions of recent ethno-histories, the<br>

Not surprisingly, the topics of Machiavellism—the relation ofvirtùor virtue to success, means to ends, persuasion to coercion, force to consent—appear regularly in his speeches.

  5  Reprisals and Bridge Building from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4n1q">Dealing with Dictators</a><br>
  Abstract: The failure of the 1956 revolution shattered the notion that the European status quo could be changed without the consent of the Soviet Union. Washington was forced to take a hard look at the European situation, and over the course of a decade they concluded that there was nothing they could do to reverse the continental division. The calculation that Europe would remain divided for the foreseeable future was not based solely on the United States’s inability to influence the power structure behind the Iron Curtain. The domestic and foreign policies of communist states like Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia also<br>

  FAVETE LINGUIS! from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ckphw4">Le Complexe d'Hermès</a><br>
  Abstract: On sait comment le roi de Milet, pour remercier Thalès d’une machine de guerre inventée par le philosophe, lui demanda ce qu’il voulait en récompense. Le philosophe, inspiré peut-être en cela par l’art persuasif (πείθω) d’Hermès, proposa au roi de déposer un grain de blé sur la première case d’un échiquier, puis deux sur la seconde, puis quatre sur la troisième et seize sur la quatrième, etc. La demande sembla raisonnable au roi qui y consentit. Seulement, par ce jeu exponentiel, toutes les réserves de blé de l’Ionie et probablement de l’Hellade entière n’auraient pas suffi à remplir la soixante-quatrième<br>

  CHAPITRE 10  IDÉOLOGIE ET PENSÉE DOMINANTE CHEZ MARX ET ENGELS from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1h64m1f">Perspectives critiques en communication</a><br>
  Author(s) Gulli Florian<br>
  Abstract: L’idéologie désigne, dans la perspective d’une critique sociale, le discours dominant d’une époque; on parle par exemple d’« idéologie néolibérale ». L’idéologie est alors un ensemble d’idées liées aux intérêts d’une classe sociale. Elle se définit par sa fonction : justifier rationnellement ses intérêts économiques et politiques. C’est un discours au service de la puissance, non de la vérité. Inutile par conséquent de l’apprécier du point de vue de sa conformité au réel, il faut le juger à son efficacité. Et il est efficace quand il parvient à faire consentir les dominés à leur propre domination. L’existence de l’idéologie nous<br>

  Book Title: Tempo e racconto nei processi creativi Strategie narrative per l’architettura-  Publisher: Quodlibet<br>
  Author(s): Amati Massimiliano<br>
  Abstract: Questo lavoro è un’esplorazione teorica delle strategie che mettono in relazione il tempo e lo spazio nel procedere narrativo delle opere. La ricerca mira a costruire dei ponti tra teoria e pratica del progetto architettonico parafrasando in termini spaziali le teorie più significative costruite intorno al significato di tempo e narrazione. In quest’ottica l’apparato iconografico asseconda la struttura concettuale del testo, che si basa essenzialmente sulle teorie della formatività di Pareyson e sulle teorie del tempo di Ricoeur e Focillon, visualizzate in progetti di arte e architettura. Oggi più che mai, in una realtà che si trasforma velocemente, si afferma l’utilità di un’indagine sul significato evolutivo dei luoghi e dei territori analizzando i processi creativi che legano l’attività umana alla modificazione dello spazio naturale e artificiale. Pensare l’architettura come un’attività che si completa nel tempo ci consente di modulare consapevolmente i processi di cambiamento. In tal senso l’architetto assume il ruolo di un regista o di uno scrittore che inserisce nuovi episodi spaziali in un vecchio testo ereditato, ossia il contesto del progetto. Il suo obiettivo diventa così quello di rileggere le potenzialità latenti del sito per proiettarle nel futuro di una nuova storia.<br>

  Author(s) Spinicci Paolo<br>
  Abstract: 1. In queste pagine vorrei discutere di due diversi problemi. Il primo è più circoscritto e, in qualche misura, costituisce il tema specifico di questo saggio: vorrei cercare di comprendere se e in che misura possano darsi immagini che si rivolgano allo spettatore per ordinargli qualcosa, che siano appunto – in questo senso – immagini dispotiche. Le immagini si usano in molti modi e hanno molte e diverse funzioni; analizzarle può essere utile perché ci consente di riflettere sul fatto che alcune di esse non sembrano appartenere al campo espressivo delle raffigurazioni in quanto tali: vi sono immagini ironiche che ci invitano<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1z27hnx">Les fondations philanthropiques:de nouveaux acteurs politiques?</a><br>
  Author(s) Brouard François<br>
  Abstract: La culture philanthropique présente plusieurs visages qui, selon les expressions qu’ils arborent, influencent la société québécoise et canadienne (Institut Mallet, 2014). Cette culture est ainsi le véhicule de certaines façons de faire le bénévolat, de s’engager dans une cause sociale ou de consentir des dons financiers. Cette influence, et les pratiques qu’elles entraînent, soulève des enjeux. Celui des ressources consacrées par nos gouvernements par le système fiscal et par des partenariats privilégiant et orientant certaines actions gouvernementales est particulièrement préoccupant. On estime, par exemple, que les dépenses fiscales fédérales se situent pour 2013 à 2 530 millions de dollars pour<br>

  Chapter Six  Cohabitation and the Process of Marrying from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt69p">The Sexual Person</a><br>
  Abstract: Emmanuel ntakarutimana expresses the Central African experience of marrying in the following words. “Where Western tradition presents marriage as a point in time at which consent is exchanged between the couple in front of witnesses approved by law, followed by consummation, the tradition here recognizes the consummation of a marriage with the birth of the first child. To that point the marriage was only being 
                  progressively realized.”¹ Four years of field experience in East Africa taught us the same thing. We offer three points of clarification. First, the Western tradition to which Ntakarutimana refers is the Western tradition of only<br>

  Author(s) Flick Catherine<br>
  Abstract: Information technology suffers from a distinct lack of care with respect to adequate informed consent procedures. Computer users are commonly asked to consent to various things that could threaten their personal identity, privacy, and property, yet little care is taken in assessing whether the consent is truly informed. Some software even takes advantage of the confusion rife in informed consent procedures in order to install otherwise unwanted software on usersʹ computers (such as adware or spyware). End user licence agreements (EULAs) are a common example of these poorinformed consent procedures, which have their basis in the inappropriate use of medical<br>

  CHAPTER ONE  The Legitimacy of Establishment from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7stdc">Democratic Legitimacy</a><br>
  Abstract: Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s contention that “the voice of the greater number always obliges the rest” is a commonplace of today’s electoral politics, yet the assertion masks a crucial assumption: the idea that political legitimacy is not fully achieved until a regime enjoys the unanimous support of its citizens. Only then can a government count itself as securely established on its social foundations. Since democracy implies that each individual is the bearer of fundamental rights, the consent of all is the only incontestable guarantee of respect for each. This “individualistic” understanding of the requirement of unanimity is the fundamental justification of the<br>

  Author(s) Egyed Béla<br>
  Abstract: From the beginning of his reflections, Nietzsche is in search of “a new philosophy of language” (CM 1976, 1:340 [8, 52]), a philosophy which would wisely consent to lose its head and which could give, in a positive manner, an account of the bacchanalian revel, the festive inordinateness of the dithyramb, “this beautiful and savage folly of poetry” (CM 1976, V: 100-1). One is to understand the “nature” of language beginning with its derailment and its loss. This new philosophy seeks to give back to language all its striking force, all its power to cast a spell, its mysterious and<br>

For hegemony is grounded upon an apparent contradiction between inequality and consent. And the very process of securing consent conjures up the spectre of conspiracy.<br>

  6  THE THREE FREE WORLD THEORIES from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3998/mpub.5558805">Democratic Peace</a><br>
  Abstract: Democratic peace is a theory of democracy, by democracy, for democracy; it is supposed to explain the behavior of democracies, it was conceived in democracies, and its political representations were put into use for the sake of democracies. The focus of this book is a free world theory. But democratic peace thesis is not the only free world theory. There are others; for example, soft power and the capitalist peace theory (or thesis). Soft power is connected to democracy in that its emphasis is on influence by consent, the supposedly democratic approach to influence, rather than by coercion. Though power<br>

  FIVE  Memory Traces, Mystical States, and Deep Pluralism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.cttts8p6">Neuropolitics</a><br>
  Abstract: It seems simple. Because life is riddled with mystery and uncertainty, an existential faith may encounter paradoxes that call its claim to universality into question. So a dictum becomes tempting: wherever mystery and freedom meet, a variety of faiths bubble up; wherever, therefore, people prize freedom they will support a significant presumption in favor of honoring that variety. Many give preliminary consent to such a dictum. But it quickly runs into difficulties. Christians have often insisted that because their faith is universal it must be sanctioned by public ethics in the states or civilizations they inhabit. Secularists, while praising religious<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 668652<br>
Date: 10 01, 2013<br>
Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in confusing motives with causes; irrationalism, which advocates a "liberté d'indifférence", basing itself on the same premise as rationalism, and confusing motives with causes, is wrong in seeing the negation of the very existence of motives as the one way of saving human freedom. Both views disregard the fact that human action is impossible and cannot be understood without motives and that this, in turn, does not mean a determination of man in a mechanical way, for motives are not a part of nature but rather an organic element in a specific human situation—voluntary action. Human freedom is the freedom peculiar to a finite being immersed in time. Both those who stress passivity and receptivity and those who stress the dynamic creating ability of the self are wrong; both those who thought that freedom is possible only on the basis of clear and distinct motives and that action is nothing but the end of deliberation (St. Thomas) and those who thought that freedom is possible only by an irrational emergence of the vital ego (Bergson) or by negating the existence of any previous determination of the self (Sartre) are mistaken. A true human decision is composed of two elements; given motives and values on the one hand, and non-intellectualist spontaneous choice on the other. Duality is peculiar to human action. This is made more explicit in dealing with the more fundamental involuntary elements; character, sub-consciousness and life. Man acts freely from a finite and determined point of view; he acts in a clear and transparent way on the basis of confused and amorphous data; he lives his freedom when thrown into life. Necessity is inherent in man; it is one of his modes of being. There is no "inner freedom" on the one hand and "objective" causal necessity on the other. This conception of human action as both activity and passivity is reminiscent of Merleau-Ponty's statement in his "Philosophie du perception": "Le monde est déjá constitué, mais aussi jamais complètement constitué.... Il n'y a donc jamais déterminisme et jamais choix absolu, jamais je ne suis chose et jamais conscience nue". There is no dilemna between determinism and irrationalism, just as there is none between extended substance and thinking substance; there is dialogue.<br>

silenzio non piu rotto da fatti straordinari né da rumori del secolo, fino alla morte, avvenuta il 12
febbraio 1671".<br>

Abstract: A community, in the same way as an individual, can follow as a normal way of behaviour — or as a wanted criteria for behaviour — for all future circumstances to decide discretionally, «case by case», or to define in a moment in time the rule (or a set of rules) that must be valid for the future. To define rules in a community has been indicated by some authors (Geoffrey Brennan and James M. Buchanan particularly) as a way to exit from a situation of a war of every man against every other man, as in the Hobbesian jungle, on one side, and from a situation dominated by a Leviathan on the other. This in a perspective where rules of a common living have been set through a social contract. The rules established through this contract would also form the criteria for a just conduct, in the end therefore for criteria of justice. The essay analyzes the situations and the conditions in which constraining oneself can be rational, even as it is not definible that in all circumstances constraining is more rational than not constraining oneself, that it is more desirable to have rules rather than discretionary decisions, the definition of ways of behaviour rather than the pre-definition of outcomes. As for what concerns the problem of justice, it is indicated how through a contractarian and constitutional procedure rules can be put by unanimous consent, but the problem of the foundation of the same rules remains unresolved. Rules do not seek truth, but only express values accepted by the counterparts in a certain moment in time, and have individuals as sources of these values.<br>

Abstract: Adopting a hyperbolic perspective is also certainly a way to argue as well as a way to examine other “texts” because it is a trope and figure of thought that reveals those moments within discourse when one is attempting to transcend the bounds of reality because the extraordinary nature of a given situation or subject matter requires the use of an excessive prophetic voice or an ardent polemical exaggeration. As Mileur posits, “The work is a hyperbole, the intersection of other hyperboles, and the subject is, insofar as he can be written about at all, another hyperbole” (1990, 86). Rather than circumventing it, understanding hyperbole as the focus of thought and action can create significant moments of
      inventioas well aselocutiofor the hyperbolist and critic alike. By approaching a particular text, a critical term, and even a piece of criticism itself from a hyperbolic perspective, one might (re)consider and (re)interpret these “texts” as a stretching of discursive limits that leads one toward a re-presentation of the extraordinary—an attempt to communicate the ineffable or transgress the expressible.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>
