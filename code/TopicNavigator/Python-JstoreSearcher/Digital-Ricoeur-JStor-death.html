  1  Policy Polysemy and the 1935 Social Security Debates from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt16wd0hf">Invoking the Invisible Hand</a><br>
  Abstract: Americans know Social Security. They likely know it better than any other public policy. Whereas many policies appear distant from Americans’ everyday lives, seemingly addressed only to Washington insiders, Social Security touches ordinary citizens directly. For millions of Americans, Social Security has provided irreplaceable benefits to compensate for income lost through the tragic injury or death of a breadwinner. For millions more, Social Security has provided steady retirement benefits for oneself, a parent, or a grandparent, affirming, in the process, the honorific status of senior citizen. And virtually all Americans have experienced the rite of passage enacted by obtaining a<br>

  3  Representing Target Populations from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt16wd0hf">Invoking the Invisible Hand</a><br>
  Abstract: Social policies ineluctably invoke target populations—people who, in the case of Social Security, would contribute to and benefit from an insurance or investment system. Whether supporting or opposing a policy proposal, debate participants address various qualities of a target population. Policymakers may assert that future retirees harbor hopes and dreams for their retirement, while retirees may expect policies to help them realize their visions. Beyond aspirations, potential beneficiaries may exhibit stated and unstated needs. Workers certainly do not plan to suffer a serious on-the-job injury or premature death, but they may need to protect their families against a tragic<br>

  Abstract: The disruption of their household that the Plunkett family experienced in the years after 1916, and lasting well into the 1920s, inevitably led to some disordering of papers relating to Joseph’s politico-military activities and writings. The distribution of books and papers after his father’s death in 1948 added a further hazard to orderly preservation. It is therefore gratifying that G. N. Plunkett’s archive in the NLI should disclose a small amount of material generated by his eldest son. Mss. 12,009–10 contain two notebooks, the first labeled Philosophy and dating from 1908 to 1909, the second containing literary matter from<br>

  Book Title: Mourning Animals-Rituals and Practices Surrounding Animal Death<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kalof Linda<br>
  Abstract: We live more intimately with nonhuman animals than ever before in history. The change in the way we cohabitate with animals can be seen in the way we treat them when they die. There is an almost infinite variety of ways to help us cope with the loss of our nonhuman friends-from burial, cremation, and taxidermy; to wearing or displaying the remains (ashes, fur, or other parts) of our deceased animals in jewelry, tattoos, or other artwork; to counselors who specialize in helping people mourn pets; to classes for veterinarians; to tips to help the surviving animals who are grieving their animal friends; to pet psychics and memorial websites. But the reality is that these practices, and related beliefs about animal souls or animal afterlife, generally only extend, with very few exceptions, to certain kinds of animals-pets. Most animals, in most cultures, are not mourned, and the question of an animal afterlife is not contemplated at all.
      Mourning Animalsinvestigates how we mourn animal deaths, which animals are grievable, and what the implications are for all animals.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Abstract: People today, especially in the industrialized and postindustrialized world, live more intimately with nonhuman animals than ever before in history. We share our lives with companion animals in a way that just fifty years ago would have been unheard of. One way to measure this drastic change in our relationships with other animals is to look at the growth of the animal death care industry. According to Brandes, there are over six hundred pet cemeteries in the United States alone, while according to Ambros there are over 900 in Japan.¹ There is even a small but growing movement to allow<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Author(s) VELDKAMP ELMER<br>
  Abstract: In residential neighborhoods in Korea up until the 1980s, dog buyers would roam the area calling out “Sell your dogs, sell your dogs!,” indicating their willingness to pay for privately kept dogs as a source of meat. For many, the divide between pets and nonpets was not a clear-cut line, and the death of dogs, cats, and other animals was not considered something to mourn for.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Author(s) MULLIN CAROLYN MERINO<br>
  Abstract: Virtually every aspect of society—from spam to broken relationships—has been curated in the museum field, and such is the case with mourning and death, albeit few and far between. Just a few thematic institutions exist, like the Museum of Mourning Art at the Arlington Cemetery (no reference to animals, as far as my research indicates) and the Museum of Death in Hollywood, California. The latter has a small gallery dedicated to taxidermy and jarred animal bodies, and the owners’ own potbellied pig, now stuffed, greets visitors as they enter the theater.<br>

  Author(s) KISIEL EMMA<br>
  Abstract: The question of whether or not humans mourn animals is present in all of my photographic work. This theme emerged in my art when I began looking closely at dead animals and making images of roadkill animals, photographing flower and stone memorials I built around their bodies. My recent project, “Another Death,” portrays museum taxidermic animals that have suffered another kind of death after their initial demise. Frozen in time, they are presented either in the throes of death at another creature’s hand or in a limp resting pose, having just passed. Moments like these appear frequently in natural history<br>

  Author(s) AUSTIN JESSICA<br>
  Abstract: Animal shelter employees face each day with the possibility of inhabiting antithetical roles: the caretaker, charged with ensuring the safety and well-being of the wards in their custody; and the executioner, overseer of these same animals’ untimely deaths. With shelter euthanasia estimates reaching three million adoptable animals per year, shelter workers shoulder a considerable burden of grief, resulting in stress and manifesting in depression and even physical complaints, such as sleep disturbance and headaches.¹ While several authors describe coping mechanisms for those whose work involves death, both in general and specifically tailored toward shelter employees, little is written about how<br>

  Book Title: Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy-The Living Art of Michael C. Leff<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Henry David<br>
  Abstract: What distinguishes the study of rhetoric from other pursuits in the liberal arts? From what realms of human existence and expression, of human history, does such study draw its defining character? What, in the end, should be the purposes of rhetorical inquiry? And amid so many competing accounts of discourse, power, and judgment in the contemporary world, how might scholars achieve these purposes through the attitudes and strategies that animate their work?
      Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy: The Living Art of Michael C. Leffoffers answers to these questions by introducing the central insights of one of the most innovative and prolific rhetoricians of the twentieth century, Michael C. Leff. This volume charts Leff 's decades-long development as a scholar, revealing both the variety of topics and the approach that marked his oeuvre, as well as his long-standing critique of the disciplinary assumptions of classical, Hellenistic, renaissance, modern, and postmodern rhetoric.Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy includes a synoptic introduction to the evolution of Leff 's thought from his time as a graduate student in the late 1960s to his death in 2010, as well as specific commentary on twenty-four of his most illuminating essays and lectures.<br>

  Abstract: The narrator of
                  In Search of Lost Timeis beset by trauma. By his own admission, he locates suffering in two maternally marked experiences in his past. The event he cites first is that fateful evening when his “mother abdicated her authority,” in the young Marcel’s bedroom at Combray; the second encompasses the many months during which the narrator observed the slow death of his grandmother.¹ The narrator is anguished: not only did he inflict pain on his mother when he “traced in her soul a first wrinkle and caused a first white hair to appear,” but also he wounded<br>

  Abstract: The 1996 Israeli election reflected the stasis that characterized Israeli politics for the fifteen years following the war in Lebanon. Labor and Likud existed in a kind of symbolic balance. The pragmatic Labor approach gave the party the advantage on “peace,” while Likud’s ideology and myth gave it the advantage on “security” and commitment to Eretz Israel. In this period, the stasis was broken only once, by the election of Yitzhak Rabin, whose personal credibility and gruff style reassured many Israelis that they could have both peace and security. After the death of Rabin, Shimon Peres was unable to marshal<br>

  Author(s): KORTE ALVIN O.<br>
  Abstract: Much knowledge and understanding can be generated from the experiences of everyday life. In this engaging study, Alvin O. Korte examines how this concept applies to Spanish-speaking peoples adapted to a particular locale, specifically the Hispanos and Hispanas of northern New Mexico. Drawing on social philosopher Alfred Schutz's theory of typification, Korte looks at how meaning and identity are crafted by quotidian activities. Incorporating phenomenological and ethnomethodological strategies, the author investigates several aspects of local Hispano culture, including the oral tradition, leave-taking, death and remembrances of the dead, spirituality, and the circle of life. Although avoiding a social-problems approach, the book devotes necessary attention to

  Book Title: Alef, Mem, Tau-Kabbalistic Musings on Time, Truth, and Death<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfson Elliot R.<br>
  Abstract: This highly original, provocative, and poetic work explores the nexus of time, truth, and death in the symbolic world of medieval kabbalah. Demonstrating that the historical and theoretical relationship between kabbalah and western philosophy is far more intimate and extensive than any previous scholar has ever suggested, Elliot R. Wolfson draws an extraordinary range of thinkers such as Frederic Jameson, Martin Heidegger, Franz Rosenzweig, William Blake, Julia Kristeva, Friedrich Schelling, and a host of kabbalistic figures into deep conversation with one another.
      Alef, Mem, Taualso discusses Islamic mysticism and Buddhist thought in relation to the Jewish esoteric tradition as it opens the possibility of a temporal triumph of temporality and the conquering of time through time. The framework for Wolfson's examination is the rabbinic teaching that the wordemet,"truth," comprises the first, middle, and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet,alef, mem,andtau,which serve, in turn, as semiotic signposts for the three tenses of time-past, present, and future. By heeding the letters ofemetwe discern the truth of time manifestly concealed in the time of truth, the beginning that cannot begin if it is to be the beginning, the middle that re/marks the place of origin and destiny, and the end that is the figuration of the impossible disclosing the impossibility of figuration, the finitude of death that facilitates the possibility of rebirth. The time of death does not mark the death of time, but time immortal, the moment of truth that bestows on the truth of the moment an endless beginning of a beginningless end, the truth of death encountered incessantly in retracing steps of time yet to be taken-between, before, beyond.<br>

  Abstract: The precise turn of thought charted in this book opens the possibility of a temporal triumph of temporality, the conquering of time through time.¹ In an effort to pave the way to this possibility, I have explored the nexus of time, truth, and death as it emerges hermeneutically from the symbolic world of medieval kabbalah. I have not adhered to the familiar methodology adopted by scholars of Jewish mysticism, focusing on a particular historical period or individual personality; I have organized my thoughts instead around the letters

  Author(s) Pinto Sarah<br>
  Abstract: In considering languages of grief in relation to languages of certainty, there is a tension in the ways death can be thought of in connection to modern knowledge. On the one hand, we can consider death as that which underlies the possibility of knowledge, as that end point to the fostering or disallowing of life that stands for the modern configuration of power/knowledge (as Foucault [1978] had it). And on the other hand, we can imagine death as that which cannot be spoken in languages of modernity (as de Certeau [1986] suggested). Put differently, this is the distinction between death<br>

  Book Title: Imagining Karma-Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): OBEYESEKERE GANANATH<br>
  Abstract: With
      Imagining Karma,Gananath Obeyesekere embarks on the very first comparison of rebirth concepts across a wide range of cultures. Exploring in rich detail the beliefs of small-scale societies of West Africa, Melanesia, traditional Siberia, Canada, and the northwest coast of North America, Obeyesekere compares their ideas with those of the ancient and modern Indic civilizations and with the Greek rebirth theories of Pythagoras, Empedocles, Pindar, and Plato. His groundbreaking and authoritative discussion decenters the popular notion that India was the origin and locus of ideas of rebirth. As Obeyesekere compares responses to the most fundamental questions of human existence, he challenges readers to reexamine accepted ideas about death, cosmology, morality, and eschatology. Obeyesekere's comprehensive inquiry shows that diverse societies have come through independent invention or borrowing to believe in reincarnation as an integral part of their larger cosmological systems. The author brings together into a coherent methodological framework the thought of such diverse thinkers as Weber, Wittgenstein, and Nietzsche. In a contemporary intellectual context that celebrates difference and cultural relativism, this book makes a case for disciplined comparison, a humane view of human nature, and a theoretical understanding of "family resemblances" and differences across great cultural divides.<br>

  Book Title: After the Massacre-Commemoration and Consolation in Ha My and My Lai<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Faust Drew<br>
  Abstract: Though a generation has passed since the massacre of civilians at My Lai, the legacy of this tragedy continues to reverberate throughout Vietnam and the rest of the world. This engrossing study considers how Vietnamese villagers in My Lai and Ha My-a village where South Korean troops committed an equally appalling, though less well-known, massacre of unarmed civilians-assimilate the catastrophe of these mass deaths into their everyday ritual life. Based on a detailed study of local history and moral practices,
      After the Massacrefocuses on the particular context of domestic life in which the Vietnamese villagers interact with their ancestors on one hand and the ghosts of tragic death on the other. Heonik Kwon explains what intimate ritual actions can tell us about the history of mass violence and the global bipolar politics that caused it. He highlights the aesthetics of Vietnamese commemorative rituals and the morality of their practical actions to liberate the spirits from their grievous history of death. The author brings these important practices into a critical dialogue with dominant sociological theories of death and symbolic transformation.<br>

  Author(s) Faust Drew<br>
  Abstract: To whom do the dead belong? And how must they be claimed? War produces unnatural death, deaths that occur out of place—away from home and kin—and deaths that occur out of time, to the young and strong. Modern war kills more noncombatants than soldiers; death strikes outside the rules meant to contain and rationalize the violence of war. The nations that are war’s agents claim the dead for political purposes and ideologies, wrenching them away from family and leaving deep wounds, turning them into instruments rather than agents of history. Religious tradition is subordinated or expropriated by state<br>

Numerous incidents from past wars are faithfully recorded in these rites, even though the archives and monuments may carry no trace of these incidents. On several occasions, including in the late 1980s and again in the late 1990s, village administrations in the provinces of Quang Nam and Quang Ngai collaborated with researchers from the provincial Communist Party on a survey of wartime casualties. They uncovered many previously unknown incidents, but these surveys left out as many cases as they revealed. People tended to report only the incidents of<br>

  CHAPTER 5  Heroes and Ancestors from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnztv">After the Massacre</a><br>
  Abstract: Ancestors and ghosts are not the only categories of death found in Vietnamese domestic ritual space. In traditional times, these two categories might have been sufficient for conceptually organizing the cosmological mirror of the living world. The rise of the modern nation-state, however, has added a novel category of death to the traditional cosmology of death. Called
                  liet siin Vietnamese, it refers to the heroic death of fallen soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the sacred purpose of protecting the nation. Historians suggest that the institutionalized commemoration of this category constitutes the core of “modern national memory.”¹ In western<br>

  Abstract: The moral identity of mass village war death was ambivalent. It shifted between tragic and heroic, as illustrated by the Ha Gia mass reburial described in the previous chapter. Finding a place for the identity of an individual victim was also uncertain: some believed it should be in the ancestral memorial, whereas some chose its structural opposite. In preparing for a domestic ritual, people imagined that ancestors who experienced tragic death were hesitating between the ancestral shrine and the shrine for ghosts. The memory of mass civilian deaths created relationships with the domain of political hero worship as well as<br>

  Abstract: Heroes, ancestors, and ghosts coexist in the village environment. While revolutionary politics and traditional religious heritage separate them, the three social classes in afterlife associate in popular ritual practices. Although they constitute a hierarchy, the hierarchy that structures their relative values varies at different sites of memory. Their status changes between the state war memorial and the community temple, and the war heroes who occupy the symbolic center in the former are relegated to the margins, outside the village ancestors, in the latter. The position of ghosts also shifts in this movement of memories. The memory of tragic death is<br>

  Abstract: If we consider the history of the Cold War “from above” and reduce it to the doctrine of deterrence, of imagining war in order to prevent war—which has been a dominant paradigm in international history—it appears that political history and the morality of death have no meaningful relationship. If we consider it “from below” instead and include in it the experience of violent political confrontations within local and national communities, which is what the Cold War actually meant in much of the world in the past century, the political bifurcation of the human community and a moral polarization<br>

Bloch, who was attracted to the savagery of some Old Testament stories and who, as his opera

In 529, less than fifty years after his death, his own successors abandoned Athens when Justinian closed the pagan philosophical schools, and although they subsequently returned, they were able to carry on their work only as private individuals.

Indeed, given Baba’s early, lonely death in a strange land (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), his biographers have seldom resisted the trope of Romantic tragedy in describing his turbulent career and sad demise. Nakae Chōmin’s touching reminiscence of his friend and fellow Jiyūtō (Liberal Party) member begins by evoking Baba’s death in the “Meriken” hospital.¹ Yasunaga Gōro starts his rather hagiographic narrative at Baba’s tall grave marker in the Woodlands Cemetery.² The opening pages of Hagihara Nobutoshi’s 1967 biography continue this convention, inviting the reader to imagine Baba’s almost<br>

  Abstract: Georges Bataille and Maurice Blanchot's mutual interest in the Lascaux cave paintings signals their common concern to construct a discourse of origin in relation to art. Both writers consider origin in terms of the anxiety-filled questioning surrounding the ontological and historical aporias that have plagued Western thought, including those that appear under the banner of the Modern and the Postmodern. Both ask: what kind of discourse presides over the disconcerting doubling of reality performed by the first artists?

  Abstract: The Shriek of Silenceis a first in several respects: the first to examine the Holocaust novels in their original languages, the first to articulate a theoretical basis for its approach, and the first phenomenological investigation -- one that attempts to penetrate the process of creation for these novelists. Organized along conceptual lines, the book examines "the word in exile," the themes of death of the father and the child, transformations of the self, and the implications of the reader. Its philosophical foundations are Rosenzweig, Buber, Neher, and Levinas. Its critical approach is shaped by Bakhtin.<br>

                  Messengers32). Many commonly view art as a kind of hubris, whereby a mere mortal assumes or unsurps the role of the Creator to call a world into being.

  Abstract: As he lay dying, Franz Rosenzweig said: “And now it comes, the point of all points, which the Lord has truly revealed to me in my sleep: the point of all points for which there . . .” (Glatzer 174). Thus in the hour of his death the man was blessed with the revelation of what cannot be conveyed, a revelation of what we the living shall have to do without. As Elie Wiesel has written, “The image of God cannot be transmitted; it can be carried away only in death” (

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130jd70">Poetry Of Discovery</a><br>
  Abstract: The work of Francisco Brines exemplifies some of the main features of Spanish poetry in the 1960s. Meditative and philosophical, often centered on the themes of time and death and on the reactions that these evoke, Brines’s poetry is also marked by the very careful and artistic use of seemingly ordinary language. Critics have observed the symbolic nature of his work and its way of giving impact to seemingly common vignettes and expressions by juxtapositions, superpositions, and linguistic devices.¹<br>

  Abstract: At first glance, it might appear that the title of this chapter brings together two mutually exclusive themes. Asceticism, conventionally understood, implies rigorous discipline of body and mind, the adoption of an austere lifestyle, which can lead to the abrogation of desire, expressed as denial and mortification. Eroticism, by contrast, entails the sense of ecstatic rapture that ensues from inspirited indulgence in bodily matters and the full embrace of the sensual. In the case of both, there is a confluence of life and death, albeit from opposite ends of the spectrum: Asceticism promotes the negation of life in the simulation<br>

  Abstract: What is destined to happen to the corpus of Derrida’s works? What fate will befall them? As I will show in Chapter 5, Derrida was anxious about what would happen after his death to his “remains,” in the double sense of his dead body and of the body of his writings, his “corpus.” This anxiety is expressed both in

  CHAPTER 5  Derrida’s Remains from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x01v0">For Derrida</a><br>
  Abstract: In a remarkable passage I have cited in part as an epigraph, Derrida gives, in the fifth of his last seminars, one more definition of
                  l’autre, the other. The concept of the other, as I have partly shown in Chapter 1, plays a crucial role in Derrida’s later writings on ethics, responsibility, politics, friendship, decision, religion, sacrifice, death, and other topics. An example is the long meditation on the phrasetout autre est tout autre, “every other is wholly other,” inThe Gift of Death(GD, 82–115; DM, 114–57).

                     Le toucher, Jean-Luc Nancyis an extremely odd or exceptional work of mourning. It mourns someone who is not yet dead, since Nancy survived his heart transplant operation to persist in what might be called a posthumous life. This has lasted down to the day I am writing this. For this I rejoice. Nancy has survived Derrida’s death to write more about Derrida. As I showed, he is having the last word about matters on which they did not quite agree, now that Derrida cannot answer back.<br>

  Abstract: Loneliness is deepest in the moments when we face the terror of nothing. But nothing rarely appears as itself. Instead, it takes on many different guises. Nonetheless, whatever guise it takes, nothing is the lack that drives us forward on many fronts of our lives. And it seems that all the kinds of nothing are surrogates for death, for nonexistence, the ultimate nothing.<br>

  Book Title: Regard for the Other: Autothanatography in Rousseau, De Quincey, Baudelaire, and Wilde-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burt E. S.<br>
  Abstract: Although much has been written on autobiography, the same cannot be said of autothanatography, the writing of one's death. This study starts from the deconstructive premise that autobiography is aporetic, not or not only a matter of a subject strategizing with language to produce an exemplary identity but a matter also of its responding to an exorbitant call to write its death. The I-dominated representations of particular others and of the privileged other to whom a work is addressed, must therefore be set against an alterity plaguing the I from within or shadowing it from without. This alterity makes itself known in writing as the potential of the text to carry messages that remain secret to the confessing subject. Anticipation of the potential for the confessional text to say what Augustine calls the secret I do not know,the secret of death, engages the autothanatographical subject in a dynamic, inventive, and open-ended process of identification. The subject presented in these texts is not one that has already evolved an interior life that it seeks to reveal to others, but one that speaks to us as still in process. Through its exorbitant response, it gives intimations of an interiority and an ethical existence to come. Baudelaire emerges as a central figure for this understanding of autobiography as autothanatography through his critique of the narcissism of a certain Rousseau, his translation of De Quincey's confessions, with their vertiginously ungrounded subject-in-construction, his artistic practice of self-conscious, thorough-going doubleness, and his service to Wilde as model for an aporetic secrecy. The author discusses the interruption of narrative that must be central to the writing of one's death and addresses the I's dealings with the aporias of such structuring principles as secrecy, Levinasian hospitality, or interiorization as translation. The book makes a strong intervention in the debate over one of the most-read genres of our time.<br>

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, each of her chapters focuses on a different but related issue and cultural sector. Foci include the basic conditions of linguistic meaning in the early modern period, instantiated by Shakespeare's plays and related to modern theories of metaphor; the role of metaphor in the words of eucharistic institution under Archbishop Cranmer; the play of metaphor and metonymy in the writings of Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin and in John Donne's Devotions; the manipulation of these two tropes in the politics of the controversy over ecclesiastical vestments and in its treatment by John Foxe; the abuse of figuration in the house of Edmund Spenser's Busirane, where catachresis, an extreme form of metaphor, is the trope du jour; the conception of metaphor in the Roman rhetorics and their legacy in the sixteenth century; and the concept of exchange in the economic writing of Gerrard de Malynes, merchant and metaphorist in the reigns of Elizabeth and James. What emerges at the end of this book is a heightened critical sense of the dynamic of metaphor in cultural history.<br>

  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, each of her chapters focuses on a different but related issue and cultural sector. Foci include the basic conditions of linguistic meaning in the early modern period, instantiated by Shakespeare's plays and related to modern theories of metaphor; the role of metaphor in the words of eucharistic institution under Archbishop Cranmer; the play of metaphor and metonymy in the writings of Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin and in John Donne's Devotions; the manipulation of these two tropes in the politics of the controversy over ecclesiastical vestments and in its treatment by John Foxe; the abuse of figuration in the house of Edmund Spenser's Busirane, where catachresis, an extreme form of metaphor, is the trope du jour; the conception of metaphor in the Roman rhetorics and their legacy in the sixteenth century; and the concept of exchange in the economic writing of Gerrard de Malynes, merchant and metaphorist in the reigns of Elizabeth and James. What emerges at the end of this book is a heightened critical sense of the dynamic of metaphor in cultural history.<br>

  Author(s) CAPUTO JOHN D.<br>
  Abstract: Who would not want to have an experience of God? But if no one has seen God and lived, who would want to risk it? Would this experience be some very extraordinary and death-defying event, like landing on the moon or being abducted by aliens? Or would it rather be a much calmer, cooler, and more calculating affair, like trying to read extremely complex computer data from the Galileo telescope that only a few highly trained experts can understand? What would “experience” mean if one had an experience of God? For that matter, what would “God” mean if God could<br>

  Abstract: In his own day, at Harvard University at the turn of the twentieth century, Josiah Royce was one of America’s premier philosophical exports, as well as a prominent interpreter of European and Asian thought to a domestic audience. Royce and his colleague William James were probably the two most prominent figures in American philosophy. Indeed, the arguments between Royce and James were played out for an international audience in numerous lectures, publications, and classrooms (the dialogue is evident, for example, in their respective Gifford Lectures, delivered between 1898 and 1902).¹ But after Royce’s death, and after two world wars, the<br>

  Book Title: Technologies of Life and Death: From Cloning to Capital Punishment-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oliver Kelly<br>
  Abstract: The central aim of this book is to approach contemporary problems raised by technologies of life and death as ethical issues that call for a more nuanced approach than mainstream philosophy can provide. To do so, it draws on the recently published seminars of Jacques Derrida to analyze the extremes of birth and dying insofar as they are mediated by technologies of life and death. With an eye to reproductive technologies, it shows how a deconstructive approach can change the very terms of contemporary debates over technologies of life and death, from cloning to surrogate motherhood to capital punishment, particularly insofar as most current discussions assume some notion of a liberal individual. The ethical stakes in these debates are never far from political concerns such as enfranchisement, citizenship, oppression, racism, sexism, and the public policies that normalize them. Technologies of Life and Death thus provides pointers for rethinking dominant philosophical and popular assumptions about nature and nurture, chance and necessity, masculine and feminine, human and animal, and what it means to be a mother or a father. In part, the book seeks to disarticulate a tension between ethics and politics that runs through these issues in order to suggest a more ethical politics by turning the force of sovereign violence back against itself. In the end, it proposes that deconstructive ethics with a psychoanalytic supplement can provide a corrective for moral codes and political cliches that turn us into mere answering machines.<br>

  Abstract: If we interpret deconstruction as a form of translation as transference, we have moved into the territory of psychoanalysis. Indeed, if poetic majesty acts to unseat sovereign majesty through the cut that carries with it rebirth, as in the story of Little Red Riding Hood, then psychoanalysis may be the discourse best equipped for articulating the dynamics of this wound that is also a source of life. In other words, psychoanalysis may provide the tools with which to analyze the thorny relationship between violence and life, particularly through the concepts of death drive and sublimation.

  Abstract: Can animals be sentenced to death? Can they be assassinated, or become victims of genocide? Certainly in our common parlance, these dubious rights are reserved for man; murder, assassination, genocide, and the death penalty are proper to man alone. Even in death, we insist upon separating ourselves from the animals. Yet our practices suggest otherwise. Animals are regularly killed for “crimes” committed against humans. For example, recently in Switzerland a swan was killed for trying to drown a swimmer by sitting on him; and dogs are regularly “put down” if they are considered dangerous.

  Book Title: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Timothy<br>
  Abstract: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics presents a decade of thought about the origins and possibilities of political theory from one of contemporary Italy's most prolific and engaging political theorists, Roberto Esposito. He has coined a number of critical concepts in current debates about the past, present, and future of biopolitics-from his work on the implications of the etymological and philosophical kinship of community (communitas) and immunity (immunitas) to his theorizations of the impolitical and the impersonal. Taking on interlocutors from throughout the Western philosophical tradition, from Aristotle and Augustine to Weil, Arendt, Nancy, Foucault, and Agamben, Esposito announces the eclipse of a modern political lexicon-"freedom," "democracy," "sovereignty," and "law"-that, in its attempt to protect human life, has so often produced its opposite (violence, melancholy, and death). Terms of the Political calls for the opening of political thought toward a resignification of these and other operative terms-such as "community," "immunity," "biopolitics," and "the impersonal"-in ways that affirm rather than negate life. An invaluable introduction to the breadth and rigor of Esposito's thought, the book will also welcome readers already familiar with Esposito's characteristic skill in overturning and breaking open the language of politics.<br>

  Abstract: Humankind has always seen community and violence as inherently related. Such a relation is, in fact, at the heart of the most important expressions of culture across history, be they of art, literature, or philosophy. The first graffiti etched in prehistoric grottoes depicted the human community through scenes of violence (hunting, sacrifice, battles). So too would war be the theme of the first great poem of Western civilization. Almost all world literatures, from the Hebrew to the Egyptian to the Indian, open with interhuman conflict and its images of violence and death to confirm for us a connection between community<br>

  Abstract: In his essay “The Uncanny,” Sigmund Freud describes the uncanny as what is concealed and frightening in the familiar and agreeable or vice versa.¹ He moves from discussing animated dolls, the Sandman’s fear of losing his eyes as castration anxiety, doubles and mirrors, fear of death, dear of the dark, to the mother’s body. In general, he attributes uncanny sensations to castration anxiety (whether from seeing the mother’s “castrated sex” or as symbolically represented by pecked out eyes) and the return, or repetition, of repressed childhood fears or desires.² Specifically, he links the uncanny to the reanimation of that which<br>

  Abstract: Styles of Pietyexplores questions of value in light of the problem of nihilism articulated in Nietzsche’s pronouncement of the death of God. With the accomplishment of a thoroughly rationalized world, the categories that had promised to give meaning to experience proved untenable. The problem of the irrational appeared to be immanent to reason rather than merely an aberration from its proper functions, the aspirations of philosophy appeared to be inherently contradictory, and its ideals seemed to harbor coercive deceptions and tyrannies. Nevertheless, philosophers since Nietzsche have continued to pursue questions of value; indeed, they have found new avenues to<br>

With the accomplishment of a thoroughly rationalized world, the categories that had promised to give meaning to experience proved untenable. The problem of the irrational appeared to be immanent to reason rather than merely an aberration from its proper functions, the aspirations of philosophy appeared to be inherently contradictory, and its ideals seemed to harbor coercive deceptions and tyrannies. Nevertheless, philosophers since Nietzsche have continued to pursue questions of value; indeed, they have found new avenues to<br>

  ONE  MARCEL’S REFLECTIVE METHOD from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0ckp">Doing Philosophy Personally: Thinking about Metaphysics, Theism, and Antiblack Racism</a><br>
  Abstract: Gabriel Marcel’s theistic philosophy traditionally has been labeled as a form of religious existentialism. While this is an accurate description of Marcel’s philosophy, I prefer to describe his philosophy as a sort of
                  reflective method. This way of describing his philosophy allows us to trace it back to its Kantian transcendentalist roots. Once we recognize the Kantian transcendentalist roots of his reflective method, we can better appreciate why he performs a detailed examination of the meaningfulness of human existence through such detrimental, life-affirming, or life-altering events as the death of a loved one, religious faith, despair, communion, hope, and love:<br>

  Abstract: Reports of the “death of the author” in the closing decades of the twentieth century nowadays appear to have been greatly exaggerated. His (sometimes her) presumed demise, to be sure, was strategically useful, not merely in renewing the formalist critique of the intentional fallacy, but also in laying to rest the naive assumption of a unified, autonomous self essentially apart from history and in full control of the unconscious.

  Abstract: Laughter first: legend tells us that Brünnhilde laughed in exultation upon witnessing (or, in some versions, upon hearing of) the death of Siegfried. Brünnhilde’s laughter recurs in most of the sources for her story; in the three versions of the Eddie Sigurd poems, one source (

  Abstract: The theme of resurrection does not seem, on the face of it, to play a major role in Blanchot. At least it is only rarely encountered in the so-called “theoretical” texts. It may be more frequent in the narratives, but in them it is harder to isolate themes per se. Yet resurrection is indissociable in that work from death and dying, with which we are more used to associating the name

  Book Title: Intention Interpretation-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): ISEMINGER GARY<br>
  Abstract: "...an excellent and comprehensive discussion of a debate that was initiated in this century in William Wimsatt's and Monroe C. Beardsley's influential article 'The Intentional Fallacy.'...this is a splendidly conceived and very useful collection of essays. Readers will want to take issue with the arguments of individual authors, but this is to be expected in a volume at the cutting edge of a fertile philosophical controversy." --David Novitz, The Philosophical Quarterly "What is the connection, if any, between the author's intentions in (while) writing a work of literature and the truth (acceptability, validity) of interpretive statements about it?" With this question, Gary Isminger introduces a literary debate that has been waged for the past four decades and is addressed by philosophers and literary theorists in Intention and Interpretation. Thirteen essays discuss the role of appeals to the author's intention in interpreting works of literature. A well-known argument by E.D. Hirsch serves as the basic text, in which he defends the appeal to the author's intention against Wimsatt and Beardsley's claim that such an appeal involved "the intentional fallacy." The essays, mostly commissioned by the editor, explore the presuppositions and consequences of arguing for the importance of the author's intentions in the way Hirsch does. Connections emerge between this issue and many fundamental issues in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind as well as in aesthetics. The (old) "New Criticism" and current Post-Structuralism tend to agree in disenfranchising the author, and many people now are disinclined even to consider the alternative. Hirsch demurs, and arguments like his deserve the careful attention, both from critics and sympathizers, that they receive here. Literary scholars and philosophers who are sympathetic to Continental as well as to Anglo-American styles of philosophy are among the contributors. "This is a timely book appearing as it does when postmodernist views of the death of the author are disappearing quickly from the scene. As a collection it exemplifies the best work that is being done on this problem at the moment, and it will no doubt inspire further debate." --The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism "[T]his volume contains important articles illuminating the central debate over the role and relevance of authorial intentions in literary interoperation." --British Journal of Aesthetics<br>

  Author(s) SHUSTERMAN RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: One of the most salient and powerful trends in the last few decades of literary theory has been the attempt to discredit and displace the traditional project of intentionalist interpretation, the idea that the meaning of a text is to be identified with or found in the intention of its author. Intentionalism surely suffered a sharp and more than momentary blow with the rise of the New Criticism and its influential doctrine of the intentional fallacy, articulated by Wimsatt and Beardsley.¹ But more recent and perhaps still more devastating have been the poststructuralist doctrine of “the death of the Author,”<br>

  Book Title: The Roots Of Thinking-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sheets-Johnstone Maxine<br>
  Abstract: "A significant contribution to the study of early humans, this book is a philosophical anthropology.... it makes genuinely novel, and highly persuasive, claims within the field itself." --David Depew In this ground-breaking interdisciplinary study about conceptual origins, Maxine Sheets-Johnstone shows that there is an indissoluble bond between hominid thinking and hominid evolution, a bond cemented by the living body. Her thesis is concretely illustrated in eight paleoanthropological case studies ranging from tool-using/tool-making to counting, sexuality, representation, language, death, and cave art. In each case, evidence is brought forward that shows how thinking is modeled on the body-specifically, how concepts are generated by animate form and the tactile-kinesthetic experience. Later chapters critically examine key theoretical and methodological issues posed by the thesis, Sheets-Johnstone demonstrates in detail how and why a corporeal turn in philosophy and the human sciences can yield insights no less extraordinary than those produced by the linguistic turn. In confronting the currently popular doctrine of cultural relativism and the classic Western metaphysical dualism of mind and body, she shows how pan-cultural invariants of human bodily life have been discounted and how the body itself has not been given its due. By a precise exposition of how a full-scale hermeneutics and a genetic phenomenology may be carried out with respect to conceptual origins, she shows how methodological issues are successfully resolved. "Ranging across the humanities and sciences, this thoroughly original book challenges both traditional metaphysics and contemporary cultural relativism. In their place, it persuasively develops a phenomenonological, tactile-kinesthetic account of the origins of thinking. This philosophical anthropology could not be more timely. It replaces the 'linguistic turn' with a promising new 'corporeal turn.'" --John J. Stuhr, University of Oregon "This work takes a much-needed stand in the inter-disciplinary field of philosophical anthropology. Sheets-Johnstone is well-read in the history of philosophy and in contemporary anthropology. The point of view she offers is inventive, insightful, well-established, and fruitful." --Thomas M. Alexander, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale<br>

Nevertheless, work against the death penalty is no mere add-on, some “extra-issue” to be raised.

  Book Title: Conrad's Marlow-Narrative and death in 'Youth', Heart of Darkness, Lord Jim and Chance<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wake Paul<br>
  Abstract: Variously described as ‘the average pilgrim’, a ‘wanderer’, and ‘a Buddha preaching in European clothes’, Charlie Marlow is the voice behind Joseph Conrad’s ‘Youth’ (1898), Heart of Darkness (1899), Lord Jim (1900) and Chance (1912). Conrad’s Marlow offers a comprehensive account and critical analysis of one of Conrad’s most celebrated creations, asking both who and what is Marlow: a character or a narrator, a biographer or an autobiographical screen, a messenger or an interpreter, a bearer of truth or a misguided liar? Reading Conrad’s fiction alongside the work of Walter Benjamin, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida and Martin Heidegger, and offering an investigation into the connection between narrative and death, this book argues that Marlow’s essence is located in his liminality – in his constantly shifting position – and that the emergence of meaning in his stories is at all points bound up with the process of his storytelling.<br>

From the moment that Marlow steps into the shoes of Fresleven, his murdered predecessor, ‘killed in a scuffle with the natives’, the death toll rises: Marlow variously recalls: a Swede who hangs himself, discarded slaves ‘dying slowly … in the greenish gloom’, an ‘invalid agent from up-country’ dying in a corner of the accountant’s office, a ‘middle-aged<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155j9p3">Conrad's Marlow</a><br>
  Abstract: Heart of Darkness, as even the most cursory of readings will reveal, is a novel that is preoccupied with death: its 118 pages are littered with representations of the dying and the dead, and death is referred to on almost every second page. From the moment that Marlow steps into the shoes of Fresleven, his murdered predecessor, ‘killed in a scuffle with the natives’, the death toll rises: Marlow variously recalls: a Swede who hangs himself, discarded slaves ‘dying slowly … in the greenish gloom’, an ‘invalid agent from up-country’ dying in a corner of the accountant’s office, a ‘middle-aged<br>

  Book Title: Conrad's Marlow-Narrative and death in 'Youth', Heart of Darkness, Lord Jim and Chance<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wake Paul<br>
  Abstract: Variously described as ‘the average pilgrim’, a ‘wanderer’, and ‘a Buddha preaching in European clothes’, Charlie Marlow is the voice behind Joseph Conrad’s ‘Youth’ (1898), Heart of Darkness (1899), Lord Jim (1900) and Chance (1912). Conrad’s Marlow offers a comprehensive account and critical analysis of one of Conrad’s most celebrated creations, asking both who and what is Marlow: a character or a narrator, a biographer or an autobiographical screen, a messenger or an interpreter, a bearer of truth or a misguided liar? Reading Conrad’s fiction alongside the work of Walter Benjamin, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida and Martin Heidegger, and offering an investigation into the connection between narrative and death, this book argues that Marlow’s essence is located in his liminality – in his constantly shifting position – and that the emergence of meaning in his stories is at all points bound up with the process of his storytelling.<br>

  INTRODUCTION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jb3s">The subject of love</a><br>
  Abstract: To a considerable extent Western cultures now live with and through the knowledge that there is no ‘outside’ or ‘beyond’, no ontological site of absolute certainty, no absolute authority at all that can be the basis of an appeal to a permanent, or even a stable truth. In other words we live with, if not the knowledge
                  per se, then perhaps the effects of the ‘death of God’. Yet, for all that the institutions of religions have supposedly been revealed as being founded upon illusory ideologies, little more than the exercise of Nietzsche’s will-to-power, there is nonetheless an apparent revivification<br>

  Author(s) BEST VICTORIA<br>
  Abstract: The novels of Louise Lambrichs are brilliant but troubling psychological dramas focusing on the traumas that inhabit the family romance: incest, sterility, the death of those we love and the terrible legacy of mourning. Bringing together themes of loss and recompense, Lambrichs’s novels trace with in fi nite delicacy the reactions of those who suffer and seek obsessively for comfort and understanding. But equally they perform a subtle and often chilling evocation of the secrets, lies and crimes that bind a family together and create a pattern of behaviour that can motivate or cripple subsequent generations.

  Author(s) Higton Mike<br>
  Abstract: Hans Frei (1922–1988) was born to a secular Jewish family in Berlin. As Nazi anti-Semitism increased, he first was sent away to a Quaker school in England, and then emigrated with his family to New York. Somewhere along the way he became a Christian, and he eventually studied theology at Yale. After a period as a Baptist minister, and then as an Episcopal priest, he completed a doctoral thesis on Karl Barth at Yale under H. Richard Niebuhr. Soon afterward he returned to teach at Yale, where he remained until his death in 1988.<br>

  Abstract: Jesus was born around 7 or 6 BCE, shortly before the death in 4 BCE of Herod the Great (who, incidentally, practiced state terrorism). He seems to have started his ministry at the age of thirty-three or thirty-four, after his baptism by John the Baptist, probably in 27 or 28 CE. The gospels cover about two and a half years of Jesus’s life. On April 6 or 7 of the year 30 CE, at the age of thirty-six, he was arrested and crucified.<br>

  Abstract: Were I writing my book in the nineteenth century, I could have come with a typically explicit title such as “The Retrospectively Set Birth Stories in the Beginning of Jesus’s Ministry by Matthew and Luke.” As I said earlier, the gospels are written from the perspective of the death and resurrection of their main character, so that the end is the beginning and the beginning is the end. In other words, for the evangelists, Jesus’s death was no ordinary death, and so his birth was no ordinary birth.¹<br>

  16  Jesus and the Resurrection from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jm7q">Jesus the Central Jew</a><br>
  Abstract: A number of texts in the Scriptures present death as irremediable (see Pss 49:20; 88:9; Job 7:9–10; 14:7–22), but for Dan 12 and the “intertestamental” literature, faith in resurrection is a certainty (see 1 Enoch 51:1; 92:3–5; 2 Macc 7; 14:46; Wis. Sol. 2–4; 4 Ezra 7:32). In Jesus’s time, most Jews believed in the resurrection of the dead. Mark 12:18–27 (// Luke 20:27–38) reports Jesus’s rebuke of the Sadducees about this issue.¹ The entire New Testament presupposes Jesus’s resurrection. The gospel shows the disciples unanimously believing that Jesus, their Master, is alive and<br>

  Author(s) Lappenga Benjamin J.<br>
  Abstract: The editorial comment in John 2:17 (“His disciples remembered that it was written, ‘Zeal for your house will consume me’”) interrupts the narrative flow between the account of Jesus’s actions in the temple (vv. 14–16) and the inquiry by “the Jews”¹ as to what sign Jesus gives for acting as he does (v. 18). Interpreters disagree about the significance and function of the citation of Ps 69:9 in verse 17, but most agree that “will consume” (καταφάγεται) is a reference to Jesus’s death, and nearly all agree that “zeal for your house” (ὁ ζῆλος τοῦ οἴκου σου) refers to<br>

  Abstract: On 12 October 1992, a major earthquake (

In addition to the human casualties, 211 mosques crumbled and 1,087 schools and 5,004 buildings fell—damage that was exacerbated by extensive aftershocks (Blin 1993, 399; El Kadi 1993). The earthquake damaged 64 percent of all dwellings and 66 percent of all housing in the governorate of Cairo; the historic districts in the western part of the governorate were the hardest hit (Kamel 1994, 216).

  Book Title: Experiencing Scripture-Intimacy with Ancient Text and Modern Faith<br>
  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Antony F<br>
  Abstract: This book aims to enable a user to become closely familiar with a limited number of Older Testament texts and so be in a position to form judgments about them and, resulting from that, to have an under- standing of the nature of biblical text itself. Beyond this, the reality that these are key texts for the understanding of the Bible means that they have fundamental impact for the basics of faith today our understanding of ourselves before God, essential to faith in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Israel's prophets reflect on the role of God in human life; faith in God's love, God's passion for justice, the essential place of fidelity in faith. Israel's foundational narratives explore the nature of human lives before God; they include issues such as creation, human freedom, and faith in God's unshakeable commitment to human life. Alongside these concerns, there is the importance of getting a feel for the nature of scripture.<br>

  Abstract: The Olympic Games in Beijing had a traditional commencement: the opening ceremony was held on the eighth day of the eighth month in the year 2008, beginning at eight minutes past eight pm. In Chinese tradition the number eight is a lucky number. The sound of the number eight is

  Author(s) Edwards Denis<br>
  Abstract: For many people in Australia and New Zealand, the death of Jesus on a Roman cross constitutes a problem of integrity in their life of faith. They ask: how could a loving God send the divine Son to be tortured to death? The theology of redemption they have imbibed involves God willing the death of Jesus on a cross as the means of our salvation. The biblical texts which say that Jesus ‘must’ suffer (Mk 8:31; Lk 24:26) are understood to mean that there was a divine requirement for the cruel death on the cross. This forms a pastoral problem<br>

  Abstract: The special law of the sixth commandment—in other words, its inability to be proposed as an absolute prohibition—finds a crucial touchstone in the absolute nature of its very object: death and its irreversibility. To kill is to mete out death. In the other commandments, life is not the issue, and the consequence of transgression is not irrecoverable. If I rob, I can restitute or repay. If I give false testimony, I can retract it. But for death—at least on the plane of earthly existence—there is no remedy. For whoever has a mortal body, to kill strikes<br>

Born not of woman but created by God on the sixth day, Adam and Eve live in the Garden of Eden in a state that knows no sorrow, no toil, and, above all, no death. Already freed from the human condition of being born an infant, Edenic humanity is also missing the fundamental characteristic recognized as human by nearly all cultures: mortality.

Even though Eve has an important role in the Edenic scene of sin that establishes humanity as a mortal species, the homicidal and fratricidal act that initiates human history provides for no woman. Something analogous happens to Pandora, the first woman according to Hesiod, from whose belly is born death in addition to other ills for the human race: the lineage that then descends from her is exclusively male, often brothers or those united in the warrior brotherhoods, whose<br>

  Book Title: Kierkegaard and Death-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): BUBEN ADAM<br>
  Abstract: Few philosophers have devoted such sustained, almost obsessive attention to the topic of death as Søren Kierkegaard. Kierkegaard and Death brings together new work on Kierkegaard's multifaceted discussions of death and provides a thorough guide to the development, in various texts and contexts, of Kierkegaard's ideas concerning death. Essays by an international group of scholars take up essential topics such as dying to the world, living death, immortality, suicide, mortality and subjectivity, death and the meaning of life, remembrance of the dead, and the question of the afterlife. While bringing Kierkegaard's philosophy of death into focus, this volume connects Kierkegaard with important debates in contemporary philosophy.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz6m3">Kierkegaard and Death</a><br>
  Author(s) Connell George<br>
  Abstract: Among the endlessly repeated motifs of the horror genre, none more reliably evokes a shudder than the idea of the undead, of humans doomed to wander between life and death. This response has a variety of deep psychological sources. Our anxiety in the face of our own mortality plays a part, as does a physiological revulsion to decaying bodies. Further, the sense of the living dead as ontologically other evokes in us a sense of numinous dread. Following Mary Douglas, the way such beings transgress the boundary separating life and death renders them both dangerous and impure.¹<br>

  Abstract: Confessing in this journal entry from 1848 that, without dying willingly, death would have prevailed over him, Kierkegaard discloses how a life of suffering has prevented death from laying its claim to one who was already dead.

He asks for six citizens to step forward to be hanged. The mayor and five others advance with halters around their necks. This fright snaps us alert—not just to cruelty, but to our mortality. And within a page, Melville assures us that a philosopher, sitting by the fire contemplating death, can be as aware, afraid, and deeply cognizant of death as anyone mounting a gallows. We all<br>

  Abstract: This short chapter is faceted to one text—Kierkegaard’s “At a Graveside.” While Kierkegaard’s thoughts on death spill across his corpus, I believe that this nonpseudonymous discourse, published in 1845, is his most straightforward and sustained reflection on what might be termed Kierkegaard’s account of “Being-towards-death.” Drawing a comparison with Tolstoy, I submit that for all the epiphanies in these pellucid pages, there is something lacking. There are other lessons to be drawn.<br>

The refusal to think about death, and specifically its association with sadness and pain for those left behind, is a constant theme in the history of philosophy. The image of Socrates presented inPhaedo,happy to accept his own death, is emblematic of the philosopher who has learned how to die.

While bringing Kierkegaard's philosophy of death into focus, this volume connects Kierkegaard with important debates in contemporary philosophy.<br>

  1.  Knights and Knaves of the Living Dead: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz6m3">Kierkegaard and Death</a><br>
  Author(s) Connell George<br>
  Abstract: Among the endlessly repeated motifs of the horror genre, none more reliably evokes a shudder than the idea of the undead, of humans doomed to wander between life and death. This response has a variety of deep psychological sources. Our anxiety in the face of our own mortality plays a part, as does a physiological revulsion to decaying bodies. Further, the sense of the living dead as ontologically other evokes in us a sense of numinous dread. Following Mary Douglas, the way such beings transgress the boundary separating life and death renders them both dangerous and impure.¹<br>

  Author(s) Podmore Simon D.<br>
  Abstract: Confessing in this journal entry from 1848 that, without dying willingly, death would have prevailed over him, Kierkegaard discloses how a life of suffering has prevented death from laying its claim to one who was already dead. Kierkegaard’s appropriation of the Latin aphorism further expresses an integral spiritual dialectic at the heart of Lutheran<br>

  Abstract: Midway through his fluid meditations in
                  Moby Dick,Melville presents us with a particularly hair-raising incident. A fourteenth-century British commander has conquered a French town and demands his fair tribute in victory. He asks for six citizens to step forward to be hanged. The mayor and five others advance with halters around their necks. This fright snaps us alert—not just to cruelty, but to our mortality. And within a page, Melville assures us that a philosopher, sitting by the fire contemplating death, can be as aware, afraid, and deeply cognizant of death as anyone mounting a gallows. We all<br>

  Author(s) Marino Gordon D.<br>
  Abstract: This short chapter is faceted to one text—Kierkegaard’s “At a Graveside.” While Kierkegaard’s thoughts on death spill across his corpus, I believe that this nonpseudonymous discourse, published in 1845, is his most straightforward and sustained reflection on what might be termed Kierkegaard’s account of “Being-towards-death.” Drawing a comparison with Tolstoy, I submit that for all the epiphanies in these pellucid pages, there is something lacking.

Often enfolded within such orientations to the potential sacredness of human suffering are associated moral experiences and ethical concerns.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzg4q">The Year's Work at the Zombie Research Center</a><br>
  Author(s) RUTHVEN ANDREA<br>
  Abstract: While Julia Kristeva doubtless did not have in mind the undead corpse of the zombie when she wrote of the abject and how it forces death upon the living, the walking dead undeniably embody abjection. It is not strange, then, that in representations of zombies, in film, literature, television, or other media, the primary focus is on how the humans who have not been infected confront and battle those who have returned from the dead. Those who engage in zombie fighting are necessarily confronting and denying the death (among other things) that the posthuman monster represents. This analysis of Seth<br>

  Book Title: The Incarnate Lord-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): WHITE THOMAS JOSEPH<br>
  Abstract: The Incarnate Lord, then, considers central themes in Christology from a metaphysical perspective. Particular attention is given to the hypostatic union, the two natures of Christ, the knowledge and obedience of Jesus, the passion and death of Christ, his descent into hell, and resurrection. A central concern of the book is to argue for the perennial importance of ontological principles of Christology inherited from patristic and scholastic authors. However, the book also seeks to advance an interpretation of Thomistic Christology in a modern context. The teaching Aquinas, then, is central to the study, but it is placed in conversation with various modern theologians, such as Karl Barth, Karl Rahner and Hans Urs von Balthasar. Ultimately the goal of the work is to suggest how traditional Catholic theology might thrive under modern conditions, and also develop fruitfully from engaging in contemporary controversies.<br>

  6  The Obedience of the Son from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16ptn5b">The Incarnate Lord</a><br>
  Abstract: The first half of this book examined the mystery of the incarnation. What does it mean to say that Jesus of Nazareth is the incarnate Lord? The second half examines the mystery of the redemption. What does it mean to say that Jesus of Nazareth is the crucified Lord? The considerations of this part of the book proceed in two main parts. Chapters 6–8 examine Aquinas’s understanding of the obedience, passion, and death of Christ, each in conversation with modern kenotic Christology. The modern kenotic tradition has focused upon the Paschal mystery as the primary locus of Trinitarian revelation.<br>

  8  The Death of Christ and the Mystery of the Cross from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16ptn5b">The Incarnate Lord</a><br>
  Abstract: In the Prolegomenon to this book, I argued that modern Christology has been characterized by two important challenges: how should we respond to the Kantian critique of classical metaphysics? How might theologians employ modern historical-critical studies of the person of Jesus of Nazareth? Both topics impact the theology of the incarnation, but they affect the theology of the redemption as well. How should we understand the saving character of the death of Christ?<br>

  10  The Ontology of the Resurrection from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16ptn5b">The Incarnate Lord</a><br>
  Abstract: Our study of the being of Christ would be incomplete without a consideration of his resurrection. What can we say about the glorification of his human nature that took place after his death? This depends in part upon what we take human nature to be. I have argued in the prolegomenon to this book that modern theology is often bifurcated. On the one side there is the tendency to reduce Christology to a form of idealized anthropology. Schleiermacher and Rahner provide models of this form of reflection. On the other side there is the theological assimilation of all natural forms<br>

  John as Witness and Friend from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16ptndz">John, Jesus, and History, Volume 2</a><br>
  Author(s) Coloe Mary<br>
  Abstract: The Fourth Gospel is the most historical of all the Gospels. While it has been entitled “the spiritual Gospel,” its depth of spiritual insight does not in any way detract from its focus on the actual life and death of Jesus of Nazareth.¹ In fact, this Gospel proclaims that history is now the locus of the divine presence. In the flesh of Jesus, we have the eternal Word of God. For this reason, history is now radiant with the glory of God: “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the<br>

  Aspects of Historicity in John 1–4: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16ptndz">John, Jesus, and History, Volume 2</a><br>
  Author(s) Koester Craig R.<br>
  Abstract: The manner in which modern scholars investigate questions of historicity is one that the Fourth Evangelist would find peculiar. In contemporary research, the historical Jesus is the pre-Easter Jesus, and questions of historicity focus on how much we can know about the ministry of Jesus prior to his death. The writer of the Fourth Gospel, however, assumes that truly understanding the pre-Easter Jesus involves a post-Easter perspective. At points this Gospel specifically draws later insights into the meaning of Jesus’ words and actions and acknowledges that Jesus said and did things that were not understood prior to his resurrection (John<br>

  Abstract: Caring for the ill is a great moral task that brings into sharp relief our convictions about life and death. Not only does such care place the caregiver in unavoidable proximity to profound questions, but also the acts of care themselves reveal the nature of deeply held assumptions. Even the language that forms our descriptions of illness indicates some level of how we conceive of illness; our descriptions of illness also indicate how we understand the significance of life when it is in good health. In short, the words used for illness carry strong interpretive and evaluative power.<br>

  Author(s) Wood Nigel<br>
  Abstract: In
                     A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Lysander realises early in the action that lovers resemble poets and the mad in that they have access to perceptions that confound common sensibilities. Any ‘sympathy in choice’ is prey to ‘war, death, or sickness’, rendering it ‘momentany as a sound’,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1729w4d">The Renaissance of emotion</a><br>
  Author(s) Meek Richard<br>
  Abstract: In Act 1 Scene 3 of
                  Richard II, Mowbray describes his sorrow at being banished from England, calling his sentence a ‘speechless death’ that will prevent his tongue from ‘breathing native breath’ (1.3.172–3). Yet Mowbray’s eloquent lament fails to influence the monarch who has banished him; as King Richard says, ‘It boots thee not to be compassionate. / After our sentence, plaining comes too late’ (1.3.174–5). Richard suggests that Mowbray’s speech is a deliberate attempt to move him to mercy and compassion, but that the complaint is belated and ineffective.¹ At this point in the play, then, Richard<br>

  Author(s) Bain Frederika<br>
  Abstract: A brief anecdote appears in the
                  Mémoiresof the valet of Louis XVI: on being informed of his coming execution, the monarch requested the account of the death of Charles I in Hume’sHistory of England(1754–61), which he read over for days leading up to the event. ‘Louis would appear to be using Hume’s narrative’, the historian Donald Siebert suggests in recounting the story, ‘as a script for his own imminent tragic performance.’¹ Apparently the effort was successful, as his affect and mien at the guillotine were praised for their grace and regal quality.

  Author(s) Putinaitė Nerija<br>
  Abstract: Stereotypes about Christianity and attitudes of Christians toward public action were engrained into the minds of Lithuanian people during the Soviet regime and are evident in contemporary Lithuania. As clearly outlined in the chapters by Streikus and Šimkunas, the Soviet ideological apparatus sought to annihilate the influence of Christianity from the lives of people. From the beginning of the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in 1940–1941, and especially from 1944 until Stalin’s death in 1953, the Christian churches in Lithuania were brutally attacked as “the biggest obstacle to the smooth sovietisation of the occupied country.”¹ Many priests were deported, parishioners<br>

  Book Title: Keeping the Feast-Metaphors of Sacrifice in 1 Corinthians and Philippians<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Patterson Jane Lancaster<br>
  Abstract: Patterson uses cognitive metaphor theory to trace the apostle Paul's use of metaphors from the Jewish sacrificial system in his moral counsels to the Philippians and the Corinthians. In these letters, Paul moves from the known (the practice of sacrifice) to the unknown (how to live in accord with the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ). Patterson illustrates that the significant sacrificial metaphors in 1 Corinthians and Philippians are not derived from Jewish sacrifices of atonement, but rather from the Passover and sacrifices of thanksgiving. Attention to these metaphors demonstrates that imagery drawn from these sacrifices shapes the overall moral counsel of the letters, reveals more varied and nuanced interpretations of sacrificial references in Paul's letters, and sheds light on Paul's continuity with Jewish cultic practice.<br>

  Abstract: A common response to transgression is confusion about how one goes about the process of forgiveness and, perhaps more centrally, whether one should forgive at all (Tracy 1999; Mullet, Girard, and Bakhshi 2004). Consider Simon Wiesenthal’s

  Abstract: Over one hundred years after the first Futurist manifesto, the historical avant-garde looks like an oddity that died long ago. Perhaps nothing has served the avant-garde better than its own death. In death, the avant-garde is memorialized and archived. Its antiart position has been absorbed by the art world, and its logics inform mass culture and high art alike. Although the historical avant-garde failed to make good on revolutionary ideals, avant-garde logics continue to evolve and diversify across our entire cultural media landscape, from Dada to Monty Python and Saturday

And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death—even death on a cross.”¹ This radically personal God, who willingly accepts radical kenotic constraints in order to dwell among humankind, shares fully in human vulnerability—including death—in order to make<br>

  Book Title: The Adventures of Jonathan Dennis-Bicultural Film Archiving Practice in Aotearoa New Zealand<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kelly Emma Jean<br>
  Abstract: Jonathan Dennis (1953-2002), was the creative and talented founding director of the New Zealand Film Archive. As a Pakeha (non-Maori/indigenous New Zealander) with a strong sense of social justice, Dennis became a conduit for tension and debate over the preservation and presentation of indigenous and non-indigenous film archival materials from the time the Archive opened in 1981. His work resulted in a film archive and curatorship practice which differed significantly from that of the North American and European archives he originally sought to emulate. He supported a philosophical shift in archival practice by engaging indigenous peoples in developing creative and innovative exhibitions from the 1980s until his death, recognizing that much of the expertise required to work with archival materials rested with the communities outside archival walls. This book presents new interviews gathered by the author, as well as an examination of existing interviews, films and broadcasts about and with Jonathan Dennis, to consider the narrative of a life and work in relation to film archiving.<br>

Some victims were hanged or burned to death; often men’s genitals were mutilated. Later, during the civil-rights struggles of the 1960s, reincarnations of the Klan spread terror and death, burning buses, clubbing demonstrators, and bombing homes and churches. Today we see another white racist movement, with Klansmen joined by neo-Nazis, racist skinheads, and members of intensely racist churches.

  Book Title: A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VENEMA HENRY ISAAC<br>
  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's entire philosophical project narrates a passion for the possibleexpressed in the hope that in spite of death, closure, and sedimentation, life is opened by superabundance, by how the world gives us much more than is possible. Ricoeur's philosophical anthropology is a phenomenology of human capacity, which gives onto the groundless ground of human being, namely, God. Thus the story of the capable man, beginning with original goodness held captive by a servile will and ending with the possibility of liberation and regeneration of the heart, underpins his passion for the more than possible. The essays in this volume trace the fluid movement between phenomenological and religious descriptions of the capable self that emerges across Ricoeur's oeuvre and establish points of connection for future developments that might draw inspiration from this body of thought.<br>

  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur’s work remains lamentably underappreciated a few years after this death. Several factors contribute to the relative neglect of his thought. First, Ricoeur is fastidious to a fault in acknowledging his intellectual debts, which can, deceptively, make his thought appear derivative. Second, the pattern of “detour and return” that characterizes his thinking can make it difficult to keep up with him. Following Ricoeur takes one through the diverse fields of existentialism, structuralism, psychoanalysis, and analytic philosophy, to name only a few of his better-known detours. How many philosophers read both Derrida and Parfit? Heidegger and Searle? Nevertheless, those willing<br>

The essays in this volume trace the fluid movement between phenomenological and religious descriptions of the capable self that emerges across Ricoeur's oeuvre and establish points of connection for future developments that might draw inspiration from this body of thought.<br>

  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur’s work remains lamentably underappreciated a few years after this death. Several factors contribute to the relative neglect of his thought. First, Ricoeur is fastidious to a fault in acknowledging his intellectual debts, which can, deceptively, make his thought appear derivative. Second, the pattern of “detour and return” that characterizes his thinking can make it difficult to keep up with him.

  Book Title: A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VENEMA HENRY ISAAC<br>
  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's entire philosophical project narrates a passion for the possibleexpressed in the hope that in spite of death, closure, and sedimentation, life is opened by superabundance, by how the world gives us much more than is possible. Ricoeur's philosophical anthropology is a phenomenology of human capacity, which gives onto the groundless ground of human being, namely, God. Thus the story of the capable man, beginning with original goodness held captive by a servile will and ending with the possibility of liberation and regeneration of the heart, underpins his passion for the more than possible. The essays in this volume trace the fluid movement between phenomenological and religious descriptions of the capable self that emerges across Ricoeur's oeuvre and establish points of connection for future developments that might draw inspiration from this body of thought.<br>

  Book Title: Death's Following: Mediocrity, Dirtiness, Adulthood, Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): LIMON JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Almost all twentieth-century philosophy stresses the immanence of death in human life-as drive (Freud), as the context of Being (Heidegger), as the essence of our defining ethics (Levinas), or as language (de Man, Blanchot). In Death's Following, John Limon makes use of literary analysis (of Sebald, Bernhard, and Stoppard), cultural analysis, and autobiography to argue that death is best conceived as always transcendentally beyond ourselves, neither immanent nor imminent. Adapting Kierkegaard's variations on the theme of Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac while refocusing the emphasis onto Isaac, Limon argues that death should be imagined as if hiding at the end of an inexplicable journey to Moriah. The point is not to evade or ignore death but to conceive it more truly, repulsively, and pervasively in its camouflage: for example, in jokes, in logical puzzles, in bowdlerized folk songs. The first of Limon's two key concepts is adulthood: the prolonged anti-ritual for experiencing the full distance on the look of death. His second is dirtiness, as theorized in a Jewish joke, a logical exemplum, and T. S. Eliot's "Ash Wednesday": In each case, unseen dirt on foreheads suggests the invisibility of inferred death. Not recognizing death immediately or admitting its immanence and imminence is for Heidegger the defining characteristic of the "they," humanity in its inauthentic social escapism. But Limon vouches throughout for the mediocrity of the "they" in its dirty and ludicrous adulthood. Mediocrity is the privileged position for previewing death, in Limon's opinion: practice for being forgotten. In refusing the call of twentieth-century philosophy to face death courageously, Limon urges the ethical and aesthetic value of mediocre anti-heroism.<br>

  CHAPTER TWO  Alas a Dirty Third: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c5chjz">Death's Following: Mediocrity, Dirtiness, Adulthood, Literature</a><br>
  Abstract: I cannot think how to prove that there is a special difficulty in knowing that we shall die. To an empiricist or existentialist, no hypothesis is more likely. To a skeptic, there is a difficulty in knowing that we shall die but it is not a special one. Yet our foreknowledge of our deaths is, uniquely, certain knowledge that always falls short. In Don DeLillo’s

  Abstract: On February 29, 1960, when I was exactly, by way of a rare half-birthday, eight-and-a-half, my father, Gerald Limon, was finally killed by an aneurysm, not yet thirty-nine. He had fainted in his car outside his factory, had improved daily for about a week, and died. Family policy, pretty strictly adhered to, was never to discuss him, either his life or death, again. Some time after his death, maybe a month or two, my mother asked me if I had any questions about it. None came to mind. She thought perhaps I had worried that I might die in the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c5cht3">Irony on Occasion: From Schlegel and Kierkegaard to Derrida and de Man</a><br>
  Abstract: The peculiar status of irony within the literary and philosophical tradition is perhaps best illustrated by the vexing questions that always hover over its founder and chief exemplar, Socrates. Was Socrates a model pedagogue or a seducer and corrupter of innocent youth? Was his method of rigorous ignorance a path leading to negative knowledge or an abyssal spiraling of rhetorical tricks? Was his stubborn insistence on interpersonal questioning and dialogue a form of urbanity or the egotistical undermining of any genuinely sociopolitical form of community?

  Abstract: Contestation over the line between life and death is perhaps the defining problem of contemporary philosophy no less than of today’s politics. From chemical weapons to drones to climate change, we confront negotiations over what counts as life as well as over the right, or the authority, to end it, if not also the responsibility to preserve it.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c5cjjf">Re-treating Religion: Deconstructing Christianity with Jean-Luc Nancy</a><br>
  Author(s) O’BYRNE ANNE<br>
  Abstract: Jean-Luc Nancy is without doubt a post-Marxist, post-Heideggerian and—I would add—post-Arendtian thinker.¹ His ontology bears traces of all three, but this ontology flows, above all, from an attempt to think creation ex nihilo after the death of the creator God. Even now, so long after Nietzsche, and so very long after Descartes set the process of secularization in motion, it is a thinking that is only uneasily, hesitantly under way. We have gone beyond God, as Nancy puts it, but in a direction still too much determined by the thought of his death and by the necro-monotheist tradition<br>

  Book Title: Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Ethical Self-Christology, Ethics, and Formation<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Elliston Clark J.<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s work has persistently challenged Christian consciousness due to both his death at the hands of the Nazis and his provocative prison musings about Christian faithfulness in late modernity. Although understandable given the popularity of both narrative trajectories, such selective focus obscures the depth and fecundity of his overall corpus. Bonhoeffer’s early work, and particularly his Christocentric anthropology, grounds his later expressed commitments to responsibility and faithfulness in a “world come of age." While much debate accompanies claims regarding the continuity of Bonhoeffer’s thought, there are central motifs which pervade his work from his doctoral dissertation to the prison writings. This book suggests that a concern for otherness permeates all of Bonhoeffer’s work. Furthermore, Clark Elliston articulates, drawing on Bonhoeffer, a Christian self-defined by its orientation towards otherness. Taking Bonhoeffer as both the origin and point of return, the text engages Emmanuel Levinas and Simone Weil as dialogue partners who likewise stress the role of the other for self-understanding, albeit in diverse ways. By reading Bonhoeffer “through" their voices, one enhances Bonhoeffer’s already fertile understanding of responsibility.<br>

In the event he has left us only fragments—notes, paragraphs,envois, sketches, and two lectures stitched together to form a kind of monograph called “La Confession d’Augustin”:theconfession, referring, as we shall see, to Augustine’s confession of his love for God.

  Book Title: Writings on Medicine-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Meyers Todd<br>
  Abstract: At the time of his death in 1995, Georges Canguilhem was a highly respected historian of science and medicine, whose engagement with questions of normality, the ideologization of scientific thought, and the conceptual history of biology had marked the thought of philosophers such as Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Pierre Bourdieu, and Gilles Deleuze. This collection of short, incisive, and highly accessible essays on the major concepts of modern medicine shows Canguilhem at the peak of his use of historical practice for philosophical engagement. In order to elaborate a philosophy of medicine, Canguilhem examines paramount problems such as the definition and uses of health, the decline of the Hippocratic understanding of nature, the experience of disease, the limits of psychology in medicine, myths and realities of therapeutic practices, the difference between cure and healing, the organism's self-regulation, and medical metaphors linking the organism to society. Writings on Medicine is at once an excellent introduction to Canguilhem's work and a forceful, insightful, and accessible engagement with elemental concepts in medicine. The book is certain to leave its imprint on anthropology, history, philosophy, bioethics, and the social studies of medicine.<br>

  Abstract: At the time of his death in 1995, Georges Canguilhem was a highly respected epistemologist and historian of biology and medicine. He was known for having extended and transformed traditions set by Gaston Bachelard and Henri Bergson, and as an influential figure for generations of scholars, including Michel Foucault, François Dagognet, Louis Althusser, Pierre Bourdieu, Dominique Lecourt, Gilbert Simondon, and Gilles Deleuze. At different stages of his life, he was in conversation with important contemporaries, among them François Jacob, Jean Hyppolite, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean Cavaillès, Kurt Goldstein, and René Leriche.

  Abstract: Charles Dickens’s
                  Our Mutual Friendis a retroactively oriented text, a text that works to undo the events that actuate it. The text begins with an ending, a corpse being drawn from the Thames, and withholds the circumstances surrounding this central event until half of the plot has transpired. While we learn the victim’s history much sooner than we do the events leading to his death, his history, nonetheless, is represented inconsecutively—after his demise. We are never to meet the victim himself; we are never to hear his story from his lips; we are never to receive a linear<br>

  Abstract: Freud’s reading of Jewish history, centered around the return to group consciousness of the long repressed memory of the primeval Father, did not end with Moses or the Hebrew prophets. Yes, Moses created the Jews and Judaism by restoring the Father to them alone, through his own person and in the teaching of the one omnipotent God of the universe. Following his death this revelation was repressed in turn, only to reemerge from its state of unconscious latency in the teachings of the prophets, which would become the common patrimony of the entire Jewish people.<br>

  Abstract: The ruined churches of

The death of personhood is closely connected to evil: wherever Being stops and Non-Being starts, there is space for negation and fear. The collapse of the house of religion in the West and the absence of a personal God contribute to a metaphysical void that is claimed by Satan who is the denier of any existence. The postmodern Satan appears without the attributes, both physical and behavioral<br>

  Author(s) Hickman Louise<br>
  Abstract: Universalism was a doctrine not widely espoused in seventeenth-century England. That hell is eternal was orthodox belief¹ and any suggestion to the contrary was viewed with grave suspicion as a “detestable and damnable” doctrine of the Arminians;² an opinion believed to give rise to ethical anarchy and antinomianism. If hell is finite, what sort of deterrent is it against misbehaving in this life? What use is Christ’s death if God can cancel the debt of human sin by will alone? Despite general denigration, however, arguments that God’s salvation has universal scope gradually gathered momentum throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<br>

  Abstract: Judging from the Apostles’ Creed, which jumps from the birth of Jesus to his death (Lat.
                  Natus ex Maria virgine; passus sub Pontio Pilato), the details of neither Jesus’s life nor his teaching carried much creedal significance. But if one important function of such a creed was for baptismal instruction and for profession at baptism when the convert renounced the devil and his works, and if part of Jesus’s life was in fact a battle with evil (victory’s being a fait accompli through his death and resurrection), then perhaps in the loosest terms one can see Jesus’s life suggested between<br>

  Book Title: Restorative Christ-  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Broughton Geoff<br>
  Abstract: The conviction that Jesus is the restorative Christ demands a commitment to the justice he articulated. The justice of the restorative Christ is justice with reconciliation, justice with repentance, justice with repair, and justice without retaliation. The Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts portray the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ through the radical concept of "enemy-love." In conversation with Dietrich Bonhoeffer (Jesus-for-others), John Howard Yoder (a nonviolent Jesus), Miroslav Volf (an embracing Jesus), and Chris Marshall (a compassionate Jesus), Broughton demonstrates what the restorative Christ means for us today. Following the restorative Christ faithfully involves imaginative disciplines (seeing, remembering, and desiring), conversational disciplines (naming, questioning, and forgiving), and embodied disciplines (absorbing, repairing, and embracing).<br>

  Book Title: Why Resurrection?-An Introduction to the Belief in the Afterlife in Judaism and Christianity<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Blanco Carlos<br>
  Abstract: Few questions exert such a great fascination on human conscience as those related to the meaning of life, history, and death. The belief in the resurrection of the dead constitutes an answer to a real challenge: What is the meaning of life and history in the midst of a world in which evil, injustice, and ultimately death exist? Resurrection is an instrument serving a broader, more encompassing reality: the Kingdom of God. Such a utopian Kingdom gathers the final response to the problem of theodicy and to the enigma of history. <CR><CR> This book seeks to understand the idea of resurrection not only as a theological but also as a philosophical category (as expression of the collective aspirations of humanity), combining historical, theological, and philosophical analyses in dialogue with some of the principal streams of contemporary Western thought.<br>

  Abstract: The belief in the persistence of life after death is not a goal in itself. People who believe in immortality of the soul and in resurrection of the dead do not do so just to state that personal identity will endure. They do so in order to state that the personal identity will endure in a different world, in a different kind of life. The belief in life beyond death is therefore meant to affirm that there is a new world waiting for us, and that life on Earth is not the definitive, final reality.<br>

No, God does not disappear into the universe a la 1960’ s “death of God” theology or some versions of radical postmodernism.

Acknowledging the centrality of Jesus as the good news of who God is and what God has done is a vital emphasis.

  Book Title: The Gift of the Other-Levinas, Derrida, and a Theology of Hospitality<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Bouma-Prediger Steven<br>
  Abstract: We live in an age of global capitalism and terror. In a climate of consumption and fear the unknown Other is regarded as a threat to our safety, a client to assist, or a competitor to be overcome in the struggle for scarce resources. And yet, the Christian Scriptures explicitly summon us to welcome strangers, to care for the widow and the orphan, and to build relationships with those distant from us. But how, in this world of hostility and commodification, do we practice hospitality? In The Gift of the Other, Andrew Shepherd engages deeply with the influential thought of French thinkers Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida, and argues that a true vision of hospitality is ultimately found not in postmodern philosophies but in the Christian narrative. The book offers a compelling Trinitarian account of the God of hospitality—a God of communion who “makes room" for otherness, who overcomes the hostility of the world though Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection, and who through the work of the Spirit is forming a new community: the Church—a people of welcome.<br>

  Book Title: Life in the Spirit-A Post-Constantinian and Trinitarian Account of the Christian Life<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): snavely Andréa D.<br>
  Abstract: Christians are united in saying that the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. But the unity breaks down when explaining how the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. Life in the Spirit is the first book to engage the post-Constantinian critique of the church with the field of Spirit Christology. Building upon the work of post-Constantinians John Howard Yoder and Stanley Hauerwas and upon the Trinitarian Spirit-Christology of Leopoldo Sánchez, this account provides a framework for seeing one’s Christian life as one transformed by the Spirit. Snavely rejects the characterisation of life in the Spirit as bringing sinners to faith, and instead proposes that as Jesus lived as the Son of the Father in the Spirit, the Spirit also makes other sons of the father in the image of Jesus. This Trinitarian interpretation shows the Christian life as being one of total trust in God with one’s own life, and after death living in Jesus’ resurrected life in the Spirit. Snavely’s account calls for a reimagining of the church and the Christian life in terms of ecclesial structure, Christian discipleship and the Christian view of marriage. Life in the Spirit will not only help Christians to have a better understanding of the place of vocation in the world as witnesses to the lordship of Jesus Christ, but it will also promote unity in the body of Christ based on the actual unity that all his adopted sons and daughters already have by belonging to Jesus Christ’s life in the Spirit.<br>

As possibly the most significant philosopher of religion in the second half of twentieth century, Hick’s contributions to the field of philosophy of religion in general, and in religious epistemology, theistic proofs, theodicy, death and eternal life, and mysticism, in particular, have widely been recognized.

  Book Title: Jesus and the Cross-Necessity, Meaning, and Atonement<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Laughlin Peter<br>
  Abstract: According to the Nicene Creed, Christ died for us and for our salvation. But while all Christians agree that Christ’s death and resurrection has saving significance, there is little unanimity in how and why that is the case. In fact, Christian history is littered with accounts of the redemptive value of Christ’s death, and new models and motifs are constantly being proposed, many of which now stand in stark contrast to earlier thought. How then should contemporary articulations of the importance of the death of Christ be judged? At the heart of this book is the contention that Christian reflection on the atonement is faithful inasmuch as it incorporates the intention that Jesus himself had for his death. In a wide-reaching study, the author draws from both classical scholarship and recent work on the historical Jesus to argue that not only did Jesus imbue his death with redemptive meaning but that such meaning should impact expressions of the saving significance of the cross.<br>

The question becomes more potent if we phrase is slightly differently: Would it actually make any difference to the Christian faith if its doctrine of the atonement had no basis in the intention of Jesus and was merely a symbolic invention of the early church? An uncritical reaction to this type of question is to answer with an indignant affirmation, since there is more than a little audacity in the suggestion that Jesus’ intention is irrelevant to the Christian proclamation of salvation. However, does the<br>

The task now is to discuss what can be known of the world of meaning that Jesus constituted for his death and then, in the next chapter, to bring these results to bear on our understanding of Christian atonement. Easy enough perhaps to state, a rather more difficult task in practice. Indeed, the endeavor threatens to become all-consuming; John Meier’s four-volume work is ample evidence of the<br>

That contention still stands, and our analysis of the previous chapter has brought us to the point in which we must now discuss what kind of continuity is, in fact, to be expected. How should we incorporate the meaning that Jesus created for his death into our contemporary presentations? What kind of continuity are we looking for?

  Abstract: What I have attempted to demonstrate herein is the ongoing potential for theology to articulate the meaning of Jesus’ death in a way that remains both faithful to the Christian tradition and yet sensitive to the needs of any given community. Hence, the task has not been to assert any one particular motif or understanding of the cross as
                  theexpression of faithful Christianity. Such an assertion (be it for any particular motif) needs to be rejected, not because individual motifs lack understanding or coherence but because the communication of the saving message of the cross must be received personally,<br>

This chapter considers five discourses that are not conventionally consulted for input on theological hope: nihilism, lament, disability, feminist theory, and feminist theology. The philosophical and critical theory conversation of nihilism and its relative, indeterminism or undecidability, suggests a kind of hope without over-confident claims of knowable hopes for the future. Scriptural and extra-scriptural lament demonstrates a persistent and apparently futile hope that continues into and through death with no sign of God’s response or rescue.

  Abstract: Deuteronomy, before reporting the death of Moses in a final chapter (34), has included a Blessing of Moses (33), one of two old poems in a second supplement to the book (31–34), the other being the Song of Moses (32: 1– 43). The Song of Moses is a strident rebuke of Israel for chasing after other gods. With a concluding blessing on the twelve tribes (excluding Simeon), the book of Deuteronomy can now end on a calming note before Moses dies and Joshua replaces him as israel’s leader. The book of Genesis similarly ends with a Blessing of Jacob<br>

  Abstract: Matthew’s narrative tells the story of Jesus. In terms of genre the narrative is an ancient form of biography¹ and the one undeniable feature of the narrative is that it follows a chronological sequence of Jesus’ life: birth, baptism, ministry in Galilee, the journey to Jerusalem, death, and resurrection. Like all stories, the structure, which arranges the individual parts so that the story is brought to a satisfying conclusion, has a beginning (Matthew 1–2, the prologue), middle (Matthew 3–25, the central section), and an end (Matthew 26–28, the passion and resurrection).²<br>

  Abstract: Luther’s theological aesthetics of God’s glory in Christ’s suffering love lays a basis for reshaping and redirecting motives of Asian post-confessional theology toward a different understanding and transformation of Luther. When Luther encounters a postmodern context, he can best be understood by challenging and transcending him. His doctrine of justification, theology of the cross, Trinity, law and gospel, eucharistic theology, and two kingdoms theory among others are seen at the point of the death, resurrection and reconciliation of the crucified Christ, the scope and reach of which is of inclusive, universal character allowing and tolerating other ways.

  Abstract: In this last section of the book, we carry through in practice what was developed in theory, namely that Christian ethics is “responsible witness of the Word of God” serving both “God and men” (
                  CDIV/3: 609). In each movement, there is a corresponding dialectic of God’s initiating action and human response. In chapters 7–8, we saw how the Yes of moral knowledge of the good, human agency, and moral judgment is followed by the No against the nothingness of sin, death, evil, and the powers. We are now able to discuss further how God’s reconciling Yes provides the<br>

  Author(s) Senior Donald<br>
  Abstract: The attempt to find at least “glimpses” of the historical Jesus in the Gospel according to John is a topic of growing interest for biblical scholarship, and this study of a unique Johannine passage is intended to be a modest contribution to that perspective. The Johannine account of the deliberations of the “council” in 11:45–53 is an interesting example of the convergence of historical, literary, ethical, and theological dimensions of the causes and meaning of Jesus’s death in the Fourth Gospel.¹<br>

  Abstract: The Fourth Gospel’s account of the final events of Jesus’s life, including the causes and circumstances of his death, offers both special promise and special problems as a source for reconstructing his career. The Johannine passion narrative is
                  promisingsimply because this material enjoys substantial parallels with other canonical and early noncanonical Christian documents. Unlike most of the Johannine signs and sayings, the causes and events of Jesus’s trials and death are recorded, or at least alluded to, in all three synoptic Gospels, the Johannine and Pauline Epistles, a variety of noncanonical Christian texts (most significantly the Gospel of Peter),<br>

  Abstract: Monsters loom large in the cultural imaginary. From folktales to splatter movies, from the Bible to computer games, from birth to death, monsters such as devils, werewolves, dragons, ghosts, cyborgs, zombies, and vampires inundate our imagination. Monsters, which can be understood as symbols of human vulnerability, can, however, also help us to imagine triumphing over danger. As Stephen T. Asma points out, they are “beneficial foes” that are “imaginative foils for thinking about our own responses to menace” (2009, online).<br>

  Abstract: Structuralism, whatever that term may mean over a decade into the twenty-first century, is overdue for reassessment. The death of Claude Lévi-Strauss in 2009 provides the obligation as well as the opportunity to engage in such an exercise of historical retrospect. Lévi-Strauss moved with characteristic creative aplomb across a remarkable range of potential disciplinary homes, but anthropology remained his home base, the place of comfort from which to discomfit other disciplines. The history of anthropology therefore has a particular claim to the movement he founded and popularized beyond its origins in Saussurean linguistics despite the fact that French structuralism has<br>

  Abstract: In December 1800, Jacob, “a valuable Waterman” and “an honest inoffensive negro,” committed suicide by “stab[bing] himself.” Because he was considered valuable, his enslaver, William Wilson, submitted a petition to the Virginia governor’s office seeking compensation for the loss of Jacob, whom he referred to as his “chief support.”¹ It might seem unusual to contemporary readers that a slaveholder would file for compensation on the death of his bondman, but this was common in the late eighteenth- and nineteenth-century United States.

Yet the slave ship looks different when viewed in its coastal U.S. configuration.

  Abstract: The Grecanici of Southern Italyprovides a comprehensive ethnography that examines the ways the minority developed and sustain enduring cultural forms of solidarity and relatedness. Stavroula Pipyrou proposes the concept of "fearless governance" to describe overlapping and sometimes contradictory systems of power, authority, and relational networks that enable the Grecanici to achieve political representation at the intersection of local, national, and global encounters. Refuting easy assumptions of top-down governmental influence, Pipyrou shows how the Grecanici find political representation through the European Union and UNESCO, state policy, civic associations, family networks and illegal organizations; not being afraid to take risks, incur wrath, lose friends, or risk death in challenging the political status-quo.<br>

  Abstract: As I discussed in the previous chapter, Sergio Leone’s films were seen by some as the death knell of the Western and by others as its regenerative force, breathing new life into a tired, mythic formula and seeing the genre as the site for cultural critique and counterhegemonic practice. The established generic grid of the Western proved elastic and porous enough for new filmmakers looking to utilize its broad expectations and codes for different purposes, building on the promising works of directors such as Nicholas Ray, Sam Peckinpah, and Robert Altman.

Such overt Christian symbolism has prompted the Native American poet and critic Elizabeth Cook-Lynn (Crow Creek Sioux) to criticize Erdrich for her supposed adulteration of aboriginal writing and “the myths and metaphors of sovereign nationalism” with “Christian-oriented” prose (84, 85).

  Abstract: Like a Western obituary, the Jing Yun stele begins by offering the names of the deceased—personal, courtesy, and surname—his office, and then the date of his death, the last given as a particular day in the summer of 103 ce, the precision of which is rather surprising given that this stele was erected seventy years later.¹ Unlike a Western obituary (and unlike most other Han stelae), it then provides us with hardly any other personal information about Jing Yun such as his education, his service history, his age at death, and his surviving relatives.

  Abstract: Death naturally entails absence in terms of both space, because the dead are no longer within sight, and time, because the point of death ever recedes into the past. But what else can be said about how this absence is manifested? For the surviving lineage, the lacuna may require restructuring family authority; for the individual descendant, it leads to forgetfulness as details about the dead gradually fade and memories blur.

  Book Title: Taking Hold of the Real-Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Profound Worldliness of Christianity<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Harvey Barry<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer writes in one of his last prison letters that he had “come to know and understand more and more the profound this-worldliness of Christianity." In Taking Hold of the Real, Barry Harvey engages in constructive conversation with Bonhoeffer, contending that the “shallow and banal this-worldliness" of modern society is ordered to a significant degree around the social technologies of religion, culture, and race. These mechanisms displace human beings from their traditional connections with particular locales, and relocate them in their “proper places" as determined by the nation-state and capitalist markets. Christians are called to participate in the profound this-worldliness that breaks into the world in the apocalyptic action of Jesus Christ, a form of life that requires discipline and an understanding of death and resurrection. The church is a sacrament of this new humanity, performing for all to hear the polyphony of life that was prefigured in the Old Testament and now is realised in Christ. Unable to find a faithful form of this-worldliness in wartime Germany, Bonhoeffer joined the conspiracy against Hitler, a decision aptly contrasted with a small French church that, prepared by its life together over many generations, saved thousands of Jewish lives.<br>

  Author(s) Liew Tat-siong Benny<br>
  Abstract: Jacques Lacan (2001, 341) has famously declared that “it is not enough to decide on the basis of its effect—Death. it still remains to be decided which death, that which is brought by life or that which brings life.” Of course, for Lacan, whose psychoanalysis has much to do with one’s relations to death and the dead (Luepnitz 2003, 232), there is a difference between biological and psychic death and hence between mortality and vitality. Nevertheless, his statement does highlight, in a delightfully ironic way, how talk about death can—or should—be both specific and ambiguous at the<br>

  Book Title: Light and Death-Figuration in Spenser, Kepler, Donne, Milton<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: Light figures being; darkness, death. Bridging mathematical science, semantics, rhetoric, grammar, and major poems, Judith H. Anderson seeks to negotiate writings from multiple disciplines in the shared terms of poiesis and figuration rather than as cultural opposites. Analogy, a type of metaphor, has always been the connector of the known to the unknown, the sensible to the infinite. Anderson’s study moves from the figuration of light and death to the history of analogy and its pertinence to light in physics and metaphysics, from Kepler to Donne, Spenser, and Milton. Topics proliferate: creativity, optics, the relation of literature to science, the methodology of thought and argument, and the processes of narrative, discovery, and interpretation.<br>

  CHAPTER 1  “The Body of This Death”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1h1hww3">Light and Death</a><br>
  Abstract: In Romans 7:24, Saint Paul, lamenting the conflict between his enlightened mind and his sinful flesh, utters a cry that has echoed down the centuries: “O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” Almost predictably, Paul’s moving outcry attracted the sustained attention of the poets of early modern England, conspicuous among them Spenser, Donne, and Milton—predictably, not only because of Paul’s anguish but also because of its unusual phrasing and figuration.

  Abstract: Spenser’s Mutabilitie Cantos engage the subjects of sin and death from start to finish—from the introduction of Mutability herself through the end of her pageant. Descended from Mother Earth and the rebellious Titans, Mutability desires “Rule and dominion” over Earth, her maternal inheritance, “That as a Goddesse, men might her admire, / And heauenly honours yield” (VII.vi.4). To this end, she has perverted the order of Nature, quite altered “the worlds faire frame,” and made all those “accurst / That God had blest” (vi.5):<br>

  CHAPTER 3  Satanic Ethos: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1h1hww3">Light and Death</a><br>
  Abstract: The organization of this chapter on
                  Paradise Lostmight be considered a diptych. The first of its panels—Part I—shows the origin of evil, hence sin, in Satan’s envy when the Son is exalted, an envy that underlies Satan’s self-authoring pride.¹ This panel focuses primarily on negation and death. Part II, the second panel, which examines God’s terms of exaltation in greater detail, focuses on the inseparable questions of individuality, allness, and pride, each of which, even pride, has a more positive potential.² My argument in both panels grows out of two crucial speeches in Book V, examining them<br>

  CHAPTER 4  Connecting the Cultural Dots: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1h1hww3">Light and Death</a><br>
  Abstract: Changing focus, this chapter engages the history and structure of analogy. The change is pronounced—from sin and death to rhetoric, from poetry and belief to science and methodology. In manner, the chapter is historical, analytical, and abstract, in effect a further shift. These changes threaten to confirm the very chasm between science and the humanities against which I argue. Yet my first three chapters have treated matters that relevantly recur in this one, such as physical and intellectual vision, body and mind, imagination, knowledge, figurative illumination, and Neoplatonism. More importantly, the argument of this chapter enables a theorized broadening<br>

  CHAPTER 7  Milton’s Twilight Zone: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1h1hww3">Light and Death</a><br>
  Abstract: Culturally, associatively, and naturally, light brings with it reference to darkness, as day to night and life to death. The symbolic valences of night and light, together with their phonic likeness, occupied Milton throughout his writing, but especially after his blindness, as his blind protagonist eloquently testifies in
                  Samson Agonistes. Various half-lights, such as twilight, dusk and dawn, shade and shadow, enter the picture, too. These belong neither to light nor to darkness, neither exclusively to day nor to night; in them, light and dark combine suggestively. InParadise Lost, Milton’s figure of Death is recurrently called a shade or<br>

  Abstract: Culturally, associatively, and naturally, light brings with it reference to darkness, as day to night and life to death.

  Book Title: Light and Death-Figuration in Spenser, Kepler, Donne, Milton<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: Light figures being; darkness, death. Bridging mathematical science, semantics, rhetoric, grammar, and major poems, Judith H. Anderson seeks to negotiate writings from multiple disciplines in the shared terms of poiesis and figuration rather than as cultural opposites. Analogy, a type of metaphor, has always been the connector of the known to the unknown, the sensible to the infinite. Anderson’s study moves from the figuration of light and death to the history of analogy and its pertinence to light in physics and metaphysics, from Kepler to Donne, Spenser, and Milton. Topics proliferate: creativity, optics, the relation of literature to science, the methodology of thought and argument, and the processes of narrative, discovery, and interpretation.<br>

  Introduction: from:

  Abstract: Introducing this book, the word
                  issue, derived from Latinexire, “to go out” or “go forth,” embraces a range of meanings, among them “outflows,” “questions,” or “problems,” which in turn suggest “results,” “departures,” “developments,” or even “extensions.”¹ Englishissuesis itself a historical extension ofexire, one issuing from this verb over time. For readers of early modern texts,issuesand its implied Latin root hold a haunting memory of Donne’s play on it inDeaths Duell, famously his own funeral sermon, which examines the issues from, in, and through death—Latinà(ab),in, andperdeath—and charges<br>

  CHAPTER 1  “The Body of This Death”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1h1hww3">Light and Death</a><br>
  Abstract: In Romans 7:24, Saint Paul, lamenting the conflict between his enlightened mind and his sinful flesh, utters a cry that has echoed down the centuries: “O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” Almost predictably, Paul’s moving outcry attracted the sustained attention of the poets of early modern England, conspicuous among them Spenser, Donne, and Milton—predictably, not only because of Paul’s anguish but also because of its unusual phrasing and figuration. Popular English translations of the Bible, such as Geneva and King James, in accord with the Latin Vulgate and the<br>

  Abstract: Spenser’s Mutabilitie Cantos engage the subjects of sin and death from start to finish—from the introduction of Mutability herself through the end of her pageant. Descended from Mother Earth and the rebellious Titans, Mutability desires “Rule and dominion” over Earth, her maternal inheritance, “That as a Goddesse, men might her admire, / And heauenly honours yield” (VII.vi.4).

  Author(s) Piazza Anna<br>
  Abstract: One of the most fecund themes of Paul Ludwig Landsberg’s anthropology, which stands out for a presentation of man’s potential “self-comprehension” on the basis of a lived “inner-experience,” is his reflection concerning death and the confrontation with the human conscience of death, which threatens the sense of life and the search for an overcoming of transitoriness. It was in
                  Espritwhere Landsberg published, in 1935, the two essays related to this topic,Die Erfahrung des TodesandDas moralische Problem des Selbstmorder. In particular, we would like to analyze the former, and compare it with the positions of two other<br>

This new experience is the very heart of Christianity and its fire ….”¹ Yet, throughout Schmemann’s extensive writing on time and the kingdom of God and his heavy emphasis on these themes, he does not explicitly, nor systematically lay out how this new experience of time shapes his theological anthropology.

                  The Poseidon Adventure(1972),The Towering Inferno(1974), or evenJaws(1975), a local threat drives characters into familial or tribal collectives, all focused on an exit strategy, with key characters playing out both romance and villain plots. In more recent end-of-the-world films like the viral pandemics 28Days Later(2002), 28Weeks Later(2007), orContagion(2011), the very survival of humanity and civilization is at stake.

  Abstract: Life comes to the fore most explicitly when it is under threat. We think about life (instead of just living it) when faced with the prospect of death, whether of individuals; of ethnic or national groups in wars and other forms of conflict; or of entire species, human or nonhuman. My concern here is with the prospect of the impending death of the human species. In the mainstream MEDIA, human extinction is usually presented as something inevitable. In

  Book Title: Seamus Heaney as Aesthetic Thinker-A Study of the Prose<br>
  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): MacKillop James<br>
  Abstract: Seamus Heaney’s unexpected death in August 2013 brought to completion his body of work, and scholars are only now coming to understand the full scale and importance of this extraordinary career. The Nobel Prize–winning poet, translator, and playwright from the North of Ireland is considered the most important Irish poet after Yeats and, at the time of his death, arguably the most famous living poet. For this reason, much of the scholarship to date on Heaney has understandably focused on his poetry. O’Brien’s new work, however, focuses on Heaney’s essays, book chapters, and lectures as it seeks to understand how Heaney explored the poet’s role in the world. By examining Heaney’s prose, O’Brien teases out a clearer understanding of Heaney’s sense of the function of poetry as an act of public intellectual and ethical inquiry. In doing so, O’Brien reads Heaney as an aesthetic thinker in the European tradition, considering him alongside Heidegger, Derrida, Lacan, and Adorno. Studying Heaney within this theoretical and philosophical tradition sheds new and useful light on one of the greatest creative minds of the twentieth century.<br>

  VIII  NIETZSCHE from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1j7x66b">Placing Aesthetics</a><br>
  Abstract: One might say that the founding experience of Friedrich Nietzsche’s philosophy is the experience of the death of God. It is announced, like Plato’s thought, in poetic form through the Parable of the Madman in
                  The Gay Science. Nietzsche describes a madman who lit a lantern in the morning hours and went in search of God, like Diogenes, who claimed that the light of day was not sufficient to reveal an honest man. The madman’s audience of unbelievers mocked him, asking whether God had gotten lost or emigrated. The madman proclaimed that God was dead and that he and they<br>

  Abstract: A martyr is defined as “one who voluntarily suffers death as the penalty of witness to and refusing to renounce his religion” (
                  Webster’s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language). For purposes of quantification, Christian martyrs are “believers in Christ who have lost their lives prematurely, in situations of witness, as a result of human hostility.” This definition can be expounded as follows: “Believers in Christ” are individuals from the entire Christian community of Roman Catholics, Orthodox, Protestants, Anglicans, Marginal Christians, and Independents. “‘Lost their lives” restricts it to Christians actually put to death, for whatever reason. “Prematurely” means<br>

  Author(s) BÉRAUD CÉLINE<br>
  Abstract: The management of death, the regulation of pregnancy termination and medically assisted procreation and the institutionalization of same-sex couples and same-sex parenting: in the different European countries that we have studied, the public authorities are preoccupied by such issues which relate to questions concerning life (from its beginning until its end), sexuality and gender. As per Michel Foucault¹, new bio politics are being developed, a new “government of bodies” (according to Didier Fassin and Dominique Memmi²). This usually concerns women’s bodies, regardless whether it is abortion, medically assisted reproduction – as Frisina writes in the chapter on Italy – or same-sex marriage.³<br>

  Abstract: Oppressive structures are often adjusted to accommodate the changing fears and desires of the (neo)colonizers and/or dominant oppressors. The public face of an oppressive system can change (or alternate, at times), between oppressor and oppressed subordinated other; aspects of the new facade may even appear representative of the oppressed. But the death-dealing policies continue to the detriment of the oppressed. Oppressive systems must be exposed and deconstructed or dismantled (even in sacred texts), not simply recycled or cosmetically adjusted to palliate and opiate the oppressed and their allies.

His fictional works from 1971 to his death in 2016 express the desire to keep his native Kabylian culture present and alive, to use the Berber language, which he spoke before he knew French, and to break apart the codified structures of all languages.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1np9c3">Time and the Shape of History</a><br>
  Abstract: Thinking of history as travelling along a line, rather than round in a completed circle, is an alternative way of interpreting the experience of time. The seasons go round; but each spring is a new one, not an old spring revived. Life is viewed as a journey from youth to old age, which is halted only at the ‘journey’s end’ by death. ‘An individual is a four-dimensional object of greatly elongated form. In ordinary language, we say that he [or she] has considerable extension in time and insignificant extension in space,’ explained physicist Arthur Eddington kindly. Not all, of course,<br>

  Abstract: In this lecture we confront one of the most formidable and influential figures in our reading. In the years preceding and since his recent death (2004), Jacques Derrida has enjoyed a second vogue on the strength of having turned to ethical and political issues. He never repudiated his earlier thinking or his notoriously involuted style, but he adapted these signatures to the interests of progressive humanists. Together with the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben in particular, late Derrida is associated with what’s called “the ethical turn” in theoretical approaches to literature and other matters that is very much of the current<br>

  Abstract: Recent progress in neuroscience and its integration in dynamic evolutionary processes, which include culture and its history, prompt us to rethink certain central philosophical questions, such as the significance of death. Death is an essential biological phenomenon directly related to the evolution of species. It has taken on a special dimension in the history of humanity. Buff on rightly said that “death is as natural as life.” Many philosophical and religious fundamentals, which emphasize the sacred character of life, maintain the balance by doing the same for its interruption by death. I feel it is opportune today more than ever<br>

  Abstract: FROM THE BEGINNING Christians were conscious of the other. The first Christians had to explain to their fellow Jews why they venerated a man who had been executed by the Romans. Within a few decades of Jesus’ death, as some Christians ceased observing the Jewish Law, Christian leaders had to answer charges they had abandoned the ancient traditions of the Jewish people. Later, in Greece, as Paul began to move beyond the Jewish world to address the Gentiles, the citizens of Athens brought him to the famous hill west of the Acropolis, the Areopagus, and asked him to justify his<br>

  Book Title: Agitations-Essays on Life and Literature<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Krystal Arthur<br>
  Abstract: We disagree. From small questions of taste to large questions concerning the nature of existence, intellectual debate takes up much of our time. In this book the respected literary critic Arthur Krystal examines what most commentators ignore: the role of temperament and taste in the forming of aesthetic and ideological opinions. In provocative essays about reading and writing, about the relation between life and literature, about knowledge and certainty, about God and death, and about his own gradual disaffection with the literary scene, Krystal demonstrates that opposing points of view are based more on innate predilections than on disinterested thought or analysis.Not beholden to any fashionable theory or political agenda, Krystal interrogates the usual suspects in the cultural wars from an independent, though not impartial, vantage point. Clearly personal and unabashedly belletrist, his essays ask important questions. What makes culture one thing and not another? What inspires aesthetic values? What drives us to make comparisons? And how does a bias for one kind of evidence as opposed to another contribute to the form and content of intellectual argument?<br>

In the past several years, novels by Cynthia Ozick, Umberto Eco, and the late John Gardner have unabashedly pondered what Lionel Trilling called ‘‘the great issues with which the mind has traditionally been concerned: whence and whither, birth and death, fate, free will, and immortality.’’ Trilling felt that in neglecting these issues, midtwentieth-century fiction had suffered a loss of emotional power. This may be putting the case too strongly; impassioned dialogue about ideas, however,<br>

  Wertung und Wertwiderstand. Selbsterfahrung und die antinomische Struktur der Existenz bei Jaspers und Heidegger from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1p5f306">Karl Jaspers e la molteplicità delle visioni del mondo</a><br>
  Author(s) Steinmann Michael<br>
  Abstract: The essay discusses Karl Jaspers’ concept of limit situations in his
                  Psychology of Worldviews. In limit situations, individuals experience their finite existence in an essential way. The essay shows that the concept had great influence on Martin Heidegger, who gives two of the situations, death and guilt, a decisive role in the phenomenological analysis of human existence inBeing and Time. For Jaspers’Psychology, the main emphasis lies on the individual’s spiritual counter-reaction to the experience of limit situations, which leaves the overall status of the situations unclear. The essay also shows that for Jaspers limit situations are devastating because<br>

  3  Exile from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1pq15d">Faces of Displacement</a><br>
  Abstract: The practice of exile has its beginnings with the advent of settled and socially organized societies. The first known human experience of exile, the story of Sinuhe (documented on an Egyptian papyrus), dates back to 2000 BC (Tabori, 43). The limited social mobility, settled way of life, and minimal knowledge of the “other” in geographical and cultural terms in early societies meant that physical expulsion from the homeland was one of the most severe forms of punishment, almost equivalent to death.¹ Exile is connected to a range of other important signifiers: separation, loss, alienation, loneliness, and nostalgia.

  Author(s) IMBERT PATRICK<br>
  Abstract: The only undeniable information one can have access to is that they were living people, and now they are dead. Apart from this information, there is an accumulation of discursive constructions in which the deaths of people are used in media images and political discourses in order to endorse a given logic or strategy in the battle for recognition and power. However, the statement of passage from life to death is more than a referential base. It is a way of reinstating an ethic of recognizing the Other. It traces a path towards self-reflection that demands new and different solutions.<br>

  Abstract: Early on the morning of September 11, 2001, nineteen terrorists hijacked four planes and crashed them into the World Trade Center towers, the Pentagon, and a farm field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The attacks killed 2,996 people and spawned a global “War on Terror” in Iraq and Afghanistan. Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the 9/11 attacks; U.S. forces pursued its leader, Osama bin Laden, for more than nine years and ultimately killed him in a raid on his Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound on May 2, 2011. Following his death, soldiers removed bin Laden’s body and transferred it to the U.S.S.

  Book Title: The Goals of Medicine-The Forgotten Issues in Health Care Reform<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Callahan Daniel<br>
  Abstract: The Hastings Center coordinated teams of physicians, nurses, public health experts, philosophers, theologians, politicians, health care administrators, social workers, and lawyers in fourteen countries to explore these issues. In this volume, they articulate four basic goals of medicine - prevention of disease, relief of suffering, care of the ill, and avoidance of premature death - and examine them in light of the cultural, political, and economic pressures under which medicine functions. In reporting these findings, the contributors touch on a wide range of diverse issues such as genetic technology, Chinese medicine, care of the elderly, and prevention and public health.<br>

  Abstract: In the final analysis, every dying person who retains the capacity to hear and to understand the call of death faces two important sets of questions: questions of
                  valueand questions ofmeaning.Whether the dying individual addresses or ignores these questions is totally up to the individual in his or her own freedom. The fact that some persons freely choose to ignore these questions does not vitiate their importance. Even if all persons freely chose to ignore these questions, they would remain important. Regardless of whether people confront these questions, they always present themselves as obvious questions for the<br>

  What to Expect When Your Avatar is Expecting: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1rrd8tc">Natal Signs</a><br>
  Author(s) CRUIKSHANK LAUREN<br>
  Abstract: When it comes to video games, much attention is paid to representations of death. Game developers spill considerable digital blood crafting elaborate spectacles of violent demise in death-oriented games, while academics and the popular media spill equally as much ink debating the implications of those virtual fatalities. Avatars, visual representations of human players in these digital spaces, die repeatedly in games, such that experiences of dying become “part of the everyday life in the world” (Klastrup 144). However, in the context of this discussion and a medium in which death has so often been the focus, what about birth?<br>

  Making Meaning of Stillbirth from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1rrd8tc">Natal Signs</a><br>
  Author(s) FARRALES LYNN<br>
  Abstract: Sensitive language, remembrance photography, and mementos have become integrated into stillbirth care practices in North American health care institutions for parents and families who have experienced the death of an infant. While representations reflect how families, caregivers, and society understand stillbirth, they also help shape our relationship with birth, death, and both as they occur together. From both subjective and objective points of view, this chapter will explore how words, images, and artifacts come to represent multiple meanings of stillbirth in a way that can both challenge and contribute to the silence, stigma, and emancipation of bereaved parents from ambiguity<br>

  Abstract: In the Chinese-American writer Yiyun Li’s prizing-winning short story “Immortality” (2003), a carpenter’s wife conceives a child on the day Mao Zedong declares the founding of the People’s Republic of China.¹ During her pregnancy, she is inundated with Cultural Revolution–style cult-of-Mao propaganda, and as a result of her constant gazing at Mao’s portrait, she gives birth to a son who is the spitting image of Mao. Years later, soon after Mao’s death, the now grown-up son is whisked to the capital to be trained as Mao’s impersonator. As such, he becomes his hometown’s pride and joy. But when the<br>

  Abstract: In 638 B.C.E., in an episode that was to become a matter of some difficulty to Confucian commentators, an army from the southern state of Chu defeated a force of the state of Song on the banks of the river Hong.

  Abstract: Since his death in 2010, there has been continuing and growing interest in the life, vision, and thought of the late Spanish-Indian mystical theologian Raimon Panikkar. As well as offering both a personal affirmation and critique of Panikkar‘s thought from a Catholic and Protestant perspective, the work compares and contrasts him with a range of Western and Indian theologians, both Catholic and Protestant, and outlines the possibilities of learning from Panikkar in an ecumenical context.<br>

  Author(s): Myers Jacob D.<br>
  Abstract: The real question for homiletics in our increasingly postmodern, post-Christian contexts is not how are we going to prevent preaching from dying, but how are we going to help it die a good death. Preaching was not made to live. At most, preaching is a witness, a sign, a crimson X marking a demolition site. The church has developed sophisticated technologies in modernity to give preaching the semblance of life, belying the truth: preaching was born under a death sentence. It was born to die. Only when preaching embraces its own death is it able to truly live.<br>

  Abstract: There is a sense in which violence always involves idolatry.¹ Follow the blood of the innocents to the foot of the idols. For what and for whom are human beings willing to kill? Even against the “guilty,” violence involves an idolatrous and preemptive exploit of the divine prerogative. This is more than merely “God on our side.” Whether it is in the death penalty or war, the exercise of official violence generally presumes to know or to execute (which is to say, usurp) the judgment of God who alone holds the power of life and death.<br>

  Abstract: Violence is the ethos of our times. It is the spirituality of the modern world. It has been accorded the status of a religion, demanding from its devotees an absolute obedience to death. Its followers are not aware, however, that the devotion they pay to violence is a form of religious piety. Violence is so successful as a myth precisely because it does not seem to be mythic in the least. Violence simply appears to be the nature of things. It is what works. It is inevitable, the last and, often, the first resort in conflicts. It is embraced with<br>

He violated religious laws and customs regarding the Sabbath, hand-washing, and holiness, but in every case the issue hung on interpretation, and no doubt some rabbis would have supported him; at least they would not have condemned him to death.

That much is clear, not just from the Sermon on the Mount, but from his entire life and teaching and, above all, the way he faced his death. His was not merely a tactical or pragmatic nonviolence seized upon because nothing else would have “worked” against the Roman Empire’s near monopoly on violence. Rather, he saw nonviolence as a direct corollary of the nature of God and of the new reality emerging in the world from God.

                  believe inanything else. And that phrase “believe in” provides the clue. We trust violence. Violence “saves.” It is “redemptive.” All we have to do is make survival the highest goal, and death the greatest evil, and we have handed ourselves over to the gods of the Domination System. We trust violence because we are afraid. And we will not relinquish our fears until we are able<br>

  Abstract: James Baldwin’s critique of white supremacy is largely existential. In addition to being a moral atrocity, white supremacy is a system of self-delusion, preventing its adherents from facing reality and taking responsibility for their freedom. In
                  The Fire Next Time(1963), Baldwin speculated that fear of death was one of the wellsprings of not only white supremacy but all forms of racial, religious, and national chauvinism: “Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies,<br>

                  The Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative(Ryan, 2005, p. 590). What makes a narrative worth telling, it suggests tongue-in-cheek, are religion, aristocracy, sex and mystery. The formula illustrates how tellability depends on the subject matter of the narrative. Ryan points out that such salience can be, on the one hand, grounded in universally relevant topics (such as sex and death) and, on the other hand, be related to cultural contexts (for example the interest in the<br>

  Abstract: In depicting the character and personality of their deceased subject, English Protestant ministers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries employ features of writing strikingly comparable to contemporary works of fictional narrative. Such features include not only the selective inclusion of biographical details from the subject’s life and death, but a spectrum of seemingly ‘literary’ devices such as the portrayal of multiple points of view through eyewitness ‘testimonials’, direct quotation of correspondence, poetry, diary entries, and vividly-realized deathbed scenes (some of which include dialogue).<br>

With his arrows he shot a coyote.¹ Lord 8 Deer and his elder half-brother, Lord 12 Movement, both painted black with the hallucinogenic ointments of priests, sacrificed the coyote and a deer for a celestial spirit, Lord 13 Reed, who spoke to them from Heaven.

  Abstract: The icon of the Toltec ruler as manifestation ( ) of the Plumed Serpent is the impressive feather headdress, the
                  quetzalapanecayotl. It appears in the Ñuu Dzaui codices as a diagnostic attribute of Lord 4 Jaguar. Lord 8 Deer was considered worthy to wear it in death; his mummy bundle was adorned with it when laid to rest in the dark and sacred cave. At several occasions Mexica emperors, such as the triumphant Tizoc, distinguished themselves in this manner. Motecuhzoma sent one such headdress to Cortés upon his arrival, together with the turquoise serpent mask of Quetzalcoatl and other divine<br>

  Author(s) Alexander Neal<br>
  Abstract: To speak of post-Troubles fiction, or even fiction ‘after’ the Troubles, is perhaps as problematic as it is unavoidable. Nearly a decade since the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, the political accord for which it paved the way remains fraught and uncertain. And if it can be said with at least some certainty that the war is finally over, then it is equally certain that Northern Ireland’s troubles are not. The latest edition of
                  Lost Livesincludes entries for 195 Troubles-related deaths in the period after the IRA ceasefire announced on 31 August 1994.¹ Moreover, the very real social and<br>

  Abstract: Triggered by references to “death within life” by informants in Northern Cyprus, this paper is an attempt to write against the grain of what I would like to call normalizing representations of “the political” in anthropology. If I have picked what could be called an “abnormal” context for ethnographic research, the territory of Northern Cyprus carved out of international recognition, I intend this “facing [of] the extreme,” in Tzvetan Todorov’s terms,¹ of an exaggerated context, to accentuate the “abnormal” in contexts that are usually considered politically “normal.” The purpose is not to normalize, by default, the abnormal (i.e., the illegal<br>

  Abstract: In 1969, Simon Wiesenthal, already internationally recognized for his work in the Documentation Center of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime in Vienna, published an autobiographical narrative based on an exceptional encounter between himself and a dying, repentant Nazi soldier. On his deathbed this soldier confessed to Wiesenthal that he had participated in the murder of hundreds of Jews (including children) and asked Wiesenthal—at the time himself a prisoner in a concentration camp in Poland—for his forgiveness. Responding at the time with silence, Wiesenthal confessed nonetheless to being haunted by the dying man’s request, unable<br>

                  L298) as the death tolls of the battlegrounds repeatedly reached the gates of her Amherst family home. “War feels to me an oblique place,” she wrote in February 1863 to Thomas Wentworth Higginson (L280).<br>

There are disturbing moments in this tale’s treatment of illness and death, but the elements of horror or terror (uzhas)² in the story do not belong to melodrama. Tolstoy’s purpose is not to say “Boo!” to the reader, that is, to frighten him to death, but rather to wake him<br>

                  Zueignung) to Faust and to Zhukovsky’s “Imitation of Goethe”? Nabokov had composed a verse translation of Goethe’s poem into Russian in 1923. He published that poem in 1932 on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Goethe’s death.² He was thoroughly familiar with Zhukovsky’s<br>

  Abstract: As one considers any biographical treatment of Alexander Pushkin it is prudent to bear in mind the words of the eminent cultural historian, literary theorist, and biographer of the poet Yury Lotman. In his biography Lotman “wanted to show how, like the mythological King Midas who turned everything he touched to gold, Pushkin turned everything he touched into creativity, art. [But] Midas starved to death — his food became gold.”² This metaphor is strikingly apropos when it comes to the facts of Pushkin’s life. Let us take for an example the seemingly straightforward case of the poet’s hair color. In the<br>

                  Nouvelle Revue française, “Pouchkine, ou le vrai et le vraisemblable” (“Pushkin, or the Real and the Plausible”),³ Nabokov claimed that the truth of another’s life is inaccessible because thought inevitably distorts whatever it tries to encompass. However, the intuitions of a fictionalized biography motivated by love for its subject might convey a “plausible” life bearing a mysterious affinity for “the poet’s work, if not the poet himself.”⁴ This relatively early statement on this subject by Nabokov, made during centennial celebrations of Aleksandr Pushkin’s death, becomes poignant in light of Nabokov’s novel Pale Fire<br>

  Book Title: The Cinema of the Soviet Thaw-Space, Materiality, Movement<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oukaderova Lida<br>
  Abstract: Following Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, the Soviet Union experienced a dramatic resurgence in cinematic production. The period of the Soviet Thaw became known for its relative political and cultural liberalization; its films, formally innovative and socially engaged, were swept to the center of international cinematic discourse. In The Cinema of the Soviet Thaw, Lida Oukaderova provides an in-depth analysis of several Soviet films made between 1958 and 1967 to argue for the centrality of space-as both filmic trope and social concern-to Thaw-era cinema. Opening with a discussion of the USSR's little-examined late-fifties embrace of panoramic cinema, the book pursues close readings of films by Mikhail Kalatozov, Georgii Danelia, Larisa Shepitko and Kira Muratova, among others. It demonstrates that these directors' works were motivated by an urge to interrogate and reanimate spatial experience, and through this project to probe critical issues of ideology, social progress, and subjectivity within post-Stalinist culture.<br>

  CONCLUSION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxz0fb">The Cinema of the Soviet Thaw</a><br>
  Abstract: The cinematic scrutiny of space in Soviet culture of the 1950s and 1960s was rooted in an urgency to find new forms of social engagement. It was also propelled by a need to redefine the role of cinema in the wake of Stalin’s death. Rethinking the language of cinema, Soviet filmmakers began to emphasize the production of the environment as a social and filmic problem, creating spatial experiences within theatrical walls that differed significantly from those of established socialist practices. These filmmakers reorganized the spaces of familiar cities, landscapes, and public and private interiors, opening them up to dialogical interactions<br>

  Abstract: If anyone should think that evil is a problem of the past and not of the present, a glance at the history of the twentieth century proves otherwise. In that century, the atrocities of war escalated dramatically; between 1900 and 1990, there were over four times as many war deaths as in the preceding four hundred years. In 1990 battlefields included Afghanistan, Angola, Colombia, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, India, Kuwait, Lebanon, Liberia, Mozambique, Peru, Somalia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, and Tibet (Vickers 1993, 2).

  Abstract: This essay develops the hypothesis that social death is utterly central to the evil of genocide, not just when a genocide is primarily cultural but even when it is homicidal on a massive scale. It is social death that enables us to distinguish the peculiar evil of genocide from the evils of other mass murders. Even genocidal murders can be viewed as extreme means to the primary end of social death. Social vitality exists through relationships, contemporary and intergenerational, that create an identity that gives meaning to a life. Major loss of social vitality is a loss of identity and<br>

  Author(s) Bărbulescu Ana<br>
  Abstract: Between 1940 and 1944 the Romanian authorities imposed broad antisemitic legislation that led to the exclusion of the Jewish minority from all levels of society. The Jews from the Old Kingdom of Romania were subjected to two major outbreaks of violence: the pogroms in Bucharest (January 1941) and Iaşi (June 1941). The pogrom in Bucharest led to the killings of 125 Jews, while the one in Iaşi resulted in as many as 14,850 Jewish deaths.<br>

  Abstract: All disciplines are founded on a basic one, the theory of knowledge, which is in turn founded on a primordial root: the human being who lives and dies, and investigates how to live and what he can expect after death. Man is an abbreviated world, a physical body like the stone, vegetative like the pine tree, sensitive like the animals, and on top of all this, endowed with reason. Man can be studied from all of these perspectives: his biochemistry, heritage, genome, and behavior. When the natural sciences, especially biology, study man, they approach him as another natural being, not<br>

  Abstract: In this final chapter, the significance of conciliar law comes to the fore once again. The division of the Carolingian Empire upon the death of Louis the Pious meant the end of its stridently proclaimed and religiously interpreted politico-religious unity. These dramatic changes were reflected, as on a seismometer, in councils that record the development of new, unprecedented lines of political thought. The division of the empire called for the reconceptualization of monarchical government. This chapter includes close readings of little-studied council records, such as Aachen (836) and Yütz-bei-Diedenhofen (844). In these and other documents, we see the problem of<br>

  Abstract: In dramatizing a frozen imagination and a sterilized world, Baudelaire’s rocklike formations crush the life from any belief in the spellbinding or “reenchanting” capabilities of lyric. Subjectivity turned to stone has also been linked (most notably in the wake of Benjamin’s reflections on Baudelaire) to another distinction—that between symbol and allegory in the aesthetics of poetic representation. In Baudelaire the petrified order of things signifies the death of the “symbol,” understood as the quasi-animistic, “living,” and embodying force of analogy and
                  correspondances, and a fall back into the disjunctive, broken sphere of the allegorical, where matter is but the<br>

Some of these constraints are readily comprehensible; for example, it makes sense that the law would seek to protect donors against improper exploitation by would-be donees. Other legal constraints upon gift giving, however, are more difficult to explain. Why is it, for example, the<br>

  Abstract: September 11 was initially thought to have radically transformed politics. Old categories and ways of thinking about foreign policy seemingly lost their relevance. It became fashionable to speak of a “clash of civilizations,” and suddenly, new forms of violence were apparently acceptable. Terrorism undertaken by suicide bombers, or what Ulrich Beck termed the “individualization of war,” was thought to have supplanted battles between armies. Concrete interests, many believed, had given way before apocalyptic visions. The enemy was no longer a state but self-appointed representatives of a transnational movement inspired by fanatical religious beliefs. With the tragic deaths of 3,000 innocent<br>

  Book Title: Christianity in Evolution-An Exploration<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): MAHONEY JACK<br>
  Abstract: Evolution has provided a new understanding of reality, with revolutionary consequences for Christianity. In an evolutionary perspective the incarnation involved God entering the evolving human species to help it imitate the trinitarian altruism in whose image it was created and counter its tendency to self-absorption. Primarily, however, the evolutionary achievement of Jesus was to confront and overcome death in an act of cosmic significance, ushering humanity into the culminating stage of its evolutionary destiny, the full sharing of God's inner life. Previously such doctrines as original sin, the fall, sacrifice, and atonement stemmed from viewing death as the penalty for sin and are shown not only to have serious difficulties in themselves, but also to emerge from a Jewish culture preoccupied with sin and sacrifice that could not otherwise account for death. The death of Jesus on the cross is now seen as saving humanity, not from sin, but from individual extinction and meaninglessness. Death is now seen as a normal process that affect all living things and the religious doctrines connected with explaining it in humans are no longer required or justified. Similar evolutionary implications are explored affecting other subjects of Christian belief, including the Church, the Eucharist, priesthood, and moral behavior.<br>

This approach argues against the mainline Christian tradition that<br>

  Abstract: Examining the traditional Christian doctrines of original sin, the fall of humanity, and concupiscence reveals that these beliefs have been heavily influenced by a Jewish culture that was preoccupied in ascribing all human sufferings, including death, to divine punishment for human sins. As the acceptance of evolution and closer theological and historical examination make it unnecessary to continue to subscribe to these traditional beliefs, it becomes apparent that another line of explanation is required to account for human ills and tragedies, and for God’s part in these, and this chapter is devoted to exploring what shape such a change of<br>

  Book Title: Christianity in Evolution-An Exploration<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): MAHONEY JACK<br>
  Abstract: Evolution has provided a new understanding of reality, with revolutionary consequences for Christianity. In an evolutionary perspective the incarnation involved God entering the evolving human species to help it imitate the trinitarian altruism in whose image it was created and counter its tendency to self-absorption. Primarily, however, the evolutionary achievement of Jesus was to confront and overcome death in an act of cosmic significance, ushering humanity into the culminating stage of its evolutionary destiny, the full sharing of God's inner life. Previously such doctrines as original sin, the fall, sacrifice, and atonement stemmed from viewing death as the penalty for sin and are shown not only to have serious difficulties in themselves, but also to emerge from a Jewish culture preoccupied with sin and sacrifice that could not otherwise account for death. The death of Jesus on the cross is now seen as saving humanity, not from sin, but from individual extinction and meaninglessness. Death is now seen as a normal process that affect all living things and the religious doctrines connected with explaining it in humans are no longer required or justified. Similar evolutionary implications are explored affecting other subjects of Christian belief, including the Church, the Eucharist, priesthood, and moral behavior.<br>

  Abstract: In chapter 3 I argue that with the acceptance of the evolutionary origin of humanity there is no longer a need or a place in Christian beliefs for the traditional doctrines of original sin, the Fall, and human concupiscence resulting from that sin and, further, that much more positively the evolutionary achievement of Jesus was to communicate the altruism of God to the evolving human species and to lead it through death and individual extinction to a richer experience of life by sharing in the altruistic love of the three-personed God. This approach argues against the mainline Christian tradition that<br>

  Abstract: Chronologically the earliest of the Muslim reformers to be discussed in this volume, Muḥammad ʿAbduh is the most ambiguous in terms of understanding the full extent of his legacy in the century since his death. With the possible exception of his teacher and political mentor Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī (1838–97), he is arguably the most overinterpreted figure in modern Islamic thought. Indeed, it may be useful to think of ʿAbduh as the “Illustrated Man” of contemporary Sunnī Islam.

  Book Title: Troubling Natural Categories-Engaging the Medical Anthropology of Margaret Lock<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KIELMANN KARINA<br>
  Abstract: Where do our conventional understandings of health, illness, and the body stem from? What makes them authoritative? How are the boundaries set around these areas of life unsettled in the changing historical and political contexts of science, technology, and health care delivery? These questions are at the heart of Troubling Natural Categories, a collection of essays honouring the tradition of Margaret Lock, one of the preeminent medical anthropologists of our time. Throughout her career, Lock has investigated how medicine sets boundaries around what is deemed "normal" and "natural," and how, in turn, these ideas shape our technical and moral understandings of life, sickness, and death. In this book, nine established medical anthropologists - all former students of Lock - critically engage with her work, offering ethnographic and historical analyses that problematize taken-for-granted constructs in health and medicine in a range of global settings. The essays elaborate cutting-edge themes within medical anthropology, including the often disturbing, inherently political nature of biomedicine and biotechnology, the medicalization of mental health processes, and the formation of uniquely "local biologies" through the convergence of bodily experience, scientific discourse, and new technologies of care. Troubling Natural Categories not only affirms Margaret Lock's place at the forefront of scholarship but, with these essays, carves out new intellectual directions in the medical social sciences. Contributors include Sean Brotherton, Vinh-Kim Nguyen, Junko Kitanaka, Stephanie Lloyd, Dominique Behague, and Annette Leibing.<br>

  Abstract: That pigment on canvas has a way of initiating conventional reactions for most people needs no reminder. Behind these reactions is a body of history matured into dogma, authority, tradition. The totalitarian hegemony of this tradition I despise, its presumptions I reject. Its security is an illusion, banal, and without courage. Its substance is but dust and filing cabinets. The homage paid to it is a celebration of death.

  Abstract: The tragic news of Pollock’s death two summers ago was profoundly depressing to many of us. We felt not only a sadness over the death of a great figure, but also a deep loss, as if something of ourselves had died too. We were a piece of him: he was, perhaps, the embodiment of our ambition for absolute liberation and a secretly cherished wish to overturn old tables of crockery and flat champagne. We saw in his example the possibility of an astounding freshness, a sort of ecstatic blindness.<br>

For this project, I will draw on the elective affinity between detective fiction and psychoanalysis, which is based—at least partly—on the fact that, like the criminal case, the psychoanalytic case is a knotty problem with death at its center.

  Abstract: Professionalism is arguably more important in some occupations than in others. It is vital in some because of the life and death decisions that must be made, for example in medicine. In others the rapidly changing nature of the occupation makes efficient regulation difficult and so the professional behaviour of the practitioners is central to the good functioning of that occupation. The core idea behind this book is that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is changing so quickly that professional behaviour of its practitioners is vital because regulation will always lag behind.<br>

The sociologist Alan Peterson argues that such stories are deemed newsworthy “precisely because they offer people the promise of being able to re-make themselves anew—to ‘play God’—so that they can better deal with, if not overcome, the reality of disease, disability and death” (2001, 267). Because of the possibility that such stories may bring about changes in individual behaviors, Peterson insists that it is important to investigate how “gene stories” selectively<br>

As Herskovitz notes, senility is characterized as “monstrosity” by the lay media with “clichéd metaphors and representations in which Alzheimer’s is characteristically drawn in colourfully dramatic terms that paint vividly disturbing images” (1995, 152–153).

In keeping with a Semitic idiom that the blood of someone who has been wronged will be required from the perpetrators of evil (Lev 20:9; 1 Sam 4:11; Jer 26:15), the people in Matthew’s passion narrative voluntarily accept the consequences of Jesus’ death.

  Abstract: In the human and social sciences, the modern academic study of memory is generally acknowledged to have been initiated by the sociologist Maurice Halbwachs (1925; 1992). Virtually effaced from scholarly consciousness, he received academic acceptance only decades following his death in Buchenwald. His omnipresence in current memory studies owes much to the work of Jan Assmann, himself the author of a classic work on memory theory. In part dependent on Halbwachs and in part quite separately, memory has recently emerged as a pivotal concept in cultural studies and as a principal topic of research in the humanities and social sciences.<br>

His omnipresence in current memory studies owes much to the work of Jan Assmann, himself the author of a classic work on memory theory. In part dependent on Halbwachs and in part quite separately, memory has recently emerged as a pivotal concept in cultural studies and as a principal topic of research in the humanities and social sciences.<br>

  Abstract: Of all the verses in the New Testament, few have been more deeply implicated in the bloodstained history of Jewish-Christian relations than the Matthean rendition of the people’s response to Pilate and his declaration of his own innocence: “His [Jesus’] blood be on us and on our children” (Matt 27:25). In keeping with a Semitic idiom that the blood of someone who has been wronged will be required from the perpetrators of evil (Lev 20:9; 1 Sam 4:11; Jer 26:15), the people in Matthew’s passion narrative voluntarily accept the consequences of Jesus’ death.

  Introduction from:

  Author(s) Britton Celia<br>
  Abstract: There is a curious relationship between the birth of an academic field and its death. In the manifestos and declaration of intent that mark the invention of a field there is often a recognition of its limitations and an intimation of its future demise. In some cases there is even a tacit challenge to bring about and hasten that expiration, or at least quickly to render the field’s initial manifestations and conceptual apparatus redundant. Such would seem to be the case with Francophone Postcolonial Studies, a field of study that itself came into being through the end of another, the<br>

  Abstract: Among acts by individuals that challenge social and religious norms, suicide ranks among the most transgressive. The part played by religion and, in particular, Christianity in the stigmatisation of the act of self-destruction and the individual who kills or attempts to kill himself/herself has, of course, been rehearsed on countless occasions. As Georges Minois points out in his overview of the history of suicide, the early Christian Church seemed to give out mixed messages on the question: the earthly life is a vale of tears and the Christian should aspire to death so that he/she can be united with God<br>

                  Hamlet, “I mean, where’s it going to end?” And Guildenstern adds a little later, “Death followed by eternity … the worst of both worlds. It is a terrible thought.”¹ Death, as they say, is forever, but if the same were true of life—if one could live a life without end—would this be any less terrible? Some philosophers have argued that life in the absence of death would indeed be terrible—it would be a life, according to Bernard Williams, of unendurable boredom.² I think there<br>

  Abstract: As one reads this famous passage about how Prince Andrei finally meets Napoleon, one may easily assume the narrator’s, and Andrei’s, point of view. But I do not think it would be difficult for me to ignore my hero if I were slowly bleeding to death on the battlefield. It is as though Tolstoy, whose thoughts of death were sometimes all-consuming, purposely imagined an event in fiction in which another would be struck by the enormity of death in a way he himself was. Napoleon fails to interest a man who is dying—to which one wants to say,

He later commented: “One page by Dostoevsky is worth a whole novella by Turgenev.”³ By the turn of the century, Tolstoy had taken full account of<br>

  Abstract: Looming over every positive achievement of the twentieth century is the Nazi Holocaust against the Jewish people, a genocidal explosion that saw a sudden and irrevocable break with all of the secular humanistic traditions that had been developing in Europe over the previous thousand years. The relationship between mass death and the industrial state that became manifested in the Holocaust was both intimate and interdependent, and, as a result of it having taken place, we have forever a yardstick by which all other cases of genocide must be measured. Its message is so powerful that no definition of Western civilization<br>

Husserl may very well have been the most influential philosopher of the century. Toward the end of his life he was often discouraged. In addition to the almost unbearable political situation in which he had come to find himself, there was the full realization that there really was nobody willing and able to continue the work he had started. He had hoped that Heidegger would have been this person; yet Heidegger preferred to go his own way. In Husserl’s view, the task<br>

  Abstract: A Zen master in the Myōshin-ji lineage of the Rinzai School, Shidō Bunan (or Munan) is best known for his teaching that the best approach to Zen would be “to die while you are alive” and then try to remain that way for the rest of your life. One of Bunan’s disciples became the master of Hakuin, and thus the germ of Hakuin’s notion of “the great death” of the self originated with Bunan.

  Book Title: Great Fool-Zen Master Ryokan--Poems, Letters, and Other Writings<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): HASKEL PETER<br>
  Abstract: Taigu Ryokan (1759-1831) remains one of the most popular figures in Japanese Buddhist history. Despite his religious and artistic sophistication, Ryokan referred to himself as "Great Fool" and refused to place himself within the cultural elite of his age. In contrast to the typical Zen master of his time, who presided over a large monastery, trained students, and produced recondite religious treatises, Ryokan followed a life of mendicancy in the countryside. Instead of delivering sermons, he expressed himself through kanshi (poems composed in classical Chinese) and waka and could typically be found playing with the village children in the course of his daily rounds of begging. Great Fool is the first study in a Western language to offer a comprehensive picture of the legendary poet-monk and his oeuvre. It includes not only an extensive collection of the master's kanshi, topically arranged to facilitate an appreciation of Ryokan's colorful world, but selections of his waka, essays, and letters. The volume also presents for the first time in English the Ryokan zenji kiwa (Curious Accounts of the Zen Master Ryokan), a firsthand source composed by a former student less than sixteen years after Ryokan's death. Although it lacks chronological order, the Curious Account is invaluable for showing how Ryokan was understood and remembered by his contemporaries. It consists of colorful anecdotes and episodes, sketches from Ryokan's everyday life.<br>

  Abstract: Because of the vast amount of legendary literature, both oral and written, that has accumulated around Ryōkan since his death, it is often forgotten that the effort to document Ryōkan’s life and to preserve his writings had already begun during his lifetime (1758–1831). This brief survey identifies the key primary sources for Ryōkan’s biography, sketches the historical context in which the contemporaneous biographies of Ryōkan were composed, and illustrates the intertwining historical relationships that join these texts. Many of the sources exist only as unpublished manuscripts. In cases where there exist printed editions of these sources, whether partial or<br>

  Book Title: Making Transcendents-Ascetics and Social Memory in Early Medieval China<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Campany Robert Ford<br>
  Abstract: By the middle of the third century B.C.E. in China there were individuals who sought to become transcendents (xian)—deathless, godlike beings endowed with supernormal powers. This quest for transcendence became a major form of religious expression and helped lay the foundation on which the first Daoist religion was built. Both xian and those who aspired to this exalted status in the centuries leading up to 350 C.E. have traditionally been portrayed as secretive and hermit-like figures. This groundbreaking study offers a very different view of xian-seekers in late classical and early medieval China. It suggests that transcendence did not involve a withdrawal from society but rather should be seen as a religious role situated among other social roles and conceived in contrast to them. Robert Campany argues that the much-discussed secrecy surrounding ascetic disciplines was actually one important way in which practitioners presented themselves to others. He contends, moreover, that many adepts were not socially isolated at all but were much sought after for their power to heal the sick, divine the future, and narrate their exotic experiences.

He contends, moreover, that many adepts were not socially isolated at all but were much sought after for their power to heal the sick, divine the future, and narrate their exotic experiences. The book moves from a description of the roles of xian and xian-seekers to an account of how individuals filled these roles, whether by their own agency or by others’—or, often, by both. Campany summarizes the repertoire of features that constituted xian roles and presents a detailed example of what analyses of those cultural repertoires look like. He charts the functions of a basic dialectic in the self-presentations of adepts and examines their narratives and relations with others, including family members and officials. Finally, he looks at hagiographies as attempts to persuade readers as to the identities and reputations of past individuals. His interpretation of these stories allows us to see how reputations were shaped and even co-opted—sometimes quite surprisingly—into the ranks of xian. Making Transcendents provides a nuanced discussion that draws on a sophisticated grasp of diverse theoretical sources while being thoroughly grounded in traditional Chinese hagiographical, historiographical, and scriptural texts. The picture it presents of the quest for transcendence as a social phenomenon in early medieval China is original and provocative, as is the paradigm it offers for understanding the roles of holy persons in other societies.<br>

  1  The Ghost’s Body from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqx52">The Phantom Heroine</a><br>
  Abstract: Death is not personified in Chinese thought or rhetoric, and consequently death cannot be represented as a feminine figure as it is at many points in Indo-European traditions.¹ Yet the prominence of the female revenant and the frequent fantasy of her resurrection or rebirth is one of the most striking features of seventeenth-century Chinese literature. The taste for “phantom heroines” is part of the widespread fascination with the death of beautiful, talented women in the sentimental culture of this period, exemplified by the phenomenal success of Tang Xianzu’s southern drama of 1598,Peony Pavilion (Mudan ting), which was subtitledThe<br>

  2  The Ghost’s Voice from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqx52">The Phantom Heroine</a><br>
  Abstract: “
                  Perhaps the most obvious thing about death,” write Sarah Goodwin and Elisabeth Bronfen, “is that it is always only represented.”¹ We can never truly know first hand what it would be like to be dead; we can only imagine it. This chapter is about a fantasy inside view of death. It is not an exposé of the topography or organization or activities of the afterlife, (although there are many Chinese stories that do this), but rather what it means to inhabit the subjective viewpoint of the dead. In contrast to the previous chapter, which was about imagining the Other’s dead<br>

  3  Ghosts and Historical Time from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqx52">The Phantom Heroine</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter I explored how the ghost was used in Chinese literature to stage a confrontation with mortality. Endowing the ghost with a voice capable of expressing subjective emotion, primarily through the vehicle of lyric poetry, opened a window onto the unknowable: what would it feel like to be dead, to be on the other side? Accordingly, these ghost stories represent death as an interior state of exile in which suffering and longing are intensified rather than annihilated. The paradigmatic sites of such stories are the cemetery, the unmarked grave, uninhabited wasteland; the paradigmatic poetic genres involved are<br>

  Abstract: The Heian age stands out for the contributions made by noblewomen in the production of literary works and as sponsors of the arts and religious ceremonies. Their participation in political decisions at the center, however, has traditionally been seen as limited, especially when compared to the two hundred years between Empress Suiko’s accession (592) and Empress Shōtoku’s death (770), when men and women reigned in equal numbers and shared similar spans of rule.

  Abstract: LEONARD PELTIER has been in prison for just under thirty years. Accused of killing two FBI agents during a confrontation at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in 1973, Peltier has argued for his innocence. His supporters say that he is a political prisoner, held for upholding Native rights. Conversely, more recent researchers into the American Indian Movement (AIM) and the death of activist Anna Mae Pictou Aquash have sketched AIMʹs own politics as self-aggrandizing and masculinist,¹ and some historians suggest that Peltierʹs importance as a political figure has been exaggerated.² Amid these conflicting views, Peltier has published

  Abstract: NATIVE AMERICAN history is the story and stories of a material oppression that I believe very few people would deny. It is a history of unparalleled genocide—eighty to one hundred million deaths, twenty million in the United States alone.¹ It is a history of violence perpetrated on multiple levels, including personal violence, whereby Natives were tortured, killed outright, torn from parents to be placed in boarding schools and foster homes, put on display at European courts and festivals, and made into spectacle as in the popular Buffalo Billʹs Wild West Show in the 1800s (Slotkin 165ff).

While the need or desire for acceptance or inclusion may seem to signal weakness or low self-confidence, I think of it as a sign of health and as part of daily life. Even more, however, it is part of religious belief and behavior. Indeed, the religious desire for inclusion or acceptance, among other things, accounts, it seems to me, for the expectation of a positive outcome beyond death, which can arise less<br>

  Abstract: Authored by legal practitioners, activists, and theorists in addition to theologians and ethicists, the essays collected here are informed by timeless principles, and yet they could not be timelier. The trend in sentencing moves toward an increased severity, and the number of incarcerated people in the United States is at an all-time high. In the half-decade since 9/11, moreover, homeland security has established itself as a permanent fixture in our lives. In this atmosphere, the current volume seeks initially to clarify how justice and mercy intertwine in relation to a number of issues, such as rehabilitation, the death penalty, domestic violence, and war crimes. Exploring the legal, philosophical, and theological grounds for mercy in our courts, the discussion then moves to the practical ways in which mercy may be implemented.<br>

When one of the major Stoic thinkers of the school’s middle period, Panaetius, befriended Scipio the younger at Rome, the ideas of the Stoics, especially their ethics, started to be tailored to meet the needs of statesmen and soldiers and so assumed an important place in the minds of the emerging elite of what was to become the largest empire yet seen.

                  Iliad3.173). In her regret at what has happened, Eve, too, wishes for death, indeed proposes a suicide pact (PL 10.1001).

  Abstract: As I hope has been made clear in chapter one, attempts at solving the problem of social order all turn ultimately on one’s view of what constitutes (or does not) the individual social actor. Rational and social choice theories—like their economistic prototype—all hark back to a more or less Hobbesian view of the individual as a self-contained actor who is director of his or her own passions and interests, chief among which is, for Hobbes, the fear of death and the corresponding right to flee its approach.<br>

  Book Title: Charred Lullabies-Chapters in an Anthropography of Violence<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Daniel E. Valentine<br>
  Abstract: How does an ethnographer write about violence? How can he make sense of violent acts, for himself and for his readers, without compromising its sheer excess and its meaning-defying core? How can he remain a scholarly observer when the country of his birth is engulfed by terror? These are some of the questions that engage Valentine Daniel in this exploration of life and death in contemporary Sri Lanka. In 1983 Daniel "walked into the ashes and mortal residue" of the violence that had occurred in his homeland. His planned project--the study of women's folk songs as ethnohistory--was immediately displaced by the responsibility that he felt had been given to him, by surviving family members and friends of victims, to recount beyond Sri Lanka what he had seen and heard there. Trained to do fieldwork by staying in one place and educated to look for coherence and meaning in human behavior, what does an anthropologist do when he is forced by circumstances to keep moving, searching for reasons he never finds? How does he write an ethnography (or an anthropography, to use the author's term) without transforming it into a pornography of violence? In avoiding fattening the anthropography into prurience, how does he avoid flattening it with theory? The ways in which Daniel grapples with these questions, and their answers, instill this groundbreaking book with a rare sense of passion, purpose, and intellect.<br>

  Book Title: Russian Experimental Fiction-Resisting Ideology after Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clowes Edith W.<br>
  Abstract: In the three decades following Stalin's death, major underground Russian writers have subverted Soviet ideology by using parody to draw attention to its basis in utopian thought. Referring to utopian writing as diverse as Defoe's
         Robinson Crusoe, Dostoevsky'sNotes from Underground, and Orwell'sAnimal Farm, they have tested notions of truth, reality, and representation. They have gone beyond their precursors by experimenting with the tensions between ludic and didactic art. Edith Clowes explores these "meta-utopian" narratives, which address a wide range of attitudes toward utopia, to expose the challenge that literary play poses to dogmatism and to elucidate the sense of renewal it can bring to social imagination. Using both structural analysis and reception theory, she introduces readers outside Russia to a fascinating body of literature that includes Aleksandr Zinoviev'sThe Yawning Heights, Abram Terts'sLiubimov, Vladimir Voinovich'sMoscow 2042, and Liudmila Petrushevskaia's "The New Robinsons.".<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztrtb">The Darwinian Heritage</a><br>
  Author(s) Durant John R.<br>
  Abstract: It is a fact familiar to all historians of science that Darwin was extremely slow to put his most important ideas into print. Having become a convinced transmutationist in 1837, he made such rapid progress over the next few years that he soon foresaw the prospect of writing a work that would revolutionize natural history. Yet it was not until 1844 that he produced an essay that was suitable for publication by his family in the event of his death; and fourteen years later, the unexpected arrival of Wallace’s short paper “On the tendency of varieties to depart indefinitely from<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztrtb">The Darwinian Heritage</a><br>
  Author(s) Secord James A.<br>
  Abstract: In 1898, sixteen years after the death of Charles Darwin and two years after that of his wife Emma, the fate of their famous residence at Down was highly uncertain. The aging botanist Joseph Hooker, writing to Darwin’s son George, suggested that the historic house might well be saved for future generations by turning it to practical use as an experimental station for the study of animal breeding (Atkins 1974, p. 101). Although never taken up, the idea was an appropriate one. Almost from the very beginning of his career as a transmutationist, Darwin looked to the work of animal<br>

  4  Yes, She Is an Ethicist: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zw0q">Existentialist Thinkers and Ethics</a><br>
  Author(s) SCHULMAN STEPHEN<br>
  Abstract: Hannah Arendt is almost always considered a political thinker, and she is often considered a phenomenologist; she is rarely considered either an existentialist or an ethicist. This is not a surprise, because in some ways Arendt does not look like either one. Unlike most ethicists, for example, she is not primarily concerned with how human beings should act. Furthermore, unlike most existentialists, she is not concerned with death or anxiety, and she focuses on the “public,” as opposed to individuals outside of their relations with others.<br>

  Nietzsche and Biblical Nihilism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt806gf">Nietzsche and the Rhetoric of Nihilism</a><br>

  Abstract: Nietzsche knew nihilism as an historical consequence of Christianity, and, more specifically, as a consequence of the death of the Christian God. That God is identified in
                  The Antichristas the deification of nothingness, the will to nothingness pronounced holy (section 18). No thinker in history has been so obsessed with God as was Nietzsche, nor has any other thinker, with the possible exception of his deepest predecessors, Spinoza and Hegel, so fully known and envisioned the totality of God, a totality which is finally inseparable from consciousness itself. But it was Nietzsche who discovered the nihilistic identity of the<br>

  Abstract: Members of the political science community in Canada were saddened to hear of the sudden death of one of their most respected colleagues, Khayyam Zev Paltiel, on April 17, 1988. For those of us who had spent some time at Carleton University, either as students or as teachers, and who came to know Khayyam, the loss was particularly painful. Many of us in the Political Science department at Carleton had unthinkingly assumed that there would always be a Khayyam Paltiel wandering the corridors of the sixth floor in the Loeb Building, a copy of the

  4  Women and Words in Keats (with an Instance from La Belle Dame sans Merci) from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt807k6">Mind in Creation</a><br>
  Author(s) TETREAULT RONALD<br>
  Abstract: It has become commonplace to praise Keats as a moral hero, bravely enduring the ravages of disease and disappointment until he makes his awkward bow from the stage of the tragedy that can be constructed from his life. His writing, however, is a different matter, for it offers no cathartic reconciliation. That calm of mind with which he faced his death (“Now you must be firm,” he reassured Severn, “for it will not last long”)¹ is missing from a text marked again and again by passion and uncertainty. Yet these, rather than any faith he may have achieved, may be<br>

  Abstract: Kierkegaard says that a physician has a view of sickness different from that of the patient. Why? “Because the physician has a definite and developed conception of what it is to be healthy and ascertains a person’s condition accordingly.”¹ When he came to the climax of his creative vision in 1848, Kierkegaard believed that he had captured a comprehensive understanding, “a definite and developed conception,” of spiritual health. Typically, he explores and depicts this vision of ideal human “health” as the reverse implication of a detailed analysis of die universal human “sickness unto death,” namely despair.

  Abstract: It is not surprising that Antoine de Saint-Exupéry would demonstrate a penchant for aphoristic discourse, in light of his early attraction to Nietzsche and his lifelong admiration for Pascal. Whether it is a question of influence or simple affinity matters little for our purposes here; suffice it to say that we are often reminded of the sententiousaphoristic style of these two predecessors as we read Saint-Exupéry’s text. The most clear-cut manifestation of the style in question occurs in Saint-Exupéry’s highly aphoristic

  Abstract: The poems that Matthew Arnold addressed to Arthur Hugh Clough in life and death, most notably “The Scholar Gipsy” and “Thyrsis,” make these poets the
                  dioscuriof nineteenth century English literature, as securely twinned as Castor and Pollux. There is, of course, a conventionally acknowledged difference: Arnold is major-canonical, while Clough, until recently at least, has been regarded as minor, generally no more than a footnote to his younger friend.¹ In 1849, the year of the composition of the majority of Arnold’s “Switzerland” lyrics and Clough’s epistolary novel in verse,Amours de Voyage, they were pretty much on a footing<br>

  Book Title: Chora 2-Intervals in the Philosophy of Architecture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Parcell Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Karsten Harries provides a new and long-overdue reading of Martin Heidegger's well-known essay "Building Dwelling Thinking." Donald Kunze and Stephen Parcell consider possibilities of meaningful architectural space for a visual culture, continuing themes they addressed in Chora 1. Further reflections on the spaces of literature, cinema, and architecture include an interview with French writer and film maker Alain Robbe-Grillet and articles by Dagmar Motycka Weston on the surrealist city, Tracey Eve Winton on the museum as a paradigmatic modern building, and Terrance Galvin on spiritual space in the works of Jean Cocteau. Jean-Pierre Chupin and Bram Ratner explore historical themes in their essays on French Renaissance architect Philibert de l'Orme and the Jewish myth of the Golem. Gregory Caicco addresses ethical questions in his essay on the Greek agora and the death of Socrates, as does Lily Chi in her meditation on the critical issue of use in architectural works. A concern with architectural representation and generative strategies for the making of architecture is present throughout, especially in the essay by Joanna Merwood on the provocative House by British artist Rachel Whiteread.<br>

  Author(s) Caicco Gregory Paul<br>
  Abstract: SACRIFICE IS THE OLDEST FORM of religious action.¹ If a person wished to draw near to the gods, as the priest Chryses did with Apollo or as Hektor and Odysseus did with Zeus, he could do so only after he had “burnt many thigh-pieces of bulls” (
                  Il. T.40, 22.170;Od. I.66). Ancient piety rested on a foundation of killing, death, and eating. The victim’s end coincided with a ritual scream at a point, between the knife and the altar, where the community and the Awesome were gathered.² By going through this “irreversible act,” life was affirmed through direct confrontation with<br>

  Abstract: Augustine’s preaching does not merely make frequent reference to death and resurrection: it is saturated with a thorough-going emphasis upon the end of mortal life. A case study upon this theme of death and resurrection permits us to examine how Augustine appealed to interiority and temporality when applying Scripture to this important concern. It is our intention in this chapter to expose the methods Augustine used in a way which demonstrates empathy for his approach. Just as we have selected the topic of death and resurrection because it is so prevalent in his preaching, so the aspects of that preaching<br>

  Book Title: The Train Journey-Transit, Captivity, and Witnessing in the Holocaust<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Gigliotti Simone<br>
  Abstract: Deportations by train were critical in the Nazis' genocidal vision of the "Final Solution of the Jewish Question." Historians have estimated that between 1941 and 1944 up to three million Jews were transported to their deaths in concentration and extermination camps. In his writings on the "Final Solution," Raul Hilberg pondered the role of trains: "How can railways be regarded as anything more than physical equipment that was used, when the time came, to transport the Jews from various cities to shooting grounds and gas chambers in Eastern Europe?" This book explores the question by analyzing the victims' experiences at each stage of forced relocation: the round-ups and departures from the ghettos, the captivity in trains, and finally, the arrival at the camps. Utilizing a variety of published memoirs and unpublished testimonies, the book argues that victims experienced the train journeys as mobile chambers, comparable in importance to the more studied, fixed locations of persecution, such as ghettos and camps.<br>

There are countless stories about the horrors of deportation trains that were critical in the Final Solution, the Nazi euphemism for the mass murder of European Jewry during World War II. Irrespective of their origin of deportation, whether from Warsaw, Drancy, Salonica, or Westerbork, former deportees recall resoundingly similar experiences. Deceived into believing that deportation promised survival, seduced by the tantalizing lure of food, violently grabbed and beaten in houses and on streets, intimidated by death threats, volunteering to prevent the break up of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qd53n">The Train Journey</a><br>
  Abstract: The camps were not the destinations of promised resettlement. They were points of no return in a human-engineered system of death that polluted the landscape and survivors’ memories, with flames, smoke, and smell. Would not arrival at the camps offer relief from suffocation and stench in the trains? Preparations for arrival at the camp, and the process of unloading, prompted some deportees to return to the hopes they had when the journey began. But how could the promise of safe arrivals, of deportation as a journey of life, be securely carried into the camp world, considering the torments experienced in<br>

  7  Educationalization as an Ongoing Modernization Process from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdwdd">Between Educationalization and Appropriation</a><br>
  Author(s) Smeyers P.<br>
  Abstract: In several Western societies we witness today an increasing tendency to “educationalize” social problems. As an institution, the school is, among other things, held accountable for solving social inequalities (related to class, race, and gender); for reducing traffic deaths, obesity, teenage sex, and environmental destruction; and for enhancing public health, economic productivity, citizenship, and even performances in sport contests such as the Olympic Games. Pushing these kind of “social” responsibilities on schools is a process that has been under way for a long time and coincides with the role of education in the formation of the modern nation-state.

  Abstract: The tragic deaths of twenty-six people shot and killed on December 14, 2012, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, included twenty young children and six educators. All of the children were shot multiple times. Many more children might have been killed or injured had it not been for the brave and decisive actions of the teachers in the school. The mainstream media was quick to call them heroes, and there is little doubt that what they did under horrific circumstances reveals not only how important educators are in shielding children from imminent threat, but also how demanding their<br>

  Author(s) MANSFIELD JOHN H.<br>
  Abstract: In 1641, a group of courageous or foolhardy persons set forth from the wintry, intolerant shores of Massachusetts to establish a tolerating state in the gentler clime of Providence Isle off the coast of Nicaragua. They probably had become fired up by events in England and talk of religious liberty coming from there, but having no opportunity to put their new beliefs into practice in Massachusetts, they looked elsewhere to establish them. To their libertarian beliefs, however, there was one limit: anyone who spoke against another’s religion would be put to death,¹ Thus like Jean Bodin, they agreed with the<br>

  Book Title: Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Feminist as Thinker-A Reader in Documents and Essays<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Smith Richard Cándida<br>
  Abstract: More than one hundred years after her death, Elizabeth Cady Stanton still stands - along with her close friend Susan B. Anthony - as the major icon of the struggle for women's suffrage. In spite of this celebrity, Stanton's intellectual contributions have been largely overshadowed by the focus on her political activities, and she is yet to be recognized as one of the major thinkers of the nineteenth century.Here, at long last, is a single volume exploring and presenting Stanton's thoughtful, original, lifelong inquiries into the nature, origins, range, and solutions of women's subordination. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Feminist as Thinker reintroduces, contextualizes, and critiques Stanton's numerous contributions to modern thought. It juxtaposes a selection of Stanton's own writings, many of them previously unavailable, with eight original essays by prominent historians and social theorists interrogating Stanton's views on such pressing social issues as religion, marriage, race, the self and community, and her place among leading nineteenth century feminist thinkers. Taken together, these essays and documents reveal the different facets, enduring insights, and fascinating contradictions of the work of one of the great thinkers of the feminist tradition.Contributors: Barbara Caine, Richard Candida Smith, Ellen Carol DuBois, Ann D. Gordon, Vivian Gornick, Kathi Kern, Michele Mitchell, and Christine Stansell.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qgk5t">Religious Imaginaries</a><br>
  Abstract: In moving from a consideration of Christina Rossetti’s religious imaginary as shaped within Anglican and Anglo-Catholic worship to a close reading of the religious poetry itself, this chapter focuses primarily on Rossetti’s last publication.
                  Verses,published in 1893, one year before Rossetti’s death, is the poet’s only collection of solely religious poetry. I focus on it for two reasons.

  Author(s) MOLERO - MESA JORGE<br>
  Abstract: One of the features most frequently mentioned to highlight the social impact of tuberculosis is that it was the main cause of mortality in every industrialised country in the nineteenth century. In Spain, tuberculosis contributed to around 7 percent of the general mortality rate between 1901 and 1930, which resulted in about thirty thousand deaths each year. Some contemporaries claimed that deficiencies in the data collection and analysis meant the actual figure was as high as seventy thousand; indeed, some estimates multiplied the official number of deaths from tuberculosis by ten. However, high mortality was not the only feature that<br>

  Abstract: The language of tears seen in poem 92, “Piangete, donne, et con voi pianga Amore” (“O ladies weep, and may Love weep with you”), mourning the death of Cino da Pistoia, establishes the act of weeping not simply as a natural part of grief but as a means of prostrating oneself before God together with the community.¹ To weep openly is to break stoic apathy.

There is the blackboard on which the rebel Arabs leave Daru’s death sentence at the end of the short story ‘L’Hôte.’ The long process during which Joseph Grand labours painstakingly over the single sentence he seeks to perfect is also worked out on a blackboard, his room being described thus: ‘On remarquait seulement un rayon de bois blanc garni de deux ou trois dictionnaires, et un tableau noir sur lequel on pouvait lire<br>

  Abstract: All the existentialists are united in their opposition to idealist philosophies which ignore space and time as necessary conditions of the human existence. In no way is the finiteness of the human creature more evident than in the fact that he must live an earthly existence, and, since things in time have a beginning and an end, that he must be subject to the mysteries of birth and death. Ignoring these fundamental facts, the idealists sought to transcend the time process by rational system and they imposed a rational pattern upon the course of historical events.

  Abstract: The question of the subject remains both central and contentious in poststructuralist thought, despite – or perhaps in accordance with – the poststructuralist declaration of the subject’s death. The issue primarily concerns where a revised notion of the subject will be positioned and what role it will take in relation to concepts of meaning, agency, thinking and politics. The matter, however, is not usually posed in this way, as many thinkers who broadly fall within poststructuralist circles have instead framed the question of the subject as a debate between those who would retain it and those who would throw away<br>

  Abstract: One of the most famous figures of poststructuralism, Jacques Derrida, died on 8 October 2004. Over the following days, weeks and months, newspapers and other media the world over contained reactions, responses, comments and obituaries to him. Many of these were surprisingly hostile; they were often irreverent and disrespectful; and often also mocking, joking and scornful. Some were starkly abusive and aggressive. In fact, many obituaries, reactions and responses to the news of Derrida’s death attacked or slandered not only his work but also cast aspersions on his character and personality.

  Author(s) Widder Nathan<br>
  Abstract: The question of the subject remains both central and contentious in poststructuralist thought, despite – or perhaps in accordance with – the poststructuralist declaration of the subject’s death. The issue primarily concerns where a revised notion of the subject will be positioned and what role it will take in relation to concepts of meaning, agency, thinking and politics. The matter, however, is not usually posed in this way, as many thinkers who broadly fall within poststructuralist circles have instead framed the question of the subject as a debate between those who would retain it and those who would throw away<br>

  Abstract: Combining black humour, thriller and horror film, Alex de la Iglesia’s
                  La Comunidad (Common Wealth2000) tells the story of a gruesome community of neighbours who have signed a contract to share the money that another of their neighbours has won in thequiniela(football pools) after his death. However, their plans are frustrated when a new arrival, the estate agent Julia, finds the dead man’s money and decides to keep it for herself.

  CHAPTER FOUR  Measure: from:

  Abstract: This chapter follows on from the last by offering an account of the differences between Wordsworth and Coleridge’s thinking on poetic diction and measure. Wordsworth’s well-known objections to poetic diction were made just before the death of Cowper, whose work Wordsworth read and admired. Wordsworth understands poetic diction as a strictly delimited and historically sanctioned set of words found frequently in poetry and infrequently in prose, and therefore an artificial deformation of language, like metre and rhyme. Unlike those deformations, however, poetic diction is unpredictable:<br>

  Abstract: In international affairs, 11 September 2001 was a watershed day. This day will forever be associated with the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, DC that resulted in the deaths of 3,000 people. Over the course of the next decade more than 7,500 American, British and other allied troops would lose their lives in the wars and occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq. Civilians, too, have been killed and, while exact figures are unknown and often ignored, the widely accepted conservative estimate is that more than 130,000 Iraqi and Afghan citizens have lost their lives during this same time period<br>

  Abstract: Karl Jaspers’ existential concept of death lies at the heart of this book. For Jaspers, a human being is not merely a physical entity, but a being with a transcendent aspect, which is in some sense ‘deathless’. It is the connection between these two aspects of the human being that governs the structure of his work. This book is primarily concerned to clarify and reassess Jaspers’ concept of death and his claim that one’s transcendent self ‘knows no death’. In this respect, it is an attempt to determine what it means for a human being to be ‘deathless’ within the<br>

  Abstract: In Chapter 3, we explored the relationship between 
                     Existenz, death and eternity. We also interpreted what it means for one’s Existenz to be deathless from two different perspectives: the Mystical and the Existential Interpretations. We now turn to the final part of the analysis. In this chapter, I draw on the traditional understanding of eternity as non-temporal duration. I then take a fresh look at Jaspers’ concept of the Augenblick experience within the framework of the Existential Interpretative model. Finally, Jaspers’ assertions about the eternal aspect of one’s Existenz is reassessed.<br>

  Book Title: Death-Drive-Freudian Hauntings in Literature and Art<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Smith Robert Rowland<br>
  Abstract: Robert Rowland Smith takes Freud's work on the death-drive and compares it with other philosophies of death - Pascal, Heidegger and Derrida in particular. He also applies it in a new way to literature and art - to Shakespeare, Rothko and Katharina Fritsch, among others. He asks whether artworks are dead or alive, if artistic creativity isn't actually a form of destruction, and whether our ability to be seduced by fine words means we don't put our selves at risk of death. In doing so, he proposes a new theory of aesthetics in which artworks and literary texts have a death-drive of their own, not least by their defining ability to turn away from all that is real, and where the effects of the death-drive mean that we are constantly living in imaginary, rhetorical or 'artistic' worlds. The book also provides a valuable introduction to the rich tradition of work on the death-drive since Freud.Key Features* Includes a general introduction to the death-drive* Presents an original theory of aesthetics* Analyses both theoretical and clinical psychoanalysis* Offers in-depth treatment of Freud* Provides an overview of philosophies of death<br>

  Abstract: Everything that lives, dies. Equally – for it doesn’t follow – everything that dies will have lived. Rather than being opposites, therefore, it’s fairer to say that living and dying depend on each other, each the other’s condition. Although we might think of death as standing at the end of life, as its destination or terminus, it had to be there from the start – life wouldn’t have been able to get going unless it had agreed to come to an end. Life and death make up the two sides of a same coin – not two different coins –<br>

In the largely symbolic fairy tale Time in a Red Coat, the seafaring adventure story Vinland and the elegiac Beside the Ocean of Time, Brown examines the idea of community as myth, as historical reality and as fiction itself.

  Book Title: The Real and the Sacred-Picturing Jesus in Nineteenth-Century Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): GATRALL JEFFERSON J. A.<br>
  Abstract: The international "quest of the historical Jesus" has been amply documented within the context of nineteenth-century biblical scholarship. Yet there has been no broad-based comparative study devoted to the depiction of Jesus in prose fiction over the same time period.
         The Real and the Sacredoffers a comprehensive survey of this body of fiction, examining both the range of its Christ types and the varying formal means through which these types were represented. The nineteenth century-despite forecasts of God's death at the time-not only revived older Christ types but also witnessed the rise of new ones, includingle Christ proletaire, the Mormon Christ, the Buddhist Christ, and the Tolstoyan Christ. Novelists played a crucial role in the invention and popularization of the historical Jesus in particular, one of modernity's major figures.<br>

Martineau nevertheless claimed to “cherish” this “little volume” alongsideEastern Life, Past and Present(1848)—a freethinker’s travelogue to the Holy Land—above all her other writings. After its success in London, the novel was republished in the United States, later translated into French, and reprinted as late as 1892, more than a quarter century after the author’s death.<br>

  Abstract: Evelyn Lincoln served as John F. Kennedy’s personal secretary in the White House. She is credited with saving from extinction various notes, drafts, doodles, and miscellaneous Kennedy memorabilia that otherwise would not have been preserved.² Following JFK’s death, the Kennedy Library, Senator Ted Kennedy, and John F. Kennedy Jr. directly asked Lincoln to donate her collected memorabilia to the library.³ She responded by donating some of her collection. At her death in 1995, she bequeathed other memorabilia to another collector, Robert L. White. Three years later, White attempted to auction some of his Kennedy memorabilia received from Lincoln as well<br>

  Abstract: The above account appeared in a Parisian daily newspaper,
                  Le Matin, in 1906 among a list offaits-divers, sundry incidents too minor to warrant full stories. Offering only a bare description of the scene and without preface or commentary, the miniature narrative says little about the victim yet speaks volumes. nestled among other reports of accident or misfortune from across France, the anonymous story reminds the newspaper reader of shared vulnerability: even a priest is not safe from the capriciousness of fate. The tale’s swiftness reinforces the abrupt arrival of death. An event almost too insignificant to mention suggests universal<br>

  Abstract: Sidney Greenspan (1915–44) was a small, skinny, myopic Jew with sloping shoulders, a prominent nose, and thin brown hair. He died brutally in Carano, Italy, during World War II’s “Operation Shingle.” His death occurred two days after Allied forces carried out an amphibious landing on Anzio Beach to outflank the German troops and facilitate an attack on Rome. On 24 January 1944, Sidney, serving as a medic, was hit by machine-gun fire that first shattered his right hip and then splintered his left forearm. Sidney continued caring for the wounded, hauling them to safety until he bled to death.<br>

  Book Title: The Science of the Soul in Colonial New England-  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): RIVETT SARAH<br>
  Abstract: The Science of the Soulchallenges long-standing notions of Puritan provincialism as antithetical to the Enlightenment. Sarah Rivett demonstrates that, instead, empiricism and natural philosophy combined with Puritanism to transform the scope of religious activity in colonial New England from the 1630s to the Great Awakening of the 1740s.In an unprecedented move, Puritan ministers from Thomas Shepard and John Eliot to Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards studied the human soul using the same systematic methods that philosophers applied to the study of nature. In particular, they considered the testimonies of tortured adolescent girls at the center of the Salem witch trials, Native American converts, and dying women as a source of material insight into the divine. Conversions and deathbed speeches were thus scrutinized for evidence of grace in a way that bridged the material and the spiritual, the visible and the invisible, the worldly and the divine.In this way, the "science of the soul" was as much a part of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century natural philosophy as it was part of post-Reformation theology. Rivett's account restores the unity of religion and science in the early modern world and highlights the role and importance of both to transatlantic circuits of knowledge formation.<br>

  Abstract: On the day before her death in 1697, Mary Clark Bonner requested the presence of her close friends and family members in her Cambridge home. A group began to gather around her bed to bear witness to the final phase in the life of a Puritan saint: a testimony offering evidence of divine translation, the passage from death to eternal life. Often compared to childbirth, this passage was long and laborious. At one point, Mary cried out in a dreadful and frightened voice, “The devil came upon me like a Lyon.” Her neighbor Mrs. Champney comforted and encouraged her “not<br>

  Book Title: “The Useless Mouths” and Other Literary Writings-  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Le Bon de Beauvoir Sylvie<br>
  Abstract: "The Useless Mouths" and Other Literary Writings brings to English-language readers literary writings--several previously unknown--by Simone de Beauvoir. Culled from sources including various American university collections, the works span decades of Beauvoir's career. Ranging from dramatic works and literary theory to radio broadcasts, they collectively reveal fresh insights into Beauvoir's writing process, personal life, and the honing of her philosophy. The volume begins with a new translation of the 1945 play The Useless Mouths, written in Paris during the Nazi occupation. Other pieces were discovered after Beauvoir's death in 1986, such as the 1965 short novel "Misunderstanding in Moscow," involving an elderly French couple who confront their fears of aging. Two additional previously unknown texts include the fragmentary "Notes for a Novel," which contains the seed of what she later would call "the problem of the Other," and a lecture on postwar French theater titled Existentialist Theater. The collection notably includes the eagerly awaited translation of Beauvoir's contribution to a 1965 debate among Jean-Paul Sartre and other French writers and intellectuals, "What Can Literature Do?" Prefaces to well-known works such as Bluebeard and Other Fairy Tales, La Bâtarde, and James Joyce in Paris: His Final Years are also available in English for the first time, alongside essays and other short articles. A landmark contribution to Beauvoir studies and French literary studies, the volume includes informative and engaging introductory essays by prominent and rising scholars. Contributors are Meryl Altman, Elizabeth Fallaize, Alison S. Fell, Sarah Gendron, Dennis A. Gilbert, Laura Hengehold, Eleanore Holveck, Terry Keefe, J. Debbie Mann, Frederick M. Morrison, Catherine Naji, Justine Sarrot, Liz Stanley, Ursula Tidd, and Veronique Zaytzeff<br>

  Author(s) Simons Margaret A.<br>
  Abstract: This volume of literary writings by Simone de Beauvoir (1908–86), the renowned French existentialist author of
                     The Second Sex, opens with a drama. Beauvoir wrote her 1945 play,The Useless Mouths, during the final year of the Nazi Occupation of France when food shortages were acute. Her story of the anguish of choice for a besieged medieval town facing starvation is also a surprisingly feminist tale of courageous women who stare down death and inspire the male leaders of the town to do the same.<br>

  Abstract: One must admire today the extent to which the terrain of Simone de Beauvoir scholarship has changed over these last decades: the Beauvoir whose centennial we celebrated in 2008 is a very different public and private figure from the one whose death we mourned in 1986. Still, little critical attention continues to be paid to Beauvoir’s relationship to theater, admittedly a small portion of her creative activity with
                  Les bouches inutiles(The Useless Mouths) as her only play, and even less to her ideas on theater.¹ Until recently, Beauvoir’s theoretical interest in the genre as both a written and a<br>

  Author(s) ARRIGO BRUCE A.<br>
  Abstract: Ethnographic studies of “dangerous men” have generally taken us behind bars. Erving Goffman’s (1961) arresting critique of the confinement setting as a generative milieu for the exercise of power helped to spawn a series of monograph-length works recounting life, death, and survival behind prison walls (e.g., Jacobs 1978; Sykes 1971; Toch 1977). A second wave of penological analysis, still concerned with “everyday experience” behind bars, challenged the correctional system as an extension of the state’s regulatory ambit. For example, Irwin’s (1970, 1985) studies of the felon and the jail respectively ushered in a new era of incisive commentary. Crime control<br>

                  who they are.During in-depth interviews with twenty-seven men in and out of correctional institutions, in halfway houses, and on death row, I heard depictions of the self as morally decent and as engaged in a heroic struggle of some sort. It is crucial that we understand such talk. Violence is excused and justified through talk about the self in relation to others: for example, by saying that the victim has wronged one in the past<br>

  Abstract: It would be difficult to find someone for whom this name does not evoke images, emotions, memories, desires, beliefs. Even years after his death in 2011, Osama bin Laden’s name conjures up a complex array of narratives and representational structures. Depending on one’s location—geographically, politically, religiously—the name invokes stories of evil, bravery, destruction, retribution, deception, truth-telling, cowardice, courage. The name—“Osama bin Laden”— goes far beyond the man—Osama bin Laden—and extends well beyond his death.<br>

  Abstract: The greatest night of Geraldo Rivera’s career: this is worth looking into. To understand Rivera’s nationalist ebullience—echoed in the streets and tweets across the United States on the night of bin Laden’s death—I’d like to figure Osama bin Laden’s body as an object in the Ahmedian sense of the word, that is, as an orientation device with world-mapping capabilities. In this framing, it could be said that bin Laden’s fugitive tenure occasioned, among many Americans, a profound and prolonged bout of phenomenological disorientation.

That landmark, however, is no signpost, stone marker, or architectural structure heavily anchored to a place and drawn on a map. It is more like a scratch in a record that makes the needle stutter and skip. “For most of my life,” Delany recalls, “if it came up, I would tell you: ‘My father died of lung cancer in 1958 when I was seventeen.’”²<br>

But, in between, it is a pure sense of life, a belief, a common, which I have suggested as a belief morphed into knowledge, that overwhelms and blurs all else. My explorations here have started<br>

  Book Title: The Thought of Death and the Memory of War-  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
  Abstract: War lays bare death and our relation to it. And in the wars-or more precisely the memories of war-of the twentieth century, images of the deaths of countless faceless or nameless others eclipse the singularity of each victim's death as well as the end of the world as such that each death signifies. Marc Crépon's The Thought of Death and the Memory of War is a call to resist such images in which death is no longer actual death since it happens to anonymous others, and to seek instead a world in which mourning the other whose mortality we always already share points us toward a cosmopolitics. Crépon pursues this path toward a cosmopolitics of mourning through readings of works by Freud, Heidegger, Sartre, Patocka, Levinas, Derrida, and Ricœur, and others. The movement among these writers, Crépon shows, marks a way through-and against-twentieth-century interpretation to argue that no war, genocide, or neglect of people is possible without suspending how one relates to the death of another human being. A history of a critical strain in contemporary thought, this book is, as Rodolphe Gasché says in the Foreword, "a profound meditation on what constitutes evil and a rigorous and illuminating reflection on death, community, and world." The translation of this work received financial support from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<br>

  Abstract: With these two phrases, as is often the case in his writings on Heidegger, Derrida opens up a perspective that is at the same time a breach. It has been said over and over again that the existential analytic recoils from thinking about the political, that it treats the political as an ancillary and derivative question. But Derrida’s two remarks suggest something else. They invite us to ask more specifically if this wavering before the political might not be what is playing itself out in the sections

  Author(s) Sartre Jean-Paul<br>
  Abstract: Few passages of Sartre’s architecturally complex work 
                  Being and Nothingness are more critical of the existential analytic of Being and Time than those, in the fourth and last part, devoted to “my death.” Heidegger’s summons to an authentic Being-toward-death—to the acknowledgment by Dasein that death is its ownmost possibility—becomes, translated into Sartre’s idiom, the realization of a “project toward death,” the realization of a “freedom-to-die” that allows Dasein to “constitute itself as totality by [its] free choice of finitude.”¹ The idea that death can be the object of such a project [projet] is thus, from the beginning, put<br>

  Author(s) Levinas Emmanuel<br>
  Abstract: As stated in the introduction, none of the philosophical engagements with Heidegger’s 
                  Being and Time in the last century is more clearly marked by the memory of World War II—by the torment of mass murder, the assassinations, the untold executions, and, most extraordinarily, the deportation and extermination of the Jews of Europe, which distinguishes this war from all others—than the thought of Emmanuel Levinas. It is this torment that makes for the uniqueness of the thought of death that Levinas elaborates in the pages of his work. It keeps alive, like no other, the memory of the victims<br>

  Author(s) Ricœur Paul<br>
  Abstract: For Paul Ricoeur, as for Sartre, Levinas, Patočka, and Derrida, sections 46 through 53 of 
                  Being and Time, on the existential analytic of Being-toward-death, constitute one of the most acutely confrontational passages of Heidegger’s formidable book. Bearing spirited witness to this is a long passage in part 3 of Memory, History, Forgetting, devoted to “the historical condition,” in which the philosopher of memory and history considers in his turn the identification of death with “the intimate possibility of one’s ownmost potentiality of being,” and opposes to it “an alternative reading of the potentiality of dying.”¹ However, as Ricœur was writing<br>

  Abstract: We live day in and day out with images of death. They are foisted on us at regular hours of the day. We encounter them at newsstands, both in magazines and in the publicity for magazines. They continually invade the televised news. They participate in the coverage of events whose distinctive character, whose primary character is to

  Abstract: Orgasm is a blind spot; “you can fire a pistol in the room without disturbing lovers at the point.”¹ But so is the vanishing point in Paolo Uccello’s
                  The Hunt. The recovery of the middle ground may signify the emancipation of women from political servitude, but how does it address the question of desire? Apollo may be a hunter, but so is Diana, the deity presiding overLa Caccia. The little death of orgasm is twinned with the larger conclusion of life.

                  The Hairy Ape(1921), the main character, Yank, encounters a gorilla at the zoo.¹ As the two stare “intently” at each other, Yank admires the gorilla’s body: “Some chest yuh got, and shoulders, and dem arms and mits!” (195). Inspired and awed by the strength of the figure before him, Yank breaks his new friend out of his cage, only to be repaid with “a murderous hug.” Lying near death on the floor of the cage, Yank utters his last words “in the strident tones of a circus barker”: “Ladies and gents,<br>

When the Hijar-Padrés colonists, including men, women, and children, left Mexico City in caravans to come to California in 1834, their neighbors cried and tried to dissuade them from going to a place where they would all meet certain death at the hands of the Indians (Coronel, 6).

  Abstract: In the medieval Icelandic culture of the supernatural, one who recrossed the boundary from death to life was called

In thedraugr,spirit is not breathed into matter so much as material corporeality is retained by the restless spirit.

His contribution to Latin American theater and to Cuban narrative is undeniably important. Similarly, he exercised great influence on a younger generation of writers with whom he came in contact during his years at the helm of
                  Ciclón(Cyclone; 1955-59), such as playwrights José Triana (1935) and Antón Arrufat (1935), and novelists such as Severo Sarduy (1937-93) and Reinaldo Arenas (1943-92) (González Echevarría 23). And yet, Piñera’s work remains elusive; perhaps more than any other Cuban<br>

  Abstract: What is at stake when the ravages of the flesh nourish the ecstasy of the letter? What happens when the metaphorical condensation of love and death, so essential to the mystico-poetic tradition, is realized, actualized, literalized? How do readers and writers situate themselves with respect to texts that communicate sickness, especially when the texts engage the discourse of divinity? Despite their seemingly timeless appeal, these and other questions acquire immediacy and urgency in the crisis of representation (Simon Watney) and the brutality of idealization (Leo Bersani) that mark the age of AIDS.

  Abstract: Grasping the foundational status of time requires acceding to finitude as our ultimate horizon. Just as artists, scientists, and philosophers of the twentieth century tried to integrate time into thought, they also attempted to affirm the inescapability of finitude. We reject temporality because we cannot accept finitude, and we construct the idea of eternity in order to avoid it.¹ Major philosophers and physicists of the twentieth century explain the denial of temporality in this manner. In
                  The Direction of Time, for instance, physicist Hans Reichenbach contends that our failure to properly understand time stems from our flight from death. He<br>

Generally such anecdotes are not explained but get filed away with other exotic superstitions held by curious primitives, leaving these people to sort out their own relationship to cameras, photographs, film, and now video. Traditional people sometimes follow through by taming the magical properties of recording media.

  Abstract: Boundaries abound. Between humanity and the gods. Between human and animal. Between culture and nature. Between life and death. Between genders, nations, peoples, times, races, classes, and territories. But boundaries have also become problematic today, perhaps more so than before. In a world experienced by many to be without a natural design to which they might conform, the function of boundaries becomes highly ambiguous. Boundaries form indispensable protections against violation and violence; but the divisions they sustain also carry cruelty and violence. Boundaries provide preconditions of identity, individual agency, and collective action; but they also close off possibilities of being<br>

In the first place, Derrida argues that expression not only (as Husserl sees) does not require fulfillment in order to exercise its meaning function, but essentially involves a lack of fulfillment.¹ The very structure of Husserl’s pure grammar shows that meaning excludes intuition, the presence of the object meant. This would be true even for words such as “I,” which means that the meaningfulness of my own utterances requires my own absence or death. Since writing is defined as those signs that function even in the absence of the<br>

Agius, a monk-priest of the nearby abbey of Corvey—her confidant and perhaps a blood relative—was with her when she died.¹ Afterward, so he tells us, Agius consoled her bereaved sisters at Gandersheim, speaking movingly of Hathumoda’s long and painful passing and the significance of her life and death. Over the next two years he transformed those conversations into a consolatory dialogue in verse. At the same time, so that they, who could “no longer hold her or gaze at her in the flesh,” might at least “possess<br>

                  Book of Visions (Liber visionum) is a unique, largely unstudied, collection of thirty-seven visions produced during a period of great religious anxiety and instability—the long vacancy after the death of Pope Nicholas IV, the odd selection of the saintly-hermit Peter Marrone as successor, his resignation, and the subsequent election of Boniface VIII. The visions are preserved in two manuscripts, both of which also contain Robert’s only other known work, The Book of the Words of the Lord (Liber<br>

  Abstract: From late February to early March 1513, after Piero Soderini’s republican government had bowed to the consequences of military defeat at Prato and a foreign power had returned the Medici to Florence as more than first citizens, Niccolò Machiavelli spent three weeks as their political prisoner.² Then, on March 11, Cardinal Giovanni de’Medici became Pope Leo X. Florence celebrated with an amnesty, and Machiavelli, liberated to territorial confinement, spent the late spring and summer writing 
                  On Principalities (De principatibus).³ Although he would write many other things before his death in 1527, including works that gave him some literary standing among<br>

  Abstract: When peter the Venerable’s mother died in 1135, her son consoled himself with metaphor: the body of his mother was not, in truth, dead matter or flesh, but rather a living seed. As Peter explained in a letter to his grieving brothers, the body can revivify at the end of time only if it has already putrefied in death; like those of their mother’s, he assured them, “the seeds of [our] bodies” (cf. 1 Cor 15:37) would sprout and grow anew at the resurrection, their burials, like hers, having accomplished a veritable sowing of immortality.¹ Peter had turned to the<br>

  Abstract: The two quotations forming an epigraph to this introduction appear to advance contradictory theses. Paradoxically, that is not the case. For, as the saying goes, there is death and then there is death. Thus it is not really cinema-as-a-medium whose death the British filmmaker Peter Greenaway is observing, but rather a form of cinema, the form that dominated the twentieth century:
                  classical narrative cinema(or something like it). This form of cinema involves plunging a passive viewer into the darkness of a “traditional” movie theater. What Greenaway is lashing out at is something he describes as “old fashioned ideas of<br>

  Abstract: Some people see the crisis cinema finds itself in the midst of today as a mild foreshadowing of its death, visible on the horizon. The various heralds of the “death” of cinema do not generally believe in its true death, in any real cessation of its vital activity. In the context of the digital turn, the “death” foretold is indicative, rather, of the medium’s decline within the great chorus of media and also of the end of a situation in which cinema exercised an across-the-board hegemony.

  Abstract: The Allied forces called it ‘

A frontal assault on the firepower of US Marines was little more than a well-ordered mass suicide; and exactly that element of the Pacific War gained a new meaning in the opening decade of the twenty-first century when the West again faced an enemy more concerned with death than with victory. In Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) director Clint Eastwood tells the story of the Japanese soldiers fighting Americans (the Americans’ story is told in Flags of Our Fathers, 2006),<br>

It is a maze-mandala in the form of a commercial Lasco fan, modeled on the one installed in my studio window in Boston to clear the smoke and toxic fumes from my work space. The butts and the fan blades come together in the shape of a gold host, where inhalation and exhalation, life and death, health and illness, the addict and the saint share the same space.<br>

  Book Title: The Disclosure of Politics-Struggles Over the Semantics of Secularization<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lara María Pía<br>
  Abstract: Postmodern political critiques speak of the death of ideology, the end of history, and the postsecular return of religious attitudes, yet radical conservative theorists such as Mark Lilla argue religion and politics are inextricably intertwined. Returning much-needed uncertainty to debates over the political while revitalizing the very terms in which they are defined, María Pía Lara explores the ambiguity of secularization and the theoretical potential of a structural break between politics and religion.<br>

  SEVEN  The Ascetic Ideal from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/onfr17126">A Hedonist Manifesto</a><br>
  Abstract: Twenty centuries of wholesale Judeo-Christianity has left its mark on the Western body. Recycling the Pythagorean tradition and, above all, that of Plato has made the Christian European body schizophrenic. It hates itself, and it harbors the extraordinary fiction of an immaterial and immortal soul. It delights in the death drive that the dominant ideology cultivates.<br>

  FOURTEEN  An Art of Artifice from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/onfr17126">A Hedonist Manifesto</a><br>
  Abstract: Ever since humans started humanizing themselves, they made themselves artificial, emancipating themselves from their natural condition. The first trepanations and cataract procedures proved that nature was not to be celebrated as a sweet and good provider of nothing but positivity, like some cornucopia. It also contains death, sadness, suffering, conflict, claws, beaks, and condemnation of the weak to death.<br>

  Epilogue: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/shou12328">Milton and the Rabbis</a><br>
  Abstract: In chapter 5 I suggested a parallel between Milton’s imagined forecast of future times in the final books of 
                  Paradise Lost and the rabbinic fantasy of Moses’s visit to the bet midrash of R. Akiba. Both mountaintop scenes render complex perspectives on history, politics, belief, and human agency. These two scenes of instruction offer useful insights into one another, but Milton’s portrayal of Michael’s postlapsarian instructions to Adam has for its precursor a more explicit biblical account of divinely granted vistas, Moses’s Pisgah sight, just before his death, in Deuteronomy 34.¹ Anticipating Milton’s own reworking of this culminating biblical episode,<br>

  Book Title: The Death of Philosophy-Reference and Self-reference in Contemporary Thought<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): LYNCH RICHARD A.<br>
  Abstract: Thomas-Fogiel begins with postphilosophical claims such as scientism, which she reveals to be self-refuting, for they subsume philosophy into the branches of the natural sciences. She discovers similar issues in Rorty's skepticism and strands of continental thought. Revisiting the work of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century philosophers, when the split between analytical and continental philosophy began, Thomas-Fogiel finds both traditions followed the same path-the road of reference-which ultimately led to self-contradiction. This phenomenon, whether valorized or condemned, has been understood as the death of philosophy. Tracing this pattern from Quine to Rorty, from Heidegger to Levinas and Habermas, Thomas-Fogiel reveals the self-contradiction at the core of their claims while also carving an alternative path through self-reference. Trained under the French philosopher Bernard Bourgeois, she remakes philosophy in exciting new ways for the twenty-first century.<br>

  Abstract: How else could a book about birds and extinction begin, but with the tragicstory of the Dodo? In death, this bird from a small island in the western Indian Ocean has taken on a strange celebrity, becoming something of a “poster child” for extinction. And yet, many of the specific images and ideas about the Dodo that circulate in people’s imaginations are highly speculative. Ultimately, a great deal remains unclear about what kind of a bird the Dodo was, how it lived, and when it passed from the world. While reports, sketches, and paintings of the Dodo survive from<br>

Unlike otherau couranttheorists, Said was refreshing: his accessible erudition and sharp-edged writing style sliced cleanly through a seemingly autochthonous, gelatinous mass of theoretical obscurantism. That he was one of a handful of politically inclined academics in the United States—from the mid-1970s till his death in 2003 he stuck his neck out to defend the Palestinian underdog against a tyrannical Israeli government—made him especially unique and<br>

  Abstract: Focusing on the Classic Period (AD 250-900), James Fitzsimmons examines and compares textual and archaeological evidence for rites of death and burial in the Maya lowlands, from which he creates models of royal Maya funerary behavior. Exploring ancient Maya attitudes toward death expressed at well-known sites such as Tikal, Guatemala, and Copan, Honduras, as well as less-explored archaeological locations, Fitzsimmons reconstructs royal mortuary rites and expands our understanding of key Maya concepts including the afterlife and ancestor veneration.<br>

  Abstract: Rituals surrounding death are informed not only by biological concerns but also by social and religious norms of behavior. As a primary focus in sociocultural anthropology, the study of death witnessed an explosion in theoretical refinement and scope over the last few decades of the twentieth century, expanding far beyond its modest nineteenth-century origins in the study of social organization to address broad philosophical and anthropological issues.¹ Archaeology has followed a similar path, with speculative, chronological, and cultural approaches to burials supplanted by the concerns of processual and postprocessual theory.² Yet most analytical approaches to death have at their theoretical<br>

It was a stigma procured during sex or maize consumption: ingesting maize and participating in sexual activity were ways of consuming death and incorporating it into the body. In eating maize, they brought what was born of the earth—of the realm of death—into their bodies and hence began participation in a larger life cycle.² Knowingin teuhtli, in tlazolli,“the dust, the filth,” of sex was likewise viewed as a<br>

  Abstract: As can be expected, funerary rites are not generally depicted from start to finish. Perhaps the best encapsulation of behaviors associated with death, burial, and rebirth comes from the aforementioned Berlin vessel (Figure 31). On it, a deceased lord is wrapped within a bundle inside a funerary temple, with mourners outside crying and gesturing toward the pyramid. Although his burial is not shown, it is implied: his bones sit amid watery bands, indicating his entry into the Underworld. He reappears in two forms, as an anthropomorphic cacao tree and as an abstract lunar deity. Even this vessel, however, does not<br>

  Book Title: The Fate of Earthly Things-Aztec Gods and God-Bodies<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassett Molly H.<br>
  Abstract: Following their first contact in 1519, accounts of Aztecs identifying Spaniards as gods proliferated. But what exactly did the Aztecs mean by a "god" (teotl), and how could human beings become gods or take on godlike properties? This sophisticated, interdisciplinary study analyzes three concepts that are foundational to Aztec religion—teotl (god), teixiptla (localized embodiment of a god), and tlaquimilolli (sacred bundles containing precious objects)—to shed new light on the Aztec understanding of how spiritual beings take on form and agency in the material world. In The Fate of Earthly Things, Molly Bassett draws on ethnographic fieldwork, linguistic analyses, visual culture, and ritual studies to explore what ritual practices such as human sacrifice and the manufacture of deity embodiments (including humans who became gods), material effigies, and sacred bundles meant to the Aztecs. She analyzes the Aztec belief that wearing the flayed skin of a sacrificial victim during a sacred rite could transform a priest into an embodiment of a god or goddess, as well as how figurines and sacred bundles could become localized embodiments of gods. Without arguing for unbroken continuity between the Aztecs and modern speakers of Nahuatl, Bassett also describes contemporary rituals in which indigenous Mexicans who preserve costumbres (traditions) incorporate totiotzin (gods) made from paper into their daily lives. This research allows us to understand a religious imagination that found life in death and believed that deity embodiments became animate through the ritual binding of blood, skin, and bone.<br>

This sophisticated, interdisciplinary study analyzes three concepts that are foundational to Aztec religion—teotl (god), teixiptla (localized embodiment of a god), and tlaquimilolli (sacred bundles containing precious objects)—to shed new light on the Aztec understanding of how spiritual beings take on form and agency in the material world. In The Fate of Earthly Things, Molly Bassett draws on ethnographic fieldwork, linguistic analyses, visual culture, and ritual studies to explore what ritual practices such as human sacrifice and the manufacture of deity embodiments (including humans who became gods), material effigies, and sacred bundles meant to the Aztecs. She analyzes the Aztec belief that wearing the flayed skin of a sacrificial victim during a sacred rite could transform a priest into an embodiment of a god or goddess, as well as how figurines and sacred bundles could become localized embodiments of gods. Without arguing for unbroken continuity between the Aztecs and modern speakers of Nahuatl, Bassett also describes contemporary rituals in which indigenous Mexicans who preserve costumbres (traditions) incorporate totiotzin (gods) made from paper into their daily lives. This research allows us to understand a religious imagination that found life in death and believed that deity embodiments became animate through the ritual binding of blood, skin, and bone.<br>

  Abstract: When the beauty of the world as one knows it is lost through some personal or communal catastrophe, be it a crippling accident, the death of a loved one, betrayal by a trusted and idealized friend, or some more far reaching disturbance—a terrorist attack that ends in mass destruction, an epidemic, a genocidal uprising, a world war—the ancient question arises anew: How is this possible? What went wrong in the beginning to allow this to happen? How can the beauty that was lost be restored?<br>

  Book Title: Mourning in America-Race and the Politics of Loss<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): McIvor David W.<br>
  Abstract: Recent years have brought public mourning to the heart of American politics, as exemplified by the spread and power of the Black Lives Matter movement, which has gained force through its identification of pervasive social injustices with individual losses. The deaths of Sandra Bland, Michael Brown, Freddie Gray, Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Walter Scott, and so many others have brought private grief into the public sphere. The rhetoric and iconography of mourning has been noteworthy in Black Lives Matter protests, but David W. McIvor believes that we have paid too little attention to the nature of social mourning-its relationship to private grief, its practices, and its pathologies and democratic possibilities.<br>

The volume was probably made for Mary, heiress of Humphrey de Bohun, earl of Hereford, Essex, and Northampton, shortly after her marriage to Henry of Bolingbroke (later Henry IV) in 1380/1 and certainly before her death in 1394 at the age of twenty-four.

  Book Title: Luis de Góngora and Lope de Vega-Masters of Parody<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): KERR LINDSAY G.<br>
  Abstract: Co-Winner of the 2014 Publication Prize awarded by the Association of Hispanists of Great Britain and Ireland Kerr traces the processes and paradoxes at work in the late parodic poetry of Luis de Góngora and Lope de Vega, illuminating the correlations and connections between two poets who have more often than not been presented as enemies.The analysis follows the parallel development of the complex parodic genre through Góngora's late mythological parody, from his 1589 Hero and Leander romance through to his culminating parody, La fábula de Píramo y Tisbe (1618) and Lope de Vega's alter ego Tomé de Burguillos, whose anthology, Rimas humanas y divinas del licenciado Tomé de Burguillos, was published a year before Lope's death, in 1634. Working from the premise that parody provides a Derridean supplément to exhausted, dominant genres (e.g. pastoral, lyric, epic), this study asks: what do these texts achieve by their supplementarity, and how do they achieve it?, and, the overarching question, why do these erudite poets turn to parody in an age of decline? Lindsay Kerr received her PhD in Spanish at Queen's University Belfast.<br>

  Abstract: On June 13, 2005, the US Senate apologized for filibustering antilynching legislation from the early twentieth century that would have made lynching a federal crime.¹ In essence, the government apologized for failing one of its most basic functions: protecting its citizens from harm. This apology acknowledged that victims of lynch mobs, largely southern African Americans killed by whites, did not receive appropriate protection of law officials to prevent or punish their deaths. This apology was long overdue and reflects a popular consensus, perhaps prompted by scholarship, that lynching is unjust.<br>

  Book Title: Medieval Hispanic Studies in Memory of Alan Deyermond-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Weiss Julian<br>
  Abstract: Professor Alan Deyermond was one of the leading British Hispanists of the last fifty years, whose work had a formative influence on medieval Hispanic studies around the world. There were several tributes to his work published during his lifetime, and it is fitting that this one, in his memory, should be produced by Tamesis, the publishing house that he helped establish and to which he contributed so much as author and editor right up to his death. The contributors to this volume are some of Professor Deyermond's former colleagues, doctoral students, and members of the Medieval Hispanic Research Seminar. Given Professor Deyermond's breadth of expertise, the span of the essays is appropriately wide, ranging chronologically from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century, and covering lyric, hagiography, clerical verse narrative, frontier balladry, historical and codicological studies. The volume opens with a personal memoir of her father by Ruth Deyermond, and closes with the draft of an unpublished essay found amongst Professor Deyermond's papers, and edited by his literary executor, Professor David Hook. Andrew M. Beresford is Reader and Head of Hispanic Studies at the University of Durham. Louise M. Haywood is Reader in Medieval Iberian Literary and Cultural Studies, and Head of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Cambridge. Julian Weiss is Professor of Medieval & Early Modern Hispanic Studies at King's College London.<br>

  Abstract: As early as 1834, two years after Goethe’s death, the apparent resemblance of his Faust figure with Paracelsus led John S. Blackie, in the preface to his rendition of Goethe’s tragedy into English verse, to the following statement: “There is much in all that is told of him [Faust] that recalls to our mind the biography of Paracelsus.”¹ By the end of the nineteenth century, this assumption acquired a degree of certainty for Goethe scholars. In 1870, Gustav von Loeper² remarked that Goethe’s Faust is a physician and a physician’s son, as is Paracelsus. Both figures detested the medicine of<br>

  Author(s) Grimes Nicole<br>
  Abstract: Eduard Hanslick’s reviews of the works of Johannes Brahms span from 1862, when he announced “the appearance before the Viennese public of this blond, St. John visage of a composer,”¹ to the year of Hanslick’s death, 1904. Composer and critic struck up a close and lifelong friendship following their meeting in 1862, a friendship they shared with the Austrian surgeon and amateur musician Theodor Billroth—the three being on intimate 
                  du terms and forming the “closest musical threesome.”² Hanslick was the music correspondent for the Neue Freie Presse, Austria’s leading liberal daily newspaper.³ It was here that he published his<br>

  Abstract: Dramatic developments in manufacturing, mining and transportation precipitated by the Industrial Revolution brought irreversible cultural and socio-economic change to Britain. Thousands of ordinary people experienced profound changes, their life experiences and personal stories etched into their physical remains and threaded through the trappings of their death. The pressures of modern development mean that many recent burials are disinterred from their ‘final’ resting place and reburied elsewhere. The research value of post-medieval burial assemblages was recognised only relatively recently,² and this has undoubtedly influenced the strategic approach to planning and excavation.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt31nj3t">Love Poetry in the Spanish Golden Age</a><br>
  Abstract: Roland Barthes’ insistence on the death of the author (1968),¹ closely followed by Michel Foucault’s equally provocative interrogation of the writing subject (‘What is an Author?’ 1969),² have been elaborated, qualified, denigrated and newly historicised in almost half a century’s literary theorisings. Common sense alone suggests that in denying a critical need to relate the individual subject (whether author or reader) to a larger cultural, historically specific field of operations, Barthes’ theory of textual construction went too far. But whatever its implicit contradictions (and current memory studies have identified several), there is no denying that the post-structuralist critique of authorship<br>

  Abstract: In october 1099, following the conquest of Jerusalem, First Crusade forces led by Duke Godfrey of Bouillon laid siege to the city of Arsuf, about fifteen miles north of modern Tel Aviv. According to the early-twelfth-century chronicler Albert of Aachen, the city’s defenders attempted to distract Godfrey by crucifying one of Godfrey’s men, Gerard of Avesnes. They placed him on the city walls within sight of the siege forces. Dying yet still able to talk, Gerard begged Godfrey to avenge his suffering and death.

  Author(s) WALTER KATIE L.<br>
  Abstract: In its most basic terms, war depends upon getting men to risk their bodies, to override the instinct to flee danger so as to preserve life, and instead to stand and fight, and if necessary, to fight to the death. The means by which this is achieved can be understood variously as the effects of the noble virtue of courage at one end of the spectrum, and the despicable hardening of men into beasts at the other. The Middle Ages has not shaken off its reputation as a violent, conflict-ridden age (a view not without some justification), nor has it<br>

  Abstract: Suffering and death are universal. They are the basal experience that tragic art addresses. But is tragic art in one form or another also universal? Are there times and places on which tragic thinking can have no purchase? If so, is our anti-mythic age of science and reason, of democracy and rapid technological progress an era unsuited to tragic art? The modern world is largely optimistic despite the massively destructive violence of the last century. Terrible things still happen to individuals, to families, to whole peoples. Yet when no wrong seems fully beyond prevention—an unforeseen possibility that with due<br>

  Book Title: Love and Death in Goethe-`One and Double'<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Dye Ellis<br>
  Abstract: Goethe, in association with his younger Romantic compatriots the Schlegels, Novalis, Fichte, and Schelling, struggled with the subject-object dichotomy, and tried to bridge the gap between self and other, consciousness and nature. His theory and practice prefigured the Romantics' determination to display and interrogate the linguistic and cultural structures informing their own thinking and modes of representation--what Goethe calls one's "Vorstellungsart." His work exploits, subverts, and supplants inherited conventions and signs, demonstrating with virtuosic irony that literature is a system of texts, pre-texts, and pre-established but dynamic conceptual models. 'Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double"' explores Goethe's use, in a wide range of his poetry and prose, of the theme of 'Liebestod' (love and death) and related embodiments of the paradox of unity in duality. Ellis Dye also examines Goethe's use of other themes related to love and death--the 'femme fatale', the 'vagina dentata, Frau Welt', the Lorelei, venereal disease, the 'Lustmord' --and considers issues of selfhood and individuation as well as the possibility that the love-death theme contains an implicit gender bias toward the existential fact of personal separateness. Poems, plays, and novels are dealt with, nevertheless, as works of art, not only as illustrations of an idea or as points of intersection in a system of rhetorical conventions, and are examined for intellectual cohesiveness, elegance, and integrity of design as well as special meanings and effects. ' Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double" ' explores the meaning of the central theme of Romantic poetry in the works of the most important Romantic poet of all. Students of literary culture, both the lay reader and the Goethe specialist, will be enlightened by its approach and find pleasure and instruction in its revelations. Robert Ellis Dye is professor of German at Macalester College.<br>

  Abstract: Woman, in the 
                  Liebestod tradition, is both a love object and an agent of death. Charlotte, for example, is both a madonna and femme fatale to Werther, a paragon of lust-defying purity but as seductive as the magnetic mountain in Werther’s grandmother’s tale, a mountain that pulls the hardware out of passing ships and sends them to a watery grave (16. and 26. Julius 1771). The narratives that evolved around Friederike Brion, too, rely on stereotypes of woman as virgin and woman as whore.¹ The Princess von Este in Torquato Tasso appears first as Tasso’s muse, and then, in his<br>

  Abstract: Two of the works that Goethe wrote in 1774 end with a 
                  Liebestod. Clavigo, an enduringly popular play, does not actually celebrate the blending of the lovers in a death-transcending union: Its horizon is more social than existential and revolves around Clavigo’s difficulty in choosing between love and ambition, between ascendancy in society and government on the one hand and marriage to the declassé Marie Beaumarchais on the other. The dilemma is resolved by the thrust of a dagger from Marie’s brother, the mortally wounded Clavigo falling on the coffin of the woman he has wronged. He grasps her cold<br>

  Abstract: Stella has been called a “Pendant zu Werther . . .; die Figuren der Dreiecksgeschichte sind vertauscht” (MA 1,1:757), for while in Werther it was one woman between two men, in Stella it is one man between two women. Werther ends in the death of the protagonist, Stella does so only in a late, second version, no longer subtitled “Ein Schauspiel für Liebende,” but simply “Ein Trauerspiel.” Both works pose the question of the uniqueness of personalities and raise the possibility of one lover replacing or standing in for another.

  Abstract: Goethe’s 
                  Faust expresses Romanticism’s agony over the fact of individuation and the individual’s distance from its origin and destiny. Its action is propelled by a man’s desire to escape from selfhood into love. Faust does not end in a Liebestod, like Romeo and Juliet or Aida. Yet what is at stake is the continuation of Faust’s self-identity in time versus his dissolution, his Entgrenzung, in a timeless moment of bliss. The escape from selfhood into union with another, whether a lover, the world, or God, would be a Liebestod, and there are many echoes of the love-death theme in Faust,<br>

The paradox of the love-death tradition is mirrored in Goethe’s conception of truth and in the Romantic irony with which he shows that any representation of reality that is free from irony only masks it further.

  Book Title: Bones of Contention-The living archive of Vasil Levski and the making of Bulgaria's national hero<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Todorova Maria<br>
  Abstract: This book is about documenting and analyzing the living archive around the figure of Vasil Levski (1837–1873), arguably the major and only uncontested hero of the Bulgarian national pantheon. The processes described, although with a chronological depth of almost two centuries, are still very much in the making, and the living archive expands not only in size but constantly adding surprising new forms. The monograph is a historical study, taking as its narrative focus the life, death and posthumous fate of Levski. By exploring the vicissitudes of his heroicization, glorification, appropriations, reinterpretation, commemoration and, finally, canonization, it seeks to engage in several broad theoretical debates, and provide the basis for subsequent regional comparative research. The analysis of Levski's consecutive and simultaneous appropriations by different social platforms, political parties, secular and religious institutions, ideologies, professional groups, and individuals, demonstrates how boundaries within the framework of the nation are negotiated around accepted national symbols.<br>

It flows like a river, accelerates like an engine, flies like a winged chariot, freezes like instant ice, stands still like a heart between beats, or, in Sexton’s words, grows short, and then dims out as death opens his door. Without the metaphors, whether “that Nazi Mama” wiggling her skirts, or the more venerable arrow of time, the fourth dimension would be exceedingly difficult to grasp. Linguists have noted that it is virtually impossible to talk about time without invoking motion (wiggling skirts, engines, chariots, arrows) and spatial content (short,<br>

  Abstract: The death of Slobodan Milošević, on March 11, 2006, in the detention unit of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) put an abrupt end to yet another process dubbed as “the trial of the century.” Three days later the Trial Chamber took notice of the death of the accused, hence terminating the case IT-02-54 that dragged on for more than four years toward its anticlimactic end. Disappointment among the interested parties was as deep as the earlier feeling of success upon his bringing to justice. “I deeply regret the death of Slobodan Milošević. It deprives the victims<br>

  Abstract: The visual record of Hungary’s transition to democracy is marked with comfortably familiar (if not canonical) images of key events and personalities. No visual representation of the Hungarian transition which takes its topic and itself seriously is complete without the black-and-white film of Imre Nagy, the prime minister of the 1956 revolt, listening to his death sentence, followed by the images of the immense crowd at his reburial ceremony before the catafalque on Heroes’ Square. The story of the Roundtable Talks cannot be presented properly without the requisite images of the Opposition Roundtable meeting in the building of the Law<br>

  Abstract: In
                  Park kul’tury i otdykha(Park of culture and leisure, 2008), a collection of short stories by Kharkiv writer Andrei Krasniashchikh (b. 1970), most events take place in the gap between life and death. This deep, inhabitable abyss is far from being a mere border between two separate worlds. As the book’s description explains, “this rift (prosvet) is not always clearly tangible on a daily basis, but it is quite noticeable when ghosts and corpses emerge from it. Or when our dreams and fantasies leak into it.”¹ In an interesting parallel, Zhadan observes in a separate piece of writing: “Literature<br>

  Abstract: In the traditional attitude of the community towards its deceased members of great importance, we can find the notion that they are divided depending on their personal characteristics into categories of 
                  pure, suspicious and impure (Vaseva 1994, 3. pp. 154–55). The whole ritual and magic behavior of the community is structured and subordinated on the basis of this concept. The folk terminology distinguishes a fourth category for the period right after the death of members of the community, who are called “fresh” dead. This category of fresh deceased usually lasts one year, which is the necessary time period for<br>

Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Doctrine and method, theory and interpretation are not necessarily coordinate. Were such coordination possible, a metacritical stance would be required. By accepting uncritically the presuppositions that lie behind psychoanalytic metapsychology, Juillerat abrogates, in my view, ethnological responsibility, that is, the responsibility to measure in a receptive manner the presuppositions of ones hermeneutic against those of the culture one is studying. Though his attention to ethnographic detail leads Juillerat to refine psychoanalytic doctrine, it confirms the epistemological and hermeneutic assumptions of that doctrine (e.g., notions of the unconscious, id, ego, and superego, drives, repression, and, indeed, psychic space). Yafar myth and ritual as he presents them become allegories of that doctrineallegories, I would argue, of allegories. There would appear to be no escape, were it not for the Yafar voices that sound through Juillerats psychoanalytically predetermined presentations. (He offers us almost no contextualized verbatim texts in these essays, though he does in his monographs.) They remind us that, as LviStrauss demonstrated, myths are readily translated one into another, particularly when they are decontextualized. What is of ethnographic, indeed, psychoanalytic import is howand perhaps whytranslation is arrested and a particular myth (e.g., the Oedipal tale) becomes so authoritative that it has the power of promiscuous reduction. Though fascinated by the range of Yafar cultural expression, Juillerat fails to consider the implications of Yafars refusal to reduce their corpus of mythology and ritual to a single mytha singular ritual.<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since his 1962
   Introduction to Husserl’s “The Origin of Geometry.”The real difference between the thought of Ricoeur and Derrida is the distinctive way each thinker supplements phenomenology to take into account the creativity of meaning at the boundary of reason. For Derrida, it is thedifféranceof deconstruction; for Ricoeur, the graft of hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Even Riffaterre's approach to the structuring unsaid of textual writing can be seen to represent on its own terms a shift from the ontology of narrative toward its epistemology at the level of form rather than content. By the deliberate provocation of his title, his semiotic narratology is interested not just in the structural essence of fiction as art but in its specific
            truth:a story's immanent signifying patterns in their subtextual disclosure.<br>

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: Franke’s book has considerable merit, but I have a theoretical and a practical concern with his appropriation of negative theology. First, negative theology is never entirely negative, and while Franke recognizes that poetic language is both deconstructive and open, he nevertheless insists that our various theologies—literary or religious—finally have no positive content. Perhaps this is the postmodernism in his negative theology because this is not entirely consistent with the theological tradition. A good counterexample is Pseudo‐Dionysius, whose mystical theology seeks finally to overcome the limitations of both positive and negative speaking. Dionysius insists that God is love in a way that is both negative and positive. On this, Franke should consider the work of Jean‐Luc Marion and especially his response to Jacques Derrida on the subject of negative theology, and this omission is a considerable oversight. Second, many people of various faiths will never accept that their understanding of the transcendent has no positive content, and if this is a precondition for dialogue, then it is unlikely to occur. On this, the practical dimension of Franke’s study needs more development, as well as more traditional examples of poetic and theological openness from contemporary religious life.<br>

Abstract: It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
            Adaptation—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case thatAdaptation“undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on Film,” inBooks in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship, ed. Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up tosomething, and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average movie we find easier to read. In fact,Adaptationhas only solidified Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.<br>

Abstract: The Captivity of Innocencesuccessfully concludes an innovative study of primeval myth in J’s Genesis. Its argument about exilic authorship serves as a springboard for a free and erudite exploration of biblical concerns with name, exile, and the paradoxes of divine-human relations. Very few biblical scholars today can compass this range of biblical, literary, and philosophical literature with such finesse. At a time when biblical studies incorporate a wider range of methods than ever, LaCocque, like Roland Barthes (whom he cites), powerfully combines traditional and more contemporary intellectual paradigms. Advanced students and scholars will find inThe Captivity of Innocencea far-reaching and engaging reading of Genesis 11 by a virtuoso of biblical studies.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: Critchley uses the term in a discussion of Levinas and politics. Noting that government tends to become tyrannical when left to itself, Critchley commends the way Levinas’s ethical ideas can cultivate forms of “dissensual emancipatory praxis” that “work against the consensual idyll of the state, not in order to do away with the state or consensus, but to bring about its endless betterment” (“Five Problems in Levinas’s View of Politics,” 183).<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Abstract: Framed in such a way, the early movements of Mahler's Second Symphony—characterized by the alternation between halting sections that dissolve almost as soon as they begin and long-breathed melodies that seem to unfold effortlessly—suggest the melancholic subject's struggle between despair in the face of abject meaninglessness and a manic euphoria, neither of which addresses the loss. By contrast, the text in the symphony's final movement, adapted by Mahler from Friedrich Klopstock's chorale on the resurrection of the dead, encourages true remembrance of the deceased as a figure beyond death. Heard as a musical enactment of mourning, the final movement suggests that the dead who are mourned are resurrected through remembrance. Forcing us to acknowledge Mahler's death on some level, the final movement completes the work of mourning by engendering the composer's own resurrection in our memories as we witness each performance of his Second Symphony.<br>

Abstract: This article is concerned with the ways in which women narrate a move from a 'working-class' position to a position marked (in however fragmentary and complex a way) as 'middle class'. While such a move might be seen in terms of a straightforward escape from a disadvantaged social position, I argue here that what has to be analysed is the pain and the sense of estrangement associated with this class movement. Drawing on the class narratives of a group of seven white British women, the article uses Bourdieu's concepts of symbolic capital and habitus to explore the cultural and symbolic configurations of class. These configurations may be inscribed into the self, so that the self, itself, is class marked. Since working-class selves are frequently marked in pathological terms, this raises particular difficulties for the idea of an 'escape' from such a position. Class in this sense is embedded in people's history and so cannot be so easily 'escaped'. The usual conventions of life-narratives - in which the self remains the same entity from birth to death and later events are a culmination of earlier ones - are also disrupted in this case. But if a working-class position is marked as pathological, so too is taking on the markers of middle-class existence. to do so is not only to risk 'getting it wrong', but it is also to risk the scorn attached to 'pretentiousness'. There is a particular jeopardy here for women, since it is women who have been especially associated with desires for artefacts associated with bourgeois existence. The article argues for a focus for classed desires and class envy, not in pathological terms, but in terms of a coherent response to political and social exclusions.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines, from the point of view of an existential hermeneutics, five accounts of transpersonal experience: Robert Monroe's Journeys Out of the Body, Paul's experience in the third heaven in II Corinthians 12, a description of rapture by Teresa of Avila, a disembodied vision of guardian spirits by John Lilly from The Center of the Cyclone, and the vision of the assault of the Lords of the Dead from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Through a consideration of world, embodiment, death, care and other existential categories, the discussion in each case focuses on a central ambiguity about the personal identity of the narrator. The question of authenticity, in a Heideggerian sense, is posed to these materials, and the central ambiguity is shown to strike so deeply as to undercut the assumption of autonomy as the criterion of authenticity. Being-toward-death is relativized in such experiences, but relativized by an even more radical threat to individual existence. In conclusion, some generalized principles are offered as heuristic criteria for interpreting transpersonal experience in general.<br>

Abstract: Recent study of the nature of textuality as such opens new insights for the study of the Bible. Although individual parts of the Bible have oral antecedents, the Bible as a whole has existed only as a text, and a unique kind of text, folded back on itself out of communal memory as no other book has been. A text is a monument. Textuality establishes a special relationship between discourse and death. Spoken words are exchanges between living persons. The text presents its message as well if its author is dead as it does if he or she is alive. Print is even more bound to death than writing is. In comparison with oral performance-delivery of an oration, song-a text physically has certain special alliances with past time. All texts come out of the past. Literature as text is psychologically retrospective: its effects typically include an element of nostalgia. Because of its future orientation, culminating in the closing words of Revelation, "Come, Lord Jesus" (as against typical narrative closes such as "They lived happily ever after"), the Bible has an unusual relationship to textuality: it is not literature in the way other texts are. Typical narrative plot structures existence retrospectively: the story is organized back from the conclusion. This retrospective organization is maximized by writing, which tightens plot and makes more of re-cognition, a kind of return to the beginning (the past) and hence a cyclic pattern. In addition to being related intimately to death, writing and print are also limitlessly fecund, the central forces in the evolution of consciousness, once they appear. The fecundity of writing and print, like other fecundity in human existence, is achieved by passage through death. "Unless the grain of wheat dies." The Word of God in the Person of Jesus Christ is conceived of by analogy with the spoken word. The Father speaks the Word, the Son (eo verbum quo filius); he does not write the Word, who would then by biblical attestation be not life but death: "The letter kills, but the spirit [pneuma, breath, producer of speech] gives life." The Son passes through death to resurrected life. The written text, also God's word, must also be resurrected-by interpretation, by being inserted into the lifeworld of living persons. Hermeneutics is resurrection and in common Christian teaching demands faith. Study of the textuality of the Bible-which presumes but is not the same as study of the text of the Bible-opens many new theological questions and / or gives new contours to old questions.<br>

Abstract: This article focuses on the personal experience of regret and the importance of coming to terms with our regrets. It begins with a sermon preached by the first author in which the issue of regret is explored by means of a summary of the film The Big Kahuna, continues with a discussion of recent articles (Tomer and Eliason, Existential and spiritual issues in death attitudes, 2008; Mannarino et al., Existential and spiritual issues in death attitudes, 2008) on the concept of regret formulated by Landman (Landman, Regret: A theoretical and conceptual analysis, 1987; Regret: The persistence of the possible, 1993), and on regret therapy, and concludes with a pastoral care case in which a dying woman expresses both future-related and past-related regrets. The case is interpreted in light of regret therapy's emphasis on parabolic experiences and reframing techniques.<br>

Abstract: This essay is a comparative study of the tributes paid to the American philosopher John Rawls, in France and the United States, after his death in November 2010. Whereas in the U.S. tributes to Rawls appeared in scholarly journals, in France they did in political magazines and general interest media. Besides, the focus in U.S. journals on Rawls's philosophical commitments is at odds with the emphasis placed by the French media on the political interpretations of his theory of justice. The contrast between Rawls's French and U.S. "funerals" is a consequence of the way intellectual fields in France and the U.S. differ in their relation to politics. While Rawls conformed with what was expected of him in the American academia by staying away from politics almost all his life, he was seen in France as an intellectuel engagé, the typical figure of intellectual life since the Dreyfus case. The contrast between the French and American reactions to Rawls's death is also related to the fact that those who first got interested in his theory of justice in France were supporters of the anti-totalitarian left or center-right, rather than academic philosophers.<br>

Abstract: A modest proposal for solving the 150-year-old problem of what kinship is, its specific quality, viz. mutuality of being: persons who are members of one another, who participate intrinsically in each other's existence. `Mutuality of being' applies as well to the constitution of kinship by social construction as by procreation, even as it accounts for `the mysterious effectiveness of relationality' (Viveiros de Castro), how it is that relatives live each other's lives and die each other's deaths. Involving such transpersonal relations of being and experience, kinship takes its place in the same ontological regime as magic, gift exchange, sorcery, and witchcraft. Une modeste proposition pour résoudre l'équation, vieille de 150 ans, de ce qu'est la parenté, sa spécificité, à savoir la mutualité d'existence: des personnes qui sont membres les unes des autres, qui participent à l'existence les unes des autres. La « mutualité d'existence » vaut aussi pour la constitution de lien de parenté par la construction sociale et la procréation, bien qu'elle tienne compte de « la mystérieuse efficacité de la relationalité » (Viveiros de Castro), de la manière dont les parents vivent les vies et meurent les morts des uns et des autres. La parenté, en mettant en jeu ces relations transpersonnelles d'existence et d'expérience, s'inscrit dans le même ordre ontologique que la magie, l'échange de cadeaux, la sorcellerie et la magie noire.<br>

Abstract: Schwartz argues for the later rabbinic development of practices related to death: "Indeed, if it
is the case that even strongly 'Jewish' Jews were often buried without the accompaniment of Jewish
iconography—that despite what we are accustomed to think about such liminal moments as birth,
death, marriage and so on, death was not yet generally an occasion among Palestinian Jews for
strong public affirmation of group identity—then Beth Shearim shows that the judaization of
Jewish burial practice was now (third-fourth century) underway in some circles" (2001: 154).<br>

Abstract: Set in the exiled poet's "marginal" home in the Channel Islands, Les Travailleurs de la mer (1866) elaborates a vision of creative potential. Science, dreams, meditation, natural forces, physical prowess, selfess devotion, even death—all serve as vehicles for expanding the boundaries of our universe, both internal and external. The protagonist, Gilliatt, avails himself of these multiple modes of transport to challenge our notion of the humanly—and inhumanly—possible. Transcending his own limits to conquer a wide array of "monsters," he links the motifs of movement and displacement in Hugo's hypertropic narrative to the transpositions of metaphor, the sublime, and political exile.<br>

Abstract: Disciplina acuñada en el XIX, la filología surge como historicidad fundamental, identificando la significación de una obra con sus condiciones de producción originarias, un discurso de la ciencia (historia) sobre la lengua y la literatura. La hermenéutica contemporánea supone una ruptura de la razón histórico-filológica y una afirmación de los nuevos significados que a un texto se le añaden al pasar de un contexto cultural u otro nuevo. Para la filología, el criterio pedagógico único de explicación de los textos es la restitución de la intención deliberada y originaria del autor. Hermenéutica y teoría de la literatura afirman que no hay adecuación lógica necesaria entre sentido de la obra e intención de autor. Tras la “muerte del autor” del formalismo semiótico, la posmodernidad niega el texto mismo y afirma que éste tiene tantos sentido como lectores. A discipline minted in the 19th century, philology, emerges as a fundamental historicist approach, identifying the significance of a work with its original conditions of production, a discourse from science (history) about language and literature. Contemporary hermeneutics assumes a break with historical-philological reason, as well as an affirmation of the new meanings added to a text by passing from one cultural context to another new one. For philology, the only pedagogical criterion in explaining texts is the restitution of deliberate and original authorial intent. Hermeneutics and literary theory assert that there is no logical association necessary between the meaning of the work, and authorial intent. Since the “death of the author” of semiotic formalism, postmodernity has denied the text itself, instead asserting that it has as many meanings as it has readers.<br>

Abstract: This paper asks, why does the eponymous hero of Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim fail to obtain absolution despite two confessional attempts, and then seek his own death? By using narratological distinctions together with an analysis of the confessional structures of Jim's narratives, we find that his confessions fail for three reasons: he never fulfils his promise to Marlow to plot the 'fundamental why' of his jumping ship, his father's 'easy morality' condemns him even before he abandons the Patna, and Marlow fails to meet his role as confessor.<br>

Abstract: The story of the Fall inscribes the myth of a fallen language as the absolute other of the original sacred. Hence the dualistic scheme between a fallen materiality and a metaphysical God. This article explores how the death of this God is not merely a secular turn, but the opening of a different, anti-theological, or fallen religiosity that allows us to trace the sacred in unexpected places—also within fallen language. Translation and literature will be explored as instances where language performs its own fallenness— its materiality, arbitrariness and difference—and thereby releases a sacred expression. The essay considers 17th-century theologian Martin de Barcos' letters regarding translation, Derrida's essay 'Des Tours de Babel' and notions of literariness based on Blanchot and Mallarmé.<br>

Abstract: Rav H̱isday Crescas (1340-1410/11), Rabbi of Aragonese Jewry in Christian Spain and a major figure in medieval Jewish philosophy, is unique in positing an all-embracing thesis of Love. This thesis permeates his theories of cosmogony, metaphysics and theology and generates far-reaching didactic implications. This article examines Crescas' rather bold description of Love as a positive Divine attribute, an anthropopathism meant to convey ontological meaning about the Divine Nature via an analogous construct. Themes such as Infinite Goodness, Joy and Kindness enable Rav H̱isday to structure a new conception of the Creator and Providence. After postulating Divine Love as the Cosmic Force sustaining creation, Crescas explains the purpose of Torah and mitzvot in terms of evoking love for God thus drawing the soul to link up to the Divine Overflow of Love. Even spiritual existence after death is explicated in terms of the soul's love for its Divine Source. To understand Crescas' unique theory of Love, we compare it with the views of his predecessors and analyze his use of philosophic sources such as the 5th century BCE pre-Socratic scientist-mystic Empedocles. We examine educational aspects of Crescas' teachings on love and view them in context of the mass conversions to Christianity resulting from the 1391 riots. Finally, Crescas' ideas are read as pedagogical messages relevant to both Jews and conversos in the twenty traumatic years after 1391 when he served as chief rabbi and political leader in Saragossa.<br>

Abstract: Interestingly enough it appears that the structural features of reconciliation show a re-
versed version of the structural features of evil. Resolving the evil I do toward the other re-
quires that I am able to say what I have done wrong (the reverse of silence and the
tinspeakable), that I recognize my guilt (which is incompatible with splitting) and that I ask for
forgiveness (which is very shameful, but may résolve shame when penitence is accepted and
forgiveness is given); see Glas (in press); Muφhyand Hampton (1988); Volf (1996).<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: In Matter and Memory, Bergson examines the relationship between perception and memory, the status of consciousness in its relation to the brain, and more generally, a possible conjunction of matter and mind. Our reading focuses in particular on his understanding of the evanescent presence of the present and of its debt vis-à-vis the "unconscious" consciousness of a "virtual" past. We wish to show that the Bergsonian version of a critique of "the metaphysics of presence" is, for all that, an offshoot of a Platonic type of metaphysics. It is true that Bergson departs from traditional stand-points on the side of a self-sufficient and original present and a form of presence to which the transparency of consciousness would confer the character of immediate evidence. All the same, it can hardly be claimed that his rehabilitation of the past and the unconscious opens up new perspectives on how forgetting and death are bound up with the work of memory.<br>

Abstract: In From Beast to the Blonde, Marina Warner studies the status of fairy tales as historical documents which
give an account of women's daily experiences, as they illustrate their particular rites of passage and the relevance
of maternal figures in their lives. The resonance of Mother Goose is taken by Warner "either as a historical source,
or a fantasy of origin" which she can trace into ancient traditions, like the Islamic or the Christian, and which
adds credibility to the stories (1994, xxiii).<br>

Abstract: This essay applies Roman Jakobson's binary system of rhetoric to the representation of death in Women in Love. While Lawrence's novel harks back to traditional configurations of death as metaphoric event, geared to transformations, it also anticipates contemporary conceptions of death as metonymic event, stripped of meaning and devoid of transcendental resonance.<br>

Abstract: Central Australian Aboriginal `increase ritual' has often been seen exclusively as an attempt to control environmental forces. Following Durkheim's early arguments against this view, and expanding them to encompass a psychoanalytic perspective, it is argued that the direct effect of so-called `increase ritual' is psychological, but that this effect has consequences for the maintenance of resources in a hunter-gatherer society. `Increase ritual', as Durkheim suggested, is structured as a form of sacrifice. It is also, as Freud suggested, linked to the death of the father. It is argued here that these symbolic themes relate practically to the control which mature men exercise over the reproduction of the social and natural orders.<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo expone los principales resultados de una investigación realizada con el objeto de analizar el papel que cumplen las emociones colectivas en el mantenimiento del orden social. En concreto, trata de explicar el hecho de que las noticias más importantes que aparecen en los medios de comunicación sean noticias de horror, es decir, noticias en las que la muerte siempre aparece en el primer plano de la escena. Los informativos de los medios de comunicación expresan y fomentan la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. Ahora bien, para entender esta cultura es preciso determinar previamente la naturaleza emocional del horror, así como establecer una definición sociológica de este sentimiento. El horror es una emoción compleja compuesta por sentimientos de terror, de asco y de conmoción. El horror, sociológicamente, puede entenderse como "la emoción mediante la que un orden social señala sus límites más extremos". El estudio concluye señalando que existen dos modos alternativos de mantener el orden y la cohesión en el seno de un sistema social. El primer modo de legitimación, característico de las sociedades centrípetas, funciona mediante la gran potencia atractiva que ejerce sobre el campo social un núcleo central de valores sociales positivos. El segundo, característico de las sociedades centrífugas, funciona mediante la gran potencia repulsiva que ejercen sobre el campo social las transgresiones flagrantes del orden moral. El modo típico en el que las sociedades centrífugas regulan el orden social explica la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. /// This article sets out the main results obtained from a research study carried out for the purpose of analysing the role that collective emotions play in maintaining social order. In specifíc terms, it attempts to explain the fact that the most important items of news that appear in the media are news of horror, in other words, news in which death always appears in the foreground. The news programmes of the media express and encourage the culture of horror that is characteristic of our advanced societies. However, in order to understand this culture, we must first establish the emotional nature of horror and also establish a sociological definition of this feeling. Horror is a complex emotion made up of feelings of terror, disgust and shock. Sociologically speaking, horror can be understood as "the emotion through which a social order indicates its outermost limits". The study concludes showing that there are two alternative ways of maintaining order and cohesión within the bosom of a social system. The first method of legitimation, which is characteristic of centripetal societies, works through the great power of attraction it exerts over the social field of a central nucleus of positive social values. The second, which is characteristic of centrifugal societies, works through the great power of repulsion exerted by flagrant transgressions of moral order over the social field. The typical method in which centrifugal societies regulate social order explains the culture of horror that is characteristic of our advanced societies.<br>

Abstract: By focusing on children involved in the ritual practices in Ambonwari village, East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea, this essay compares two types of ritual: that of healing and that of male initiation. Like other life crisis rituals both deal with two dimensions of the Ambonwari life-world, that is with the living and the dead and, in a broader sense, with people and spirits. Though both are based upon the same cosmology there are fundamental differences between them. First, healers in healing ceremonies treat uninitiated children as 'non-beings'. From the perspective of Ambonwari 'selves' or 'beings', children belong to this domain. They exist as extensions of their parents or carers, from whom they cannot be separated conceptually. Second, by examining the Ambonwari concepts of negation I show that healers do not approach the domain of cosmological non-existence: they are not concerned with the cosmogony of the Ambonwari life-world. The male initiation rituals do just the opposite, however. It is only in the male initiation ritual, seen as a cosmogonic event, that young boys are cut off from their parents and 'thrown' abruptly into a state of becoming. Unlike the healing rites, these rituals treat young boys as both Ambonwari beginnings and Ambonwari beings. I argue that Ambonwari initiation rituals are not concerned with symbolic death followed by rebirth, but with states of being. Initiation means that death becomes possible for a child. The initiated boy will now be able to die as an Ambonwari being.<br>

Abstract: In thought as well as in imagery, two of Auden's poems, "Death's Echo" and "Danse Macabre," appear to draw on such diverse manifestations of the medieval cult of death as lyric poems of memento mon, dialogues between the "quick and the dead," and the macabre tradition in morality plays. Combining the concept of the verbal icon (Wimsatt) with the principles of the theory of metaphor, as summarized by Ricoeur in The Rule of Metaphor (1977), the paper studies a selection of medieval poems and those of Auden as complex macro-vehicles and contrasts the possible tenors they are carrying.<br>

Abstract: This review explores the most significant dimensions and findings of phenomenological approaches in anthropology. We spell out the motives and implications inherent in such approaches, chronicle their historical dimensions and precursors, and address the ways in which they have contributed to analytic perspectives employed in anthropology. This article canvasses phenomenologically oriented research in anthropology on a number of topics, including political relations and violence; language and discourse; neurophenomenology; emotion; embodiment and bodiliness; illness and healing; pain and suffering; aging, dying, and death; sensory perception and experience; subjectivity; intersubjectivity and sociality; empathy; morality; religious experience; art, aesthetics, and creativity; narrative and storytelling; time and temporality; and senses of place. We examine, and propose salient responses to, the main critiques of phenomenological approaches in anthropology, and we also take note of some of the most pressing and generative avenues of research and thought in phenomenologically oriented anthropology.<br>

Abstract: Individual behaviors, such as loss-coping and “grief work” are affected in organizational contexts. In everything pertaining to coping with trauma in general, and loss more particularly, the individual is “trapped” within a political psychology that enforces the habitus and expectations of institutional dominance on the ostensibly intimate and private response. Regimes have perceived bereavement over battlefield deaths as a form of social capital that can be mobilized to enhance national loyalty and political support. Employing both existential/hermeneutic and institutional analysis, this study examines three diachronic models of bereavement — hegemonic, political and civil — and their political ramifications in the Israeli context.Drawing on changing parental conceptual orientations towards fallen sons and their role as cultural and ideological agents in public sphere, the article traces the movement of bereavement from its capture by the hegemonic state institutions to its creations under the domination of others institutions: political and civic and ultimate use in critiquing the political and military echelon. The article indicates the powerful impact of the social institutional-organizational context on the intimate-psychological context of coping with loss, by illustrating this phenomenon in the Israeli society.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo analiza la disputa sobre cuál sería la representación literaria más eficaz que José María Arguedas establece con los autores del llamado boom latinoamericano en los Diarios de El zorro de arriba y el zorro de abajo. En una argumentación que desarrolla ideas semejantes a las propuestas por Walter Benjamin en su ensayo "El narrador", Arguedas destaca el valor de una narradora oral como Carmen Taripha sobre los logros literarios del más significativo escritor del boom, Gabriel García Márquez. Lo importante para la representación literaria en Arguedas será la transmisión de experiencia, algo que su última novela logrará bajo la forma del testimonio de su propia muerte. This article examines the dispute regarding what would be the most effective literary representation that José María Arguedas established with the authors of the so-called Latin American boom, in the Diaries of The Fox from Up Above and the Fox from Down Below. In an argument that develops ideas similar to those proposed by Walter Benjamin in his essay "The Storyteller," Arguedas stresses the value of the storyteller Carmen Taripha over the literary achievements of the most significant writer of the boom, Gabriel García Márquez. What is important for the literary representation in Arguedas is the transmission of experience, something that his latest novel achieved in the form of the testimony of his own death.<br>

Abstract: Can the act of creation itself be considered like an infinite forgiveness that God turns to the earth and to those who live there after having preferred the waters as his place of first existence? The conference "In the beginning it was the forgiveness" held in L'Aquila in the occasion of a pluriconfessional meeting, suggests some hypothesis starting even from some biblical episodes like: the universal deluge, the Amalek's remembering, Giuseppe and his brothers, Isaac's sacrifice, and furthermore with Moses' death, to end with the forgiveness from the original sin through the entrance in the promise land. A suggestive analysis of the forgiveness in the Hebraism, seen too often as a pure religion of the contraposition law to the forgiveness given from the religion of love. The forgiveness in this way is dealt with the inter-religious point of view, and also with the human one that in the relationship between God and man has its top and beginning in the solemnity of Kippur.<br>

Abstract: Although today much of the Mayo-Yoreme sacred myths and their inherent symbolism is rather esoteric knowledge, known to a few only, the community's performance of the responso (ritual of honoring the dead) is important for the re-establishment of relationships between humans and the supernatural beings and between living persons and the ancestors. The communal experience of the responso and the sense of beingenjoined are characteristic of the spiritual experience and fundamental to the musical experience as well Since life/death of any individual is an experience tied to other individuals, I argue that a philosophical inquiry of selfhood—of both the individual and the community—may help us reason about and make possible an understanding of the responso.<br>

Abstract: As violence escalates among black males in many sectors of American life, thinkers are forced to seek solutions to this problem from a variety of perspectives. Inspired largely by a 1994 black fraternity hazing death, this article examines violence as a societal construct, not one intrinsic to individuals. The paradigmatic possibilities this approach brings to bear include: (1) the establishment of an unseverable link between race and class when studying marginalization, (2) the societal politicalization of black males in their struggle for identity, and (3) a societal approach to questions of freedom, identity, and violence where the black male is concerned.<br>

Abstract: This paper attempts to compare two lives, that of Ramana Maharshi, the beloved cereberal sage of South India, and Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis. Much has been written on both these individuals, so what this paper does is to focus on affliction as a source of insight about life, detachment, pain, existentialism and coping. By taking narratives which delineate a historical plane on which illness can be coded, I try to understand the anthromorphic nature of suffering and its consequences in these two great lives. Individuals reflect the culture of which they are a part, so what we receive through the narratives which tell us about them is significant in terms of their similarities and their differences. Who authors narratives which we analyse is of utmost significance, and both feminism and narrative analyses looks at social anthropology as benefiting from the question of the writing subject. The Nirvana principle works in Ramana Maharshi's case to create a comfort zone for helping us to think of death as dream, in Freud it works as a comfort zone to cope with existence. Human beings work with ideas in order to evaluate the nature of life and survival, or with death as an attribute which too is natural and part of the order of reality. Paul Ricoeur's work helps me to build a bridge between the two thinkers, Ramana Maharshi and Freud, in terms of the application of the concepts of Eros, Thanatos and Ananke.<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the options that narrative and language have in their attempts to capture or describe traumatic experience and death. It concentrates on two prose texts by Karel Čapek, Obyčejný život and Povětroň, and the first phase of Freudian psychoanalysis, pointing at generally distinguishable limits and distortions that arise when narrative and language come in contact with trauma and death. Contrary to the current trend within „trauma studies“ , the article does not deal with autobiographical records of traumatic experience. It rather tries to point out that thinking consistently about the connection between memory, language and trauma tends to blur and question the traditional distinction between fiction (understood as a work of imagination) and autobiography (taken as a description of real events). It also tries to show that psychoanalysis arrives, explicitly and implicitly, at a similar conclusion. The last part of the article poses the question what the resulting relationship between the outside (narrated, written Story) and the „inner“ experience is like, and to what extent the structure of this dyad can also be questioned.<br>

Abstract: This paper begins by summarizing a handful of well-known and recent sacrificial theories commonly applied to Greek religion. It then discusses their applicability to sacrificial scenes in Homer's Iliad and in so doing examines the focalizations, marking vocabulary and verse sequences for the Iliad's two different sacrificial traditions, the commensal sacrifice and oath-sacrifice. The essay concludes that the longer narrative context for the sacrificial scenes in the Iliad has conspicuous bearing on how the scenes are shaded and on why, for instance, commensal sacrifices ignore the victim's death while oath-sacrifices emphasize it. That narrative context eludes the theories of Rene Girard, Walter Burkert, and Jean-Pierre Vernant and Marcel Detienne. However, oath-sacrificing narratives do lend themselves well to strands of ritual theory which stress metaphorical transformation and cosmic dramatization, as articulated by James Fernandez, Clifford Geertz, Stanley Tambiah, and Howard Eilberg-Schwartz.<br>

Abstract: Mallarmé constructs a "crisis of verse" that mimes the circumstances of loss and the moment of lamentation to produce his celebrated poetic purity. Indeed, he constructs this purity out of the materials of ritual and philosophical defilement: not only does his poetic theory valorize death and danger, but his poetic practice largely relies on contact with the foreign, on semantic contagion, and on ambiguity. The significance of this defilement spreads in multiple directions: it is instrumental in producing newness and in mediating Mallarmé's professional rivalry with Wagner, it bears witness to the domestic crisis of the Third Republic, and it functions as a form of resistance to cultural assimilation. Moreover, because defilement is at once material and symbolic and because that "symbolism" is an obstinately obscure mode of referentiality, Mallarmé's cultivation of defilement is a recuperation of the scapegoats that "pure" philosophy necessarily exiles: the material and the hyperessential.<br>

Abstract: Embodied memories of terror and violence create new meaning and reorder the world, but in doing so they encompass the inexplicable aspects of cultural processes that have allowed the world one lives in to become an unspeakable place, hostile and death-ridden. In this article, we examine the narratives of Cambodian refugees' experiences of the Khmer Rouge regime against the backdrop of an ethnographic study of older Cambodians' lives in an inner-city neighborhood. The stories from this study of 40 Cambodians between the ages of 50 and 79 illustrate the relationship between bodily distress and memory, and between personal history and collective experience. These narratives reveal how people strive to create continuity in their lives but under certain circumstances are unable to do so.<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Our plight, then, is not simply that we are all in the same boat, let alone on the same ocean. Yet we are still bound by the responsbility of inhabiting the same planet. What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: I want to conclude with one more argument from my own work. I have very often argued that philosophers of technology, regarding the expectations of society and their own traditions and habits, may come “too late” to technologies. They too often undertake their reflections
            afterthe technologies are in place. Rather, I argue, they should reposition themselves at what I call the “R&D” position where technologies are taking developmental shape, in think tanks, in incubator facilities, in research centers. Only then can truly “new” and emerging technologies be fully philosophically engaged.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: Adopting a hyperbolic perspective is also certainly a way to argue as well as a way to examine other “texts” because it is a trope and figure of thought that reveals those moments within discourse when one is attempting to transcend the bounds of reality because the extraordinary nature of a given situation or subject matter requires the use of an excessive prophetic voice or an ardent polemical exaggeration. As Mileur posits, “The work is a hyperbole, the intersection of other hyperboles, and the subject is, insofar as he can be written about at all, another hyperbole” (1990, 86). Rather than circumventing it, understanding hyperbole as the focus of thought and action can create significant moments of
      inventioas well aselocutiofor the hyperbolist and critic alike. By approaching a particular text, a critical term, and even a piece of criticism itself from a hyperbolic perspective, one might (re)consider and (re)interpret these “texts” as a stretching of discursive limits that leads one toward a re-presentation of the extraordinary—an attempt to communicate the ineffable or transgress the expressible.<br>

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: The reviewer of the collection of essay called
         The Cambridge Companion to John Updike, edited by Stacey Olster, confesses that in the middle years of the career of John Updike, he lost interest in the author's novels for the paradoxical reasons that he felt they were either too predictable, seemingly too programmatic or too unpredictable, Updike pumping up a flagging imagination with an assortment ofoutréforms and subjects. But the reviewer rejoices that the predominantly fine essays in theCompanion—by scholars such as D. Quentin Miller, Sanford Pinsker, Edward Vargo, Donald J. Greiner, and John N. Duvall—renewed his interest in the works unread, prompted him to do much catching up, and left him wondering, more ruefully than ever, upon Updike's death in January of 2009 why the novelist had never won a highly deserved Nobel Prize for Literature.<br>

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>Link: <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/utopianstudies.25.1.0001">http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/utopianstudies.25.1.0001</a>

Abstract: In contemporary Western culture, death is often made separate from life. The dying body is rendered invisible, even though sociocultural performances of death foreshadow and signify death and dying. This article challenges this signifying by arguing that death and dying are constituted performatively through the inscriptive surfaces of living, dying, and dead bodies, rendered visible by breath and breathing. The article begins by reflecting on the experience of witnessing the author's mentor's dying breath. Thinking through the dying breath, it then questions to what extent the separation of death from life is maintained by what is unspoken of the dying and dead body. Finally, the article considers the analytical implications of the argument for those who remain behind to grieve for, and remember, the dying bodies, and those to whom those bodies once belonged<br>
