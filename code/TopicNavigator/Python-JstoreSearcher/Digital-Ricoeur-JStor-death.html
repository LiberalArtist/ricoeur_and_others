  Abstract: Social policies ineluctably invoke target populations—people who, in the case of Social Security, would contribute to and benefit from an insurance or investment system. Whether supporting or opposing a policy proposal, debate participants address various qualities of a target population. Policymakers may assert that future retirees harbor hopes and dreams for their retirement, while retirees may expect policies to help them realize their visions. Beyond aspirations, potential beneficiaries may exhibit stated and unstated needs. Workers certainly do not plan to suffer a serious on-the-job injury or premature death, but they may need to protect their families against a tragic<br>

  Abstract: The disruption of their household that the Plunkett family experienced in the years after 1916, and lasting well into the 1920s, inevitably led to some disordering of papers relating to Joseph’s politico-military activities and writings. The distribution of books and papers after his father’s death in 1948 added a further hazard to orderly preservation. It is therefore gratifying that G. N. Plunkett’s archive in the NLI should disclose a small amount of material generated by his eldest son. Mss. 12,009–10 contain two notebooks, the first labeled Philosophy and dating from 1908 to 1909, the second containing literary matter from<br>

  Book Title: Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy-The Living Art of Michael C. Leff<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Henry David<br>
  Abstract: What distinguishes the study of rhetoric from other pursuits in the liberal arts? From what realms of human existence and expression, of human history, does such study draw its defining character? What, in the end, should be the purposes of rhetorical inquiry? And amid so many competing accounts of discourse, power, and judgment in the contemporary world, how might scholars achieve these purposes through the attitudes and strategies that animate their work?
      Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy: The Living Art of Michael C. Leffoffers answers to these questions by introducing the central insights of one of the most innovative and prolific rhetoricians of the twentieth century, Michael C. Leff. This volume charts Leff 's decades-long development as a scholar, revealing both the variety of topics and the approach that marked his oeuvre, as well as his long-standing critique of the disciplinary assumptions of classical, Hellenistic, renaissance, modern, and postmodern rhetoric.Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy includes a synoptic introduction to the evolution of Leff 's thought from his time as a graduate student in the late 1960s to his death in 2010, as well as specific commentary on twenty-four of his most illuminating essays and lectures.<br>

The event he cites first is that fateful evening when his “mother abdicated her authority,” in the young Marcel’s bedroom at Combray; the second encompasses the many months during which the narrator observed the slow death of his grandmother.¹ The narrator is anguished: not only did he inflict pain on his mother when he “traced in her soul a first wrinkle and caused a first white hair to appear,” but also he wounded<br>

  Abstract: The 1996 Israeli election reflected the stasis that characterized Israeli politics for the fifteen years following the war in Lebanon. Labor and Likud existed in a kind of symbolic balance. The pragmatic Labor approach gave the party the advantage on “peace,” while Likud’s ideology and myth gave it the advantage on “security” and commitment to Eretz Israel. In this period, the stasis was broken only once, by the election of Yitzhak Rabin, whose personal credibility and gruff style reassured many Israelis that they could have both peace and security.

  Book Title: Nosotros-A Study of Everyday Meanings in Hispano New Mexico<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): KORTE ALVIN O.<br>
  Abstract: Much knowledge and understanding can be generated from the experiences of everyday life. In this engaging study, Alvin O. Korte examines how this concept applies to Spanish-speaking peoples adapted to a particular locale, specifically the Hispanos and Hispanas of northern New Mexico. Drawing on social philosopher Alfred Schutz's theory of typification, Korte looks at how meaning and identity are crafted by quotidian activities. Incorporating phenomenological and ethnomethodological strategies, the author investigates several aspects of local Hispano culture, including the oral tradition, leave-taking, death and remembrances of the dead, spirituality, and the circle of life. Although avoiding a social-problems approach, the book devotes necessary attention to

  Abstract: Thoreau brings the ʺwildernessʺ side of the proposition into focus: what the nineteenth century would have subsumed under the word ʺnatureʺ and the later twentieth century under ʺecology.ʺ The emphasis is in fact characteristically American, and the view of wilderness and wildness brings together ideas (social and personal) of place, of language, of body, and of mind. In the American instance, also, the persistent presence is that of the Indian (ʺthe vengeful ghost lurking in the back of the troubled American mindʺ—G.

  Book Title: Alef, Mem, Tau-Kabbalistic Musings on Time, Truth, and Death<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfson Elliot R.<br>
  Abstract: This highly original, provocative, and poetic work explores the nexus of time, truth, and death in the symbolic world of medieval kabbalah. Demonstrating that the historical and theoretical relationship between kabbalah and western philosophy is far more intimate and extensive than any previous scholar has ever suggested, Elliot R. Wolfson draws an extraordinary range of thinkers such as Frederic Jameson, Martin Heidegger, Franz Rosenzweig, William Blake, Julia Kristeva, Friedrich Schelling, and a host of kabbalistic figures into deep conversation with one another.
      Alef, Mem, Taualso discusses Islamic mysticism and Buddhist thought in relation to the Jewish esoteric tradition as it opens the possibility of a temporal triumph of temporality and the conquering of time through time. The framework for Wolfson's examination is the rabbinic teaching that the wordemet,"truth," comprises the first, middle, and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet,alef, mem,andtau,which serve, in turn, as semiotic signposts for the three tenses of time-past, present, and future. By heeding the letters ofemetwe discern the truth of time manifestly concealed in the time of truth, the beginning that cannot begin if it is to be the beginning, the middle that re/marks the place of origin and destiny, and the end that is the figuration of the impossible disclosing the impossibility of figuration, the finitude of death that facilitates the possibility of rebirth. The time of death does not mark the death of time, but time immortal, the moment of truth that bestows on the truth of the moment an endless beginning of a beginningless end, the truth of death encountered incessantly in retracing steps of time yet to be taken-between, before, beyond.<br>

  Book Title: Imagining Karma-Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): OBEYESEKERE GANANATH<br>
  Abstract: With
      Imagining Karma,Gananath Obeyesekere embarks on the very first comparison of rebirth concepts across a wide range of cultures. Exploring in rich detail the beliefs of small-scale societies of West Africa, Melanesia, traditional Siberia, Canada, and the northwest coast of North America, Obeyesekere compares their ideas with those of the ancient and modern Indic civilizations and with the Greek rebirth theories of Pythagoras, Empedocles, Pindar, and Plato. His groundbreaking and authoritative discussion decenters the popular notion that India was the origin and locus of ideas of rebirth. As Obeyesekere compares responses to the most fundamental questions of human existence, he challenges readers to reexamine accepted ideas about death, cosmology, morality, and eschatology. Obeyesekere's comprehensive inquiry shows that diverse societies have come through independent invention or borrowing to believe in reincarnation as an integral part of their larger cosmological systems. The author brings together into a coherent methodological framework the thought of such diverse thinkers as Weber, Wittgenstein, and Nietzsche. In a contemporary intellectual context that celebrates difference and cultural relativism, this book makes a case for disciplined comparison, a humane view of human nature, and a theoretical understanding of "family resemblances" and differences across great cultural divides.<br>

  Abstract: Always concerned with the subversive capacity of cinema to show us what we may not wish to see, critic Amos Vogel has frequently commented on the medium’s tendency to avert its eyes before the sight of actual death. He writes: “Now that sex is available to us in hard-core porno films, death remains the one last taboo in cinema. However ubiquitous death is—we all ultimately suffer from it—it calls into question the social order and its value systems; it attacks our mad scramble for power, our simplistic rationalism and our unacknowledged, child-like belief in immortality.”¹ Death, Vogel suggests,<br>

  Book Title: After the Massacre-Commemoration and Consolation in Ha My and My Lai<br>

  Author(s): Faust Drew<br>
  Abstract: Though a generation has passed since the massacre of civilians at My Lai, the legacy of this tragedy continues to reverberate throughout Vietnam and the rest of the world. This engrossing study considers how Vietnamese villagers in My Lai and Ha My-a village where South Korean troops committed an equally appalling, though less well-known, massacre of unarmed civilians-assimilate the catastrophe of these mass deaths into their everyday ritual life. Based on a detailed study of local history and moral practices,
      After the Massacrefocuses on the particular context of domestic life in which the Vietnamese villagers interact with their ancestors on one hand and the ghosts of tragic death on the other. Heonik Kwon explains what intimate ritual actions can tell us about the history of mass violence and the global bipolar politics that caused it. He highlights the aesthetics of Vietnamese commemorative rituals and the morality of their practical actions to liberate the spirits from their grievous history of death. The author brings these important practices into a critical dialogue with dominant sociological theories of death and symbolic transformation.<br>

If we consider it “from below” instead and include in it the experience of violent political confrontations within local and national communities, which is what the Cold War actually meant in much of the world in the past century, the political bifurcation of the human community and a moral polarization<br>

In 529, less than fifty years after his death, his own successors abandoned Athens when Justinian closed the pagan philosophical schools, and although they subsequently returned, they were able to carry on their work only as private individuals.

  Abstract: Georges Bataille and Maurice Blanchot's mutual interest in the Lascaux cave paintings signals their common concern to construct a discourse of origin in relation to art. Both writers consider origin in terms of the anxiety-filled questioning surrounding the ontological and historical aporias that have plagued Western thought, including those that appear under the banner of the Modern and the Postmodern. Both ask: what kind of discourse presides over the disconcerting doubling of reality performed by the first artists? For Bataille, origin is bound up with the ritual significance of eroticism and death as these underpin all forms of artistic endeavour;<br>

  Abstract: The Shriek of Silenceis a first in several respects: the first to examine the Holocaust novels in their original languages, the first to articulate a theoretical basis for its approach, and the first phenomenological investigation -- one that attempts to penetrate the process of creation for these novelists. Organized along conceptual lines, the book examines "the word in exile," the themes of death of the father and the child, transformations of the self, and the implications of the reader. Its philosophical foundations are Rosenzweig, Buber, Neher, and Levinas. Its critical approach is shaped by Bakhtin.<br>

Meditative and philosophical, often centered on the themes of time and death and on the reactions that these evoke, Brines’s poetry is also marked by the very careful and artistic use of seemingly ordinary language. Critics have observed the symbolic nature of his work and its way of giving impact to seemingly common vignettes and expressions by juxtapositions, superpositions, and linguistic devices.¹<br>

  Book Title: Regard for the Other: Autothanatography in Rousseau, De Quincey, Baudelaire, and Wilde-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burt E. S.<br>
  Abstract: Although much has been written on autobiography, the same cannot be said of autothanatography, the writing of one's death. This study starts from the deconstructive premise that autobiography is aporetic, not or not only a matter of a subject strategizing with language to produce an exemplary identity but a matter also of its responding to an exorbitant call to write its death. The I-dominated representations of particular others and of the privileged other to whom a work is addressed, must therefore be set against an alterity plaguing the I from within or shadowing it from without. This alterity makes itself known in writing as the potential of the text to carry messages that remain secret to the confessing subject. Anticipation of the potential for the confessional text to say what Augustine calls the secret I do not know,the secret of death, engages the autothanatographical subject in a dynamic, inventive, and open-ended process of identification. The subject presented in these texts is not one that has already evolved an interior life that it seeks to reveal to others, but one that speaks to us as still in process. Through its exorbitant response, it gives intimations of an interiority and an ethical existence to come. Baudelaire emerges as a central figure for this understanding of autobiography as autothanatography through his critique of the narcissism of a certain Rousseau, his translation of De Quincey's confessions, with their vertiginously ungrounded subject-in-construction, his artistic practice of self-conscious, thorough-going doubleness, and his service to Wilde as model for an aporetic secrecy. The author discusses the interruption of narrative that must be central to the writing of one's death and addresses the I's dealings with the aporias of such structuring principles as secrecy, Levinasian hospitality, or interiorization as translation. The book makes a strong intervention in the debate over one of the most-read genres of our time.<br>

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, eac~<br>

  Book Title: Technologies of Life and Death: From Cloning to Capital Punishment-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oliver Kelly<br>
  Abstract: The central aim of this book is to approach contemporary problems raised by technologies of life and death as ethical issues that call for a more nuanced approach than mainstream philosophy can provide. To do so, it draws on the recently published seminars of Jacques Derrida to analyze the extremes of birth and dying insofar as they are mediated by technologies of life and death. With an eye to reproductive technologies, it shows how a deconstructive approach can change the very terms of contemporary debates over technologies of life and death, from cloning to surrogate motherhood to capital punishment, particularly insofar as most current discussions assume some notion of a liberal individual. The ethical stakes in these debates are never far from political concerns such as enfranchisement, citizenship, oppression, racism, sexism, and the public policies that normalize them. Technologies of Life and Death thus provides pointers for rethinking dominant philosophical and popular assumptions about nature and nurture, chance and necessity, masculine and feminine, human and animal, and what it means to be a mother or a father. In part, the book seeks to disarticulate a tension between ethics and politics that runs through these issues in order to suggest a more ethical politics by turning the force of sovereign violence back against itself. In the end, it proposes that deconstructive ethics with a psychoanalytic supplement can provide a corrective for moral codes and political cliches that turn us into mere answering machines.<br>

  Book Title: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Timothy<br>
  Abstract: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics presents a decade of thought about the origins and possibilities of political theory from one of contemporary Italy's most prolific and engaging political theorists, Roberto Esposito. He has coined a number of critical concepts in current debates about the past, present, and future of biopolitics-from his work on the implications of the etymological and philosophical kinship of community (communitas) and immunity (immunitas) to his theorizations of the impolitical and the impersonal. Taking on interlocutors from throughout the Western philosophical tradition, from Aristotle and Augustine to Weil, Arendt, Nancy, Foucault, and Agamben, Esposito announces the eclipse of a modern political lexicon-"freedom," "democracy," "sovereignty," and "law"-that, in its attempt to protect human life, has so often produced its opposite (violence, melancholy, and death). Terms of the Political calls for the opening of political thought toward a resignification of these and other operative terms-such as "community," "immunity," "biopolitics," and "the impersonal"-in ways that affirm rather than negate life. An invaluable introduction to the breadth and rigor of Esposito's thought, the book will also welcome readers already familiar with Esposito's characteristic skill in overturning and breaking open the language of politics.<br>

  Book Title: Intention Interpretation-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): ISEMINGER GARY<br>
  Abstract: "...an excellent and comprehensive discussion of a debate that was initiated in this century in William Wimsatt's and Monroe C. Beardsley's influential article 'The Intentional Fallacy.'...this is a splendidly conceived and very useful collection of essays. Readers will want to take issue with the arguments of individual authors, but this is to be expected in a volume at the cutting edge of a fertile philosophical controversy." --David Novitz, The Philosophical Quarterly "What is the connection, if any, between the author's intentions in (while) writing a work of literature and the truth (acceptability, validity) of interpretive statements about it?" With this question, Gary Isminger introduces a literary debate that has been waged for the past four decades and is addressed by philosophers and literary theorists in Intention and Interpretation. Thirteen essays discuss the role of appeals to the author's intention in interpreting works of literature. A well-known argument by E.D. Hirsch serves as the basic text, in which he defends the appeal to the author's intention against Wimsatt and Beardsley's claim that such an appeal involved "the intentional fallacy." The essays, mostly commissioned by the editor, explore the presuppositions and consequences of arguing for the importance of the author's intentions in the way Hirsch does. Connections emerge between this issue and many fundamental issues in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind as well as in aesthetics. The (old) "New Criticism" and current Post-Structuralism tend to agree in disenfranchising the author, and many people now are disinclined even to consider the alternative. Hirsch demurs, and arguments like his deserve the careful attention, both from critics and sympathizers, that they receive here. Literary scholars and philosophers who are sympathetic to Continental as well as to Anglo-American styles of philosophy are among the contributors.

  Author(s): Sheets-Johnstone Maxine<br>
  Abstract: "A significant contribution to the study of early humans, this book is a philosophical anthropology.... it makes genuinely novel, and highly persuasive, claims within the field itself." --David Depew In this ground-breaking interdisciplinary study about conceptual origins, Maxine Sheets-Johnstone shows that there is an indissoluble bond between hominid thinking and hominid evolution, a bond cemented by the living body. Her thesis is concretely illustrated in eight paleoanthropological case studies ranging from tool-using/tool-making to counting, sexuality, representation, language, death, and cave art. In each case, evidence is brought forward that shows how thinking is modeled on the body-specifically, how concepts are generated by animate form and the tactile-kinesthetic experience. Later chapters critically examine key theoretical and methodological issues posed by the thesis, Sheets-Johnstone demonstrates in detail how and why a corporeal turn in philosophy and the human sciences can yield insights no less extraordinary than those produced by the linguistic turn. In confronting the currently popular doctrine of cultural relativism and the classic Western metaphysical dualism of mind and body, she shows how pan-cultural invariants of human bodily life have been discounted and how the body itself has not been given its due. By a precise exposition of how a full-scale hermeneutics and a genetic phenomenology may be carried out with respect to conceptual origins, she shows how methodological issues are successfully resolved. "Ranging across the humanities and sciences, this thoroughly original book challenges both traditional metaphysics and contemporary cultural relativism. In their place, it persuasively develops a phenomenonological, tactile-kinesthetic account of the origins of thinking. This philosophical anthropology could not be more timely. It replaces the 'linguistic turn' with a promising new 'corporeal turn.'" --John J. Stuhr, University of Oregon "This w~<br>

  Abstract: This book is about conceptual origins. In particular, it addresses the question of the conceptual origin of fundamental human practices and beliefs that arose far back in evolutionary human history: tool-making, counting, consistent bipedality, language, the concept of death, engraving and painting. Typically, answers to questions about origins—how a verbal language originated, how counting began, for example—take for granted the very concepts basic to the practice, the concept of oneself as a sound-maker in the case of language, for instance, or the concept of numbers in the case of counting.

  Book Title: Conrad's Marlow-Narrative and death in 'Youth', Heart of Darkness, Lord Jim and Chance<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wake Paul<br>
  Abstract: Variously described as ‘the average pilgrim’, a ‘wanderer’, and ‘a Buddha preaching in European clothes’, Charlie Marlow is the voice behind Joseph Conrad’s ‘Youth’ (1898), Heart of Darkness (1899), Lord Jim (1900) and Chance (1912). Conrad’s Marlow offers a comprehensive account and critical analysis of one of Conrad’s most celebrated creations, asking both who and what is Marlow: a character or a narrator, a biographer or an autobiographical screen, a messenger or an interpreter, a bearer of truth or a misguided liar? Reading Conrad’s fiction alongside the work of Walter Benjamin, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida and Martin Heidegger, and offering an investigation into the connection between narrative and death, this book argues that Marlow’s essence is located in his liminality – in his constantly shifting position – and that the emergence of meaning in his stories is at all points bound up with the process of his storytelling.<br>

  Abstract: This book aims to enable a user to become closely familiar with a limited number of Older Testament texts and so be in a position to form judgments about them and, resulting from that, to have an under- standing of the nature of biblical text itself. Beyond this, the reality that these are key texts for the understanding of the Bible means that they have fundamental impact for the basics of faith today our understanding of ourselves before God, essential to faith in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Israel's prophets reflect on the role of God in human life; faith in God's love, God's passion for justice, the essential place of fidelity in faith. Israel's foundational narratives explore the nature of human lives before God; they include issues such as creation, human freedom, and faith in God's unshakeable commitment to human life. Alongside these concerns, there is the importance of getting a feel for the nature of scripture.<br>

Even though Eve has an important role in the Edenic scene of sin that establishes humanity as a mortal species, the homicidal and fratricidal act that initiates human history provides for no woman. Something analogous happens to Pandora, the first woman according to Hesiod, from whose belly is born death in addition to other ills for the human race: the lineage that then descends from her is exclusively male, often brothers or those united in the warrior brotherhoods, whose<br>

  Author(s) Crockett Clayton<br>
  Abstract: In seeking to outline a future of Continental philosophy of religion, as is the objective of this volume, perhaps we first need to trace the trajectory of the future of Continental philosophy itself. It could be said that the latter endeavor had already been put in place by Jean-Luc Nancy sometime in 1986, when he posed the question of
                  qui vient après le sujet,or “who comes after the subject,” a question coming in the wake of the dissolution, or the putting to death, of thesubjectby Continental philosophy since the late 1960s. What Nancy’s question implies is that<br>

  Book Title: Kierkegaard and Death-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): BUBEN ADAM<br>
  Abstract: Few philosophers have devoted such sustained, almost obsessive attention to the topic of death as Søren Kierkegaard. Kierkegaard and Death brings together new work on Kierkegaard's multifaceted discussions of death and provides a thorough guide to the development, in various texts and contexts, of Kierkegaard's ideas concerning death. Essays by an international group of scholars take up essential topics such as dying to the world, living death, immortality, suicide, mortality and subjectivity, death and the meaning of life, remembrance of the dead, and the question of the afterlife. While bringing Kierkegaard's philosophy of death into focus, this volume connects Kierkegaard with important debates in contemporary philosophy.<br>

In effect, I take Derrida to be suggesting that pursuing ethical considerations is an attempt to avoid confronting one’s<br>

  Book Title: The Incarnate Lord-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): WHITE THOMAS JOSEPH<br>
  Abstract: The Incarnate Lord, then, considers central themes in Christology from a metaphysical perspective. Particular attention is given to the hypostatic union, the two natures of Christ, the knowledge and obedience of Jesus, the passion and death of Christ, his descent into hell, and resurrection. A central concern of the book is to argue for the perennial importance of ontological principles of Christology inherited from patristic and scholastic authors. However, the book also seeks to advance an interpretation of Thomistic Christology in a modern context. The teaching Aquinas, then, is central to the study, but it is placed in conversation with various modern theologians, such as Karl Barth, Karl Rahner and Hans Urs von Balthasar. Ultimately the goal of the work is to suggest how traditional Catholic theology might thrive under modern conditions, and also develop fruitfully from engaging in contemporary controversies.<br>

  Abstract: Our study of the being of Christ would be incomplete without a consideration of his resurrection. What can we say about the glorification of his human nature that took place after his death? This depends in part upon what we take human nature to be. I have argued in the prolegomenon to this book that modern theology is often bifurcated. On the one side there is the tendency to reduce Christology to a form of idealized anthropology. Schleiermacher and Rahner provide models of this form of reflection. On the other side there is the theological assimilation of all natural forms<br>

  Abstract: The manner in which modern scholars investigate questions of historicity is one that the Fourth Evangelist would find peculiar.

The writer of the Fourth Gospel, however, assumes that truly understanding the pre-Easter Jesus involves a post-Easter perspective.

Not only does such care place the caregiver in unavoidable proximity to profound questions, but also the acts of care themselves reveal the nature of deeply held assumptions. Even the language that forms our descriptions of illness indicates some level of how we conceive of illness; our descriptions of illness also indicate how we understand the significance of life when it is in good health. In short, the words used for illness carry strong interpretive and evaluative power.<br>

  Book Title: Keeping the Feast-Metaphors of Sacrifice in 1 Corinthians and Philippians<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Patterson Jane Lancaster<br>
  Abstract: Patterson uses cognitive metaphor theory to trace the apostle Paul's use of metaphors from the Jewish sacrificial system in his moral counsels to the Philippians and the Corinthians. In these letters, Paul moves from the known (the practice of sacrifice) to the unknown (how to live in accord with the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ). Patterson illustrates that the significant sacrificial metaphors in 1 Corinthians and Philippians are not derived from Jewish sacrifices of atonement, but rather from the Passover and sacrifices of thanksgiving. Attention to these metaphors demonstrates that imagery drawn from these sacrifices shapes the overall moral counsel of the letters, reveals more varied and nuanced interpretations of sacrificial references in Paul's letters, and sheds light on Paul's continuity with Jewish cultic practice.<br>

That statement may seem so obvious that it hardly bears mentioning, but the fact often becomes lost in Christian theologizing, in which the move from sacrificial practice to sacrificial metaphor has become obscured by what appears to be the givenness of the metaphor of sacrifice.

  Book Title: The Adventures of Jonathan Dennis-Bicultural Film Archiving Practice in Aotearoa New Zealand<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kelly Emma Jean<br>
  Abstract: Jonathan Dennis (1953-2002), was the creative and talented founding director of the New Zealand Film Archive. As a Pakeha (non-Maori/indigenous New Zealander) with a strong sense of social justice, Dennis became a conduit for tension and debate over the preservation and presentation of indigenous and non-indigenous film archival materials from the time the Archive opened in 1981. His work resulted in a film archive and curatorship practice which differed significantly from that of the North American and European archives he originally sought to emulate. He supported a philosophical shift in archival practice by engaging indigenous peoples in developing creative and innovative exhibitions from the 1980s until his death, recognizing that much of the expertise required to work with archival materials rested with the communities outside archival walls. This book presents new interviews gathered by the author, as well as an examination of existing interviews, films and broadcasts about and with Jonathan Dennis, to consider the narrative of a life and work in relation to film archiving.<br>

  Book Title: A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VENEMA HENRY ISAAC<br>
  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's entire philosophical project narrates a passion for the possibleexpressed in the hope that in spite of death, closure, and sedimentation, life is opened by superabundance, by how the world gives us much more than is possible. Ricoeur's philosophical anthropology is a phenomenology of human capacity, which gives onto the groundless ground of human being, namely, God. Thus the story of the capable man, beginning with original goodness held captive by a servile will and ending with the possibility of liberation and regeneration of the heart, underpins his passion for the more than possible. The essays in this volume trace the fluid movement between phenomenological and religious descriptions of the capable self that emerges across Ricoeur's oeuvre and establish points of connection for future developments that might draw inspiration from this body of thought.<br>

  Book Title: Death's Following: Mediocrity, Dirtiness, Adulthood, Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): LIMON JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Almost all twentieth-century philosophy stresses the immanence of death in human life-as drive (Freud), as the context of Being (Heidegger), as the essence of our defining ethics (Levinas), or as language (de Man, Blanchot). In Death's Following, John Limon makes use of literary analysis (of Sebald, Bernhard, and Stoppard), cultural analysis, and autobiography to argue that death is best conceived as always transcendentally beyond ourselves, neither immanent nor imminent. Adapting Kierkegaard's variations on the theme of Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac while refocusing the emphasis onto Isaac, Limon argues that death should be imagined as if hiding at the end of an inexplicable journey to Moriah. The point is not to evade or ignore death but to conceive it more truly, repulsively, and pervasively in its camouflage: for example, in jokes, in logical puzzles, in bowdlerized folk songs. The first of Limon's two key concepts is adulthood: the prolonged anti-ritual for experiencing the full distance on the look of death. His second is dirtiness, as theorized in a Jewish joke, a logical exemplum, and T. S. Eliot's "Ash Wednesday": In each case, unseen dirt on foreheads suggests the invisibility of inferred death. Not recognizing death immediately or admitting its immanence and imminence is for Heidegger the defining characteristic of the "they," humanity in its inauthentic social escapism. But Limon vouches throughout for the mediocrity of the "they" in its dirty and ludicrous adulthood. Mediocrity is the privileged position for previewing death, in Limon's opinion: practice for being forgotten. In refusing the call of twentieth-century philosophy to face death courageously, Limon urges the ethical and aesthetic value of mediocre anti-heroism.<br>

  Abstract: Jean-Luc Nancy is without doubt a post-Marxist, post-Heideggerian and—I would add—post-Arendtian thinker.¹ His ontology bears traces of all three, but this ontology flows, above all, from an attempt to think creation ex nihilo after the death of the creator God. Even now, so long after Nietzsche, and so very long after Descartes set the process of secularization in motion, it is a thinking that is only uneasily, hesitantly under way. We have gone beyond God, as Nancy puts it, but in a direction still too much determined by the thought of his death and by the necro-monotheist tradition<br>

  Book Title: Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Ethical Self-Christology, Ethics, and Formation<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Elliston Clark J.<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s work has persistently challenged Christian consciousness due to both his death at the hands of the Nazis and his provocative prison musings about Christian faithfulness in late modernity. Although understandable given the popularity of both narrative trajectories, such selective focus obscures the depth and fecundity of his overall corpus. Bonhoeffer’s early work, and particularly his Christocentric anthropology, grounds his later expressed commitments to responsibility and faithfulness in a “world come of age." While much debate accompanies claims regarding the continuity of Bonhoeffer’s thought, there are central motifs which pervade his work from his doctoral dissertation to the prison writings. This book suggests that a concern for otherness permeates all of Bonhoeffer’s work. Furthermore, Clark Elliston articulates, drawing on Bonhoeffer, a Christian self-defined by its orientation towards otherness. Taking Bonhoeffer as both the origin and point of return, the text engages Emmanuel Levinas and Simone Weil as dialogue partners who likewise stress the role of the other for self-understanding, albeit in diverse ways. By reading Bonhoeffer “through" their voices, one enhances Bonhoeffer’s already fertile understanding of responsibility.<br>

  Book Title: Writings on Medicine-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Meyers Todd<br>
  Abstract: At the time of his death in 1995, Georges Canguilhem was a highly respected historian of science and medicine, whose engagement with questions of normality, the ideologization of scientific thought, and the conceptual history of biology had marked the thought of philosophers such as Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Pierre Bourdieu, and Gilles Deleuze. This collection of short, incisive, and highly accessible essays on the major concepts of modern medicine shows Canguilhem at the peak of his use of historical practice for philosophical engagement. In order to elaborate a philosophy of medicine, Canguilhem examines paramount problems such as the definition and uses of health, the decline of the Hippocratic understanding of nature, the experience of disease, the limits of psychology in medicine, myths and realities of therapeutic practices, the difference between cure and healing, the organism's self-regulation, and medical metaphors linking the organism to society. Writings on Medicine is at once an excellent introduction to Canguilhem's work and a forceful, insightful, and accessible engagement with elemental concepts in medicine. The book is certain to leave its imprint on anthropology, history, philosophy, bioethics, and the social studies of medicine.<br>

Yes, Moses created the Jews and Judaism by restoring the Father to them alone, through his own person and in the teaching of the one omnipotent God of the universe. Following his death this revelation was repressed in turn, only to reemerge from its state of unconscious latency in the teachings of the prophets, which would become the common patrimony of the entire Jewish people.<br>

The justice of the restorative Christ is justice with reconciliation, justice with repentance, justice with repair, and justice without retaliation. The Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts portray the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ through the radical concept of "enemy-love." In conversation with Dietrich Bonhoeffer (Jesus-for-others), John Howard Yoder (a nonviolent Jesus), Miroslav Volf (an embracing Jesus), and Chris Marshall (a compassionate Jesus), Broughton demonstrates what the restorative Christ means for us today. Following the restorative Christ faithfully involves imaginative disciplines (seeing, remembering, and desiring), conversational disciplines (naming, questioning, and forgiving), and embodied disciplines (absorbing, repairing, and embracing).<br>

  Abstract: Few questions exert such a great fascination on human conscience as those related to the meaning of life, history, and death. The belief in the resurrection of the dead constitutes an answer to a real challenge: What is the meaning of life and history in the midst of a world in which evil, injustice, and ultimately death exist? Resurrection is an instrument serving a broader, more encompassing reality: the Kingdom of God. Such a utopian Kingdom gathers the final response to the problem of theodicy and to the enigma of history. <CR><CR> This book seeks to understand the idea of resurrection not only as a theological but also as a philosophical category (as expression of the collective aspirations of humanity), combining historical, theological, and philosophical analyses in dialogue with some of the principal streams of contemporary Western thought.<br>

  Book Title: The Gift of the Other-Levinas, Derrida, and a Theology of Hospitality<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Bouma-Prediger Steven<br>
  Abstract: We live in an age of global capitalism and terror. In a climate of consumption and fear the unknown Other is regarded as a threat to our safety, a client to assist, or a competitor to be overcome in the struggle for scarce resources. And yet, the Christian Scriptures explicitly summon us to welcome strangers, to care for the widow and the orphan, and to build relationships with those distant from us. But how, in this world of hostility and commodification, do we practice hospitality? In The Gift of the Other, Andrew Shepherd engages deeply with the influential thought of French thinkers Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida, and argues that a true vision of hospitality is ultimately found not in postmodern philosophies but in the Christian narrative. The book offers a compelling Trinitarian account of the God of hospitality—a God of communion who “makes room" for otherness, who overcomes the hostility of the world though Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection, and who through the work of the Spirit is forming a new community: the Church—a people of welcome.<br>

  Book Title: Life in the Spirit-A Post-Constantinian and Trinitarian Account of the Christian Life<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): snavely Andréa D.<br>
  Abstract: Christians are united in saying that the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. But the unity breaks down when explaining how the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. Life in the Spirit is the first book to engage the post-Constantinian critique of the church with the field of Spirit Christology. Building upon the work of post-Constantinians John Howard Yoder and Stanley Hauerwas and upon the Trinitarian Spirit-Christology of Leopoldo Sánchez, this account provides a framework for seeing one’s Christian life as one transformed by the Spirit. Snavely rejects the characterisation of life in the Spirit as bringing sinners to faith, and instead proposes that as Jesus lived as the Son of the Father in the Spirit, the Spirit also makes other sons of the father in the image of Jesus. This Trinitarian interpretation shows the Christian life as being one of total trust in God with one’s own life, and after death living in Jesus’ resurrected life in the Spirit. Snavely’s account calls for a reimagining of the church and the Christian life in terms of ecclesial structure, Christian discipleship and the Christian view of marriage. Life in the Spirit will not only help Christians to have a better understanding of the place of vocation in the world as witnesses to the lordship of Jesus Christ, but it will also promote unity in the body of Christ based on the actual unity that all his adopted sons and daughters already have by belonging to Jesus Christ’s life in the Spirit.<br>

  Abstract: According to the Nicene Creed, Christ died for us and for our salvation. But while all Christians agree that Christ’s death and resurrection has saving significance, there is little unanimity in how and why that is the case. In fact, Christian history is littered with accounts of the redemptive value of Christ’s death, and new models and motifs are constantly being proposed, many of which now stand in stark contrast to earlier thought. How then should contemporary articulations of the importance of the death of Christ be judged? At the heart of this book is the contention that Christian reflection on the atonement is faithful inasmuch as it incorporates the intention that Jesus himself had for his death. In a wide-reaching study, the author draws from both classical scholarship and recent work on the historical Jesus to argue that not only did Jesus imbue his death with redemptive meaning but that such meaning should impact expressions of the saving significance of the cross.<br>

  Author(s) Ormerod Neil<br>
  Abstract: What I have attempted to demonstrate herein is the ongoing potential for theology to articulate the meaning of Jesus’ death in a way that remains both faithful to the Christian tradition and yet sensitive to the needs of any given community. Hence, the task has not been to assert any one particular motif or understanding of the cross as
                  theexpression of faithful Christianity. Such an assertion (be it for any particular motif) needs to be rejected, not because individual motifs lack understanding or coherence but because the communication of the saving message of the cross must be received personally,<br>

  Author(s) Jasper David<br>
  Abstract: Throughout this book we have wrestled with the question of how to conceive of sacrament and sacramentality in a way that consists with the postmodern imagination. We have seen that the meaning of the Eucharist, and by extension sacramentality, may be derived from the endless matrix of signification within which it exists. In this sense, the Eucharist is not “rooted” in its history, but rather
                  extends across historyas an endlessly sprawling, endlessly relevant living metaphor. It recalls the Last Supper; it (re) presents Christ’s sacrificial death on Calvary; it is ratified by thelivingTradition of the Body of<br>

  Abstract: Chapter 1 described Jürgen Moltmann’s future-determined, creationfocused, ideologically-modern, hope in the passible God who has been brought to suffer with humanity by Jesus Christ’s suffering and death. I followed the sketch of Moltmann’s theological hope with examples of Moltmannian hope and its humanist, this-worldly hope in the changes that responsible, hopeful actions can make. In chapter 2, I noted what an exclusive reliance on Moltmannian hope loses: non-modern imagination, divine impassibility, Christ’s two natures, heaven, transcendent human flourishing, and apparently irresponsible discipleship.

Lévi-Strauss moved with characteristic creative aplomb across a remarkable range of potential disciplinary homes, but anthropology remained his home base, the place of comfort from which to discomfit other disciplines. The history of anthropology therefore has a particular claim to the movement he founded and popularized beyond its origins in Saussurean linguistics despite the fact that French structuralism has<br>

Refuting easy assumptions of top-down governmental influence, Pipyrou shows how the Grecanici find political representation through the European Union and UNESCO, state policy, civic associations, family networks and illegal organizations; not being afraid to take risks, incur wrath, lose friends, or risk death in challenging the political status-quo.<br>

  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Harvey Barry<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer writes in one of his last prison letters that he had “come to know and understand more and more the profound this-worldliness of Christianity." In Taking Hold of the Real, Barry Harvey engages in constructive conversation with Bonhoeffer, contending that the “shallow and banal this-worldliness" of modern society is ordered to a significant degree around the social technologies of religion, culture, and race. These mechanisms displace human beings from their traditional connections with particular locales, and relocate them in their “proper places" as determined by the nation-state and capitalist markets. Christians are called to participate in the profound this-worldliness that breaks into the world in the apocalyptic action of Jesus Christ, a form of life that requires discipline and an understanding of death and resurrection. The church is a sacrament of this new humanity, performing for all to hear the polyphony of life that was prefigured in the Old Testament and now is realised in Christ. Unable to find a faithful form of this-worldliness in wartime Germany, Bonhoeffer joined the conspiracy against Hitler, a decision aptly contrasted with a small French church that, prepared by its life together over many generations, saved thousands of Jewish lives.<br>

  Abstract: One persistent theoretical and practical problem in Marxism was to explain the failures of working-class opposition to capitalist exploitation. Karl Marx had assumed that the organized working class would eventually engage in a successful political struggle against the ruling class alongside a background of systematic crises in the economic system. A wide range of explanations as to why this transformation did not take place has been developed over the decades after Marx’s death in 1883. At the end of the nineteenth century, it appeared that the condition of the German working class had improved, suggesting that capitalism could be reformed.<br>

  Book Title: Light and Death-Figuration in Spenser, Kepler, Donne, Milton<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: Light figures being; darkness, death. Bridging mathematical science, semantics, rhetoric, grammar, and major poems, Judith H. Anderson seeks to negotiate writings from multiple disciplines in the shared terms of poiesis and figuration rather than as cultural opposites. Analogy, a type of metaphor, has always been the connector of the known to the unknown, the sensible to the infinite. Anderson’s study moves from the figuration of light and death to the history of analogy and its pertinence to light in physics and metaphysics, from Kepler to Donne, Spenser, and Milton. Topics proliferate: creativity, optics, the relation of literature to science, the methodology of thought and argument, and the processes of narrative, discovery, and interpretation.<br>

  Abstract: Culturally, associatively, and naturally, light brings with it reference to darkness, as day to night and life to death. The symbolic valences of night and light, together with their phonic likeness, occupied Milton throughout his writing, but especially after his blindness, as his blind protagonist eloquently testifies in
                  Samson Agonistes. Various half-lights, such as twilight, dusk and dawn, shade and shadow, enter the picture, too. These belong neither to light nor to darkness, neither exclusively to day nor to night; in them, light and dark combine suggestively. InParadise Lost, Milton’s figure of Death is recurrently called a shade or<br>

  Book Title: Seamus Heaney as Aesthetic Thinker-A Study of the Prose<br>
  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): MacKillop James<br>
  Abstract: Seamus Heaney’s unexpected death in August 2013 brought to completion his body of work, and scholars are only now coming to understand the full scale and importance of this extraordinary career. The Nobel Prize–winning poet, translator, and playwright from the North of Ireland is considered the most important Irish poet after Yeats and, at the time of his death, arguably the most famous living poet. For this reason, much of the scholarship to date on Heaney has understandably focused on his poetry. O’Brien’s new work, however, focuses on Heaney’s essays, book chapters, and lectures as it seeks to understand how Heaney explored the poet’s role in the world. By examining Heaney’s prose, O’Brien teases out a clearer understanding of Heaney’s sense of the function of poetry as an act of public intellectual and ethical inquiry. In doing so, O’Brien reads Heaney as an aesthetic thinker in the European tradition, considering him alongside Heidegger, Derrida, Lacan, and Adorno. Studying Heaney within this theoretical and philosophical tradition sheds new and useful light on one of the greatest creative minds of the twentieth century.<br>

Nietzsche describes a madman who lit a lantern in the morning hours and went in search of God, like Diogenes, who claimed that the light of day was not sufficient to reveal an honest man. The madman’s audience of unbelievers mocked him, asking whether God had gotten lost or emigrated. The madman proclaimed that God was dead and that he and they<br>

For purposes of quantification, Christian martyrs are “believers in Christ who have lost their lives prematurely, in situations of witness, as a result of human hostility.” This definition can be expounded as follows: “Believers in Christ” are individuals from the entire Christian community of Roman Catholics, Orthodox, Protestants, Anglicans, Marginal Christians, and Independents. “‘Lost their lives” restricts it to Christians actually put to death, for whatever reason. “Prematurely” means<br>

As per Michel Foucault¹, new bio politics are being developed, a new “government of bodies” (according to Didier Fassin and Dominique Memmi²).

In section 48, Heidegger distinguishes between, on the one hand, ending as stopping and disappearance, and on the other hand, ending as ripening and fulfillment (227). Whereas the former meaning is about termination, the latter concerns end as a telos, a purpose. It is about completion and fulfillment. Now whatever<br>

  Author(s): Krystal Arthur<br>
  Abstract: We disagree. From small questions of taste to large questions concerning the nature of existence, intellectual debate takes up much of our time. In this book the respected literary critic Arthur Krystal examines what most commentators ignore: the role of temperament and taste in the forming of aesthetic and ideological opinions. In provocative essays about reading and writing, about the relation between life and literature, about knowledge and certainty, about God and death, and about his own gradual disaffection with the literary scene, Krystal demonstrates that opposing points of view are based more on innate predilections than on disinterested thought or analysis.Not beholden to any fashionable theory or political agenda, Krystal interrogates the usual suspects in the cultural wars from an independent, though not impartial, vantage point. Clearly personal and unabashedly belletrist, his essays ask important questions. What makes culture one thing and not another? What inspires aesthetic values? What drives us to make comparisons? And how does a bias for one kind of evidence as opposed to another contribute to the form and content of intellectual argument?<br>

  Author(s) Thoma Samuel<br>
  Abstract: The essay discusses Karl Jaspers’ concept of limit situations in his
                  Psychology of Worldviews. In limit situations, individuals experience their finite existence in an essential way. The essay shows that the concept had great influence on Martin Heidegger, who gives two of the situations, death and guilt, a decisive role in the phenomenological analysis of human existence inBeing and Time. For Jaspers’Psychology, the main emphasis lies on the individual’s spiritual counter-reaction to the experience of limit situations, which leaves the overall status of the situations unclear. The essay also shows that for Jaspers limit situations are devastating because<br>

The writer had plunged actively into politics after his illegal return to Ukraine in 1914, and from 1917 to 1920 he was one of the leaders of the Ukrainian revolution. He was the first Chair of the Ukrainian government, 1917–18, and head of the revolutionary Directory, 1918–19. After the collapse of the Ukrainian People’s Republic (UNR), Vynnychenko left the country and resided briefly in Semmering, Budapest, Lienz, Vienna, and Prague. In the Czech capital of Prague<br>

  Author(s) DANIELSON JANET HENSHAW<br>
  Abstract: The only undeniable information one can have access to is that they were living people, and now they are dead. Apart from this information, there is an accumulation of discursive constructions in which the deaths of people are used in media images and political discourses in order to endorse a given logic or strategy in the battle for recognition and power. However, the statement of passage from life to death is more than a referential base. It is a way of reinstating an ethic of recognizing the Other. It traces a path towards self-reflection that demands new and different solutions.<br>

  Abstract: In an incisive and rarely quoted article, Walter Benjamin recounts this legendary story, an ancient tale explaining how to become rich, to introduce his thesis that modernity brought about a loss of experience. As it is described in this brief excerpt, experience assumes a tradition that is shared and taken up in the spoken word passed on from generation to generation. With modernity, Benjamin relates, the knowledge this old man wants to leave to his children before his death is radically transformed by the use of technology.

  Abstract: The May events took France’s vaunted caste of intellectual mandarins entirely by surprise. As we have seen, the theoretical inspiration for the revolt did not come from the intellectual elite—France’s so-called Master Thinkers—but from the margins: left-wing groupuscules like the Arguments group, the Situationist International, and Socialism or Barbarism. For French intellectuals, the May revolt was a lesson in humility. To their surprise, and perhaps for the first time, they found themselves in the peculiar position of followers rather than leaders. As such, May sounded the death knell for the prophetic intellectual: the thinker who possesses privileged access<br>

The attacks killed 2,996 people and spawned a global “War on Terror” in Iraq and Afghanistan. Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the 9/11 attacks; U.S. forces pursued its leader, Osama bin Laden, for more than nine years and ultimately killed him in a raid on his Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound on May 2, 2011. Following his death, soldiers removed bin Laden’s body and transferred it to the U.S.S.

  Abstract: The Hastings Center coordinated teams of physicians, nurses, public health experts, philosophers, theologians, politicians, health care administrators, social workers, and lawyers in fourteen countries to explore these issues. In this volume, they articulate four basic goals of medicine - prevention of disease, relief of suffering, care of the ill, and avoidance of premature death - and examine them in light of the cultural, political, and economic pressures under which medicine functions. In reporting these findings, the contributors touch on a wide range of diverse issues such as genetic technology, Chinese medicine, care of the elderly, and prevention and public health.<br>

  Abstract: Sensitive language, remembrance photography, and mementos have become integrated into stillbirth care practices in North American health care institutions for parents and families who have experienced the death of an infant. While representations reflect how families, caregivers, and society understand stillbirth, they also help shape our relationship with birth, death, and both as they occur together. From both subjective and objective points of view, this chapter will explore how words, images, and artifacts come to represent multiple meanings of stillbirth in a way that can both challenge and contribute to the silence, stigma, and emancipation of bereaved parents from ambiguity<br>

  Abstract: The real question for homiletics in our increasingly postmodern, post-Christian contexts is not how are we going to prevent preaching from dying, but how are we going to help it die a good death. Preaching was not made to live. At most, preaching is a witness, a sign, a crimson X marking a demolition site. The church has developed sophisticated technologies in modernity to give preaching the semblance of life, belying the truth: preaching was born under a death sentence. It was born to die. Only when preaching embraces its own death is it able to truly live.<br>

Even against the “guilty,” violence involves an idolatrous and preemptive exploit of the divine prerogative. This is more than merely “God on our side.” Whether it is in the death penalty or war, the exercise of official violence generally presumes to know or to execute (which is to say, usurp) the judgment of God who alone holds the power of life and death.<br>

  Abstract: What do Stéphane Mallarmé, Antonin Artaud, Meret Oppenheim, Asger Jorn, Yoko Ono, Tom Phillips and Martin Arnold have in common? Whereas a wealth of critics have diagnosed contemporary art’s preoccupations with madness, depression and self-abuse as well as its tendency to cultivate an (anti-)aesthetics of the negative, the excremental and the abject (say, from the Vienna Action Group to Serrano, McCarthy or Delvoye), much less attention has been paid to how modern and contemporary artists and public have thrived on the destruction, disfiguration and obliteration of work by the artists and/or by that of others. From Artaud’s «terminal» notebooks to the recent upsurge in «erasure poetics», the history of «undoing» art deserves to be recounted in a positive mode and rescued from popular narratives of the decline and death of the avant-garde.<br>

  Abstract: In the preceding chapter we began our discussion of the last stanza of Eugene Onegin with Nabokov’s search for the source of Pushkin’s socalled Saadi line, “Some are no more, others are distant” (Inykh uzh net, a te daleche), and begin this one with a question: Why did Nabokov pass over specific allusions to Goethe’s “Dedication” (
                  Zueignung) to Faust and to Zhukovsky’s “Imitation of Goethe”? Nabokov had composed a verse translation of Goethe’s poem into Russian in 1923. He published that poem in 1932 on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Goethe’s death.² He was thoroughly familiar with Zhukovsky’s<br>

  Author(s) Davydov Sergei<br>
  Abstract: “Death,” writes Joseph Brodsky in his 1982 essay on Akhmatova, “is a good litmus test for a poet’s ethics. The ‘in memoriam’ genre is frequently used to exercise self-pity or for metaphysical trips that denote the subconscious superiority of survivor over victim, of majority (of the alive) over minority (of the dead). Akhmatova [in her poetic cycle
                  Requiem] would have none of that.”² This statement, as self-regarding as it is self-effacing, is itself a kind of litmus test for the author’s own ethics and aesthetics. Versions of it reappear at strategic moments in Brodsky’s important essays on Tsvetaeva and on<br>

  Abstract: In his 1937 French essay for the
                  Nouvelle Revue française, “Pouchkine, ou le vrai et le vraisemblable” (“Pushkin, or the Real and the Plausible”),³ Nabokov claimed that the truth of another’s life is inaccessible because thought inevitably distorts whatever it tries to encompass. However, the intuitions of a fictionalized biography motivated by love for its subject might convey a “plausible” life bearing a mysterious affinity for “the poet’s work, if not the poet himself.”⁴ This relatively early statement on this subject by Nabokov, made during centennial celebrations of Aleksandr Pushkin’s death, becomes poignant in light of Nabokov’s novel Pale Fire<br>

  Book Title: The Cinema of the Soviet Thaw-Space, Materiality, Movement<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oukaderova Lida<br>
  Abstract: Following Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, the Soviet Union experienced a dramatic resurgence in cinematic production. The period of the Soviet Thaw became known for its relative political and cultural liberalization; its films, formally innovative and socially engaged, were swept to the center of international cinematic discourse. In The Cinema of the Soviet Thaw, Lida Oukaderova provides an in-depth analysis of several Soviet films made between 1958 and 1967 to argue for the centrality of space-as both filmic trope and social concern-to Thaw-era cinema. Opening with a discussion of the USSR's little-examined late-fifties embrace of panoramic cinema, the book pursues close readings of films by Mikhail Kalatozov, Georgii Danelia, Larisa Shepitko and Kira Muratova, among others. It demonstrates that these directors' works were motivated by an urge to interrogate and reanimate spatial experience, and through this project to probe critical issues of ideology, social progress, and subjectivity within post-Stalinist culture.<br>

  Abstract: The cinematic scrutiny of space in Soviet culture of the 1950s and 1960s was rooted in an urgency to find new forms of social engagement. It was also propelled by a need to redefine the role of cinema in the wake of Stalin’s death. Rethinking the language of cinema, Soviet filmmakers began to emphasize the production of the environment as a social and filmic problem, creating spatial experiences within theatrical walls that differed significantly from those of established socialist practices. These filmmakers reorganized the spaces of familiar cities, landscapes, and public and private interiors, opening them up to dialogical interactions<br>

After a phase of relative geographic concentration, Hellenism spreads completely throughout the ancient world and makes contact with other civilizations.

Subjectivity turned to stone has also been linked (most notably in the wake of Benjamin’s reflections on Baudelaire) to another distinction—that between symbol and allegory in the aesthetics of poetic representation. In Baudelaire the petrified order of things signifies the death of the “symbol,” understood as the quasi-animistic, “living,” and embodying force of analogy and

  Book Title: Christianity in Evolution-An Exploration<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): MAHONEY JACK<br>
  Abstract: Evolution has provided a new understanding of reality, with revolutionary consequences for Christianity. In an evolutionary perspective the incarnation involved God entering the evolving human species to help it imitate the trinitarian altruism in whose image it was created and counter its tendency to self-absorption. Primarily, however, the evolutionary achievement of Jesus was to confront and overcome death in an act of cosmic significance, ushering humanity into the culminating stage of its evolutionary destiny, the full sharing of God's inner life. Previously such doctrines as original sin, the fall, sacrifice, and atonement stemmed from viewing death as the penalty for sin and are shown not only to have serious difficulties in themselves, but also to emerge from a Jewish culture preoccupied with sin and sacrifice that could not otherwise account for death. The death of Jesus on the cross is now seen as saving humanity, not from sin, but from individual extinction and meaninglessness. Death is now seen as a normal process that affect all living things and the religious doctrines connected with explaining it in humans are no longer required or justified. Similar evolutionary implications are explored affecting other subjects of Christian belief, including the Church, the Eucharist, priesthood, and moral behavior.<br>

  Book Title: Troubling Natural Categories-Engaging the Medical Anthropology of Margaret Lock<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KIELMANN KARINA<br>
  Abstract: Where do our conventional understandings of health, illness, and the body stem from? What makes them authoritative? How are the boundaries set around these areas of life unsettled in the changing historical and political contexts of science, technology, and health care delivery? These questions are at the heart of Troubling Natural Categories, a collection of essays honouring the tradition of Margaret Lock, one of the preeminent medical anthropologists of our time. Throughout her career, Lock has investigated how medicine sets boundaries around what is deemed "normal" and "natural," and how, in turn, these ideas shape our technical and moral understandings of life, sickness, and death. In this book, nine established medical anthropologists - all former students of Lock - critically engage with her work, offering ethnographic and historical analyses that problematize taken-for-granted constructs in health and medicine in a range of global settings. The essays elaborate cutting-edge themes within medical anthropology, including the often disturbing, inherently political nature of biomedicine and biotechnology, the medicalization of mental health processes, and the formation of uniquely "local biologies" through the convergence of bodily experience, scientific discourse, and new technologies of care. Troubling Natural Categories not only affirms Margaret Lock's place at the forefront of scholarship but, with these essays, carves out new intellectual directions in the medical social sciences. Contributors include Sean Brotherton, Vinh-Kim Nguyen, Junko Kitanaka, Stephanie Lloyd, Dominique Behague, and Annette Leibing.<br>

  Abstract: Hans W. Frei’s projected history of Christology in the modern period was cut short by his death on 12 September 1988. It was to be a major project for which he had been preparing through most of his academic career, and those who knew him and his scholarship looked forward to it with high anticipation.

  Abstract: The literary and philosophical traditions of many cultures reveal that the urge for revenge is an ancient, deep-rooted human need that has only tentatively been transferred to central authority in the form of state-sponsored retribution. If that need for revenge is not acknowledged by being in some way incorporated into formal systems of justice, as are the Furies by Athena in the 
                  Oresteia, it reemerges as private vengeance, as it does with Paulina in Death and the Maiden. It has the potentiality of “dripping poison over all the land,” as Athena fears the unsatisfied Furies will do in the Oresteia.<br>

For this project, I will draw on the elective affinity between detective fiction and psychoanalysis, which is based—at least partly—on the fact that, like the criminal case, the psychoanalytic case is a knotty problem with death at its center.

She has written wonderfully about the great mysteries of time and death, and those imaginings that seem to cancel time and death: eternity and immortality.<br>

As Herskovitz notes, senility is characterized as “monstrosity” by the lay media with “clichéd metaphors and representations in which Alzheimer’s is characteristically drawn in colourfully dramatic terms that paint vividly disturbing images” (1995, 152–153).

Most of us are born into families that provide a child care not only to survive, but also to thrive. Family thus serves as the space that protects life. However, in many instances today, the family has unfortunately become the space in which human life is prevented from flourishing.<br>

  Abstract: In the human and social sciences, the modern academic study of memory is generally acknowledged to have been initiated by the sociologist Maurice Halbwachs (1925; 1992). Virtually effaced from scholarly consciousness, he received academic acceptance only decades following his death in Buchenwald. His omnipresence in current memory studies owes much to the work of Jan Assmann, himself the author of a classic work on memory theory. In part dependent on Halbwachs and in part quite separately, memory has recently emerged as a pivotal concept in cultural studies and as a principal topic of research in the humanities and social sciences.<br>

  Book Title: Great Fool-Zen Master Ryokan--Poems, Letters, and Other Writings<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): HASKEL PETER<br>
  Abstract: Taigu Ryokan (1759-1831) remains one of the most popular figures in Japanese Buddhist history. Despite his religious and artistic sophistication, Ryokan referred to himself as "Great Fool" and refused to place himself within the cultural elite of his age. In contrast to the typical Zen master of his time, who presided over a large monastery, trained students, and produced recondite religious treatises, Ryokan followed a life of mendicancy in the countryside. Instead of delivering sermons, he expressed himself through kanshi (poems composed in classical Chinese) and waka and could typically be found playing with the village children in the course of his daily rounds of begging. Great Fool is the first study in a Western language to offer a comprehensive picture of the legendary poet-monk and his oeuvre. It includes not only an extensive collection of the master's kanshi, topically arranged to facilitate an appreciation of Ryokan's colorful world, but selections of his waka, essays, and letters. The volume also presents for the first time in English the Ryokan zenji kiwa (Curious Accounts of the Zen Master Ryokan), a firsthand source composed by a former student less than sixteen years after Ryokan's death. Although it lacks chronological order, the Curious Account is invaluable for showing how Ryokan was understood and remembered by his contemporaries. It consists of colorful anecdotes and episodes, sketches from Ryokan's everyday life.<br>

Endowing the ghost with a voice capable of expressing subjective emotion, primarily through the vehicle of lyric poetry, opened a window onto the unknowable: what would it feel like to be dead, to be on the other side? Accordingly, these ghost stories represent death as an interior state of exile in which suffering and longing are intensified rather than annihilated.

  Abstract: The third facet of religious identity is assumption in the sense of being received or accepted, what we mean when we refer to the assumption of the Virgin. While the need or desire for acceptance or inclusion may seem to signal weakness or low self-confidence, I think of it as a sign of health and as part of daily life. Even more, however, it is part of religious belief and behavior. Indeed, the religious desire for inclusion or acceptance, among other things, accounts, it seems to me, for the expectation of a positive outcome beyond death, which can arise less<br>

  Book Title: Doing Justice to Mercy-Religion, Law, and Criminal Justice<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): Jung Kevin<br>
  Abstract: Authored by legal practitioners, activists, and theorists in addition to theologians and ethicists, the essays collected here are informed by timeless principles, and yet they could not be timelier. The trend in sentencing moves toward an increased severity, and the number of incarcerated people in the United States is at an all-time high. In the half-decade since 9/11, moreover, homeland security has established itself as a permanent fixture in our lives. In this atmosphere, the current volume seeks initially to clarify how justice and mercy intertwine in relation to a number of issues, such as rehabilitation, the death penalty, domestic violence, and war crimes. Exploring the legal, philosophical, and theological grounds for mercy in our courts, the discussion then moves to the practical ways in which mercy may be implemented.<br>

The book argued that U.S. practices of policing, imprisonment, and the death penalty form a system that disseminates terror among poor communities, and further, that this system often functions to reinforce exploitative patterns of political, economic, and social power. This terrorizing function, and its importance to U.S. public order, is hidden, for many people, behind the claims of moral legitimacy that police and other criminal justice officials<br>

When one of the major Stoic thinkers of the school’s middle period, Panaetius, befriended Scipio the younger at Rome, the ideas of the Stoics, especially their ethics, started to be tailored to meet the needs of statesmen and soldiers and so assumed an important place in the minds of the emerging elite of what was to become the largest empire yet seen.

  Abstract: As I hope has been made clear in chapter one, attempts at solving the problem of social order all turn ultimately on one’s view of what constitutes (or does not) the individual social actor. Rational and social choice theories—like their economistic prototype—all hark back to a more or less Hobbesian view of the individual as a self-contained actor who is director of his or her own passions and interests, chief among which is, for Hobbes, the fear of death and the corresponding right to flee its approach.<br>

  Book Title: Charred Lullabies-Chapters in an Anthropography of Violence<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Daniel E. Valentine<br>
  Abstract: How does an ethnographer write about violence? How can he make sense of violent acts, for himself and for his readers, without compromising its sheer excess and its meaning-defying core? How can he remain a scholarly observer when the country of his birth is engulfed by terror? These are some of the questions that engage Valentine Daniel in this exploration of life and death in contemporary Sri Lanka. In 1983 Daniel "walked into the ashes and mortal residue" of the violence that had occurred in his homeland. His planned project--the study of women's folk songs as ethnohistory--was immediately displaced by the responsibility that he felt had been given to him, by surviving family members and friends of victims, to recount beyond Sri Lanka what he had seen and heard there. Trained to do fieldwork by staying in one place and educated to look for coherence and meaning in human behavior, what does an anthropologist do when he is forced by circumstances to keep moving, searching for reasons he never finds? How does he write an ethnography (or an anthropography, to use the author's term) without transforming it into a pornography of violence? In avoiding fattening the anthropography into prurience, how does he avoid flattening it with theory? The ways in which Daniel grapples with these questions, and their answers, instill this groundbreaking book with a rare sense of passion, purpose, and intellect.<br>

  Book Title: Russian Experimental Fiction-Resisting Ideology after Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clowes Edith W.<br>
  Abstract: In the three decades following Stalin's death, major underground Russian writers have subverted Soviet ideology by using parody to draw attention to its basis in utopian thought. Referring to utopian writing as diverse as Defoe's
         Robinson Crusoe, Dostoevsky'sNotes from Underground, and Orwell'sAnimal Farm, they have tested notions of truth, reality, and representation. They have gone beyond their precursors by experimenting with the tensions between ludic and didactic art. Edith Clowes explores these "meta-utopian" narratives, which address a wide range of attitudes toward utopia, to expose the challenge that literary play poses to dogmatism and to elucidate the sense of renewal it can bring to social imagination. Using both structural analysis and reception theory, she introduces readers outside Russia to a fascinating body of literature that includes Aleksandr Zinoviev'sThe Yawning Heights, Abram Terts'sLiubimov, Vladimir Voinovich'sMoscow 2042, and Liudmila Petrushevskaia's "The New Robinsons.".<br>

Furthermore, unlike most existentialists, she is not concerned with death or anxiety, and she focuses on the “public,” as opposed to individuals outside of their relations with others.<br>

Further reflections on the spaces of literature, cinema, and architecture include an interview with French writer and film maker Alain Robbe-Grillet and articles by Dagmar Motycka Weston on the surrealist city, Tracey Eve Winton on the museum as a paradigmatic modern building, and Terrance Galvin on spiritual space in the works of Jean Cocteau. Jean-Pierre Chupin and Bram Ratner explore historical themes in their essays on French Renaissance architect Philibert de l'Orme and the Jewish myth of the Golem. Gregory Caicco addresses ethical questions in his essay on the Greek agora and the death of Socrates, as does Lily Chi in her meditation on the critical issue of use in architectural works. A concern with architectural representation and generative strategies for the making of architecture is present throughout, especially in the essay by Joanna Merwood on the provocative House by British artist Rachel Whiteread.<br>

  Abstract: SACRIFICE IS THE OLDEST FORM of religious action.¹ If a person wished to draw near to the gods, as the priest Chryses did with Apollo or as Hektor and Odysseus did with Zeus, he could do so only after he had “burnt many thigh-pieces of bulls” (
                  Il. T.40, 22.170;Od. I.66). Ancient piety rested on a foundation of killing, death, and eating. The victim’s end coincided with a ritual scream at a point, between the knife and the altar, where the community and the Awesome were gathered.² By going through this “irreversible act,” life was affirmed through direct confrontation with<br>

  Abstract: Let us recall that in the mid-1980s, with the echoes of the year 1968 still audible and following the example of the literary and architectonic aesthetics that were saying their good-byes to modernity – J.-F. Lyotard announced the advent of the
                  postmodern condition.¹ However, the most disquieting thing was, without a doubt, the tempestuous news that, in a fashion similar to the announcement of the death of God by Nietzsche, was contained in his report on the societies of telematic capitalism: the news of the end of the Western metaphysical metanarratives, demythologized as tall tales written by – and, moreover, mimicking W.<br>

  Abstract: Augustine’s preaching does not merely make frequent reference to death and resurrection: it is saturated with a thorough-going emphasis upon the end of mortal life. A case study upon this theme of death and resurrection permits us to examine how Augustine appealed to interiority and temporality when applying Scripture to this important concern. It is our intention in this chapter to expose the methods Augustine used in a way which demonstrates empathy for his approach. Just as we have selected the topic of death and resurrection because it is so prevalent in his preaching, so the aspects of that preaching<br>

The memory of major events tends to crystallize, to acquire a fixed frame of interpretations and analysis, suggested by personal feelings and political beliefs. Tragedies, especially when highly shocking, tend to turn into “legendary” narratives, and the more important they are, the harder it becomes to examine them critically.

  Book Title: Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Feminist as Thinker-A Reader in Documents and Essays<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Smith Richard Cándida<br>
  Abstract: More than one hundred years after her death, Elizabeth Cady Stanton still stands - along with her close friend Susan B. Anthony - as the major icon of the struggle for women's suffrage. In spite of this celebrity, Stanton's intellectual contributions have been largely overshadowed by the focus on her political activities, and she is yet to be recognized as one of the major thinkers of the nineteenth century.Here, at long last, is a single volume exploring and presenting Stanton's thoughtful, original, lifelong inquiries into the nature, origins, range, and solutions of women's subordination. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Feminist as Thinker reintroduces, contextualizes, and critiques Stanton's numerous contributions to modern thought. It juxtaposes a selection of Stanton's own writings, many of them previously unavailable, with eight original essays by prominent historians and social theorists interrogating Stanton's views on such pressing social issues as religion, marriage, race, the self and community, and her place among leading nineteenth century feminist thinkers. Taken together, these essays and documents reveal the different facets, enduring insights, and fascinating contradictions of the work of one of the great thinkers of the feminist tradition.Contributors: Barbara Caine, Richard Candida Smith, Ellen Carol DuBois, Ann D.

  Abstract: This chapter follows on from the last by offering an account of the differences between Wordsworth and Coleridge’s thinking on poetic diction and measure. Wordsworth’s well-known objections to poetic diction were made just before the death of Cowper, whose work Wordsworth read and admired. Wordsworth understands poetic diction as a strictly delimited and historically sanctioned set of words found frequently in poetry and infrequently in prose, and therefore an artificial deformation of language, like metre and rhyme. Unlike those deformations, however, poetic diction is unpredictable:<br>

  Abstract: According to Iain Sinclair, writing in 1999, the millennium had no future because it had already happened. The millennial moment in Britain and beyond, was not the dawn of the year 2000 but the death of the Princess of Wales – discussed in Chapter 5. Sinclair is here working with the idea of affect and with an emotional moment; one that expresses the finality, transition and mourning that might be associated with an endpoint, even though the media mood for the millennial shift itself was unremittingly celebratory. Yet Sinclair’s view that ‘the millennium’ happened somewhere or sometime else points up many<br>

  Abstract: In Chapter 3, we explored the relationship between 
                     Existenz, death and eternity. We also interpreted what it means for one’s Existenz to be deathless from two different perspectives: the Mystical and the Existential Interpretations. We now turn to the final part of the analysis. In this chapter, I draw on the traditional understanding of eternity as non-temporal duration. I then take a fresh look at Jaspers’ concept of the Augenblick experience within the framework of the Existential Interpretative model. Finally, Jaspers’ assertions about the eternal aspect of one’s Existenz is reassessed.<br>

  Book Title: Death-Drive-Freudian Hauntings in Literature and Art<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Smith Robert Rowland<br>
  Abstract: Robert Rowland Smith takes Freud's work on the death-drive and compares it with other philosophies of death - Pascal, Heidegger and Derrida in particular. He also applies it in a new way to literature and art - to Shakespeare, Rothko and Katharina Fritsch, among others. He asks whether artworks are dead or alive, if artistic creativity isn't actually a form of destruction, and whether our ability to be seduced by fine words means we don't put our selves at risk of death. In doing so, he proposes a new theory of aesthetics in which artworks and literary texts have a death-drive of their own, not least by their defining ability to turn away from all that is real, and where the effects of the death-drive mean that we are constantly living in imaginary, rhetorical or 'artistic' worlds. The book also provides a valuable introduction to the rich tradition of work on the death-drive since Freud.Key Features* Includes a general introduction to the death-drive* Presents an original theory of aesthetics* Analyses both theoretical and clinical psychoanalysis* Offers in-depth treatment of Freud* Provides an overview of philosophies of death<br>

  Author(s): McLoughlin Kate<br>
  Abstract: Leading international scholars explore the party's significance to ModernismHave you ever been struck by the number of parties in Modernist literature? Mrs. Ramsay drowns in anguish at the dinner-party she gives in Woolf's To The Lighthouse. Death is a guest in Katherine Mansfield's 'The Garden Party'. Politics sour the evening party in Joyce's 'The Dead'. Have you also noticed the role played by parties in the public intellectual culture of Modernism? A party held in London by Amy Lowell on 17 July 1914, attended by Ezra Pound, Ford Madox Ford, H.D. and Richard Aldington, degenerated into an argument over the nature of Imagism. On 18 May 1922, Proust, Joyce, Picasso, Stravinsky and Diaghilev met at a post-ballet party at Paris's Hotel Majestic: an unrepeatable encounter between Modernism's leading figures. In The Modernist Party, internationally distinguished scholars explore the party both as a literary device and as a social setting in which the movement's creative values were developed.Key Features:* Develops the concept of space, currently of central concern to Modernist scholars* Explores the tensions between Modernism as an aesthetics of intensity and Modernism as a movement of the everyday* Adds a new and vital area of research to investigations of Modernism as the product of intellectual and social networksKeywords: Modernism, Literature, Party, Social Network, Collaboration, Space<br>

  Abstract: The international "quest of the historical Jesus" has been amply documented within the context of nineteenth-century biblical scholarship. Yet there has been no broad-based comparative study devoted to the depiction of Jesus in prose fiction over the same time period.
         The Real and the Sacredoffers a comprehensive survey of this body of fiction, examining both the range of its Christ types and the varying formal means through which these types were represented. The nineteenth century-despite forecasts of God's death at the time-not only revived older Christ types but also witnessed the rise of new ones, includingle Christ proletaire, the Mormon Christ, the Buddhist Christ, and the Tolstoyan Christ. Novelists played a crucial role in the invention and popularization of the historical Jesus in particular, one of modernity's major figures.<br>

  Book Title: “The Useless Mouths” and Other Literary Writings-  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Le Bon de Beauvoir Sylvie<br>
  Abstract: "The Useless Mouths" and Other Literary Writings brings to English-language readers literary writings--several previously unknown--by Simone de Beauvoir. Culled from sources including various American university collections, the works span decades of Beauvoir's career. Ranging from dramatic works and literary theory to radio broadcasts, they collectively reveal fresh insights into Beauvoir's writing process, personal life, and the honing of her philosophy. The volume begins with a new translation of the 1945 play The Useless Mouths, written in Paris during the Nazi occupation. Other pieces were discovered after Beauvoir's death in 1986, such as the 1965 short novel "Misunderstanding in Moscow," involving an elderly French couple who confront their fears of aging. Two additional previously unknown texts include the fragmentary "Notes for a Novel," which contains the seed of what she later would call "the problem of the Other," and a lecture on postwar French theater titled Existentialist Theater. The collection notably includes the eagerly awaited translation of Beauvoir's contribution to a 1965 debate among Jean-Paul Sartre and other French writers and intellectuals, "What Can Literature Do?" Prefaces to well-known works such as Bluebeard and Other Fairy Tales, La Bâtarde, and James Joyce in Paris: His Final Years are also available in English for the first time, alongside essays and other short articles. A landmark contribution to Beauvoir studies and French literary studies, the volume includes informative and engaging introductory essays by prominent and rising scholars.

                  Our Mutual Friend) to find a remarkable allusion to life between life and death, when a sense of life pervades and overwhelms any sense of good or bad.¹ Before or after, it would seem, a surrounding, an environment, objectivity or subjectivity, internality or externality, would take over and make it a social presence (with its “goodness” and “badness”). But, in between, it is a pure sense of life, a belief, a common, which I have suggested as a belief morphed into knowledge, that overwhelms and blurs all else. My explorations here have started<br>

  Abstract: “The artist may be known rather by what he omits,” as Eisenstein quotes Schiller in a diary entry dated June 20, 1947, almost exactly six months before his death in February 1948.¹ The quotation might strike us as incongruous, coming from the master who was never shy to voice his opinion or illustrate his points—in both his directorial work and his theoretical commentaries. Yet at this late stage of his career, Eisenstein becomes preoccupied with the issue of what he termed “great nothingness”—the opposite, the emptiness, the nonidentity against which we can define what is present and given.<br>

  Abstract: In 1941, the United States Navy commissioned the husband-and-wife team of Charles and Ray Eames to design a lightweight splint to get wounded soldiers safely out of the battlefield. Metal splints of the period were not secure enough to hold the leg still, causing unnecessary death from gangrene, shock, blood loss, and so on. The Eameses had been working on techniques to mold and bend plywood, and they came up with a splint design conforming to the body without a lot of extra joints and parts. The wood design became a secure, lightweight, nestable solution, and the Eameses produced more<br>

  Book Title: The Thought of Death and the Memory of War-  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
  Abstract: War lays bare death and our relation to it. And in the wars-or more precisely the memories of war-of the twentieth century, images of the deaths of countless faceless or nameless others eclipse the singularity of each victim's death as well as the end of the world as such that each death signifies. Marc Crépon's The Thought of Death and the Memory of War is a call to resist such images in which death is no longer actual death since it happens to anonymous others, and to seek instead a world in which mourning the other whose mortality we always already share points us toward a cosmopolitics. Crépon pursues this path toward a cosmopolitics of mourning through readings of works by Freud, Heidegger, Sartre, Patocka, Levinas, Derrida, and Ricœur, and others. The movement among these writers, Crépon shows, marks a way through-and against-twentieth-century interpretation to argue that no war, genocide, or neglect of people is possible without suspending how one relates to the death of another human being. A history of a critical strain in contemporary thought, this book is, as Rodolphe Gasché says in the Foreword, "a profound meditation on what constitutes evil and a rigorous and illuminating reflection on death, community, and world." The translation of this work received financial support from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<br>

Just as artists, scientists, and philosophers of the twentieth century tried to integrate time into thought, they also attempted to affirm the inescapability of finitude.

In a world experienced by many to be without a natural design to which they might conform, the function of boundaries becomes highly ambiguous. Boundaries form indispensable protections against violation and violence; but the divisions they sustain also carry cruelty and violence.

  Book Title: The Disclosure of Politics-Struggles Over the Semantics of Secularization<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lara María Pía<br>
  Abstract: Postmodern political critiques speak of the death of ideology, the end of history, and the postsecular return of religious attitudes, yet radical conservative theorists such as Mark Lilla argue religion and politics are inextricably intertwined. Returning much-needed uncertainty to debates over the political while revitalizing the very terms in which they are defined, María Pía Lara explores the ambiguity of secularization and the theoretical potential of a structural break between politics and religion.<br>

  Book Title: Contemporary Romanian Cinema-The History of an Unexpected Miracle<br>
  Publisher: Wallflower Press<br>
  Author(s): NASTA DOMINIQUE<br>
  Abstract: Over the last decade, audiences worldwide have become familiar with highly acclaimed films from the Romanian New Wave such as
      4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days(2007),The Death of Mr. Lazarescu(2005), and12:08 East of Bucharest(2006). However, the hundred or so years of Romanian cinema leading to these accomplishments have been largely overlooked. This book is the first to provide in-depth analyses of essential works ranging from the silent period to contemporary productions. In addition to relevant information on historical and cultural factors influencing contemporary Romanian cinema, this volume covers the careers of daring filmmakers who approached various genres despite fifty years of Communist censorship. An important chapter is dedicated to Lucian Pintilie, whose seminal work,Reconstruction(1969), strongly inspired Romania's 21st-century innovative output. The book's second half closely examines both the 'minimalist' trend (Cristian Mungiu, Cristi Puiu, Corneliu Porumboiu, Radu Muntean) and the younger, but no less inspired, directors who have chosen to go beyond the 1989 revolution paradigm by dealing with the complexities of contemporary Romania.<br>

  Book Title: The Death of Philosophy-Reference and Self-reference in Contemporary Thought<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): LYNCH RICHARD A.<br>
  Abstract: Thomas-Fogiel begins with postphilosophical claims such as scientism, which she reveals to be self-refuting, for they subsume philosophy into the branches of the natural sciences. She discovers similar issues in Rorty's skepticism and strands of continental thought. Revisiting the work of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century philosophers, when the split between analytical and continental philosophy began, Thomas-Fogiel finds both traditions followed the same path-the road of reference-which ultimately led to self-contradiction. This phenomenon, whether valorized or condemned, has been understood as the death of philosophy. Tracing this pattern from Quine to Rorty, from Heidegger to Levinas and Habermas, Thomas-Fogiel reveals the self-contradiction at the core of their claims while also carving an alternative path through self-reference. Trained under the French philosopher Bernard Bourgeois, she remakes philosophy in exciting new ways for the twenty-first century.<br>

Perhaps the best encapsulation of behaviors associated with death, burial, and rebirth comes from the aforementioned Berlin vessel (Figure 31).

  Book Title: The Fate of Earthly Things-Aztec Gods and God-Bodies<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassett Molly H.<br>
  Abstract: Following their first contact in 1519, accounts of Aztecs identifying Spaniards as gods proliferated. But what exactly did the Aztecs mean by a "god" (teotl), and how could human beings become gods or take on godlike properties? This sophisticated, interdisciplinary study analyzes three concepts that are foundational to Aztec religion—teotl (god), teixiptla (localized embodiment of a god), and tlaquimilolli (sacred bundles containing precious objects)—to shed new light on the Aztec understanding of how spiritual beings take on form and agency in the material world. In The Fate of Earthly Things, Molly Bassett draws on ethnographic fieldwork, linguistic analyses, visual culture, and ritual studies to explore what ritual practices such as human sacrifice and the manufacture of deity embodiments (including humans who became gods), material effigies, and sacred bundles meant to the Aztecs. She analyzes the Aztec belief that wearing the flayed skin of a sacrificial victim during a sacred rite could transform a priest into an embodiment of a god or goddess, as well as how figurines and sacred bundles could become localized embodiments of gods. Without arguing for unbroken continuity between the Aztecs and modern speakers of Nahuatl, Bassett also describes contemporary rituals in which indigenous Mexicans who preserve costumbres (traditions) incorporate totiotzin (gods) made from paper into their daily lives. This research allows us to understand a religious imagination that found life in death and believed that deity embodiments became animate through the ritual binding of blood, skin, and bone.<br>

It develops new arguments around issues of cognition, interpretation, and language. Digitization, he writes, is inherent in all forms of "writing," from its early beginnings in clay tablets. As digitization increases in print and now electronic culture, there is a corresponding need to counter the fractioning of digitization with the unitive attempts of hermeneutics, particularly hermeneutics that are modeled on oral rather than written paradigms.<br>

Begun in earnest in 1927, and left unfinished at the time of Warburg's death in 1929, theMnemosyne-Atlasconsisted of sixty-three large wooden panels covered with black cloth. On these panels Warburg carefully, intuitively arranged some thousand black-and-white photographs of classical and Renaissance art objects, as well as of astrological and astronomical images ranging from ancient Babylon to Weimar Germany. Here and there, he also included maps, manuscript pages, and contemporary images taken from newspapers. Trying through these constellations of images to make visible the many polarities that fueled antiquity's afterlife, Warburg envisioned theMnemosyne-Atlasas a vital form of metaphoric thought.<br>

The work is in Latin, as textbooks in all subjects normally had always been in Western Europe from classical times.

  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): KERR LINDSAY G.<br>
  Abstract: Co-Winner of the 2014 Publication Prize awarded by the Association of Hispanists of Great Britain and Ireland Kerr traces the processes and paradoxes at work in the late parodic poetry of Luis de Góngora and Lope de Vega, illuminating the correlations and connections between two poets who have more often than not been presented as enemies.The analysis follows the parallel development of the complex parodic genre through Góngora's late mythological parody, from his 1589 Hero and Leander romance through to his culminating parody, La fábula de Píramo y Tisbe (1618) and Lope de Vega's alter ego Tomé de Burguillos, whose anthology, Rimas humanas y divinas del licenciado Tomé de Burguillos, was published a year before Lope's death, in 1634. Working from the premise that parody provides a Derridean supplément to exhausted, dominant genres (e.g. pastoral, lyric, epic), this study asks: what do these texts achieve by their supplementarity, and how do they achieve it?, and, the overarching question, why do these erudite poets turn to parody in an age of decline?

An all-white grand jury had indicted him, and this all-white petit jury convicted Hale, an “illiterate, destitute” nineteen-year-old, of the murder of a forty-year-old white man, W. R. Toon. Hale had admitted he confronted—but did not kill—a white man to protect black women. Hale<br>

  Book Title: Medieval Hispanic Studies in Memory of Alan Deyermond-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Weiss Julian<br>
  Abstract: Professor Alan Deyermond was one of the leading British Hispanists of the last fifty years, whose work had a formative influence on medieval Hispanic studies around the world. There were several tributes to his work published during his lifetime, and it is fitting that this one, in his memory, should be produced by Tamesis, the publishing house that he helped establish and to which he contributed so much as author and editor right up to his death. The contributors to this volume are some of Professor Deyermond's former colleagues, doctoral students, and members of the Medieval Hispanic Research Seminar. Given Professor Deyermond's breadth of expertise, the span of the essays is appropriately wide, ranging chronologically from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century, and covering lyric, hagiography, clerical verse narrative, frontier balladry, historical and codicological studies. The volume opens with a personal memoir of her father by Ruth Deyermond, and closes with the draft of an unpublished essay found amongst Professor Deyermond's papers, and edited by his literary executor, Professor David Hook. Andrew M. Beresford is Reader and Head of Hispanic Studies at the University of Durham. Louise M. Haywood is Reader in Medieval Iberian Literary and Cultural Studies, and Head of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Cambridge. Julian Weiss is Professor of Medieval & Early Modern Hispanic Studies at King's College London.<br>

  Abstract: As early as 1834, two years after Goethe’s death, the apparent resemblance of his Faust figure with Paracelsus led John S. Blackie, in the preface to his rendition of Goethe’s tragedy into English verse, to the following statement: “There is much in all that is told of him [Faust] that recalls to our mind the biography of Paracelsus.”¹ By the end of the nineteenth century, this assumption acquired a degree of certainty for Goethe scholars. In 1870, Gustav von Loeper² remarked that Goethe’s Faust is a physician and a physician’s son, as is Paracelsus. Both figures detested the medicine of<br>

Thousands of ordinary people experienced profound changes, their life experiences and personal stories etched into their physical remains and threaded through the trappings of their death. The pressures of modern development mean that many recent burials are disinterred from their ‘final’ resting place and reburied elsewhere. The research value of post-medieval burial assemblages was recognised only relatively recently,² and this has undoubtedly influenced the strategic approach to planning and excavation.

Common sense alone suggests that in denying a critical need to relate the individual subject (whether author or reader) to a larger cultural, historically specific field of operations, Barthes’ theory of textual construction went too far.

In his writings, Adorno often tries to draw a distinction between Berg and Wagner, but his explanations, while illuminating, only contribute to the problem. In his reevaluation of Berg, written about twenty years after Berg’s death, Adorno recognizes the “autonomy” of Berg’s works but points to a peculiar sort of metaphysics in which Berg’s music would emerge from underneath the music drama. In other words, Adorno draws a distinction<br>

  Book Title: Love and Death in Goethe-`One and Double'<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Dye Ellis<br>
  Abstract: Goethe, in association with his younger Romantic compatriots the Schlegels, Novalis, Fichte, and Schelling, struggled with the subject-object dichotomy, and tried to bridge the gap between self and other, consciousness and nature. His theory and practice prefigured the Romantics' determination to display and interrogate the linguistic and cultural structures informing their own thinking and modes of representation--what Goethe calls one's "Vorstellungsart." His work exploits, subverts, and supplants inherited conventions and signs, demonstrating with virtuosic irony that literature is a system of texts, pre-texts, and pre-established but dynamic conceptual models. 'Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double"' explores Goethe's use, in a wide range of his poetry and prose, of the theme of 'Liebestod' (love and death) and related embodiments of the paradox of unity in duality. Ellis Dye also examines Goethe's use of other themes related to love and death--the 'femme fatale', the 'vagina dentata, Frau Welt', the Lorelei, venereal disease, the 'Lustmord' --and considers issues of selfhood and individuation as well as the possibility that the love-death theme contains an implicit gender bias toward the existential fact of personal separateness. Poems, plays, and novels are dealt with, nevertheless, as works of art, not only as illustrations of an idea or as points of intersection in a system of rhetorical conventions, and are examined for intellectual cohesiveness, elegance, and integrity of design as well as special meanings and effects. ' Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double" ' explores the meaning of the central theme of Romantic poetry in the works of the most important Romantic poet of all. Students of literary culture, both the lay reader and the Goethe specialist, will be enlightened by its approach and find pleasure and instruction in its revelations. Robert Ellis Dye is professor of German at Macalester College.<br>

  Book Title: Bones of Contention-The living archive of Vasil Levski and the making of Bulgaria's national hero<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Todorova Maria<br>
  Abstract: This book is about documenting and analyzing the living archive around the figure of Vasil Levski (1837–1873), arguably the major and only uncontested hero of the Bulgarian national pantheon. The processes described, although with a chronological depth of almost two centuries, are still very much in the making, and the living archive expands not only in size but constantly adding surprising new forms. The monograph is a historical study, taking as its narrative focus the life, death and posthumous fate of Levski. By exploring the vicissitudes of his heroicization, glorification, appropriations, reinterpretation, commemoration and, finally, canonization, it seeks to engage in several broad theoretical debates, and provide the basis for subsequent regional comparative research. The analysis of Levski's consecutive and simultaneous appropriations by different social platforms, political parties, secular and religious institutions, ideologies, professional groups, and individuals, demonstrates how boundaries within the framework of the nation are negotiated around accepted national symbols.<br>

Abstract: Although his arguments could be tighter, Steffen makes some novel points. He suggests that crime, as an abuse of freedom, is appropriately punished by limitations on freedom—the greater the crime the greater (longer) the appropriate limitation. He also argues that implementation of the death penalty results in a focus on the criminal’s body, rather than on the person. This objectification, he argues, is inconsistent with the sort of respect for the criminal which is necessary for holding him responsible for his crime.<br>

Author(s): Vidal Fernando<br>
Abstract: What became implausible was not resurrection as such but the resurrection
         of the (same) body. Such a judgment stimulated the proposition of alternatives that deeply altered the landscape of belief. By the end of the eighteenth century, the psychological problem of personal identity had triumphed over the numerical sameness of bodies. Disembodiment thus sustained the doctrines of metempsychosis that, since the nineteenth century, have dominated over traditional Christian eschatology.124Yet, on the margins of this transformation, and independently of other discussions on the persistence of personality after death, debates took place during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries on the relations between the resurrection of the flesh and scientific models and data. A version of the germ theory was proposed in 1888; a century later, it was imaginable that DNA and raw materials could suffice to bring about the resurrection of the body.125<br>

Abstract: Sometimes, members may openly challenge the dominant style, front stage. Remember the woman who kept getting on a high horse at the Buffalo. Similarly, and even more explicitly, ACES member John tried unsuccessfully to challenge the group’s “timid affiliation” style several times. For the participant‐observer, John’s challenge made the mostly taken‐for‐granted group style all the more apparent. John’s favorite means of challenging the group style was to get other members to talk about “capitalism,” in either group meetings or informal get‐togethers. Other members would greet his efforts with awkward silence and a quick switch of topics. These were signs of an inability to continue verbalizing meaning together in a group bonded on the implicit understanding that ideological motivations (a critical stance on capitalism, e.g.) were private matters. At a combined meeting and holiday party, for instance, John launched into an impromptu tirade against Microtech for producing “death for a profit.” Giving an ironic twist to a format intended to make people feel comfortable in groups, John proposed that party goers in Barb’s living room “go around the room and each say what he thinks about capitalism.” Barb broke in to say, “Maybe we should all introduce ourselves.” Once we introduced ourselves, she announced that dinner was ready. When John initiated the topic again in a private conversation by the potluck table, Barb broke in to say it was time to watch a video. An ACES ally from a metropolitan activist group, an experienced activist himself, whispered to John at this point, “You know, capitalism really does stink.” By insisting that the group debate his own ideological stance, John was challenging the group style of allowing leeway for privately held ideological motivations. The silences, frozen expressions, and quick switches of topic that greeted John’s salvos at capitalism strongly suggest that group interaction, and group purpose itself, was threatened by challenges t~<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Several of the essays arein the theological senseapologetic. The first is a selfsituating, at times trenchant criticism of cognitive anthropology. The second is a historical account of psychoanalytic anthropology that is so parochial, so superficial that it hardly merits reading. Juillerat considers neither the critiques of psychoanalytic anthropology nor the research of ethnopsychoanalysts such as Paul Parin in Zurich, Waud Kracke in the United States, or the anthropologically oriented psychoanalysts in India, Japan, and South America. It would be a pity, however, if readers dismissed the book at this point, for the remaining essays are theoretically interesting, ethnographically rich, and at times conceptually disquieting. They include such topics as the nature of the symbol; the relationship between Freuds originary fantasies and LviStrausss basic kinship units (
      atomes de parent); the interaction between individual and collective representations; the conjunction of endopsychic projections of cosmologies and social reality; splitting and metamorphosis in the Yafar conception of death; parallels between the evolutionism in Yafar mythology and in BachofensMutterrecht; the stress on the paternal principle in Freud and the maternal in Jung; a rethinking of Maussian exchange theory that recognizes gifts that impose no obligation; an interpretation of a recent cargo cult that relates the land of plenty to the terror and longing for intrauterine return that is expressed in Yafar myth; and a reinterpretation of Naven as a psychodrama in which the uterine nephewthe eternal herois caught between agnatic law and incestuous ties with the mother. The last chapter consists of theoretical excerpts from JuilleratsLavnement du pre(1995), which, though meant to enrich the reading of Yafar ritual and myth, are difficult to evaluate out of context.<br>

Abstract: Without lingering over other processes of objectification (psychiatry, biology, etc.), let us consider directly the definition of the human being not only as social animal (social living being), but as political object, such as it ratifies and perfects the “mobilization” without remainder of the humanity of man.
         21The political determination of man is not summed up by his sociability, but, at the very least, politics imposes upon that sociability a technological treatment. In particular, through the determination of one's identity (of his name, I.D., passport) according to number: dates (from birth to death), places (residence, work, trips, etc.), health, commercial operations (bank account numbers, credit cards, etc.), local as well as long‐distance communications (sound and visual recordings, electronic addresses, cell phones, etc.), all become numbers, such that the identity thus “digitized” according to limitless parameters erects a comprehensive definition of the citizen. And inevitably this comprehensive definition ends up by authorizing, indeed demanding, the separation of men according to those who satisfy the political conditions of this citizenship and those who are excluded or ought to be (“exclusion,” beginning with the jobless, the homeless, the maladjusted, delinquents, and illegal immigrants, and ending with the mentally ill, or embryos reputedly not yet humanized, or supernumerary, etc.). From the identity card to the list of interdiction, the outcome, while not good, is nonetheless possible, easy, and rapid. Political wisdom consists first in resisting such an outcome. Failing such resistance, there will be no end of ideologies or racisms that produce definitions of man and, through an inverted outcome, proscribe those who do not fit in, before moving on to the arrest, or indeed to the extermination of the submen or nonmen thus identified.22<br>

Issue: jmh.2004.76.issue-3<br>

Author(s): Marino John A.<br>
Abstract: Braudel addressed the critics directly in
            The Mediterranean,2d ed. (1972), 2:1243–44: “The question is frequently put to me, both by historians and philosophers, if we view history from such a distance, what becomes of man, his role in history, his freedom of action?” A classic example is embodied in Braudel’s portrait of Philip II himself. “What degree of freedom was possessed by Philip II, or by Don Juan of Austria as he rode at anchor among his ships, allies, and troops? Each of these so‐called freedoms seems to me to resemble a tiny island, almost a prison.” See the conclusion of Part III, 2:1236 that recounts the death of Philip II on September 13, 1598, based on three secondary sources of the 1920s, not from contemporary accounts of Philip’s “good death.” Braudel’s last poignant paragraph suggests that Philip did not know what he was doing: “[Philip] was not a man of vision: he saw his task as an unending succession of small details. Every one of his annotations is a small precise point, whether an order, a remark, or the correction of a spelling mistake or geographical error. Never do we find general notions or grand strategies under his pen.” The king’s “grand strategy,” however, is exactly what Geoffrey Parker set out to demonstrate inThe Grand Strategy of Philip II(New Haven, Conn., 1998). Braudel may be correct that Philip, as a prince, was not a student of geography. But what Philip did study, architecture, emphasized design. No discipline was more useful to understanding “general notions or grand strategies.” Thus, Braudel’s Part III, as traditional as it is often said to be, appears to get the story and the king wrong because Braudel’s steering assumption, not Philip II, was in control: “Good reasons for us to reflect once more on the distance separating biographical history from the history of structures, and even more from the history of geographical areas” (2:1237).

Abstract: The analogy with political speech, supported by the observation that a community’s official doctrines are the products of controversy, suggests that the ability of these doctrines to define and sustain a sense of identity might be their most basic function. The curious fact that theologically trivial or obscure points often attain tremendous doctrinal importance suggests that doctrines derive their significance more from their effectiveness in defining the identity of a community than from their putative correspondence to metaphysical reality. The life‐and‐death importance attached to the cognitively obscure difference between the Nicene
         homoousiosand the semi‐Arianhomoiousiosexemplifies this idea that doctrinal differences derive much of their original significance from the dynamics of social and political struggle. Mundane political discourse represents the limit case of this phenomenon, allowing us to see its basic features with stark clarity. The political slogan or label has meaning only relationally, its political use having effaced much of the intrinsic cognitive content of its words.39This neutralization of semantic or descriptive meaning allows these words more effectively to take on emotionally charged connotations from the political context and thus to serve as effective means for shaping and directing public sentiment. While the political analogy carries the obvious danger of reductionism if pressed too far, an acknowledgment of the political dimension of theological debate nevertheless sheds light on the way certain theological doctrines are able to hold tremendous religious significance in spite of—or perhaps precisely because of—their informational vacuity.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: The reader will find Bourgeois’s treatment of specific topics useful and insightful, topics such as Martin Heidegger on the relation of limit, death, and the “end of philosophy” (chap. 2) or Ricoeur’s engagement with Lévinas on ethics as the face‐to‐face relation to the other (chap. 8). However, the primary argument of the book as a whole sometimes devolves into a Procrustean bed, cutting away the complexity of Heideggerian and post‐Heideggerian thought to make it fit an overreaching, insufficiently qualified thesis regarding the trajectory of twentieth‐century philosophy. Unfortunately, the reader may find it difficult to disentangle the valuable contributions of the book from the more ambitious but problematic agenda driving it. The thrust of this overarching argument is that, at a pivotal juncture in continental intellectual history, a colossal error in construing Kant’s concept of the “boundary of reason” took hold, preventing a proper understanding of the relation of the enterprise of critique to its grounding in reason and leading (apparently inexorably) to the aporias of “philosophy in the twentieth century” (p. xiv). All the trouble about the closure of meaning in recent continental thought could have been averted, the author argues, if Heidegger and post‐Heideggerian philosophers (e.g., Jacques Derrida, John Caputo, Jean François Lyotard, Emmanuel Lévinas) merely had paid more careful attention to a critical conceptual distinction Kant took pains to make between a “boundary” (
      Grenze) and a “limit” (Schranke) in theProlegomena to Any Future Metaphysics(sec. 57).<br>

Abstract: In order to recognize another's worth bona fide, one has to make an assessment in light of some standard of evaluation, and, in the absence of a genuinely global culture with a horizon or perspective more comprehensive than and inclusive of the perspectives of the individual communities, one cannot help having recourse to one’s parochial point of view and treating it as somehow universally relevant and applicable. The inevitability of a particular perspective in recognition of worth is all the more the case for religious communities that make universalistic and ultimate truth claims, such as the Christian assertion of the centrality and universality of the salvation achieved by God in and through Jesus Christ. For Christian communities their recognition of other ways of life cannot avoid being given—or not given—in reference to the divine will and practice which they believe have been disclosed for all people in Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection.<br>

Author(s): Williams Jay<br>
Abstract: While our study has helped us to map the history of theory in the pages of
      CI, it can also be used to identify new trends, figures whose stock is rising. Among these are Giorgio Agamben, first translated into English in 1991, who has been cited eight times, all in the last four years. And Étienne Balibar and Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, all of whom have been cited ten times, all since 1997. Although Žižek was first cited in 1993, his works have been cited with much more frequency just in the last few years. Will he reach his plateau soon? Other scholars whose works are being cited with greater frequency include figures from newer areas like science studies (Bruno Latour, Ian Hacking) and media theory (Friedrich Kittler). Benjamin was cited thirteen times between 1974 and 1989, and then 134 times since, though this number is so high in part because of a special issue we devoted to his work in 1998. Still, the only other theorist on whom we have done a special issue—Mikhail Bakhtin—generated a total of twenty‐five citations, and he has been cited only four times in the last ten years.19Benjamin might be a case of a figure whose writings are so challenging that it takes time for their ideas to be put to use. Similar difficult theorists who have seen increases are Theodor Adorno (who died in 1969 but whose works become much more cited around the mid‐1990s) and Gilles Deleuze (whose popularity surged several years after his death in 1995).<br>

Author(s): Schweber Simone<br>
Abstract: Maurice Halbwachs’s (
         1992) notions of collective memory can help to conceptualize the processing of history that went on in Mrs. Barrett’s room. To do so, however, it’s worth contextualizing Halbwachs’s own work, as his most famous writing,La memoire collective, was published in 1950, five years after Halbwachs's death at Buchenwald concentration camp. He had been working on the volume when the Nazis invaded the French city of Strasbourg, where he lived. Patrick Hutton suggests that, in light of these circumstances, “one senses … that [Halbwachs’s] thoughts on the subject were still provisional” (1993, 74). Specifically, Hutton critiques Halbwachs’s positivistic notions of history, his passionate loyalty to the claim that history exists outside of collective memory, inaccessible though it may be. Hutton explains, “To Halbwachs’s way of thinking, history considers a past from which living memory has been distilled, one that may be reconstructed from its evidentiary leavings but whose mentality or subjective state of mind cannot be resurrected. As he remarked in a telling simile: ‘History is like a crowded graveyard to which new tombstones are continually being added’” (76). In short, history’s chambers are inaccessible to the living, opposed intrinsically and forever to the needs and dictates of the present.<br>

Abstract: The paradox is that the mausoleum was imposed in 1949 as a public symbol and barely existed as private thought. Today, it is physically excised from the public space but is present as an architectural specter in one's private spatial memory: “Let's meet at the mausoleum!”
         103This will be the case until the generations that have seen it will themselves have passed away, and with them any trace of individual memory of the mausoleum will be demographically cleansed. This should bring at last the private and public closure of the mausoleum of Georgi Dimitrov in Sofia. Koselleck has remarked that “political experiences or messages can only be passed down beyond the death of a particular generation with great effort. To this end, societal institutions are required. In any case, the memorial, the supposed guarantor of sensory transmission beyond death, does not appear to be capable of achieving this task by itself. A conscious adoption of the message is always necessary.”104The demolishers seem to have overestimated the power of the memorial.<br>

Abstract: The third and final chapter of the book carries the title of “Mutual Recognition.” This chapter is profound and original. Many readers will first notice that Ricoeur takes the position of the opposing party from the influential reading in France of the lectures on Hegel by Alexandre Kojève, published in 1947. According to Kojève, what takes place during the master and slave dialectic in the
      Phenomenology of Spiritis a struggle for recognition that concludes either in domination or death. Some Hegelians, such as Robert R. Williams, have gone so far as to say that many French postmodernists have built their approach in an unspoken embrace or rejection of Kojève’s alleged misinterpretation of Hegel. Ricoeur eschews these tangled waters by sticking with the theme of Otherness in Levinas and showing its ramifications in, for instance, the interpretation of the young Hegel by Axel Honneth.<br>

Abstract: Indeed, as Hannah Arendt has pointed out, “Goodness in an absolute sense, as distinguished from the good‐for’ or the excellent’ in Greek and Roman antiquity, became known in our civilization only with the rise of Christianity” (Hannah Arendt,
            The Human Condition[Chicago, 1958], p. 73). The analysis of Goodness provided inThe Human Conditionand in which Arendt highlights the constitutive secrecy of good works, which must remain hidden even to the one who performs them—a good deed being good only on condition that it is forgotten at the moment it is done—as well as Goodness’s intrinsic hostility toward the public realm, converges in many respects with what Patočka—a reader of Arendt—says about this notion, as well as with all the implications that Derrida draws in systematic fashion from this conception inThe Gift of Death.<br>

His preface to the request is, however, an unusual one: “for inasmuch as thou art God, and I know thee, and thou has sworn unto me, and commanded me that I should ask in the name of thine Only Begotten; thou has made me, and given unto me a right to thy throne, and not of myself, but through thine own grace; wherefore I ask thee if thou wilt not come again on the earth?” This is probably the most dramatic example of the theurgic force of Smith’s revisions to Genesis and reveals another dimension of Smith’s rejection of the classic theological anthropology of Christianity. In the JST account, Enoch realized for himself and his people the hope of overcoming on earth the breach in the bond with the sacred through the establishment of Zion. In addition, by rights given to him by God, Enoch obtained from God the promise that he would continue to manifest himself to Enoch’s posterity and, through them, minister salvation to the world.
         85Though Enoch is portrayed as having obtained this promise “not of myself, but through … grace,” it is no less the case that Smith’s narrative contemplates that humans may influence the divine will. This is demonstrated in God’s response to Enoch’s assertion of right in conjunction with his petition that God not abandon Enoch’s progeny, notwithstanding the death of the Messiah. God swears, “Even as I live, even so will I come in the last days … to fulfil the oath which I have made unto you.”<br>

Abstract: In
         Fictional Truth, Michael Riffaterre sees the subtextual energy of fiction standing in the same relation to plot as does the unconscious in Freud to the system of conscious perception.29Like the unconscious, and revealed only in signs or symptoms of the otherwise functionally repressed, subtexts are therefore timeless, reversible, and cumulative. If denied maternity (its removal by death or its falsification) locates one such subtext inLittle Dorrit—strung along in counterpoint to the failed father motif, for instance—that matrilineal subtext has its perverse and unexpected returns across the marital trajectory of the son himself, as he is sped along the monorail of its domesticating engine toward the anticipated point of rest and its gender assimilation. Any such subtext, according to Riffaterre, is a phenomenon transcendent to change or if you will subtendent to it. It thereby lies, in the last sentence of his study, “outside the realm of time and … impervious to its ravages.”30Plot is the map of those ravages. Narratology understands this. Narratography would, as I say, reexperience it—and do so in a transferential exchange, against the medial flow, between a nervously cued attention and the insinuated unconscious of the text itself.<br>

Abstract: The mourning strategies adopted respectively by Augustine and Marcel suggest that the death of the beloved may teach us how to disrupt the foundation of self‐reflexivity upon which, as we saw with regard to the split selves of Augustine and Marcel, we tend to erect our own identity. In
         Memory, History, Forgetting, Ricoeur advocates a mourning strategy equivalent with a similar goal. At first, he says, the death of the beloved brings about “a genuine amputation of oneself.” But then the experience of mourning entails “internalization,” a new level of personal identification for both the love object, lost to death, and our own self as a subject predicated on affections that now manifest themselves in absentia. This new self‐identification, in turn, trains us in the “anticipation” of our own futural self as predicated on the “plurality” that death will one day bestow on us in the memory of our dear ones.67This is the equivalent of the compassionate reciprocity with the subject of one’s grief that, as mentioned in my opening remarks, justifies the state of mourning, or, in Nussbaum’s words, makes compassion “comprehensible.”68<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur,
            Memory, History, Forgetting, 68. Memory for Augustine is subject to the power of time, also understood as the power of death. Book 11 ofConfessions, exploring time as both a condition for and subject of memory, underscores finite humanity’s being‐toward‐death, the fact that time is “the impending state ofnot being.” SeeConfessions, bk. 11, par. 14. Ricoeur engages Heidegger on memory, historicity, and death inMemory, History, Forgetting, 357–69. See also n. 48.<br>

Abstract: The remembrance of death and the love of life, which I have explored today, are in fact etched into the structures of our everyday, lived reality. Forty years ago this week, riots broke out at Columbia University and other institutions of higher learning and then, in May, throughout the United States and Europe over the war in Vietnam. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot. We are still at war but now on a global scale. And the killing of the just and innocent continues. Years ago some farsighted people grasped the massive danger we posed to our planet’s environment and forms of life, and we this week celebrate Earth Week in order to counter that danger. The past months have been scarred by an onslaught of murders in our city, especially against children. The remembrance of death surrounds us. Yet this week is also one of freedom and life. Jews around the world during Passover look back and reenact those events that led to their liberation from bondage. Christians look forward to Pentecost and the rush of new life in the spirit. Other religions also celebrate life in its many forms. People of good will around the world struggle against the onslaught of poverty, oppression, and dehumanization in the name of human dignity and also the fragile goodness of finite life.<br>

Abstract: One of the first and most influential examples of a structuralist reading is the collective text that the editors of
         Cahiers du cinémadevoted to John Ford'sYoung Mr. Lincolnin 1970 (translated inScreenin 1972).40Scarcely a decade after Bazin's death, the journal he founded had turned against him and embraced the structuralist paradigm that was in the avant‐garde of Parisian university culture. Between 1965 and 1972, Metz published five semiotic pieces inCahiers; but it was the next, psychoanalytic phase of his career (culminating inThe Imaginary Signifier[1975]) that worked in concert with the newly politicized version of Bazin's famous journal, whose editors were intent on leaving Bazin behind and adopting a more scientific stance.Sciencein those days was understood of course in Althusser's sense.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: By making the victory against oneself the victory of prayer, Kierkegaard mirrors Coleridge in suggesting that the proper effect of prayer is a state of being founded on an unthinkable risk: explanation (
         forklaring) is never forthcoming from God, but transfiguration (forklarelse) is. He concludes by stating that an absolute debt to God, contrary to worldly logic, is actually an absolute honor, in a way not incompatible with Coleridge’s analysis of blessedness as a kind of being rather than having: the realization that yielding the finite self is a form of victory in that the precant “conquers for himself what is yet bestowed on him” (N5554, fol. 12v). Both thinkers, therefore, orientate prayer around a struggle with and passage through paradox. As such, they are of their historical moment. For a long time, one might argue, faith had been one of the most proper acts in Western culture: in the wake of the collapse of the so‐called religion of reason and the onset of modernity, it would become increasingly improper. With Matthew Arnold’s long, withdrawing roar and Nietzsche’s death of God on the horizon, a horizon already traced by Kant’sReligion within the Limits of Mere Reason, facing this impropriety would be one of the great tasks of modern religious thought.<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: The claim that Joyce is the culmination of Christian epic is less persuasive, and part 2 relies too heavily on the work of Gian Balsamo and Altizer. Franke’s contribution is to interpret linguistic repetition in
      Finnegans Wake(London, 1939) as a secular reformulation of negative theology and typology that cannot be definitively interpreted as the death of God. However, I suspect Franke accepts a historical trajectory in which secular literature displaces traditional religion as revelation. If anything, his theological interpretation of Celan, Stevens, and Joyce deconstructs our conventional notion of the secular and demonstrates that literature cannot escape theology. My concern is that we must be careful not to privilege such literature—as the fulfillment of literary or theological tradition—but recognize that Joyce speaks theologically as one voice among many. In short, Franke needs to clarify the role of Joyce in his theoretical argument about poetic language and his practical effort to promote meaningful dialogue. Presumably, Joyce illustrates the apocalyptic power of literature, but does he do so in a way that is representative or superlative in literary or theological terms?<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: The contradictory impulses in the nascent Enlightenment's relationship to Judaism were never clearer than in the case of Spinoza. His devastating engagement with biblical criticism in the
         Theologico-Political Treatise(1670), according to Sutcliffe, “primitivises and infantalises” the Jews of the Old Testament while continuing to regard Scripture as their authentic, if flawed, history. Paradoxically, Spinoza would later undergo a rather different transfiguration as the “Messiah of the Enlightenment.” Sutcliffe examines how, after the philosopher's death in 1677, his biographers made painstaking efforts to “de-judaise” his thought by emphasizing his tranquil “self-mastery” and blithe detachment from any confessional identity. Nevertheless, Spinoza's early affiliation with Judaism left this universalist image fraught with a productive tension: his first biographer, Jean Maximilien Lucas, likened his subject to Christ—another great philosopher who, having rejected the prejudices of his time, set forth to preach the love of God and neighbor. His life and death, furthermore, announced the appearance of a new source of truth for humanity, that of the Enlightenment. Sutcliff seizes on such ambiguities to show how the original paradox at the center of Enlightenment universalism could never fully transcend the particularities of its founder (Sutcliffe, 118–47, quotes on 123, 133). Sutcliffe's Spinoza, even more than Sepinwall's Grégoire, symbolizes an ideal that began to fail at the moment of its inception.<br>

Author(s): Kitts Margo<br>
Abstract: Aiding in this iconical reconfiguration were the microadjusting features of ritual performance. Procedures such as shaving, showering, praying, and blowing Quranic verses helped to heighten the register of the ritual event, and ultimately to instantiate an irreversible commitment to the end goal. Indeed, the entire ritual process might be seen as secondary to, or at least supportive of, the oath unto death in section 1. No differently than oaths in ancient war literature, the oath of the last instructions was a highly sanctified liturgical order that aimed to instantiate a commitment and to communicate binding intent.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 653501<br>
Date: 08 2010<br>
Author(s): Schildgen Brenda Deen<br>
Abstract: I also want to take seriously Coetzee's author's idea of animals as “vessels of revelation,” the idea that the allegory implicit in the life cycle of frogs (
         Elizabeth Costello, 216–18) or in the dog sunning himself (Elizabeth Costello, 229) evokes some “timeless” sign in the animal world. Despite Coetzee's “postmetaphysical” and nonreligious framework, this view hints at a transcendent reality in the immanent natural world that the poet makes present through language, as in Francis of Assisi's poetic theology in the “Cantico di frate sole” (Canticle of brother sun), often titled “Cantico delle creature” (Canticle of the creatures). Probably more studied than any other work of the patron saint of the environment, the poem is a cosmic liturgy praising all of creation: “Laudato sie, mi Signore, cun tutte le tue creature” (Praised be you, my Lord, with all your creatures).17The poem's praise of creation or created things proves to be a “poetics” for humans' reconciliation with their own animal or created being-ness.18This is similar to what Derrida recognized as drawing humans to animals because of our mutual capacity to suffer, our vulnerability to death, and therefore our potential communion with other creatures inL'animal que donc je suis. Dante, because of his canonical status, because he belongs to a long pastweltanschauung, because he adheres to Aristotelian philosophical views on ethics and on animals, and because many scholars have pounded him into his temporal niche, emerges as an excellent poet with whom to test the theory of animal images as “timeless.”<br>

Abstract: Can this really be right? Consider, again, the Hollywoodized portion of the film, that thirty-minute sequence that recycles every last trope Charlie has sworn to avoid.
         32Why should we not consider this a sellout, an abject capitulation to the imperious demand for narrative?33After all, even the calmer sequence that concludes the film, following the death of Donald, could be seen as part of the same general trend. To be sure, the tone changes here—gone is the high drama, gone the clichéd action-movie music—but Charlie's rapprochement with Amelia (Cara Seymour), while less absurd than the guns and drugs and alligators, surely still falls under the general rubric of characters “coming to like each other.” And the very fact that Charlie finds a way to complete his screenplay means that the movie is, however one looks at it, the story of a man “overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end.” Has Kaufman not given us, then, exactly what Charlie swore to withhold?<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: It is utterly clear that Faustus's inner life is tortured. The longing and the sense of exile invoked by his cries (“see, see where Christ's blood streams…one drop would save my soul…ah my Christ”) are utterly palpable yet horribly answered by sharp internal pain, as if an invisible claw slashed at Faustus's heart for its very longing (“Ah, rend not my heart for naming of Christ”). And by this rending sharpness Faustus becomes all the more alienated from mercy, as if he were confronted with the hallucination of Christ's blood disappearing (“Where is it now? ’Tis gone”), or as if God himself looked down in the sternest, most unforgiving judgment (“see where God / Stretcheth out his arm, and bends his ireful brows!”). But what makes God seem entirely confounding is not merely that he seems to all too ready to squash Faustus, as if Marlowe's hero were nothing more than a scurrying, terrified bug, but also that Faustus himself finally seems horrified by damnation yet remains utterly exiled and bereft of any chance for his soul to find rest because he manifests the very same habit of mind he displayed in his opening soliloquy. He still feels that he can live only in his body, addressing the earth as if it could hide him from God by hiding his body (“Then will I headlong run into the earth: Earth gape! O no, it will not harbor me” [5.2.87]). He still feels like salvation is an annihilation worse than death, and for that very reason he cannot help but prefer either to be in endless pain in hell or to have no soul at all (“O no end is limited to damned souls! / Why wert thou not a creature wanting soul?” [5.2.104–5]). And he still thinks that his soul is flesh and that his flesh will endure forever in hell (“Now body, turn to air, / Or Lucifer will bear thee quick to hell / O soul, be changed into little water drops, / And fall into the ocean, ne'er to be found” [5.2.116–19]). Thus he can do nothing but call on God in a gasping panic (“My God, My God!” he cries, just before~<br>

Author(s): LaCocque André<br>
Abstract: Three epigraphs circumscribe the book’s broader themes. The first, from the late philosopher Paul Ricoeur (LaCocque’s friend and collaborator), identifies the role of myth in combining the innocence and guilt of humanity. The second, from Norman Brown’s
      Life against Death, points out how “pyramids and skyscrapers” represent a “flight from death.” The third, from Jacques Derrida, characterizes the Tower of Babel as “an incompletion, the impossibility of finishing, of totalizing” (v). Taken together, these three reflections affirm an understanding of the Babel story as a timeless “symbol of all our constructions and fabrications, with their inexorable outcome: confusion (of our life messages) and scattering (of all the pieces of our projects)” (21). They also provide a model for LaCocque’s own scholarly practice, which is distinctively rigorous yet exploratory at the same time. If, for example, Genesis 11 dates from the exile, it then becomes possible to depict it as a mythic critique of architectural fetishism and political ambition. The “gate of the divine” (Bab-El) thus becomes a dangerous threshold from profane to sacred, one in which the desire to “make a name” reflects an arrogance doomed to confuse all names. As myth, Genesis 11 captures enduring tendencies in human psychology such as infants’ fascination with presence and absence (“fort” and “da”) and the politics of empire.<br>

It is interesting to note that the reentry of mourners into society is marked on the seventh day by a ceremony known as “putting on the red” (chʾuan hung), in which mourners exchange their white mourning garb with red, associated with life and luck (p. 165). The color symbolism here offers a suggestive parallel to the red heifer rite of Numbers 19, though we must keep in mind that color symbolism in general is much more pervasive and explicit in Cantonese culture than in ancient Israel.<br>

Abstract: Csordas asserts that it is only by confronting evil as an anthropological problem that we can address how morality is culturally inflected. As he says, “if it wasn’t for evil morality would be moot.” In other words, the boundaries of the positive are predicated on the definitional challenges of the negative, a procedural principle that I have found persuasive. This point obviates the need to hover indefinitely over questions of whether evil is only ever culturally defined. We already know this. But, like the fact of death clouded by its many cultural interpretations, evil is existentially present even if not amenable to set identification, an apparent elusiveness that has deterred many anthropologists from considering it a proper subject for analysis.<br>

Abstract: What then could be the meaning of that strange circumlocution: “One shaped and wing’d like one of those from heav’n / By us oft seen”? At this point in the poem, Eve has no knowledge of Satan or his shape-shifting powers, nor does she understand hypocrisy, as Schwartz rightly notes. So why does she speak this way? Why use fourteen syllables to designate what should be expressed in three: “an angel”? As she struggles to assign those strange dream words to another, the figure she ultimately focuses on is not simply a disguised Satan. It is one of those ontologically undecidable beings—like Sin and Death, or Spenser’s snowy Florimell (who may or may not have a demon inside of her pulling the strings).
         
               The point of Eve’s circumlocution is not to suggest a demonic being lurking beneath an angelic mask but rather to emphasize again the instability and unoriginality of the dream voice. As soon as one projects that voice onto an external speaker, even within the mental space of dreams, that speaker begins to disintegrate. The dream voice refuses to be pinned down on any single readily identifiable figure. Eve, then, does not get it wrong by failing to identify Satan beneath the guise of the angel. She in fact registers an even more terrifying fact about the dream voice—that there is no one behind it to identify.26<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Abstract: The second chapter, “Materiality,” is predicated on the idea that because tomb artifacts were specifically designed for the dead, they possess specific visual properties—with respect to their material, size, and decoration—directly related to their symbolic functions. Wu observes, for example, that lacquerwares from the Eastern Zhou (770–221 BCE) and Han periods were painted red and black, the colors of coffins; that vessels buried with the dead were often deliberately rendered unusable in some way; and that sculptural figurines were frequently miniaturized. This chapter also includes an important discussion of the many ways that contemporaries tried to “transform” their corporeal bodies in order to escape death.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: ncm.2012.36.issue-1<br>
Date: July 2012<br>
Abstract: Framed in such a way, the early movements of Mahler's Second Symphony—characterized by the alternation between halting sections that dissolve almost as soon as they begin and long-breathed melodies that seem to unfold effortlessly—suggest the melancholic subject's struggle between despair in the face of abject meaninglessness and a manic euphoria, neither of which addresses the loss. By contrast, the text in the symphony's final movement, adapted by Mahler from Friedrich Klopstock's chorale on the resurrection of the dead, encourages true remembrance of the deceased as a figure beyond death. Heard as a musical enactment of mourning, the final movement suggests that the dead who are mourned are resurrected through remembrance. Forcing us to acknowledge Mahler's death on some level, the final movement completes the work of mourning by engendering the composer's own resurrection in our memories as we witness each performance of his Second Symphony.<br>

Article Title: 'Getting out and Getting Away': Women's Narratives of Class Mobility<br>
Publisher: Taylor & Francis Group<br>
Issue: i260667<br>
Date: 10 1, 1931<br>
Author(s): Woolf Steph<br>
Abstract: This article is concerned with the ways in which women narrate a move from a 'working-class' position to a position marked (in however fragmentary and complex a way) as 'middle class'. While such a move might be seen in terms of a straightforward escape from a disadvantaged social position, I argue here that what has to be analysed is the pain and the sense of estrangement associated with this class movement. Drawing on the class narratives of a group of seven white British women, the article uses Bourdieu's concepts of symbolic capital and habitus to explore the cultural and symbolic configurations of class. These configurations may be inscribed into the self, so that the self, itself, is class marked. Since working-class selves are frequently marked in pathological terms, this raises particular difficulties for the idea of an 'escape' from such a position. Class in this sense is embedded in people's history and so cannot be so easily 'escaped'. The usual conventions of life-narratives - in which the self remains the same entity from birth to death and later events are a culmination of earlier ones - are also disrupted in this case. But if a working-class position is marked as pathological, so too is taking on the markers of middle-class existence. to do so is not only to risk 'getting it wrong', but it is also to risk the scorn attached to 'pretentiousness'. There is a particular jeopardy here for women, since it is women who have been especially associated with desires for artefacts associated with bourgeois existence. The article argues for a focus for classed desires and class envy, not in pathological terms, but in terms of a coherent response to political and social exclusions.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263716<br>
Date: 6 1, 1930<br>
Author(s): Underhill David R.<br>
Abstract: This essay examines, from the point of view of an existential hermeneutics, five accounts of transpersonal experience: Robert Monroe's Journeys Out of the Body, Paul's experience in the third heaven in II Corinthians 12, a description of rapture by Teresa of Avila, a disembodied vision of guardian spirits by John Lilly from The Center of the Cyclone, and the vision of the assault of the Lords of the Dead from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Through a consideration of world, embodiment, death, care and other existential categories, the discussion in each case focuses on a central ambiguity about the personal identity of the narrator. The question of authenticity, in a Heideggerian sense, is posed to these materials, and the central ambiguity is shown to strike so deeply as to undercut the assumption of autonomy as the criterion of authenticity. Being-toward-death is relativized in such experiences, but relativized by an even more radical threat to individual existence. In conclusion, some generalized principles are offered as heuristic criteria for interpreting transpersonal experience in general.<br>

Abstract: Recent study of the nature of textuality as such opens new insights for the study of the Bible. Although individual parts of the Bible have oral antecedents, the Bible as a whole has existed only as a text, and a unique kind of text, folded back on itself out of communal memory as no other book has been. A text is a monument. Textuality establishes a special relationship between discourse and death. Spoken words are exchanges between living persons. The text presents its message as well if its author is dead as it does if he or she is alive. Print is even more bound to death than writing is. In comparison with oral performance-delivery of an oration, song-a text physically has certain special alliances with past time. All texts come out of the past. Literature as text is psychologically retrospective: its effects typically include an element of nostalgia. Because of its future orientation, culminating in the closing words of Revelation, "Come, Lord Jesus" (as against typical narrative closes such as "They lived happily ever after"), the Bible has an unusual relationship to textuality: it is not literature in the way other texts are. Typical narrative plot structures existence retrospectively: the story is organized back from the conclusion. This retrospective organization is maximized by writing, which tightens plot and makes more of re-cognition, a kind of return to the beginning (the past) and hence a cyclic pattern. In addition to being related intimately to death, writing and print are also limitlessly fecund, the central forces in the evolution of consciousness, once they appear. The fecundity of writing and print, like other fecundity in human existence, is achieved by passage through death. "Unless the grain of wheat dies." The Word of God in the Person of Jesus Christ is conceived of by analogy with the spoken word. The Father speaks the Word, the Son (eo verbum quo filius); he does not write the Word, who would then by biblical attestation be not life but d~<br>

Issue: i263808<br>

Author(s): Williamson Tod<br>
Abstract: Using George Bataille's reflections on desire, death, and God as the basis for considering the love poetry of the Song of Songs as a manifestation of the commingling of separate realms and separate bodies in the service of a longed-for continuity helps us to see that such a commingling is never far from the domain of violence and that such continuity of being is never far from death. But the biblical book itself helps us to see something that is missing from Bataille's analysis-that is, a more complex understanding of the implications of desire for the divine. What if, contra Bataille, God were not "by definition" immune to risk? What if the divine were not understood to be perfection but, rather, bound as well to the vicissitudes of desire, with all the anguish and ecstasy that it implies? The Song of Song's lyrical presentation of Eros, carried over as it is into the tradition of allegorical interpretation, may, in fact, have rather profound implications for how we talk about God.<br>

Article Title: Dying between the Lines: Infinite Blindness in Lessing's "Laokoon" and Burke's "Enquiry"<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303121<br>
Date: 7 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Wellbery Adam<br>
Abstract: The essay studies the ways in which death-the word, the concept, and the friction between word and concept-informs aesthetic programs of Lessing and Burke. Both writers turn (and return often) to death as a kind of artistic touchstone and, in doing so, illustrate divergent schools of Enlightenment aesthetic thought. Lessing wants to define and maintain, if only conceptually and only pragmatically, the borders between spatial and temporal representation; Burke, to collapse the borders between space and time, if only imaginatively and momentarily. Lessing, in both the Laokoon and How the Ancients Represented Death, although nervous about the slipperiness of the word death, seems to embrace death's certainty; it is an end, the end, the limit to end all limits. Burke, on the other hand, treats death as "the king of terrors"; he opens himself, at least nominally, to the "obscurity" of death, to the possibility of the infinite. Beneath the surface, though, Burke is profoundly ambivalent about giving up finite, spatialized representation in favor of a potentially infinite temporal flow, and his treatment of Milton's "universe of death" is a fascinating study in this ambivalence. This essay closely studies the tropes-blindness, for instance-with which Lessing and Burke approach death and suggests that their strategies are at root more similar than may appear. Both find themselves in a linguistic predicament, and death becomes for both a metaphor for the strife between natural and arbitrary signs.<br>

Author(s): Ciutǎ Felix<br>
Abstract: How do we know when we are dealing with security issue? This is a cardinal question in Security Studies, and securitisation theory provides and authoritative yet incomplete answer, mainly because it rules out that the meaning of security can vary contextually. To overcome this limitation, we need a hermeneutical perspective centred on the liminality of security as a category in-between theory and policy, which produces a more precise algorithm for empirical research. A contextual hermeneutics of security signals that normative awareness is necessary even in the absence of a unifying normative manifesto, also confronts the spectre of the "death of security" invoked by those who object to the potentially endless broadening of its meaning.<br>

Author(s): Capps Donald<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on the personal experience of regret and the importance of coming to terms with our regrets. It begins with a sermon preached by the first author in which the issue of regret is explored by means of a summary of the film The Big Kahuna, continues with a discussion of recent articles (Tomer and Eliason, Existential and spiritual issues in death attitudes, 2008; Mannarino et al., Existential and spiritual issues in death attitudes, 2008) on the concept of regret formulated by Landman (Landman, Regret: A theoretical and conceptual analysis, 1987; Regret: The persistence of the possible, 1993), and on regret therapy, and concludes with a pastoral care case in which a dying woman expresses both future-related and past-related regrets. The case is interpreted in light of regret therapy's emphasis on parabolic experiences and reframing techniques.<br>

Abstract: The paper considers early death as violent death caused by another person in the context of the Nazi concentration camps. With Hannah Arendt death is understood as destruction of personal identity, because writers cannot write a poem about their own physical death. Therefore, the present contribution based on the concept of the narrative identity (Paul Ricœur) will examine by the example of the poem „Der Häftling“ („The Inmate“) by Fritz Löhner-Beda how identity can be destroyed and stabilized by techniques of narrative defiguration and refiguration at level of the first person narrator of the poem and at level of the author's subject.<br>

Author(s): Hauchecorne Mathieu<br>
Abstract: This essay is a comparative study of the tributes paid to the American philosopher John Rawls, in France and the United States, after his death in November 2010. Whereas in the U.S. tributes to Rawls appeared in scholarly journals, in France they did in political magazines and general interest media. Besides, the focus in U.S. journals on Rawls's philosophical commitments is at odds with the emphasis placed by the French media on the political interpretations of his theory of justice. The contrast between Rawls's French and U.S. "funerals" is a consequence of the way intellectual fields in France and the U.S. differ in their relation to politics. While Rawls conformed with what was expected of him in the American academia by staying away from politics almost all his life, he was seen in France as an intellectuel engagé, the typical figure of intellectual life since the Dreyfus case. The contrast between the French and American reactions to Rawls's death is also related to the fact that those who first got interested in his theory of justice in France were supporters of the anti-totalitarian left or center-right, rather than academic philosophers.<br>

Abstract: Schwartz argues for the later rabbinic development of practices related to death: "Indeed, if it
is the case that even strongly 'Jewish' Jews were often buried without the accompaniment of Jewish
iconography—that despite what we are accustomed to think about such liminal moments as birth,
death, marriage and so on, death was not yet generally an occasion among Palestinian Jews for
strong public affirmation of group identity—then Beth Shearim shows that the judaization of
Jewish burial practice was now (third-fourth century) underway in some circles" (2001: 154).<br>

Concentration Camp in Dachau, Germany. I cannot explain the emotions that I was
having while visiting a place where thousands lost their lives, not because they were evil,
not because they were criminals, but because of their race, religion, orientation, etc... It
seems I am constantly confronted with the fact that the human race is capable of such
mass atrocities. Why is it that one person or group of people must assert their beliefs and
their cause on another, often to the death." Von Interesse sind hier auch die Reaktionen

Abstract: Addressing historic injustice involves a struggle against absence. This article reflects on the foundations of that challenge, on absence and justice. I ask what it means to address the absent victims of deadly injustice given the distance of time and death that separates us from them. This topic embraces a wide swath of events of interest to students of politics. Some are as recent as the Rwandan genocide; others are by now historical: the Holocaust or slavery in antebellum America. All have in common that they and their victims are distant from us, a separation that makes doing them justice deeply perplexing. In response, I sketch an argument that the absent victims of injustice are not nullities but retain a status, a presence as claimants on justice that defines our efforts to address the wrongs done them.<br>

Publisher: The University of Nebraska Press<br>
Issue: i23535704<br>
Date: 7 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Grossman Kathryn M.<br>
Abstract: Set in the exiled poet's "marginal" home in the Channel Islands, Les Travailleurs de la mer (1866) elaborates a vision of creative potential. Science, dreams, meditation, natural forces, physical prowess, selfess devotion, even death—all serve as vehicles for expanding the boundaries of our universe, both internal and external. The protagonist, Gilliatt, avails himself of these multiple modes of transport to challenge our notion of the humanly—and inhumanly—possible. Transcending his own limits to conquer a wide array of "monsters," he links the motifs of movement and displacement in Hugo's hypertropic narrative to the transpositions of metaphor, the sublime, and political exile.<br>

Abstract: Today, bioethical themes are no longer the exclusive patrimony of university classrooms. Everyone is talking about them; "secular" and "catholics" alike. Catholics are often accused of imposing a "confessional" point of view. This article wishes to clarify this point given its importance in themes regarding the life and death of man, such as: artificial fecundation, abortion, cloning, brain death, organ transplants, and euthanasia. The article is based on a philosophical reflection starting with anthropological considerations. The extensive number of themes does not allow taking all of them into consideration. Thus the article adheres to the following outline: 1. Establish the epistemological bases for a rational discourse based on universal premises, with particular reference to artificial fecundation and the nature of human sexuality. 2. Analize the "human nature" condition of the embryo, of the physically and mentally disabled, of the terminally ill, and their status as "human persons"; this discourse is founded on the ontological status of the human body. 3. Present the value of the human body as a psycho-biological unity, which constitutes man's substantial unity. 4. We call this psycho-biological unity "person": "corpore et anima unus"; an individual subject with a rational nature, with its own singularity and oneness. The person has an absolute value, therefore cloning, even for "therapeutic reasons", is contrary to its ontological status. 5. From the consideration that a "person is", while a "personality becomes", we can explain how the person develops and matures his biological and spiritual capacities, without incurring changes in his ontological status. 6. The psycho-biological unity of the human person (corpore et anima unus) is at the basis of death in man, a unique reality. In analysing "human death" we should avoid two reductions: a biological reduction which curtails death to physical-biological processes and events (medical diagnosis of brain death)~<br>

Abstract: Johann Georg Hamann saw the written word of God as the ultimate consequence of his incarnation. The biblical texts as well also carry the death of Christ in their essence as a figure of incarnation. Roland Barthes called the process of putting these texts into writing, by which the text gains autonomy in relation to the author, the "death of the author". In terms of the theology of the Holy Scriptures, this idea can be connected to the way people have been talking about the death of God in the modern age. One must however distinguish between the death of the author and the death of the text. This occurs when exegesis does not want to accept the death of the author. When however during reading there is a new understanding of biblical texts, this means to a certain extent their resurrection.<br>

Abstract: The Bacchae by Euripides can be read as a heuristic laboratory for the transfer between the Greek "tragic" and the Christian "metatragic", since Euripides distances himself from the unstilled myth of the tragic which consits of Dionysian versus Apollinian duality. What is being sought is a new metatragic hermeneutics, which can only be found in the Chalcedonian relationship between "undivided and unmixed representation", since it is only in a Christologically substantiated statement the wish is actually (and not only seemingly) fulfilled that "Dionysos speaks the language of Apollo, and Apollo, finally, the language of Dionysos" (Nietzsche). This new kind of metatragic hermeneutics, whose substructures are denoted as "mysterium" and "metaphor", is attained by the poetic reinterpretation of the death of "Pentheus", who now becomes a type of Christus Patiens.<br>

Abstract: Une des thèses les plus importantes de l'historien français Alphonse Dupront affirme que la mort de la Chrétienté est un élément crucial de la modernité européenne. Le présent article, fondé sur une interprétation de la correspondance diplomatique de Philippe Canaye de Fresnes, ambassadeur de France à Venise durant l'Interdit vénitien (1606-1607), étudie la survie de l'idée de Chré tienté au début du XVIIe siècle. À travers les lettres de Canaye de Fresnes, on peut voir qu'un usage catholique mais antiromain du concept de Chrétienté semble possible. A favourite assumption of the french historian Alphonse Dupront is the idea that the death of Christendom is a crucial element of european modernity. The present work, based on an interpretation of the diplomatic dispatches of Philippe Canaye de Fresnes, the french ambassador in Venice during the Venetian Interdict (1606-1607), deals with the survival of the idea of Christendom at the beginning of the 17th century. Through the letters of Canaye de Fresnes, one can see that a catholic but antiromanist use of the conceipt of Christendom seems possible.<br>

Abstract: We can distinguish two different kinds in the educational process, the one called «learning education» and the one leading to a possible «autonomous education» in which every-body's freedom is above everything else. The former is education for technoscientists. The later, the «autonomous education» is supported by the thesis that knowing oneself as «moriturus», forces one to provide a sense or meaning, technologies and educational sciencies not being enough. Death forces us to decide the possible, only opposed by the impossible.<br>

Abstract: Disciplina acuñada en el XIX, la filología surge como historicidad fundamental, identificando la significación de una obra con sus condiciones de producción originarias, un discurso de la ciencia (historia) sobre la lengua y la literatura. La hermenéutica contemporánea supone una ruptura de la razón histórico-filológica y una afirmación de los nuevos significados que a un texto se le añaden al pasar de un contexto cultural u otro nuevo. Para la filología, el criterio pedagógico único de explicación de los textos es la restitución de la intención deliberada y originaria del autor. Hermenéutica y teoría de la literatura afirman que no hay adecuación lógica necesaria entre sentido de la obra e intención de autor. Tras la “muerte del autor” del formalismo semiótico, la posmodernidad niega el texto mismo y afirma que éste tiene tantos sentido como lectores. A discipline minted in the 19th century, philology, emerges as a fundamental historicist approach, identifying the significance of a work with its original conditions of production, a discourse from science (history) about language and literature. Contemporary hermeneutics assumes a break with historical-philological reason, as well as an affirmation of the new meanings added to a text by passing from one cultural context to another new one. For philology, the only pedagogical criterion in explaining texts is the restitution of deliberate and original authorial intent. Hermeneutics and literary theory assert that there is no logical association necessary between the meaning of the work, and authorial intent. Since the “death of the author” of semiotic formalism, postmodernity has denied the text itself, instead asserting that it has as many meanings as it has readers.<br>

Abstract: En Palestine, chaque année au mois d'avril, a lieu le pèlerinage musulman de Moïse (mawsim al-Nabî Mûsâ). Située dans le désert, entre Jérusalem et Jéricho, la tombe du prophète rassemble autour d'elle des pèlerins venus de l'ensemble de la Cisjordanie. Ce lieu de mémoire collective fixe et rappelle un événement lointain rapporté par la tradition musulmane : la mort de Moïse. Dans le même temps, il suscite des questionnements en chaîne : le législateur des Hébreux est-il mort dans ce lieu? Ou, comme le stipule la Bible, dans un endroit inconnu des hommes? Estil d'ailleurs vraiment mort? Son corps est-il là? Etc. Ces questions, qui portent sur les circonstances et la réalité de l'événement, reviennent à s'interroger ici et maintenant sur la présence d'un intercesseur efficace entre les hommes et Dieu. Elles sont donc étroitement liées à une problématique plus large, celle de savoir comment construire l'accessibilité et le contact avec un « ailleurs invisible », ce Dieu transcendant et lointain que l'islam propose à l'instar du judaïsme et du christianisme. Dans cet article je propose d'explorer l'indécision qui est le corollaire de cette longue série de questionnements ne trouvant aucune réponse définitive. In Palestine every year in the month of April, the Muslim pilgrimage of Moses (mawsim al-Nabî Mûsâ) takes place. Located in the desert between Jerusalem and Jericho, the grave of the Prophet gathers pilgrims from the entire West Bank. This place of collective memory fixes and recalls a distant event reported by Muslim tradition: the death of Moses. At the same time, it raises questions: did the Hebrew legislator die there? Or, as stated in the Bible, in a place unknown to men? Is he really dead? Is his body there? Etc. These questions, which relate to the circumstances and the reality of the event amounts to question here and now the presence of an effective intercessor between man and God. They are closely related to a larger issue, that of how to build accessibi~<br>

Abstract: This paper asks, why does the eponymous hero of Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim fail to obtain absolution despite two confessional attempts, and then seek his own death? By using narratological distinctions together with an analysis of the confessional structures of Jim's narratives, we find that his confessions fail for three reasons: he never fulfils his promise to Marlow to plot the 'fundamental why' of his jumping ship, his father's 'easy morality' condemns him even before he abandons the Patna, and Marlow fails to meet his role as confessor.<br>

Date: 12 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Loevlie Elisabeth M.<br>
Abstract: The story of the Fall inscribes the myth of a fallen language as the absolute other of the original sacred. Hence the dualistic scheme between a fallen materiality and a metaphysical God. This article explores how the death of this God is not merely a secular turn, but the opening of a different, anti-theological, or fallen religiosity that allows us to trace the sacred in unexpected places—also within fallen language. Translation and literature will be explored as instances where language performs its own fallenness— its materiality, arbitrariness and difference—and thereby releases a sacred expression. The essay considers 17th-century theologian Martin de Barcos' letters regarding translation, Derrida's essay 'Des Tours de Babel' and notions of literariness based on Blanchot and Mallarmé.<br>

Barr's point that 'lie' is an inappropriate depiction is accepted, but the issue is recast in terms of whether God's words would be sheqer, unreliable. An interpretation of the overall narrative, congruous with the decision about the nature of God's words, is offered.<br>

Abstract: Rav H̱isday Crescas (1340-1410/11), Rabbi of Aragonese Jewry in Christian Spain and a major figure in medieval Jewish philosophy, is unique in positing an all-embracing thesis of Love. This thesis permeates his theories of cosmogony, metaphysics and theology and generates far-reaching didactic implications. This article examines Crescas' rather bold description of Love as a positive Divine attribute, an anthropopathism meant to convey ontological meaning about the Divine Nature via an analogous construct. Themes such as Infinite Goodness, Joy and Kindness enable Rav H̱isday to structure a new conception of the Creator and Providence. After postulating Divine Love as the Cosmic Force sustaining creation, Crescas explains the purpose of Torah and mitzvot in terms of evoking love for God thus drawing the soul to link up to the Divine Overflow of Love. Even spiritual existence after death is explicated in terms of the soul's love for its Divine Source. To understand Crescas' unique theory of Love, we compare it with the views of his predecessors and analyze his use of philosophic sources such as the 5th century BCE pre-Socratic scientist-mystic Empedocles. We examine educational aspects of Crescas' teachings on love and view them in context of the mass conversions to Christianity resulting from the 1391 riots. Finally, Crescas' ideas are read as pedagogical messages relevant to both Jews and conversos in the twenty traumatic years after 1391 when he served as chief rabbi and political leader in Saragossa.<br>

Article Title: Trends in Papal Communication: A Content Analysis of Encyclicals, from Leo XIII to Pope Francis<br>

Abstract: Within the papal eneyelieals (exhortations) ranging from Leo XIII (1878) to Pope Francis (2013), concern for authority in general and for obedience and duty, in particular, is in decline. This longterm trend signals intra-ecclesial secularization at the elite level. A second negative trend supports this finding: textual indicators for Catholic uniqueness such as: Catholic, Doctrine and Pope have steadily lost prominence. Upwardly directed, the textual indicators for God, Jesus, Gospel, Spirituality and Love follow positive long-term trends. The traditional eschatological code, with its keywords sin, death, final judgment, heaven or hell, reaches only low levels of attention. Overall, there is an eschatological loss, where Heaven, due to a slower decline, wins over Hell. Christ the Inexorable Judge is retreating in favor of the loving Jesus and God as Love. The millennia-old process of civilizing God persists. Technically, the quantitative content analysis was carried out mainly with TEXTPACK.<br>

Abstract: This article tries to give an outline of Christian ethics in a pluralistic world most clearly characterized by its Babel of moral languages. There is no longer any single valid moral language. The liberal solution to establish a neutral moral language – a moral Esperanto – to solve this crisis of modernity is not possible without turning into some sort of moral imperialism. To avoid, however, the other extreme – nihilism – this article follows to some degree "communitarian" thinkers like A. MacIntyre, J. Stout and M. Walzer. Every ethics must be rooted in a narrative tradition and needs a concrete community as its precondition. The second part of this article addresses the narrative structure of Christian ethics. At first it follows MacIntyre's insight that every ethics is based on myth. It differs, however, from MacIntyre's position by putting special emphasis on the substantial content of the Christian "myth". With the help of Girard's mimetic theory this article distinguishes between archaic myths that are the product of the scapegoat mechanism and identify with the view of the lynch mob and the Biblical history of salvation that consists of a story written from the perspective of the victims of collective persecution. In the center of Christian ethics we find the example of Jesus Christ – the victim of collective violence par excellence – and the example of those of his disciples who became aware of their own contribution to Jesus's death and converted to the side of the victim. The third part of this article addresses the question of the concrete community that makes Christian ethics possible. Again MacIntyre's communitarian emphasis on the connection between concrete communities and ethics is taken as a starting point. Whereas communitarians, however, tend to support patriotism the community necessitated by Christian ethics is the universal Church. Patriotism like the ancient Greek polis is essentially characterized by its enmity to outside communities, a frie~<br>

Abstract: The aim of this article is to analyse the political and mnemonic programme to be found in the last books of the British historian and thinker Tony Judt. The author of this article assumes that the final period of Judt's writing, in which he produced Ill Fares the Land, The Memory Chalet, and the posthumously published discussion with Timothy Snyder entitled Thinking the Twentieth Century, is dependent on a kind of 'art of memory'. For Judt, being terminally ill with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and thus condemned to immobility, this method became not so much—as in the case of its classic varieties—a technology of remembering, as a manner of recognizing and analyzing the contemporary world by turning to his own biography. The purpose was to construct a 'political testament' for the Western world in a time of crisis whose roots, according to Judt, can be found in the supremacy that 'economic' thinking has achieved over traditional political thought. In a gesture reminiscent of the Stoic 'techniques of the self' described by Michel Foucault, Judt, by exploiting his own no less complicated biography and identity, tries to throw light on the complicated history of the 20th century, containing the sources of 'our contemporary ills'. Biography and history thus meet here in a 'work of memory' whose horizon and catalyzer is the perspective of death, and whose stake is the idea of a political community experiencing, according to Judt, a period of inertia.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I take issue with Heidegger's use of the concept of death as a means of disclosing human finitude. I argue that Being-towards-death is inadequate to the disclosure of Dasein's thrownness which is necessary for the kind of authentic historizing that Heidegger describes and furthermore leads to a reading of authenticity which is preclusive of Being-with-Others. I suggest that this difficulty may be alleviated through increased attention to the opposite boundary of Dasein's existence, namely its birth. Although I do not pursue the project here of conducting a phenomenology of birth, I suggest some directions for proceeding with that task, and I illustrate that a greater emphasis on Dasein's beginning will increase the richness of our understanding of our Being-with-Others.<br>

Abstract: Intensive care and the intensive care techniques in use have considerably changed our attitude towards death and dying –a process that had already been medicalized and professionalized. This study of four intensive care units (ICUs) in France and Britain brings to light the reality of death-related practices and resituates that reality at the core of professional relations and personal experience. Study results strongly suggest that the end-of-life decision is a genuine social construction: far from being purely objective and medical, it is heavily conditioned by context and actors' commitment. The search for professional autonomy and self-regulation has increased the ambivalence of the dying process, already complex because governed by extremely heterogeneous types of logic. This study shows that patient's death in an ICU is more dependant on the organization and culture of the ICU than on patient's own wishes or those of close relatives.<br>

Abstract: Dealing with North Korea is perhaps one of the most difficult challenges in global politics today. Totalitarian and reclusive, ideologically isolated and economically ruined, it is the inherent 'other' in a globalised and neo-liberal world order. The respective approaches are correspondingly divided: a confrontational approach relies on the projection of military threats and aims to undermine the authoritarian regime as fast as possible, leading to a quick disintegration and subsequent absorption. The second approach favours engaging North Korea in political, economic and cultural interactions. The essay outlines why engagement is more suited to diffusing tension on the peninsula and avoid a war. But it also draws attention to key issues that remain largely unaddressed: how exactly people divided by the traumatic memory of conflict and death might coexist in a respectful and non-violent manner, or whether or not forgiveness is necessary to promote reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: I cannot go into the question whether substances can be such self-causing causes and
consequently how agency could be conceived in a metaphysics of substances. Moreland and
McRae (2000) argue for such an approach in their important work on anthropology and eth-
ics. I conclu with their spirit (a defense of the notion of soul in a biblical sense), without shar-
ing their mind-bodv dualism and the metaphysics behind it. One could make a case, I think, of
the statement that in their account the substantiveness of the body gradually disappears, in
spite of their body — soul dualism. Another issue is the distinctness between biblical and scien-
tific language. An important argument in almost all dualist accounts is the séparation between
body and 'soul' at death. I am not convinced that this 'séparation' can be used as an argument
for body-soul dualism as a philosophical position. Is what occurs at the moment of death not
just as mysterious as what occurs at the moment of conception (and in God's act of création)?
By introducing the biblical notion of the soul in a scientific discourse on mind-body dualism,
one is coerced to adapt the biblical meaning of the concept to the prevailing ontology of sub-
stances and entities; and this almost always implies not only réduction (loss of meaning), but
also adoption of certain conceptual characteristics inherent in the metaphysics of substances
(such as separateness of substances; or self-sustenance; or being bearer of a bundie of fea-
tures).<br>

Abstract: In Cooper's interpretation of Dooyeweerd two further errors are present. Cooper (1989,
250) says that Dooyeweerd's "notion of the ego allows the supranatural to shape the temporal
but not the reverse." Dooyeweerd however speaks of both divergence and concentration.
Cooper also states that in Dooyeweerd the basic directions of thinking, imagining and willing
are rooted in the heart, not in the temporal act structure. The passage at issue deals with the
functioning of the soul after death. Cooper holds that such rootedness of the basic directions
in the heart allows us to argue that the basic directions can also function outside the earthly
(i.e. temporal) modes. Apart from the fact that for Dooyeweerd the supra-temporal belongs to
the creatural (earthly) order, Cooper neglects that Dooyeweerd strongly denied the idea of an
incorporeal personal centre: acts and basic directions are inconceivable without involvement of
the temporal function cloak, c.q. the act structure.<br>

Abstract: In Matter and Memory, Bergson examines the relationship between perception and memory, the status of consciousness in its relation to the brain, and more generally, a possible conjunction of matter and mind. Our reading focuses in particular on his understanding of the evanescent presence of the present and of its debt vis-à-vis the "unconscious" consciousness of a "virtual" past. We wish to show that the Bergsonian version of a critique of "the metaphysics of presence" is, for all that, an offshoot of a Platonic type of metaphysics. It is true that Bergson departs from traditional stand-points on the side of a self-sufficient and original present and a form of presence to which the transparency of consciousness would confer the character of immediate evidence. All the same, it can hardly be claimed that his rehabilitation of the past and the unconscious opens up new perspectives on how forgetting and death are bound up with the work of memory.<br>

Abstract: The Secret Staircase is the title given to an installation presented by Caroline Isgar and Michèle Roberts at the Foundling Museum of London in 2008, and also to the accompanying book, a collection of Isgar's drawings and Roberts's eighteen narrative pieces, meant as a souvenir of the exhibition. Roberts tells the story of a daughter's recollection of her childhood and her life with her mother on the occasion of the latter's approaching death. Each piece is inspired by an object belonging either to the past or to the experience of the mother's confinement in a hospice. Roberts's contribution to the installation constitutes a memory text in its own right, and suggests that writing is the actual trace that can bring the past to life and the means by which the daughter comes to terms with the mother figure. The Secret Staircase es el título de la exposición presentada por Caroline Isgar y Michèle Roberts en el Foundling Museum de Londres en 2008, y también el del libro que la ilustraba, una colección de los dibujos de Isgar y dieciocho narraciones breves, proyectados como souvenir de la exposición. Roberts cuenta los recuerdos de infancia de una hija junto a su madre con ocasión de la inminente muerte de ésta. Cada texto se inspira en un objeto que pertenece al pasado o a la experiencia de confinamiento en el hospital. La contribución de Roberts constituye en sí misma un texto de la memoria y sugiere que la escritura es la verdadera huella que devuelve el pasado a la vida y el medio por el cual la hija se reconcilia con la figura materna.<br>

Publisher: University of Manitoba<br>
Issue: i24778422<br>
Date: 3 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): DOHERTY GERALD<br>
Abstract: This essay applies Roman Jakobson's binary system of rhetoric to the representation of death in Women in Love. While Lawrence's novel harks back to traditional configurations of death as metaphoric event, geared to transformations, it also anticipates contemporary conceptions of death as metonymic event, stripped of meaning and devoid of transcendental resonance.<br>

una «universal déclaration of duties of the living to the death», deberes vinculados al respeto a la
dignidad de los muertos, de los cuales derivan derechos a la memoria (moum, bury, commemo-
rate) y a la historia (the right to know the truth about past human rights abuses): 1. El deber de
proteger la integridad del cuerpo del muerto (Body). 2. El deber de honorar al muerto mediante
ceremonias fúnebres (Funeral). 3. El honor de to bury o incinerar al muerto (burial). 4. El deber
de respetar las últimas voluntades del muerto respecto a cuerpo y propiedad (will). 5. El deber de
identificar al muerto y de registrar la causa de la muerte (identity). 6. El deber de valorar la priva-
cidad y reputación del muerto contra el interés público «when depicting them (Image)». 7. El deber
de valorar «when disclosing facts about them» (Speech). 8. El deber de identificar y salvaguardar

Abstract: This essay argues for theatre as a mode of becoming rather than one of vanishing. By working through the temporal constructs that have traditionally fostered a sense of transience in performance, this essay attempts to establish appearance as a category of thought. It focuses on the praxis of performance, taking as its example a 2002 production in the Philadelphia Fringe Festival entitled machines machines machines machines machines machines machines and its subsequent unfolding in the everyday. Contrary to the dominant critical model of thought that casts theatre as inevitably and unstoppably moving towards its own end, absence, and death, this essay contends that performance is a force of animate presence, continuation, and becoming.<br>

Abstract: A claim associated with Leo Strauss, but one that could with some amendment of
content or temper be applied to analytical theorists also. An entertaining irony, in that
Strauss and the analytical (he would have called them positivistic) theorists were in almost
all other respects diametrically opposed. See, for example, Leo Strauss, What is Political
Philosophy (Chicago, 1954); and Barry 'The Strange Death of Political Philosophy'.<br>

Issue: i325476<br>

Author(s): Vidler Ken<br>
Abstract: I focus on Nietzsche's architectural metaphor of self-construction in arguing for the claim that postmodern readings of Nietzsche misunderstand his various attacks on dogmatic philosophy as paving the way for acceptance of a self characterized by fundamental disunity. Nietzsche's attack on essentialist dogmatic metaphysics is a call to engage in a purposive self-creation under a unifying will, a will that possesses the strength to reinterpret history as a pathway to "the problem that we are". Nietzsche agrees with the postmodernists that unity is not a pre-given, however he would disavow their rejection of unity as a goal. Where the postmodernists celebrate "the death of the subject" Nietzsche rejects this valorization of disunity as a form of Nihilism and prescribes the creation of a genuine unified subjectivity to those few capable of such a goal. Postmodernists are nearer Nietzsche's idea of the Last Man than his idea of the Overman.<br>

Abstract: Mass death resulting from war, starvation, and disease as well as the vicissitudes of extreme poverty and enforced sexual servitude are recognizably pandemic ills of the contemporary world. In light of their magnitude, are repentance, regret for the harms inflicted upon others or oneself, and forgiveness, proferring the erasure of the guilt of those who have inflicted these harms, rendered nugatory? Jacques Derrida claims that forgiveness is intrinsically rather than circumstantially or historically impossible. Forgiveness, trapped in a paradox, is possible only if there is such a thing as the unforgivable. "Thus, forgiveness, if there is such a thing," can only exist as exempt from the law of the possible. Does this claim not open the way for hopelessness and despair? More troubling for Derrida is his concession that forgiveness may be necessary in the realm of the political and juridical. If so, is not the purity of the impossibility of forgiveness so crucial for him, contaminated? In pointing to some of the difficulties in Derrida's position, I shall appeal to Vladimir Jankelevitch's distinction between the unforgivable and the inexcusable. I shall also consider the significance of repentance in the theological ethics of Emmanuel Levinas and Max Scheler. Forgiveness, I conclude, is vacuous without expiation, a position that can be helpfully understood in the context of Judaism's analysis of purification and acquittal in the Day of Atonement liturgy. I argue that what disappears is Derrida's assurance of the impossibility of forgiveness, a disappearance that allows for hope.<br>

Article Title: The Effectiveness of Totemism: 'Increase Ritual' and Resource Control in Central Australia<br>
Publisher: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland<br>
Issue: i330173<br>
Date: 9 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Morton John<br>
Abstract: Central Australian Aboriginal `increase ritual' has often been seen exclusively as an attempt to control environmental forces. Following Durkheim's early arguments against this view, and expanding them to encompass a psychoanalytic perspective, it is argued that the direct effect of so-called `increase ritual' is psychological, but that this effect has consequences for the maintenance of resources in a hunter-gatherer society. `Increase ritual', as Durkheim suggested, is structured as a form of sacrifice. It is also, as Freud suggested, linked to the death of the father. It is argued here that these symbolic themes relate practically to the control which mature men exercise over the reproduction of the social and natural orders.<br>

Author(s): Malraux Vincent<br>
Abstract: Inspiré du récit de Joseph Kessel, "L'Armée des ombres," film de Jean-Pierre Melville, semble à bien des égards symboliser ce qu'a été l'engagement résistant. Mais s'agissait-il de représenter la Résistance ou de réfléchir sur les termes de sa figuration? Retour sur un film - mal reçu à sa sortie - qui constitue un cas d'école. Film inspiré du récit de Joseph Kessel, L'Armée des ombres ne constitue pas un film sur la Résistance, mais présente une réflexion sur les termes de sa figuration. Melville n'était sans doute pas mal placé pour proposer cette réflexion, comme cinéaste, bien sûr, mais comme résistant également - encore que son itinéraire, durant les années sombres, soit difficile à retracer. Le film, à sa sortie, fut mal reçu, en raison notamment d'une approche jugée gaulliste. Le décalage temporel nous montre pourtant que cette œuvre reste rebelle à toute classification. Tout en étant largement fidèle au récit de Kessel, elle élimine toute référence au politique, choisit de présenter la Résistance dans la variété de ses membres - qu'unit toutefois la mort qui les attend. Elle se caractérise surtout par une sobriété proche de l'épure qui évite, notamment, de transfigurer les résistants en héros. Melville, au demeurant, préfère filmer les hommes dans la délibération plutôt que dans l'action - une approche qui tranche avec les partis pris retenus par Claude Berri dans Lucie Aubrac. Les acteurs - connus - n'en sont pas moins devenus, aux yeux des spectateurs, l'incarnation symbolique mais vivante des résistants qui forgèrent l'armée des ombres. /// Le visage de l'histoire. A film inspired by Joseph Kessel's accounting, "The Army of the Shadows" is not a film on the Resistance, but presents thinking on the terms of its representations. Melville was undoubtedly in a good position to propose this thinking, as a filmmaker of course but also as a resistant, even though his itinerary during the dark years was hard to follow. When it came out the film was not well recei~<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo expone los principales resultados de una investigación realizada con el objeto de analizar el papel que cumplen las emociones colectivas en el mantenimiento del orden social. En concreto, trata de explicar el hecho de que las noticias más importantes que aparecen en los medios de comunicación sean noticias de horror, es decir, noticias en las que la muerte siempre aparece en el primer plano de la escena. Los informativos de los medios de comunicación expresan y fomentan la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. Ahora bien, para entender esta cultura es preciso determinar previamente la naturaleza emocional del horror, así como establecer una definición sociológica de este sentimiento. El horror es una emoción compleja compuesta por sentimientos de terror, de asco y de conmoción. El horror, sociológicamente, puede entenderse como "la emoción mediante la que un orden social señala sus límites más extremos". El estudio concluye señalando que existen dos modos alternativos de mantener el orden y la cohesión en el seno de un sistema social. El primer modo de legitimación, característico de las sociedades centrípetas, funciona mediante la gran potencia atractiva que ejerce sobre el campo social un núcleo central de valores sociales positivos. El segundo, característico de las sociedades centrífugas, funciona mediante la gran potencia repulsiva que ejercen sobre el campo social las transgresiones flagrantes del orden moral. El modo típico en el que las sociedades centrífugas regulan el orden social explica la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. /// This article sets out the main results obtained from a research study carried out for the purpose of analysing the role that collective emotions play in maintaining social order.

Abstract: La réanimation et les techniques employées ont bousculé notre rapport à la mort, déjà professionnalisée et médicalisée. L'étude de quatre services de réanimation, en France et en Grande-Bretagne, permet de faire apparaître la réalité des pratiques concrètes de la mort et de la replacer au cœur des relations professionnelles et des expériences personnelles. Au terme de ce travail, la décision de fin de vie apparaît être une véritable construction sociale : loin d'être purement objective et médicale, elle est conditionnée par des effets de contexte et par l'engagement des acteurs. La recherche d'autonomie et d'autorégulation professionnelle renforce l'ambivalence du processus de "mourir" déjà complexe puisque régi par des logiques très hétérogènes. La mort dépend plus de l'organisation et de la culture de chaque service que de la volonté du patient ou de ses proches. /// Intensive care units and their techniques have considerably altered our attitude towards death as well as the death process - a process that had already been professionalised and medicalised. This study of four intensive care units in France and Britain brings to light the reality of deathrelated practices and resituates that reality at the core of professional relationships and personal experiences. Study results strongly suggest that the decision to end life is a genuine social construction : far from being purely objective and medical, it is heavily conditioned by context and actors' commitment. The search for professional autonomy and self-regulation has increased the ambivalence of the dying process, already complex because governed by numerous and heterogeneous logics. This study shows that our death depends more on the organization and the culture of the intensive care unit than on our own wishes or those of close relatives. /// Behandlung und technische Mittel in der Intensivstation haben unser Verhaltnis zum Sterben grundlegend verändert und es heute schon zu einer medizinischen Berufssache g~<br>

Author(s): Maldonado-Torres Nelson<br>
Abstract: This article aims to "unthink" influential philosophical articulations of the crisis of Europe in order to articulate a non-Eurocentric epistemological position that aims to give a consistent expression to the interrelational approach of wprld-systems analysis. This alternative epistemology demands and foments a postimperial Utopia and requires no less than the death of ideals that defend the epistemological superiority of European Man. An analysis and critique of works by Edmund Husserl, Immanuel Wallerstein, and Walter Mignolo lead to the formulation of a positive conception of the crisis of Europe and to weak versions of Utopia and "colonial difference." The alternative articulation of these concepts aims to make more flexible and productive the links between knowledge and location. In this way, this article intends to bridge the gap between Wallerstein's world-systems approach and Mignolo's concern with the limits of Eurocentric critiques of Eurocentrism.<br>

Article Title: Being and 'Non-Being' in Ambonwari (Papua New Guinea) Ritual<br>
Publisher: University of Sydney<br>
Issue: i40014217<br>
Date: 6 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Telban Borut<br>
Abstract: By focusing on children involved in the ritual practices in Ambonwari village, East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea, this essay compares two types of ritual: that of healing and that of male initiation. Like other life crisis rituals both deal with two dimensions of the Ambonwari life-world, that is with the living and the dead and, in a broader sense, with people and spirits. Though both are based upon the same cosmology there are fundamental differences between them. First, healers in healing ceremonies treat uninitiated children as 'non-beings'. From the perspective of Ambonwari 'selves' or 'beings', children belong to this domain. They exist as extensions of their parents or carers, from whom they cannot be separated conceptually. Second, by examining the Ambonwari concepts of negation I show that healers do not approach the domain of cosmological non-existence: they are not concerned with the cosmogony of the Ambonwari life-world. The male initiation rituals do just the opposite, however. It is only in the male initiation ritual, seen as a cosmogonic event, that young boys are cut off from their parents and 'thrown' abruptly into a state of becoming. Unlike the healing rites, these rituals treat young boys as both Ambonwari beginnings and Ambonwari beings. I argue that Ambonwari initiation rituals are not concerned with symbolic death followed by rebirth, but with states of being. Initiation means that death becomes possible for a child. The initiated boy will now be able to die as an Ambonwari being.<br>

Abstract: Por ocasião do cinquentenário da morte de Freud, ocorrida em 1989, multiplicaram-se as homenagens e as publicaçães que acentuaram não só os aspectos clínicos da sua obra científica, mas também o valor e a significação cultural da Psicanálise. O mesmo haveria de ocorrer uma década mais tarde por ocasião do centenário da publicação de A Interpretação dos Sonhos, obra inaugural da técnica psicanalítica e uma das principais marcas na história da psicologia contemporânea. Com opresente artigo, o autor pretende demonstrar até que ponto a Psicanálise é ainda hoje uma teoria e uma prática tão viva como conflitiva, mostrando, além disso, até que ponto ela assumiu, tal como Freud previra, um carácter de autêntica revolução científica e epistemológica, similar à copernicana ou a darwiniana nos seus respectivos momentos historicos. Neste sentido, para la de analisar diversas posturas culturais em relação à Psicanálise, as quais nos interrogam acerca da sua presumível universalidade, o artigo mostra também até que ponto a descoberta do Inconsciente constitui profundo abalo no estatuto do sujeito humano. /// At the time the fiftieth anniversary of Freud's death occurred, which happened in 1989, many celebrations and publications took place, many of which highlighting not only the clinical aspects of Freud's work, but also the cultural value and meaning of Psychoanalysis. Something similar occurred ten years later on the occasion of the centenary of the publication of the The Interpretation of Dreams, work of fundamental importance for the understanding of the psychoanalytic method and one of the main moments in the history of modern psychology With the present article, the author aims at demonstrating to what extent Psychoanalysis is still a theory and a practice as lively as it is conflictive, showing, among other things how it came to assume, as Freud himself had predicted, a character of an authentic scientific and epistemological revolution, in many ways similar to the Copern~<br>

Author(s): Hart Kevin<br>
Abstract: "Mystic Maybe's": the title comes from Augustine Birrill's words on the death of Matthew Arnold. Is it true that Richard Kearney's philosophy of religion, like Arnold's reflections on the Bible, are "mystic maybe's," mere flirtations with possibility? In order to answer this question I seek to understand Kearney's expression "the God who may be" and to see if it fits into a non-metaphysical philosophy of religion. The expression is clarified by way of comparisons with Wolfhart Pannenberg's eschatological understanding of God and Eberhard Jungel's theology of possibility. One weak point in Kearney's philosophy of religion, it is argued, is its avoidance of theology in the name of the philosophy of religion. A sound philosophy of religion needs to engage with theology. /// "Mystic Maybe's" (Possibilidades místicas): Este titulo deriva das palavras de Augustine Birrill acerca da morte de Mathew Arnold. O autor do artigo pergunta até que ponto a filosofia da religião de Richard Kearney não será, tal como as reflexões de Arnold acerca da Bíblia, um mew "místico talvez", um simples namoro com a possibilidaãe. Em ordem a responder à questão, o autor procura compreender o sentido da expressão de Richard Kearney acerca do "Deus que pode ser" de modo a avaliar até que ponto a expressão se adequa a uma filosofia não-metafísica da religião. O artigo clarifica a expressão de Kearney mediante uma comparação quer com a compreensão escatológica de Deus de Wolfhart Pannenberg quer com a teologia da possibilidade de Eberhard Jüngel. Mostra-se, desta forma, que um dospontos maisfracos na filosofia da religião de Richard Kearney consiste na sua tentativa de escapar à teologia em nome da filosofia da religião. Com efeito, argumenta o autor do artigo, uma autêntica filosofia da religião não pode deixar de estar num diálogo eficaz com a teologia.<br>

Article Title: Lonergan and Girard on Sacralization and Desacralization<br>
Publisher: Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40014514<br>
Date: 12 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Doran Robert M.<br>
Abstract: The paper appeals to Rene Girard for help in specifying what might be meant by four categories suggested by Bernard Lonergan: (1) a sacralization to be dropped and (2) a sacralization to be fostered; (3) a secularization to be welcomed and (4) a secularization to be resisted. The key text that is analyzed with Girard's help is Lonergan's paper "Sacralization and Secularization," where these cateories are introduced. Key to the discrimination of the sacred is the Law of the Cross, which is here amplified by Guard's analysis of the single victim mechanism and its reversal, as these are definitively revealed in the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus. But key to the discrimination of the secular are Lonergan's transcendental precepts, which are a specification of nature as a genuine category, one that would enhance Girard's mimetic theory. Lonergan and Girard are judged to be complementary and mutually supportive. /// O presente artigo busca auxílio na obra de René Girard em ordem a especificar o possível significado de quatro categorias sugeridas por Bernard Lonergan: (1) uma sacralização a ser rejeitada e (2) uma sacralização a ser promovida; (3) uma secularização a ser acolhida e (4) uma secularização que deve ser resistida. O textochave a ser analisado com a ajuda de Girard é o artigo de Lonergan "Sacralização e Secularização", no qual estas quatro categorias são introduzidas. A chave para o discernimento do Sagrado é a Lei da Cruz, a qual neste artigo é amplificada mediante a análise girardiana do mecanismo victimário e da sua superação, tal como eles são definitivamente revelados na paixão, morte e ressurreição de Jesus. Mas a chave para o discernimento do secular encontra-se nos preceitos transcendentais de Lonergan, os quais são uma especificação da natureza como categoria genuína, uma que é capaz de aprofundar a teoria mimética girardiana. Em suma, o artigo mostra de que modo Lonergan e Girard devem ser considerados complementares e suportadores um do ou~<br>

Abstract: Segment contestataire de la biomédecine moderne, le mouvement des soins palliatifs constitue actuellement un « paradigme global » de prise en charge du mourir, de la mort et du deuil, proposant simultanément une approche holistique du malade, un modèle d'organisation des soins, une éthique alternative et un projet politique dont l'ensemble fusionne en une synthèse inédite. Aussi, l'impact grandissant des soins palliatifs en France mérite que l'on retrace l'historique de leur institutionnalisation et que l'on mette au jour les fondements idéologiques (clinique, humaniste, herméneutique et chrétien) de leur doctrine. Ainsi définis, les soins palliatifs incarnent-ils à nos yeux un mouvement paradoxal de médicalisation du mourir contemporain. Contestant segment of the modem biomedical world, the palliative care movement represents a « Paradigm » of care of the dying, death and mourning, proposing simultaneously holistic approach of patient, work organisation, alternative ethics and political project which blend into an original synthesis. Thus, the growing impact of palliative care in France leads us to retrace the history of their institutionalisation and to analyse the ideological basements (clinical, humanistic, hermeneutic and Christian) of their doctrine. So defined, the palliative care movement embodies a paradoxical movement of medicalization of contemporary dying.<br>

Abstract: The article investigates social and cultural conditions of the institutionalization of pet cemeteries in modern Western societies. After a brief description of their characteristics and their historical origins, such as urbanization, it is shown that (a) the trend of institutionalization is in the long run sociostructurally based on changes of the private lifeworld—especially of the family —, and on processes of individualization in society. In a further step (b), the increasing relevance of the pets' death is related to the contemporary conditions of the dying of human beings, particularly to the so-called "rarely dying". In regard to the cultural context (c), it is argued that pet burials may be considered as a ritual expression of a new totemism, which is grounded on the zoosemantics of the "betwixt-and-between"-position of the athropomorphically experienced pet. Finally, the corresponding tendency to a "numinosic" view of the pet animal is briefly exemplified with two different types of modern pet graves.<br>

Abstract: After the 'death of God', it would be a mistake to continue to think of eros in terms of a longing for possession ofthat which one is lacking, especially in matters of religion. Alongside Plato's Diotima, Kierkegaard, Levinas and even Heidegger, an alternative view of eros is proposed in which eros is gradually letting go of its possessive cravings in order to open itself for the other. In this way, eros is bent in the directionof the unselfish service of the other. The question is then asked which kind of understanding of being is implied by this redirection of eros. The answer is taken from a thinking of the meaning of being in terms of self-givenness and self-outpooring in beings, for beings to be 'there'. Our being at the service of the other can therefore be seen as a following of the call of being in us to become adequate to the meaning of being itself.<br>

Abstract: Hegel, refusant le déisme et son Dieu d'entendement et repensant la theologia crucis luthérienne, considère l'événement de la mort de Jésus-Christ sur la croix comme la manifestation dans l'histoire mondiale de l'amour divin trinitaire. La vie éternelle de Dieu est celle de l'amour des trois personnes divines, comme don, dessaisissement de soi et commune extase. Or la Croix révèle cet amour par la kénose du Fils, comprise comme don et mort de la mort. Par là Hegel s'efforce de penser non pas la seule mort de Dieu, mais bien la vie infinie de Dieu qui est conquête de sa vérité dans l'épreuve de l'absolu déchirement, de l'abîme de la croix. Cette vie est, par la croix, gloire de l'amour trinitaire dans le règne de l'Esprit. Hegel, refusing deism and its God of understanding, and pondering anew over the Lutheran theologia crucis, believes that Jésus Christ's death on the Cross is the manifestation of the Trinity's divine love within the history ofthe world. God's eternal life is that ofthe three divine persons embodying gift, the unravelling of one's self and common ecstasy. Now the Cross reveals such a love through the kenosis ofthe Son understood both as gift and death of death. Hence, Hegel strives at thinking not only God's death but, rather, the infinité life of God which is a conquest of its own truth through the trial of the absolute wrench of the abyss of the Cross. Such a life becomes, through the expérience of the Cross, the glory of the love of the Trinity within the realm ofthe Spirit.<br>

Abstract: Le premier volume d'inédits de Levinas comprend un hommage à Bergson rédigé en 1946. Levinas voit en Bergson celui qui s'est opposé au temps de la science et des machines au nom du temps vécu ; ceci a rendu possible la conception heideggérienne du temps comme être. Levinas souscrit à la grande découverte de Bergson. Il souligne l'intérêt de la critique bergsonienne du néant comme être biffé, mais rejette la critique du désordre qui ne serait qu'un ordre différent ; pour lui, le désordre est le chaos préalable à tout ordre. Surtout, il voit dans la durée un temps fondamental, une diachronie première, qui rend possibles les trois dimensions du temps. Et il note que la durée est une vie que la mort ne limite pas ; le temps n'est pas la marque de notre finitude. Pour Bergson, seule la matière meurt, par manque d'énergie. Bien qu'il n'ait pas suivi la méthode bergsonienne, Levinas reconnaît la supériorité de l'analyse de la durée et la prolonge dans le sens d'un immémorial subjectif. The first volume of Levinas' unpublished texts includes a tribute paid to Bergson in 1946. Levinas considers Bergson as the philosopher who opposed the time of science and machines in the name of time experienced, and this in turn paved the way to Heidegger's concept of time as being. Levinas subscribes to that major insight of Bergson. He underlines the interest of Bergson's criticism of nothingness as « being scratched out », but rejects his criticism of disorder as but a different kind of order. For Levinas, disorder is the chaos preliminary to any kind of order. Above all, he sees in duration a fundamental time, a primary diachrony which makes possible the three dimensions of time. He remarks that duration is life not limited by death: time is not the mark of our finitude. For Bergson, matter alone dies, for lack of energy. While he does not follow Bergson's method, Levinas acknowledges the superiority of his analysis of duration and takes it further in the direction of immemorial subjec~<br>

Abstract: In thought as well as in imagery, two of Auden's poems, "Death's Echo" and "Danse Macabre," appear to draw on such diverse manifestations of the medieval cult of death as lyric poems of memento mon, dialogues between the "quick and the dead," and the macabre tradition in morality plays. Combining the concept of the verbal icon (Wimsatt) with the principles of the theory of metaphor, as summarized by Ricoeur in The Rule of Metaphor (1977), the paper studies a selection of medieval poems and those of Auden as complex macro-vehicles and contrasts the possible tenors they are carrying.<br>

Abstract: This review explores the most significant dimensions and findings of phenomenological approaches in anthropology. We spell out the motives and implications inherent in such approaches, chronicle their historical dimensions and precursors, and address the ways in which they have contributed to analytic perspectives employed in anthropology. This article canvasses phenomenologically oriented research in anthropology on a number of topics, including political relations and violence; language and discourse; neurophenomenology; emotion; embodiment and bodiliness; illness and healing; pain and suffering; aging, dying, and death; sensory perception and experience; subjectivity; intersubjectivity and sociality; empathy; morality; religious experience; art, aesthetics, and creativity; narrative and storytelling; time and temporality; and senses of place. We examine, and propose salient responses to, the main critiques of phenomenological approaches in anthropology, and we also take note of some of the most pressing and generative avenues of research and thought in phenomenologically oriented anthropology.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo analiza la disputa sobre cuál sería la representación literaria más eficaz que José María Arguedas establece con los autores del llamado boom latinoamericano en los Diarios de El zorro de arriba y el zorro de abajo. En una argumentación que desarrolla ideas semejantes a las propuestas por Walter Benjamin en su ensayo "El narrador", Arguedas destaca el valor de una narradora oral como Carmen Taripha sobre los logros literarios del más significativo escritor del boom, Gabriel García Márquez. Lo importante para la representación literaria en Arguedas será la transmisión de experiencia, algo que su última novela logrará bajo la forma del testimonio de su propia muerte. This article examines the dispute regarding what would be the most effective literary representation that José María Arguedas established with the authors of the so-called Latin American boom, in the Diaries of The Fox from Up Above and the Fox from Down Below. In an argument that develops ideas similar to those proposed by Walter Benjamin in his essay "The Storyteller," Arguedas stresses the value of the storyteller Carmen Taripha over the literary achievements of the most significant writer of the boom, Gabriel García Márquez. What is important for the literary representation in Arguedas is the transmission of experience, something that his latest novel achieved in the form of the testimony of his own death.<br>

Abstract: Can the act of creation itself be considered like an infinite forgiveness that God turns to the earth and to those who live there after having preferred the waters as his place of first existence? The conference "In the beginning it was the forgiveness" held in L'Aquila in the occasion of a pluriconfessional meeting, suggests some hypothesis starting even from some biblical episodes like: the universal deluge, the Amalek's remembering, Giuseppe and his brothers, Isaac's sacrifice, and furthermore with Moses' death, to end with the forgiveness from the original sin through the entrance in the promise land. A suggestive analysis of the forgiveness in the Hebraism, seen too often as a pure religion of the contraposition law to the forgiveness given from the religion of love. The forgiveness in this way is dealt with the inter-religious point of view, and also with the human one that in the relationship between God and man has its top and beginning in the solemnity of Kippur.<br>

Abstract: Although today much of the Mayo-Yoreme sacred myths and their inherent symbolism is rather esoteric knowledge, known to a few only, the community's performance of the responso (ritual of honoring the dead) is important for the re-establishment of relationships between humans and the supernatural beings and between living persons and the ancestors. The communal experience of the responso and the sense of beingenjoined are characteristic of the spiritual experience and fundamental to the musical experience as well Since life/death of any individual is an experience tied to other individuals, I argue that a philosophical inquiry of selfhood—of both the individual and the community—may help us reason about and make possible an understanding of the responso.<br>

Abstract: As violence escalates among black males in many sectors of American life, thinkers are forced to seek solutions to this problem from a variety of perspectives. Inspired largely by a 1994 black fraternity hazing death, this article examines violence as a societal construct, not one intrinsic to individuals. The paradigmatic possibilities this approach brings to bear include: (1) the establishment of an unseverable link between race and class when studying marginalization, (2) the societal politicalization of black males in their struggle for identity, and (3) a societal approach to questions of freedom, identity, and violence where the black male is concerned.<br>

Abstract: This paper attempts to compare two lives, that of Ramana Maharshi, the beloved cereberal sage of South India, and Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis. Much has been written on both these individuals, so what this paper does is to focus on affliction as a source of insight about life, detachment, pain, existentialism and coping. By taking narratives which delineate a historical plane on which illness can be coded, I try to understand the anthromorphic nature of suffering and its consequences in these two great lives. Individuals reflect the culture of which they are a part, so what we receive through the narratives which tell us about them is significant in terms of their similarities and their differences. Who authors narratives which we analyse is of utmost significance, and both feminism and narrative analyses looks at social anthropology as benefiting from the question of the writing subject. The Nirvana principle works in Ramana Maharshi's case to create a comfort zone for helping us to think of death as dream, in Freud it works as a comfort zone to cope with existence. Human beings work with ideas in order to evaluate the nature of life and survival, or with death as an attribute which too is natural and part of the order of reality. Paul Ricoeur's work helps me to build a bridge between the two thinkers, Ramana Maharshi and Freud, in terms of the application of the concepts of Eros, Thanatos and Ananke.<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the options that narrative and language have in their attempts to capture or describe traumatic experience and death. It concentrates on two prose texts by Karel Čapek, Obyčejný život and Povětroň, and the first phase of Freudian psychoanalysis, pointing at generally distinguishable limits and distortions that arise when narrative and language come in contact with trauma and death. Contrary to the current trend within „trauma studies“ , the article does not deal with autobiographical records of traumatic experience. It rather tries to point out that thinking consistently about the connection between memory, language and trauma tends to blur and question the traditional distinction between fiction (understood as a work of imagination) and autobiography (taken as a description of real events). It also tries to show that psychoanalysis arrives, explicitly and implicitly, at a similar conclusion. The last part of the article poses the question what the resulting relationship between the outside (narrated, written Story) and the „inner“ experience is like, and to what extent the structure of this dyad can also be questioned.<br>

Abstract: Primo Levi's If This Is a Man is a central work in understanding the way in which the subjective memory of a Holocaust survival receives a general meaning. This requires a context in which the duty to prevent the repetition of the tragic events endured by European Jews becomes a universal responsibility we must assume. This text examines the process of dehumanization and total degradation of a human being in the conditions of the death camp, and examines the antidote that Levi proposes for escaping the state of existential pathology. Particular emphasis is placed on the way in which Levi, who embraces secular humanist values, uses religious background and religious symbolic structures in order to provide additional understanding of the fact that in the absence of God, the world itself becomes void of humanity.<br>

Abstract: L'ontologie heideggérienne de l'être-pour-la-mort a souvent servi de référence négative à Paul Ricoeur. Il lui a très tôt opposé trois thèses qu'il n'aurait peut-être pas formulées s'il n'avait pas croisé la philosophie de Jaspers: a) « La naissance signifie plus que la mort » ; b) « la rencontre décisive avec la mort est la mort de l'être aimé » ; c) « la mortalité elle-même doit être pensée sub specie vitae et non sub specie mortis ». La première thèse conditionne les deux suivantes. Elle introduit une phénoménologie de l' « être-envie » qui en appelle de la vie reçue à la vie transmise. On objectera peut-être que la phénoménologie de l'être-en-vie suppose l'ontologie de l'être-pour-la-mort. Mais, même si c'était le cas, elle n'en transformerait pas moins profondément la signification. La compréhension de l'existence est affectée elle-même par les phénomènes de la vie reçue et transmise. C'est ce que veut dire cette expression: « exister vivant ». L'angoisse de la fin n'annule pas la joie des commencements. Peut-être même reçoit-elle de celle-ci son sens. Paul Ricoeur has often referred to Heidegger's ontology of being-towards-death to oppose it. He early set against it three thesis that he might have formulated differently had he not studied Jasper's philosophy : a) « birth means more than death » ; b) « the decisive encounter with death is the death of the loved one » ; c) « mortality itself must be thought sub specie vitae, not sub specie mortis ». From the first thesis, can be inferred the two others. It brings in a phenomenology of being-alive. One may raise the objection that the phenomenology of being-alive presupposes the ontology of being-towards-death. But even so it would be necessarily transform its meaning. The understanding of existence is itself affected by the phenomena of life as given and received. Such is the meaning of the phrase: « existing alive ». The distress of the end never cancels the joy of the beginnings. It may even get its sense from~<br>

Abstract: C'est dans le tome III de Temps et récit, paru en 1985 que, dans le cadre d'un chapitre intitulé « L'aporétique de la temporalité », Paul Ricœur entre directement en débat avec l'auteur d'Être et temps. Bien qu'il souligne d'emblée l'originalité proprement phénoménologique de l'analyse heideggérienne du temps qui a le mérite de rompre avec le subjectivisme d'Augustin et de Husserl, il ne l'en soumet pas moins à une critique sévère, centrée sur deux points principaux : le privilège donné à l'être pour la mort, qu'il oppose à l'insouciance spinoziste à l'égard de la mort et au privilège donné à la natalité par Hannah Arendt, et l'aporie inhérente à la conception heideggérienne d'une finitude de la temporalité et d'un concept vulgaire du temps, qui ne permet pas, selon lui, à Heidegger de rendre compte aussi bien du temps historique que du temps de la nature. On s'efforce ici, en prenant appui sur les textes mêmes de Heidegger, de répondre point par point à cette critique. In the chapter entitled « The Aporetic of Temporality » of the third volume of Time and Narrative, published in 1985, Paul Ricœur enters directly into a debate with the author of Being and Time. In spite of the fact that he begins by emphasizing the originality of the Heideggerian time-analysis which breaks with Augustine's and Husserl's subjectivism, he nevertheless submits it to a severe critique which is centred on two main points : first, the privilege given to the being toward death, which Ricœur opposes to Spinoza's carelessness regarding death and Arendt's privilege given to natality, and secondly, the aporia involved in Heidegger's conception of a finite temporality and of a vulgar concept of time, which in his view does not allow to take into account historical time as well as natural time. This paper undertakes, on the basis of Heidegger's texts themselves, to give a detailed answer to Ricœur's critique.<br>

Abstract: This article interprets Mark 14:22-25, using one of the new approaches in biblical interpretation, namely, pragmatic analysis. In pragmatic analysis, a text is considered a linguistic unit composed of linguistic elements (signs) with the scope of communicating a message. Interpretation involves examining the linguistic elements, the relationship between them (the syntax), their semantic valence in view of their communicative potentiality. Reading Mark 14:22-25 with this approach leads us to the conclusion that the evangelist included the institution account in his Gospel primarily to explain the significance and effect of Jesus' death to the reader. By adequately preparing the reader on the power of the word of Jesus before coming to read the institution account, Mark achieves a rhetorical effect: the conviction of the power of the words of Jesus and an admiration for the generosity of Jesus. This elicits in the reader an attraction to enter into Jesus' covenant.<br>

Abstract: L'analyse lexicométrique des réponses à une question ouverte posée le lendemain de la mort de Fr. Mitterrand permet de mettre en évidence le champ des représentations sociales, qui forment à ce moment particulier l'image de l'ancien président. Au-delà du discours consensuel imposé par les circonstances, il est possible de mettre à jour des différences dans l'usage des stéréotypes. Les variables classiques de la sociologie politique déterminent des représentations différentes du porte-parole: l'abolition de la peine de mort, les 39 heures, la 5e semaine de congés payés, le Grand Louvre sont diversement associés au défunt président. De la même manière, les citations sélectives de caractéristiques psychologiques comme l'intelligence, la culture ou la simplicité sont le produit de logiques sociales. On peut aussi montrer que les représentations, en tant que lieux communs, constituent des « lieux de mémoire » et sont structurées par des logiques symboliques. L'image ainsi comprise « stocke », organise et condense cognitions et affects liés aux dimensions individuelles et collectives, privées et publiques, d'un porte-parole. A lexicometric analysis of answers to an open question asked the day after François Mitterrand's death clarifies the field of the social representations which then made up the former president's image. Beyond the consensual discourse imposed by circumstances, there were differences in the use of stereotypes. The classic variables of political sociology determine different representations of the leader : the abolition of capital punishment, the 39-hour work week, the fifth week of paid vacations, and the Grand Louvre are variously associated with the late former president. Similarly, references to psychological characteristics such as intelligence, culture or simplicity are the results of social logics. It can also be shown that representations as common places make up « sites » and are structured by symbolic logics. The image thus understood « stocks ~<br>

Abstract: A célebre afirmaçāo de Nietzsche acerca da morte de Deus corre, hoje em dia, o risco de se tornar num lugar comum incapaz de alcançar o seu profundo significado. No entanto, o evento anunciado pelo filósofo alemāo - de um mundo e de urna cultura sem Deus - começa a ser uma realidade nas sociedades ocidentais, ditas pós-modernas. De facto, como assinala Joseph Ratzinger, as sociedades hodiernas parecem organizar-se cada vez mais corno se Deus não existisse. Neste contexto, procurarei mostrar como o evento de um mundo sem Deus constituí urna oportunidade para o cristianismo ressurgir de um modo mais autêntico. Em primeiro lugar, irei analisar a afirmação nietzschiana Gott ist to" na complexidade da sua obra. De seguida, irei comparar a morte de Deus em Nietzsche com os conceitos de ateísmo crìstão e de crìstianismo num mundo adulto em Bonhoeffer, detectando semelhanças e contrastes entre ambos. Por firn, tentarei mostrar como a proposta bonhoefferiana se torna mais inteligível quando se procura realizar o moderno ideal de autenticidade, adoptando alguns argumentos de Charles Taylor. The well-known Nietzsche's statement about the death of God risks, nowadays, to become a common place whose deeply sense is difficult to grasp. Nevertheless, the event the German philosopher proclaimed - that is, a world and a culture without God - starts to have place in the contemporary Western societies, called post-modern. As Joseph Ratzinger argues, the contemporary societies seem to be organized more and more as if God did not exist. In this context, I will show how this event could be an opportunity for Christianity be lived in a more authentic way. First, I will analyse Nietzsche's affirmation Gott ist tot in the complexity of his work. Then, I will compare Nietzsche's death of God with Bonhoeffer s concepts of a Christian atheism and a Christianity in an adult world, highlighting similarities and differences between them. At the end, I will try to argue that the bonhoefferian prop~<br>

Author(s): de Marco Alessandra<br>
Abstract: The present paper investigates Don DeLillo's 1972 End Zone, arguing that football is a metaphor for war and that DeLillo's analysis of football and its culture effectively constitutes a critique of the war mentality undergirding American society. In this novel DeLillo meditates on the historical process that historian Michael S. Sherry calls the "militarization" (xi) of the USA and that, since the 1930s, turned the country into a military and economic superpower allowing a war mentality to enter deep into the grain of American culture. The essay will read DeLillo's focus on language against Nicholas Abraham and Maria Torok's psychoanalytical theories on demetaphorization as the linguistic counterpart of melancholia and against Herbert Marcuse's notion of functional language as a linguistic behavior that facilitates the annihilation of critical thinking. Both functional language and demetaphorization allow militarization to enforce its own discourse. Suffering from melancholia, the novel's protagonists fall prey to incorporation, a process whereby they disavow death as the product of war and, with it, pain, suffering, and destruction. As a result, the novel offers a cautionary tale about the consequences arising from an excessive exaltation of war as a means through which a nation seeks to affirm its "apotheosis" (End Zone 162).<br>

Abstract: According to German criminal law, a person who violates a criminal law rule will be excused under the conditions of § 35 German Criminal Code (necessity as an excuse). What are the reasons for not holding an offender responsible in these cases although he may have even caused the death of his victim? In section II of this essay, the usual answers to this question are analysed. The result is that none of them is utterly convincing. They all have in common that they underestimate the importance of the victim's interest in his personal freedom. In section III, the author puts forward his own interpretation of § 35 German Criminal Code. This interpretation is based on the distinction between two meanings of legal freedom. In the first place the members of a legal community are obliged to respect the „negative freedom“ of each other. On the basis of this understanding of „freedom“ the defence of necessity appears as an alien element within the system of criminal law. However, the status of the members of a legal community is not confined to their „negative freedom.“ To some extent, the criminal law also recognizes their „positive freedom“: the interest of each individual to preserve his personal integrity. The defence of necessity in § 35 German Criminal Code can be interpreted as acknowledging the offender's „positive freedom.“ In the final section of this essay (section IV) this model of explanation is applied to a range of detailed problems raised by § 35 German Criminal Code.<br>

Publisher: Department of Anthropology, University of Pittsburgh<br>
Issue: i40182556<br>
Date: 1 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): Kitts Margo<br>
Abstract: This paper begins by summarizing a handful of well-known and recent sacrificial theories commonly applied to Greek religion. It then discusses their applicability to sacrificial scenes in Homer's Iliad and in so doing examines the focalizations, marking vocabulary and verse sequences for the Iliad's two different sacrificial traditions, the commensal sacrifice and oath-sacrifice. The essay concludes that the longer narrative context for the sacrificial scenes in the Iliad has conspicuous bearing on how the scenes are shaded and on why, for instance, commensal sacrifices ignore the victim's death while oath-sacrifices emphasize it. That narrative context eludes the theories of Rene Girard, Walter Burkert, and Jean-Pierre Vernant and Marcel Detienne. However, oath-sacrificing narratives do lend themselves well to strands of ritual theory which stress metaphorical transformation and cosmic dramatization, as articulated by James Fernandez, Clifford Geertz, Stanley Tambiah, and Howard Eilberg-Schwartz.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219834<br>
Date: 10 1, 1934<br>
Author(s): Wyzewa Rebecca<br>
Abstract: Mallarmé constructs a "crisis of verse" that mimes the circumstances of loss and the moment of lamentation to produce his celebrated poetic purity. Indeed, he constructs this purity out of the materials of ritual and philosophical defilement: not only does his poetic theory valorize death and danger, but his poetic practice largely relies on contact with the foreign, on semantic contagion, and on ambiguity. The significance of this defilement spreads in multiple directions: it is instrumental in producing newness and in mediating Mallarmé's professional rivalry with Wagner, it bears witness to the domestic crisis of the Third Republic, and it functions as a form of resistance to cultural assimilation. Moreover, because defilement is at once material and symbolic and because that "symbolism" is an obstinately obscure mode of referentiality, Mallarmé's cultivation of defilement is a recuperation of the scapegoats that "pure" philosophy necessarily exiles: the material and the hyperessential.<br>

Abstract: Embodied memories of terror and violence create new meaning and reorder the world, but in doing so they encompass the inexplicable aspects of cultural processes that have allowed the world one lives in to become an unspeakable place, hostile and death-ridden. In this article, we examine the narratives of Cambodian refugees' experiences of the Khmer Rouge regime against the backdrop of an ethnographic study of older Cambodians' lives in an inner-city neighborhood. The stories from this study of 40 Cambodians between the ages of 50 and 79 illustrate the relationship between bodily distress and memory, and between personal history and collective experience. These narratives reveal how people strive to create continuity in their lives but under certain circumstances are unable to do so.<br>

Abstract: Allusion and citation in Philip's
         She Tries Her Tongueexplicitly works to harness cultural capital from the literary canon. As she puts it, her poems are squatters in the house of language: “We have been linguistic squatters, possessing adversely what is truly ours.”
               This appropriation is of a piece with what Oswald De Andrade and K. Silem Mohammad are about in their splicing of Shakespeare, which I mentioned at the outset. In130
            Sonnagrams, Mohammad combines aleatory procedures with the strict observance of traditional meter and rhyme in his recombination of Shakespeare's sonnets. Somewhat like Pierre Menard's re-authoring ofDon Quixote, Mohammad sought to create new poems that were “quantitatively equivalent to Shakespeare's poems,” although this meant they were equivalent only “at the most basic linguistic level: the letter.” Mohammad explains his combinatorial process: “I feed each of Shakespeare's 154 sonnets one line at a time into an internet anagram engine … thus generating a new list of words from each line … The textual output … gives me a bank of raw material.”
               A quatrain from sonnet #3 (“Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest”) becomes:131
            
               As Heather McHugh puts it, Mohammad offers an “anagram as scrupulous as it is full of slang and sass.”Go softly to the Disneyland Hotel,
               Its simulacral threshold grown sublime:

               Mohammad notes that he's not interested in being “overtly influenced by Shakespeare's semantic content.”133
            
               His re-authoring is, moreover, consciously situated within a tradition of anagrams (especially those of Ferdinand De Saussure) and rewritings of Shakespeare's sonnets (he names Ted Berrigan, Bernadette Mayer, Jen B~<br>

Author(s): Salmose Niklas<br>
Abstract: The nostalgic strategies that Fitzgerald used in
         Gatsbyare then part of a more general nostalgic inclination in modernist writing. Jay Gatsby's peculiar and pathetic gesture, stretching “out his hand desperately” (153) toward the past, illustrates both modern nostalgia's teleological concern and entropic vision of modernity, and the melancholia and pain involved in this retrospection. However, Fitzgerald's particular use of narrative aesthetics integrated in a grander nostalgic scheme of creating a phenomenological experience of nostalgia, a nostalgic novel rather than a novel about nostalgia, is only rivalled, in his own time, by Virginia Woolf. InTo The Lighthouse(1927) she uses a similar structure. The death of Mrs. Ramsay, as well as the whole middle chapter in which it occurs, titled “Time Passes,” becomes a structural break in the narrative, clearly dividing the story tobeforeandafterthe war. Although not entirely uncritical of the Victorian manners of pre-war Britain, what remains is still an idyllic “airy sunny garden” (141) that is constantly revoked by the surviving characters in the last chapter, “The Lighthouse.”<br>

Abstract: No other poem expresses the violence in Liberia as does “An Elegy for the St. Peter's Church Massacred,” from
         The River Is Rising. It is a poem that details the massacre of six hundred men, women, and children at St. Peter's Church, a horrible act that made international news (Reuters). Over two hundred soldiers from the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) forced their way into the church and shot the people who had taken refuge there. For the speaker, the survival of such tragedies is more painful than death, and that is why he believes he is in a worse situation than the victims:
               
         I envy those who were massacred.
               Those who never saw their killers approach
               with heavy bootsteps that made no sound
               in the dark morning hours.<br>

Abstract: Our plight, then, is not simply that we are all in the same boat, let alone on the same ocean. Yet we are still bound by the responsbility of inhabiting the same planet. What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: This statement expresses a postmodern perspective more effectively than such concepts as deconstruction, death of God, poststructuralism, or genealogical thought. By virtue of is vagueness it articulates the absence of a defining subject, mastering terms, or a foundation for thought. It privileges varieties of approach and subject matter that destabilize each other and avoids a definitive framework that would guide the organization. Instead it offers SPEP as an open space for incompatible as well as compatible types of knowledge, approach, and philosophical sensibility. It affirms an indeterminate ambiguity in all words that people might otherwise interpret as centralizing and directive in an exclusive way. I believe that it reflects a kind of democratic pluralism rather more than the philosophical traditions could tolerate that came from Europe and played defining roles in SPEP's early years. I am quite sure that some of the organization's early leaders would consider the mission statement no less nihilistic than they found Nietzsche, Sartre, Derrida, Foucault, and all other philosophers identified as postmodern in 1980.<br>

Abstract: 1976. Heidegger's death: he joins the mighty dead and remains today as “Heidegger's ghost.” Often cited as the founder of philosophy of technology, he remains almost the only figure of a cadre of European philosophers of the early twentieth century still discussed concerning technology. I use his death date as the watershed between the “Old” and “New” technologies. Heidegger divided his technologies in various ways, most often by contrasting old, largely handcraft technologies to “Modern” or industrial technologies. Stone bridges, jugs, peasant shoes, Greek temples, and his famous hammer stand out for the first; Rhine River dams, steel bridges, the atom bomb, death chambers, and modern agriculture are examples of the modern. Modern technologies are mass-produced, gigantic, and largely mechanical—in short, “industrial” of the sort so familiar early in the twentieth century. I stick to 1976 as my watershed, in spite of the fact that most of his late work on technology was done in the mid-1950s.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: In his later writings Gianni Vattimo's “weak thought” became a “death of God” theology, one that is rooted in a reading of Heidegger and Nietzsche and as such is continuous with what we have been calling “postmodern” theology and Continental philosophy.
            
                  But Badiou and Žižek represent a departure and a discontinuity, holding up the “postmodern” for scorn. They insist on the universality of truth and its clear separation from fiction and on the decisiveness of political action as opposed to “undecidability” and what they mock as an anemic “political correctness.” They advance “strong” metaphysical thinking, and they ridicule what they call a weak and flaccid postmodern play of signifiers. In their wake, a new generation of philosophers say that Continental philosophy has no future, at least not as we know it. They would regard the anniversary meeting as a memorial service, at which we were giving loving eulogies of the late lamented. Not only are the25

Abstract: At its heighthyperbole, the absolute opening, the uneconomic expenditure, is always reembraced by aneconomyand is overcome by economy. The relationship between reason, madness, and death is an economy, a structure of deferral whose irreducible originality must be respected. This attempt-to-say-the-demonic-hyperbole is not an attempt among others; it is not an attempt which would occasionally and eventually be completed by the saying of it, or by its object, the direct object of a willful subjectivity. This attempt to say, which is not, moreover, the antagonism of silence, but rather the condition for it, is the original profundity of will in general. (1978, 61–62)<br>

Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: This framework also enhances our ability to answer two other questions. First, how is it that human action both imitates the past and mobilizes it as a resource for innovation? I follow Ricoeur and others in working to open what has often been thought of as a closed hermeneutic circle. Although they labored to unpack it, thinkers as formidable as Martin Heidegger and later Hans-Georg Gadamer nevertheless expressed concern that this circle was in fact the philosophical equivalent of a death spiral (Gadamer
         1998, 190–92, 265–66, 293–94; Heidegger1996, 142–43). Ricoeur hopefully proposed that the hermeneutic circle be considered “not a vicious but a healthy circle” (1984, 1:3). Ricoeur perceived the many latent possibilities in humanity's abilities to create and deploy news stories about an old past. But his work needs to be infused with a rhetorical sensibility in order to make this a convincing view. I believe that rhetorical scholars would be well served by returning to Ricoeur to explore how the rhetorical interest in judgment and action might contribute to our understanding of this “healthy” spiral.<br>

Abstract: Indeed, the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health reports that individuals with hope deficits experience a range of enervating feelings that include helplessness, guilt, and despair; and in extreme cases, says the institute, the hopeless may succumb to depression and suicide.
         
               Similarly, the American Psychological Association links hopelessness with helplessness, self-blame and, most notably, depression.7
            
               “People who are depressed,” the association observes, “may become overwhelmed and exhausted and stop participating in certain everyday activities altogether. They may withdraw from family and friends. Some depressed individuals may have thoughts of death or suicide.”8
            
               Clinically speaking, the hopeless are mired in distress, immiserated. They cannot lead fulfilling lives, let alone thrive. In acute circumstances, they may even choose not to live at all. Clearly, when hopelessness metastasizes into depression, it becomes a life-threatening disease. Hence, without the therapeutic restoration of hope, the forlorn remain in grave danger of frantically treading water for a while and then, with no lifeline in sight, eventually drowning from sheer debilitation in a sea of isolation and anguish. Hope, then, is undeniably critical to wellness, and, in my judgment, hope is precisely the quality that best accounts for the buoyancy Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur demonstrated throughout their long and productive lives—lives that included frustration, disappointment, and adversity along with success, satisfaction, and recognition.9<br>

Abstract: The reviewer of the collection of essay called
         The Cambridge Companion to John Updike, edited by Stacey Olster, confesses that in the middle years of the career of John Updike, he lost interest in the author's novels for the paradoxical reasons that he felt they were either too predictable, seemingly too programmatic or too unpredictable, Updike pumping up a flagging imagination with an assortment ofoutréforms and subjects. But the reviewer rejoices that the predominantly fine essays in theCompanion—by scholars such as D. Quentin Miller, Sanford Pinsker, Edward Vargo, Donald J. Greiner, and John N. Duvall—renewed his interest in the works unread, prompted him to do much catching up, and left him wondering, more ruefully than ever, upon Updike's death in January of 2009 why the novelist had never won a highly deserved Nobel Prize for Literature.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>

Abstract: This phonetic–semantic relationship purports to transcend language's failure to mean. As such it might claim to transcend (in a way we might see as Utopian in a Thomist or Blochian sense) the inherent problems of the material human condition. For Joyce this eventually represents a transformation of death (which is the ultimate loss of meaning) into life (or at least into the infinite and immortal memory that literature encompasses). The
         phonicturns thefinisinto thephoenix; yet for Joyce this symbol of resurrection and redemption is not unproblematic in itself (or in the tension between the Utopian ambition and the real history that it holds in suspension): It is “Fiendish” and “sphinxish”—it is a “foenix”—a plagiarist, a parasite, a parrot.
               It is “parody's bird” rather than any Utopian bird of paradise.122
            
               As Herring has suggested, this is a text that witnesses “language at war with itself.”123

Abstract: For Vidler, dissolution of the Soviet Empire, especially the ritualized razing of the Berlin Wall, amounted to a requiem for Marx and communism, and with them, Utopia—apparent confirmation that there really is
         no alternativeto capitalism, just as neoliberals have long believed. Arguably, this self-serving conviction does not so much bespeak a crisis of Utopia as it is a failure of imagination (which makes envisioning subversion from within all but impossible). While Vidler's association of “the fall of the Berlin Wall” with “the proclaimed death of communism and Marx” may seem reasonable enough, interpreting this as ensuring the end of Utopia disregards thepermanence of desire. In this regard, Zygmunt Bauman observes, “Imagining a better life than the existing one, a life that does not yet exist but one that could and should exist—the eternal source of ‘utopian thinking’ that never runs dry—is as rich, and possibly even richer than at the time of Sir Thomas More.”

Abstract: In contemporary Western culture, death is often made separate from life. The dying body is rendered invisible, even though sociocultural performances of death foreshadow and signify death and dying. This article challenges this signifying by arguing that death and dying are constituted performatively through the inscriptive surfaces of living, dying, and dead bodies, rendered visible by breath and breathing. The article begins by reflecting on the experience of witnessing the author's mentor's dying breath. Thinking through the dying breath, it then questions to what extent the separation of death from life is maintained by what is unspoken of the dying and dead body. Finally, the article considers the analytical implications of the argument for those who remain behind to grieve for, and remember, the dying bodies, and those to whom those bodies once belonged<br>
