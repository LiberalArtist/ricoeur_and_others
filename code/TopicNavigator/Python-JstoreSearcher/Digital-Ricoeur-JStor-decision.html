  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: The realist is right about one thing: Much of the time, international politics boils down to strategy. The calculation of advantage in the game of nations is the first condition, the final necessity, and—not to be underestimated—the continuing attraction for those who presume to be players. Therefore, it is not enough for post-realists to articulate a broader conception of scientific inquiry; if we are to move beyond realism, we shall have to provide decision makers with better instruments for strategic analysis. It may seem that these two objectives are mutually contradictory. For example, the post-realist perspective exemplifies the<br>

  Abstract: In August of 1997, I was actively second-guessing my decision to leave Vail, Colorado, to start the Master of Divinity program at Columbia Theological Seminary. My sister-in-law, Denise, a pastor in the Presbyterian Church (USA), trying to be encouraging, predicted that because I loved literature, I would surely love the Old Testament. Perhaps I was in a particularly skeptical mood, but her analogy struck me as untenable. It made as much sense as if she had said, “You love Colorado, and so surely you will love Georgia.” I couldn’t see the connection. I loved medieval tales of Arthur, Beowulf, eighteenth-century<br>

  Author(s) GOODCHILD PHILIP<br>
  Abstract: In her autobiography, Edith Stein tells us that at the age of fifteen she “deliberately and consciously” gave up praying.¹ Perhaps the most significant experience between this decision and her return to the practice of prayer with her conversion to Catholicism at the age of thirty was her contact with Edmund Husserl and his theory of phenomenology. In fact it may be the case, as Jude Dougherty has observed,² that her religious conversion was made possible by her philosophical conversion to phenomenology. Husserl, himself a convert to Christianity, understood prayer in terms of the inward turn of his transcendental phenomenology.<br>

  Abstract: Latour’s conviction that Pasteur and his allies had “redefined the social link” was clearly the result of his focused analysis of late nineteenth-century biological and medical journals. Yet one can also read this statement as the consequence of a conscious decision with political undertones.

The concept of the other, as I have partly shown in Chapter 1, plays a crucial role in Derrida’s later writings on ethics, responsibility, politics, friendship, decision, religion, sacrifice, death, and other topics. An example is the long meditation on the phrasetout autre est tout autre, “every other is wholly other,” inThe Gift of Death(GD, 82–115; DM, 114–57).

  Author(s) Dumm Thomas L.<br>
  Abstract: Thomas Hobbes’s political philosophy is based on a paradox: Hobbes, one could say, gives too much and too little to the state at the same time. He can thus be seen in the tradition of Leo Strauss, as the father of liberalism, but also, from a liberal perspective, he is dismissed as the guardian of state absolutism. Hobbes stresses the absoluteness of state power, being the sovereign, that is highest, not surmountable power, so strong that he denies to the subjects aligned with each other in the person of the Leviathan every right to defy a sovereign decision or to<br>

  Abstract: For Vladimir Jankélévitch, forgiveness presents a moral dilemma. The oscillation between the unfortunate and the wicked and the oscillation between love and evil imply a dilemma that Jankélévitch maintains is insoluble. This dilemma contains within it the tension between justice and forgiveness and forces a decision within morality itself, for forgiveness and love, according to Jankélévitch, introduce an asymmetry that is at odds with the symmetry implicit in ethics and in law. This moral dilemma consequently appears as the conflict between two moralities, or, as Jankélévitch says, as the paradox of morality itself: on the one hand, the system of<br>

  Author(s) Wallraff Charles F.<br>
  Abstract: From the days of the Milesian cosmologists to the present, philosophers have tried to pass beyond an investigation of things in being to a systematic knowledge of being itself.¹ Such attempted knowledge of being, which, due to a somewhat arbitrary decision of Andronicus of Rhodes soon came to be called “metaphysics,” has hitherto appeared as “materialism (everything is matter and mechanical process), spiritualism (everything is spirit), hylozoism (the cosmos is a living spiritual substance), and so on. In every case being was defined as something existing in the world from which all other things sprang.”² But this approach to the<br>

  Author(s) Hershock Peter D.<br>
  Abstract: A minimum standard of justice would seem to require that all U.S. children have equal access to U.S. educational institutions, and that any school admissions policy that would exclude a candidate on the basis of race or ethnicity is in clear violation of this principle. Such a basic standard has certainly been upheld by the judgment of the Supreme Court in lawsuits where it was contravened. But I want to argue that the Court in coming to such a decision not only might be failing to serve justice, but in fact would be compounding a grave injustice—at least in<br>

  Abstract: The Christian tradition has been characterized by its commitment to the significance of the Bible for life and thought. Indeed, Christian communal identity has largely been formed around a set of literary texts that together form canonical scripture. As David Kelsey remarks, acknowledging the Bible as scripture lies at the very heart of participating in the community of Jesus Christ, and the decision to adopt the texts of Christian scripture as “canon” is not “a separate decision over and above a decision to become a Christian.”¹ Yet the past two centuries have seen considerable change in the nature and function<br>

  Abstract: This chapter traces the inception of André Neher’s significant role in the renewal of French Jewish intellectual and spiritual life after the Shoah. Born in 1914 in Obernai, in the Bas Rhin region of France, he was educated as both a secular intellectual and a religiously observant Jew. (His family moved to Strasbourg, which became French in 1918.) In 1936, aged twenty-two, he began to teach German language and literature at the Collège de Sarrebourg while also pursuing yeshiva studies in Montreux, Switzerland.¹ Mobilized in 1939, Neher made a crucial life decision when the Vichy government removed him from teaching<br>

  Author(s) Parker Gabrielle<br>
  Abstract: In 1962, France withdrew from Algeria back to the French mainland, leaving behind several centuries of colonial history and almost a hundred years of permanent presence on all continents. The army was on the front lines of these events. The whole army. Not just a group of specialized troops. In Algeria, the first units to disembark in 1830 belonged to troops that would later be called “metropolitans.” The state’s will under the Third Republic to associate the nation with conquest explains the decision to send draftees to Madagascar in 1895. The same will was expressed during the Rif War of<br>

  Book Title: The Cruelest of All Mothers: Marie de l'Incarnation, Motherhood, and Christian Tradition-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dunn Mary<br>
  Abstract: In 1631, Marie Guyart stepped over the threshold of the Ursuline convent in Tours, leaving behind her eleven-year-old son, Claude, against the wishes of her family and her own misgivings. Marie concluded, "God was dearer to me than all that. Leaving him therefore in His hands, I bid adieu to him joyfully." Claude organized a band of schoolboys to storm the convent, begging for his mother's return. Eight years later, Marie made her way to Quebec, where over the course of the next thirty-three years she opened the first school for Native American girls, translated catechisms into indigenous languages, and served some eighteen years as superior of the first Ursuline convent in the New World. She would also maintain, over this same period, an extensive and intimate correspondence with the son she had abandoned to serve God. The Cruelest of All Mothers is, fundamentally, an explanation of Marie de l'Incarnation's decision to abandon Claude for religious life. Complicating Marie's own explication of the abandonment as a sacrifice carried out in imitation of Christ and in submission to God's will, the book situates the event against the background of early modern French family life, the marginalization of motherhood in the Christian tradition, and seventeenth-century French Catholic spirituality. Deeply grounded in a set of rich primary sources, The Cruelest of All Mothers offers a rich and complex analysis of the abandonment.<br>

Some of these conditions and goals include the democratic principles of respect for human rights, the rule of law, and transparent decision-making.

  Abstract: In all societies, there are differences in power between persons. There is not a single society where all adults have exactly the same influence over every decision, where everyone has exactly the same rights and duties. Social differentiation and inequality are, in other words, universal phenomena. The European ideas of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries about the ‘original primitive society’, where all humans supposedly had the same rank and were political equals, was completely devastated when the first professional ethnographers returned from the field.

  Abstract: The decision taken in 1984 to produce a compilation of the culinary heritage of France, defined as a cultural and economic inventory of traditional and regional food and cuisine,¹ reflects more than just a mere interest in the past. The creation of such an inventory illustrates the various social and economic transformations experienced by French society in recent decades. The crisis in French agriculture and the consequent restructuring of local identities have provided two of the principal driving forces behind these changes. In this context, culinary heritage can be represented as the point at which political, economic and social spheres<br>

  Abstract: Satan is part of the myth of evil and if we assume that the story is one way to approach the reality of evil, we need to examine the myth in more detail. From a secular viewpoint, any metaphysical approach to the question of evil does not work. The responsibilities for all human actions lay, since Kant, in the agent’s will and accordingly, so does the decision to commit an evil deed. Nevertheless, despite all efforts to explain human behavior with psychology, sociology, biology, and psychoanalysis, there seems to be an explanatory gap when it comes to actions that hurt<br>

This decision appears to have been made without concern for the last remaining Jewish community in Europe, then numbering 825,000 people, or for Hungarian democratic elements.

  Book Title: Taking Hold of the Real-Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Profound Worldliness of Christianity<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Harvey Barry<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer writes in one of his last prison letters that he had “come to know and understand more and more the profound this-worldliness of Christianity." In Taking Hold of the Real, Barry Harvey engages in constructive conversation with Bonhoeffer, contending that the “shallow and banal this-worldliness" of modern society is ordered to a significant degree around the social technologies of religion, culture, and race. These mechanisms displace human beings from their traditional connections with particular locales, and relocate them in their “proper places" as determined by the nation-state and capitalist markets. Christians are called to participate in the profound this-worldliness that breaks into the world in the apocalyptic action of Jesus Christ, a form of life that requires discipline and an understanding of death and resurrection. The church is a sacrament of this new humanity, performing for all to hear the polyphony of life that was prefigured in the Old Testament and now is realised in Christ. Unable to find a faithful form of this-worldliness in wartime Germany, Bonhoeffer joined the conspiracy against Hitler, a decision aptly contrasted with a small French church that, prepared by its life together over many generations, saved thousands of Jewish lives.<br>

  Abstract: Let us now quickly review the neural basis of spatial processing in the brain. The goal here is not to present a course on physiology but to show how the spatialization of perception, action, memory, and decision making reduces complexity, sometimes by way of detours that, in turn, engender simplexity This theory has been revisited several times since neuroscientist and, later, Nobel Laureate Santiago Ramón y Cajal revealed the remarkable diversity of neuronal morphology. It seems obvious when we recall that the body, or even the outside world, is represented in the brain by neural maps organized by “topies,” which<br>

What is required for a robust ethical life, writes Williams, is “moral confidence,” and moral confidence “is basically a social phenomenon.”¹ The study of the work of Paul acquires a new accent if we consider his letters in light of the question suggested by Williams’s argument: What is the social process by which a religious movement like that of the early Christians undertakes to instill moral confidence in its<br>

  Abstract: Why We Fight was the title given to a seven-part film series commissioned by the US government between 1942 and 1945 as a way to explain to Americans the issues of the Second World War. The decision to create this series arose from a belief that the majority of Americans were not fully aware of the philosophical issues involved in the war; they needed to be convinced of the dangers of isolationism and the necessity of joining the crusade against fascism.

  Abstract: Understanding why people decide to move is a complicated enterprise (Bertaux-Wiame, 1979; Ni Laoire, 2000). Although migration may be a straightforward demographic event, the context in which it occurs and the mechanisms underlying it are often highly complex, and require careful study. To begin with, it is important to consider the individual role of the migrant. To what extent do people move freely from one place to another, and to what extent are their movements impacted by structural forces and constraints? Traditional models used for understanding migration decision making have typically emphasised

  Abstract: Throughout this book we have followed women’s migration journeys across space and time as they spanned and reconstituted boundaries. Beginning with their pre-migration lives – characterised for many by fractured belonging in the UK – upper and more proximate structures enabled and facilitated their agency in moving to Spain in retirement. We have also seen that women’s positionalities and unique biographies are also significant in shaping migration choices, decision-making processes and their post-migration lives.

Second, the moment at which the monument was conceived and constructed.

  Abstract: From the nineteenth century until the mid-twentieth, European imperial powers imposed legal and economic restrictions on Siam, as Thailand was called until 1939. These restrictions limited Siam’s sovereignty in ways that made it comparable to a European colony. Siam, from this angle, appears colonized. However, this comparison uncritically locates Siam as a victim of the West without questioning the aggrandizing activities engaged in by Siam’s rulers or challenging the conformist historiography that it produces.

  Abstract: Several common themes and conclusions have emerged from the contributions assembled in this volume. First, and perhaps not surprisingly, collective memories emerge in a variety of cultural and national contexts to greatly influence various foreign policies, bilateral relationships, and international affairs. Nevertheless, the ways in which collective memories become influential factors in decision making are not always as expected. The ways that memories are used as rhetorical weapons are often surprising. Although the emotions that are embedded in these memories-as-weapons are visceral and, as with other more conventional weapons, can be highly divisive and even dangerous.<br>

Assumptions about reasoned sexual practice are rooted in conceptions of human behaviour that assume individuals can and do routinely assess risks from a narrow rationalistic point of view, and modify their behaviour accordingly.

In addition, invitations to decision makers to implement subjective ideas of evil are arguably invitations toward standardlessness, emotionally driven prosecutions, and other violations of basic guarantees of the rule of law.

  Book Title: A Theory of the Trial-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burns Robert P.<br>
  Abstract: Anyone who has sat on a jury or followed a high-profile trial on television usually comes to the realization that a trial, particularly a criminal trial, is really a performance. Verdicts seem determined as much by which lawyer can best connect with the hearts and minds of the jurors as by what the evidence might suggest. In this celebration of the American trial as a great cultural achievement, Robert Burns, a trial lawyer and a trained philosopher, explores how these legal proceedings bring about justice. The trial, he reminds us, is not confined to the impartial application of legal rules to factual findings. Burns depicts the trial as an institution employing its own language and styles of performance that elevate the understanding of decision-makers, bringing them in contact with moral sources beyond the limits of law.<br>

  Abstract: In October 1960 the German Academy for Language and Literature in Darmstadt made what might seem to be a highly peculiar decision. It presented the prestigious Georg-Büchner-Preis¹ for literature to the forty-year old poet Paul Celan, a man who had never spent any appreciable amount of time living in an officially German-speaking country. Celan was born in 1920 over a thousand kilometers east of Darmstadt in the city of Czernowitz in the Bukovina.

  Abstract: Jane addams’s decision to become a volunteer also forced her to become an advocate of social justice. The girl from rural Illinois moved to Chicago with the hope of helping disadvantaged individuals. She quickly discovered that caring for individuals could go only so far. To improve the conditions of poor people in Chicago would take the help of city hall and eventually even the federal government. With the help of labor unions and social-reform organizations, she was able to institute juvenile-court laws, the first “mother’s pension” law, tenement-house regulations, an eight-hour workday law for women, factory-inspection laws, and workers’ compensation.<br>

  Abstract: There is a wealth of secondary literature on Darwin’s species concept, covering many different perspectives of the topic.¹ Of the various accounts available, I have always been particularly intrigued by Frank Sulloway’s suggestion that Darwin’s choice of species concept was guided by “tactical” considerations. Among those tactical considerations was the decision to employ his fellow naturalists’ species concept, in order to speak to them “in their own language” (Sulloway 1979, p. 37). Implicit in the suggestion is that Darwin was a member of a fairly clear-cut community of naturalists. In order to communicate with them about natural history, either to<br>

While these do not jeopardise the monopoly of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on political decision making, they illustrate major trends and characteristics of Chinese democratisation and highlight the Chinese hybrid model of democratisation.

  Abstract: Humanitarian groups have failed, Fiona Terry believes, to face up to the core paradox of their activity: humanitarian action aims to alleviate suffering, but by inadvertently sustaining conflict it potentially prolongs suffering. In
         Condemned to Repeat?, Terry examines the side-effects of intervention by aid organizations and points out the need to acknowledge the political consequences of the choice to give aid. The author makes the controversial claim that aid agencies act as though the initial decision to supply aid satisfies any need for ethical discussion and are often blind to the moral quandaries of aid. Terry focuses on four historically relevant cases: Rwandan camps in Zaire, Afghan camps in Pakistan, Salvadoran and Nicaraguan camps in Honduras, and Cambodian camps in Thailand.<br>

Scenes of oral storytelling are fertile ground for inquiry regarding late medieval practices of story transmission, especially the dynamic relation between performance and audience reception.²<br>

  Abstract: The unprecedented decision to open the archives of the GDR’s Ministry for State Security (MfS or Stasi) in 1992 added a unique layer of documentary evidence to the memories of East Germans who had suffered at the hands of the Stasi. As Alison Lewis has written, the main objective for granting former GDR citizens access was to provide them “with evidence of the wrongs that had been committed against them.”¹ Certainly, the Stasi had never intended for these files to become public. By allowing victims to read their files, the Stasi Records Law empowered them to take control of their<br>

  Abstract: On October 13, 1936, the sheriff read aloud the jury’s verdict: “We, the jury, find Joe Hale, the defendant, guilty of the first degree of murder, fix his penalty death in the electric chair.”¹  Hale probably stood as each white juror nodded, affirming for the judge and record that he had supported that decision. An all-white grand jury had indicted him, and this all-white petit jury convicted Hale, an “illiterate, destitute” nineteen-year-old, of the murder of a forty-year-old white man, W. R. Toon. Hale had admitted he confronted—but did not kill—a white man to protect black women. Hale<br>

Instead, they continued to perform in Germany, and in many cases accepted that the Nazis used them as cultural icons, for example to promote the regime abroad or to convey ideological messages through the medium of art. Their decision to stay and perform has stimulated ongoing debates<br>

But both Nietzsche and Franz Overbeck, the theologian, were amazed by Romundt’s decision in February 1875 to convert to Roman Catholicism and become a priest. Writing to Erwin Rohde on 28 February 1875, Nietzsche described Romundt as “a domestic problem, a house ghost” (ein Hausleiden, ein Hausgespenst), and expressed his indignation at Romundt’s decision in a way that might surprise us: “Our good, pure, Protestant air!

Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: The book’s eleven essays focus on poverty or economic disadvantage: one piece deals with available data on economic variables relating to crime and legal representation, the other ten directly or in passing endorse or reject the independence thesis. The quality of the essays is mixed. On the positive side, Jeremy Waldron quickly adapts an argument from the overinclusiveness of legal rules to reject indigence as a legal justification for property crime. Stephen Morse usefully rehearses and dismisses prevalent invalid inferences from economic disadvantage to criminal nonculpability. Loren Lomasky’s welfarist libertarian case for subsidizing legal representation of criminal defendants is nicely outlined. William Heffernan’s reliance on restrictions on justifications available to decision makers is a potentially fruitful move. At points some of the essays progress by bare assignments of burdens of proof rather than hard argument. Must dependence theorists have in hand a complete theory of distributive justice? Who must show that notions of authority bar judges from invoking controversial normative theories, at least when consistent with authoritative legal sources? Who must show that criteria of legal responsibility should include morally relevant psychological variables, such as stress, in addition to minimal normative and cognitive capacities? Sometimes the argument is too brief. Because legal rules need not advertise their background justifications, defendants often plausibly can claim that deviation from a rule of property law vindicates the rule’s justification. Thus, against Waldron, it is unlikely that the mere “logic” of property rights prevents indigence from being a legal justification for property crimes. More needs to be said. Brevity particularly mars Pettit’s “republican” defense of the dependence thesis in criminal sentencing. Because the defense requires that criminal sanctions aim at assuring nondomination of victims, indigence can ground different sanc~<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Duranti argues that the theoretical insights of linguistic anthropology under the third paradigm can be realized only if practitioners acknowledge the gulfs between the paradigms and criticize, at least by implication, the assumptions of the descriptivelinguistic and ethnographyofcommunication paradigms. The recent decision of the descriptive linguists (SSILA) to meet solely with the Linguistic Society of America, although it has pragmatic motivations, also ensures that the first paradigm will be increasingly separate from the other two, as well as from anthropology. I regret the absence of SSILA colleagues from the AAAs Society for Linguistic Anthropology and deplore the consequences for the study of language within anthropology. Without reciprocal crossover to linguistic training and primary professional identity, linguistic anthropology may lose the advantage Duranti sees for the study of language/discourse/performance. I am reminded of the uniqueness of our subdiscipline every time I hear the termdiscourse casually bandied about by sociocultural anthropologists who cannot imagine doing a microanalysis of particular discourses, not to mention by Foucault and other theorists for whom the term provides an analytic abstraction characterizing whole eras across time and space. An increasing job market does not necessarily preserve this historical legacy in American anthropology (although I share Durantis delight that it is occurring). Durantis examples, moreover, persuade me that the Boasian critique of premature generalization through ethnographic counterexamples has continued to characterize the second and third paradigms. The ethnography part of the equation remains, to my mind, the key to studying both language and culture, albeit with arguably new conceptual tools such as ideology, narrative, and identity.<br>

Abstract: A clue to that failure can be detected in the very dismay with which defenders of the old rhetoric contemplated a new kind of speech whose norms derived from a new kind of writing. In 1879, for example, at the very moment in which the new managers were turning away from the old rhetoric, a noted belletrist critic, William Mathews, published an elegiac tome called
         Oratory and Orators,in which he complained explicitly about the coincidence of rhetoric’s decline with the emergence of scientific and commercial culture. In a chapter entitled “Is Oratory a Lost Art?” he laments the absence of demand for oratory, even in the political sphere: “The great majority of the questions that now come up for decision by our political assemblies turn on masses of fact, antecedents in blue‐books, tabulated statistics, which all necessitate not only elaborate inquiries, but differences of opinion after the inquiries. The Demosthenic vehemence is, therefore, out of place.” It only remains to summon this vehemence for lamenting the decline of rhetoric, done in by the modern lawyer with his crabbed technicalities, “who has no time to gather the flowers of Parnassus,” and the even more crabbed “man of business, who crams down the throat of his audience a heap of statistical facts.”28Mathews is repelled by something he cannot name exactly, not simply facts or statistics, but thesermoor discourse that has been irrevocably altered by the reign of the document, by genres of writing. This new style of communication is founded on the same act of oblivion Yates sees at the origin of the memo.29<br>

Author(s): Johar Schueller Malini<br>
Abstract: In
         Bodies That Matter(1993), a book that begins, significantly, with an epigraph from Haraway’s “A Cyborg Manifesto” (1991), Butler begins to ponder the problems of the analogical model, although race is arguably still added to arguments about gender and sexuality. The bulk of the introduction theorizes the constructedness of “sex” and interrogates the critical assumption of a prior, unmarked category of sex onto which gender is culturally imposed. Instead of constructedness, Butler proposes the notion of matter, a process that “produce[s]the effect of boundary, fixity, and surface we call matter” (1993, 9). Sex and the contours of the body, Butler argues, are regulated by the heterosexual imperative. It is only much later in the introduction, after the theorizations of the body, sex, and matter have been made, that Butler introduces, as part of her chapter summaries, the idea that “normative heterosexuality is clearly not the only regulatory regime in the production of bodily contours” (1993, 17). Structurally, that is, body, sex, and matter are constituted as the main items of theory to which race is added. As Butler argues, race is not simply another domain separable from sexual difference, “but … its ‘addition’ subverts the monolithic workings of the heterosexual imperative as I have described it so far” (18). Although Butler is clearly aware of the problems of simply adding race to the understandings of the body and of sex, her own positioning of race in the introduction is nonetheless additive. Yet Butler goes on to suggest a focus on the specificities as well as intersections of race and gender construction: “It seems crucial to resist the model of power that would set up racism and homophobia and misogyny as parallel or analogical relations. The assertion of their abstract or structural equivalence not only misses the specific history of their construction and elaboration, but also delays the important work of thinking through the ways in which thes~<br>

Abstract: What does a judge do? Let me subdivide the process of judgment, somewhat artificially, into three stages. First, the judge takes the parties seriously, treats them as equals, and assumes their authenticity and sincerity. He hears the parties out as fully as possible and takes note of the information provided by their witnesses and expert witnesses. In addition, the judge takes into account the specific situations of the two parties, especially factors that determine their singularity, uniqueness, and precariousness. Second, before passing judgment he weighs the arguments for and against the claims pressed by the parties and tries to determine the pros and cons, effects and side effects, of these. Finally he pronounces a judgment, advancing a concise argument for it. In so doing he is aware that this is merely what Ricoeur would call an “attestatory judgment,” that is to say, a judgment that is fragile, albeit carefully considered, based not on mathematical proof but on rational insight, and not on logical decision but on prudential decision; a judgment not intended to stand for all eternity but based on current data and insight that may come up for review if new information or insight is ever presented.

Abstract: It was not only the opinions of the famous that the press disseminated. In the absence of a genuine public debate, the mass media tried, in the ten days after the decision to blow up the mausoleum had been published, to substitute opinion polls and random street interviews. An express poll taken by the National Center for the Study of Public Opinion among 528 citizens of Sofia showed that, while 64 percent did not like the mausoleum (as against 36 percent who did), only 34 percent wanted it removed. A full 42 percent thought it could be transformed into something different, while 24 percent wanted it preserved as it was.
         77A Gallup poll, without disclosing its sample, published the following results: 43 percent for the preservation of the mausoleum, 27 percent for its destruction, 16 percent for a transformation, and 14 percent without an opinion.78<br>

Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: The foregoing is certainly not an exhaustive list of the elements of a practical and normative ethics for librarianship. No one person can pretend to suggest an all‐inclusive set of elements. The question to be faced is, How do we, as public professionals, address the need for a more comprehensive consideration of ethics? The answer to this question grows out of the rights‐based premises upon which this article is based. As a public profession, librarianship is committed to a democratic form of public polity. An essential part of the democratic way of being is deliberation, especially public deliberation. Among the many ways we can define democracy is by aggregative or deliberative means. An aggregative position assumes that collective preferences are given; that is, the preferences are taken to be legitimated so that no further justification is required. Invocation of the LBR or ALA’s Code of Ethics as immutable dogmas of the profession may be indicative of an aggregative definition of democracy. The principal shortcoming of this stance is that challenge of taken‐for‐granted preferences is very difficult and meets with tenacious resistance. An alternative—deliberative democracy—admits to pluralism of preferences and of participants. Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson maintain that “deliberation is generally the best way to arrive at just decision, or, more accurately, the least unsatisfactory” way [

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: This posited, Popkin furnishes a wealth of information on the origins of the historian’s autobiography (Hume, Gibbon, Vico), its nineteenth‐century expressions (Dilthey, Henry Adams), and especially its sociological and literary characteristics during the second half of the twentieth century. Most authors have been white males, from middle‐class backgrounds, nearing the end of distinguished careers. Still, women, minorities (especially Jews), historians of working‐class origin, and middle‐aged authors have made inroads since the 1980s. This produces significant differences: women, for instance, are less likely than men to link their vocation to their teenage interest in history or to depict a nurturing community of scholars. Popkin minimizes, however, the impact of sociology. Commonalities predominate in his analysis. Most historian‐autobiographers, for one, frame their life stories as bildungsroman narratives, in which the author’s personality takes shape through the choice of a vocation. Like Friedrich Meinecke, they tell tales of self‐discovery, free will, and success. Their chronological accounts usually begin with warm childhoods in families that encouraged reading, education, and a thoughtful path toward a meaningful career. They then describe the pivotal apprenticeship and university years, the key mentors, and the decision‐making process through which the authors exercised their will and defined themselves. Theirs is invariably a process of choice rather than conflict or sudden illumination, even if world events captured the imaginations of many budding historians.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: What, then, for Derrida, is European responsibility or responsibility as something specifically European? The conflicting exigencies formulated in the foregoing discussion of the concept of responsibility require the invention of a new way in which to renew, revive, or replay the figure, concept, or idea of Europe. European responsibility is, first of all, this openness to
      bothtraditions of responsibility, namely, Platonism and Christianity. It consists in exposure to the radically conflicting demands that these two traditions make upon their heirs as responsible selves. European responsibility is above all the uncompromising willingness to assume the challenge posed by the aporetic nature of inheritance itself—that is, by the constitutive lack of handed‐down rules or norms to negotiate contradiction. Consequently, Europe is the name for a responsibility that also goes hand in hand with the necessity of having to invent, each time anew, new ways of meeting mutually exclusive demands. As a simultaneous responsibility to, at first, two opposite traditions, European responsibility consists in not letting one of the traditions overturn, outplay, or outdo the other. By doing justice to its double heritage, and not shunning the necessity of negotiating conflicting demands in the absence of pregiven norms or rules, such responsibility not only entails a radical refusal of traditionalism, for structural reasons, but also is distinguished by openness to other traditions and demands. Indeed, from the moment that Europe is understood as a responsibility to more than one tradition or set of injunctions, its responsiveness and responsibility extend to all other traditions. Apart from being hospitable to other historically and culturally decisive intra‐European differences (such as Judaism and Islam—not in the abstract, however, but with all their shades and forms), as well as to the many minor, or marginal, differences within Europe, this principal openness that the name E~<br>

Author(s): Wall,  John<br>
Abstract: Moral Creativityis also a book about Paul Ricoeur. Throughout, Wall turns to Ricoeur’s philosophical and religious thought for theoretical support, using a wide range of primary and secondary literature. Wall works from a Ricoeurian idea that the self is a synthesis of activity and passivity, freedom and finitude. He finds in this ontology of selfhood a basis for conceiving of creativity as the activity of inventing free action amid the limitations of finitude. This anthropology is then tied to Ricoeur’s work on narrative identity, love, ideology, and other topics. Wall’s exegesis of Ricoeur is accurate and astute, succinctly connecting the thinker’s early and late writings on selfhood. The book faults Ricoeur for having an insufficient sense for the entrenchment of social/cultural injustice and for the radical otherness of other people. The discussion of Ricoeur and Emmanuel Levinas on otherness is one of the most interesting parts of the book but also an argument that might need expansion. Wall laments Ricoeur’s decision to separate philosophy from religious discourse, claiming this was a purely pragmatic decision whereby “Ricoeur ultimately does himself a disservice” (181). This may be so, but regardless of intent, wouldn’t we have to say that such a separation is part of the thought world projected by Ricoeur’s writings? Patching over this separation may bring Ricoeur closer to writers of the current “theological turn” of postmodernism but possibly at the price of losing one of Ricoeur’s great virtues—his usefulness in mediating between postmodernism and the modernity that insists on dividing religion and reason.<br>

Abstract: My argument presumes that Smith’s rejection of these precepts, without more, is sufficient to demonstrate Mormonism’s radical diversion from traditional Christian theology, though certainly it may be argued otherwise. See, e.g., the arguments made by Stephen E. Robinson in Craig L. Blomberg and Stephen E. Robinson,
            How Wide the Divide? A Mormon and an Evangelical in Conversation(Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity, 1997). But see also the decision of the Society of Christian Philosophers to boycott Brigham Young University and the society’s related decision to establish guidelines for regional meetings, excluding “any institution professing to be Christian while at the same time subscribing to a doctrinal position directly contradicting the ecumenical creeds accepted by all branches of the Christian Church, Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant” (Peggy Fletcher Stack, “Mormon Christian Dialogue?”http://www.beliefnet.com/story/81/story_8179_1.html).<br>

Abstract: Sometimes, although relatively rarely, the commentarial and the apologetic dimensions of a classical Indian text coincided. It was not unheard of in classical India for an author to make use of a text from a rival community for the dissemination of his own views. It appears that sometimes the decision to comment on a given text was determined less by the level of agreement between its teachings and the commentator’s own than by the recognition that that text had attained in the wider brahmanical community. See Klaus Rüping,
            Philologische Untersuchungen zu den Brahmasūtra‐Kommentaren des Śaṅkara und des Bhāskara[Philological investigations on the Brahma‐sūtra commentaries of Śaṅkara and Bhāskara] (Wiesbaden: Steiner, 1977), 67: “Dort kommt es recht oft vor, dass ein Autor einen gegnerischen Text, etwa den einer rivalisierenden religiösen Gruppe, benutzt und ihn für seine eigenen Zwecke umarbeitet” (There it often happens that an author makes use of an opponent's text, perhaps that of a rival religious group, and modifies it in accordance with his own purposes).<br>

Abstract: In the late 1970s and early 1980s, with the rewritings of Margaret Atwood, Angela Carter, Sara Maitland, Michele Roberts, Emma Tennant, Jeanette Winterson, and Christa Wolf, to name just a few, feminist re‐vision took off as (almost) a literary genre in its own right.
         9While feminist scholars of literature such as Judith Fetterley called for a “resisting reader” (1978, xx)—a reader who would resist what she termed “theimmasculationof women by men” (xx)—published writers took Rich’s words to heart and actually produced such resisting readings in new and creative texts. There seemed to be no doubt: what were needed were new stories, or at least other stories, and one way to produce those alternative stories was through wide‐scale and multiple retellings of mythic narratives. For, as critics agreed, the retelling of the classics from a new point of view constituted a radical critique of the literary tradition and of the culture it served to legitimate (e.g., Ostriker1982,1986; DuPlessis1985). This, in turn, would “provide the conditions for changing the culture that the literature reflects” (Fetterley1978, xx). In fact, this idea still has currency. In her recently published book,Adaptation and Appropriation, Julie Sanders writes, “what is often inescapable is the fact that a political or ethical commitment shapes a writer’s, director’s, or performer’s decision to re‐interpret a source text” (2006, 2). “There is frequently heartfelt political commitment standing behind acts of literary appropriation or ‘re‐vision’” (7). Likewise, Peter Widdowson maintains, “re‐visionary novels almost invariably have a clear cultural‐political thrust. That is why the majority of them align themselves with feminist and/or postcolonial criticism in demanding that past texts’ complicity in oppression … be revised and re‐visioned as part of the process of restoring a voice, a history and an identity to those hitherto exploited, marginalized and silenced by dominant interests and id~<br>

Abstract: If one considers all the books that line the shelves of any given library as a collection, including the acquisition of materials for that collection, its accessibility, and its dissemination, a unique concern about truth is revealed. Consider any given library as a record of humanity’s accomplishments and failures. Both the beauty and the ugliness of humanity’s history must be represented in this collection. Sadly, however, this balanced perspective about humanity’s accomplishments and failures is often compromised by a number of factors. One such factor, often affecting public libraries, is the decision to avoid community outcry concerning controversial material. Such material could be different lifestyle perspectives, negative views of various stages of American or world history, art or literature that is deemed morally offensive, and hate literature. Regardless of the truth value of the propositions and perspectives contained in such controversial literature, the truth value must be suspended so that a complete picture of recorded history is not compromised. If the historical record is compromised, any and all theories of truth would be compromised. To what end would an individual or some group in society want this? Just as it is often said that knowledge is power, the compromising of knowledge puts that power in the hands of the compromiser.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: In this binding of memory and experience lies a crucial difference, though, between Marcel’s and Bergson’s respective points of view. As discussed earlier, to Bergson the binding of memory with experience is constantly projected toward the next moment of decision making.
         42To Marcel, instead, surrendering to the utilitarianism of the “attention to life” may entail a renunciation of one’s most genuine selves. This sort of self‐betrayal occurs when one, surrendering to more pressing needs, neglects the emotions induced, for instance—to take the best‐known example—by the sensory perception experienced by Marcel in the episode of the madeleine.43To Marcel, the process of selective recollection needed to “resurrect” or re‐actualize the most valuable among our virtual selves functions in a deliberate mode of distraction or, to invert Bergson’s formula, of inattention to life.44<br>

Abstract: The virtues to which I have alluded thus possess radical implications for citizens considering the morality of war and, in particular, whether to join a standing army or to agree to conscription in military service. If I am correct about the role of the virtues for just‐war morality, then individual citizens have a duty to settle matters of the
         jus ad bellumduring times of conflict or impending conflict. Citizens cannot merely rely on a connection between patriotism and political obedience but should act on the notion that patriotism informed by a sense of justice requires moral reflection about the merits of a polity’s demands on an individual’s conscience. That notion implies higher expectations of moral assessment than has typically been the case in just‐war theorizing and might require citizens to refuse participation or conscription in war. Put differently, citizens who fail to engage in such reflection and who enter into an unjust war may be judged culpably negligent for choosing to be made into soldiers. To be sure, the social, political, economic, legal, and cultural forces that bear on an individual’s decision are complex, making personal agency and moral deliberation in war an extremely complex matter.72But just‐war morality, properly understood, involves dispositions to resist sources of fear and to exercise courage and independence of mind regarding the merits of a polity’s cause.<br>

Abstract: Readers without solid background knowledge of French film and colonial history may have some difficulty navigating through Eades's tightly packed, allusive prose, especially since no index of any kind is provided. This absence is difficult to understand in a work of serious scholarship aimed at academic readers, as is the press's decision to invest in numerous glossy still‐frame illustrations that add nothing substantive to the analysis. However, the extensive, thematically organized filmographies and bibliographies that conclude the volume should prove very useful to all readers by providing a starting point for further reading and research.<br>

Abstract: Decades ago, when the galaxy of film was gradually swirling into existence and becoming visible within the university, it wasn't at all clear that academic oversight was pertinent or wholesome. From the perspective of the academy, movies could have the effect of devaluing the humanities, while from that of cinephiles the university might very well tamper with the organic rapport of audiences with movies, stunting or unnaturally twisting the development of both. Such a debate over the very propriety of its study seems primordial enough to distinguish film from English or any other longstanding field. You may believe the decision to have long since been rendered in favor of the academy; after all, the article you are reading was commissioned by

Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: Discussing this potency begins properly with Schmitt’s
         Political Theology. The state of exception in Schmitt’s thought requires a translation or grounding in ontology since he claims that the sovereign decides when the state of exception is in effect.16Because the decision of the sovereign enacts the state of exception, the exceptional always lurks in potentiality. To put Schmitt’s statement in the terms of law, the extraconstitutional exists within the ordinary constituted order. This problem may be further stated as how to anticipate that which exceeds all expectations. No one can plan for the state of exception. As exceptional, it necessarily exceeds the ordinary order of law, constitution, and actuality. Schmitt thought legislative or constitutional efforts to define the exceptional in advance were futile.17Since the sovereign must have this power to confront the exceptional situation, according to Schmitt, the exception is always within the ordinary constitution of things since the sovereign is ceded “exceptional powers” that can address the unanticipated.18Schmitt argued that this issue of exceptionality affects all polities, no matter their form. Because the sovereign can decide the exceptional, anything may be turned into a state of exception, in Schmitt’s view, even if the sovereign only possesses legitimacy through a democratic regime. Thus, the natural outcome of the possibility of a state of exception is that life is capable of being undone; every citizen is potentially an outcast and bandit, losing one’s ordinary status as a citizen.<br>

Abstract: Second, what is the relation between practical “reflection” (or decision) and practical reasoning? While no one can choose or avow for me, my reflective avowal must respond to what I take to be reasons, as Larmore’s argument about grounds of commitment contends—and so it cannot “dispense” entirely with reference to others (65). Thus, the authenticity found in practical affirmation or attestation cannot be an experience of complete independence from others (my choice must in principle be intelligible). And so the “irreplaceable nature of each individual life” seen in authentic self-relation (55) cannot be defined negatively as an exclusion of other perspectives: it must instead depend on the energy, effort, or initiative in avowal.<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: All these questions deserve a place on the agenda as we determine the ethnographic and theoretical place of morality in contemporary anthropology. This brings us back finally to the question of whether indeed it is necessary or valuable to understand morality as a “cultural system.” Recall that Geertz’s intent was to identify systems of cultural symbols as distinct from social forces and psychological motives operating in those domains. The cultural systems he mentions include religion, ideology, science, common sense, and art (
         1973,1975,1976), so our question is whether morality can be placed among them. If a religion as a cultural system is “a cluster of sacred symbols, woven into some kind of ordered whole” (1973:129), and ideologies are to be examined “as systems of interacting symbols, as patterns of interworking meanings” (207), can the same be said of a morality? Perhaps on this level a society’s moral system is undergirded by a selection of symbolic oppositions such as good/bad, good/evil, right/wrong, virtue/vice.
               Perhaps these oppositions generate metaphorical equivalents such as white/black, lightness/darkness, above/below; inflect experiential states such as pleasure/pain, love/hate, health/illness; define social categories such as human rights and human trafficking, existential states such as salvation and damnation, and mythical figures such as deity and demon or saint and witch. Before one objects that this formulation appears too dualistic, note that it cannot be dichotomous categories in themselves that are objectionable, since the very idea of moral choice or judgment and ethical decision or dilemma presume at least two options. If good/bad or good/evil seem problematic, are good/better or good/not-as-good more satisfactory? Emphasizing the latter may appear to be opting for a Classical as opposed to a Christian (or Abrahamic) moral sensibility, but it may also be construed as preferring an elitist ethics where one has the ~<br>

Abstract: Is Eve’s speech in any sense depraved by her enunciation of the dream voice? Whether or not we place that voice in quotation marks, we know that although Eve speaks these words they are not entirely her own. Quotation marks force us to make a decision one way or another with regard to speaker, where Milton urges us to recognize some more subtle form of partially owned speech. Compared to the vertiginous dream episode, the actual temptation and fall of Eve in book 9 is fairly straightforward. The tempting voice returns, this time in the purely external form of the serpent. But that alone is not enough to make Eve fall. She first must recognize that voice and internalize it, as she does in her soliloquy just before she eats. Here we see her articulate those impious questions, the chopped logic and slippery satanic syntax, but with herself now as the voice’s unequivocal origin. Quotation marks cannot save her this time.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: According to Badiou, the event is logical rather than phenomenological, which is to say, it draws from presentation itself. Thus the initial intervention is purely “of the order of declaration.”
            
                  It does not declare the meaning of an event, but it simply and emphatically declares the fact of its having happened: “there is an event, it has consequences, and these consequences need to be faithfully elaborated in relation to the status quo that has been interrupted.”107
               
                  From the conditions of his own “conversion” Paul draws the consequence that one can only begin from the declaration of the resurrection being the “real of faith,” a declaration that is in essence subjective, for no preconstituted subset can support it.108
               
                  The apostle must be accountable only for what others see and hear, that is, for his or her declaration.109
               
                  It is the essence of faith to publicly declare itself; even though private conviction is required, only the public confession of faith installs the subject in the perspective of salvation.110
               
                  The truth of a declaration, being without proof or visibility, emerges at that point where knowledge, be it empirical or conceptual, breaks down. Hence Paul’s “antiphilosophy”: apostolic declaration stems from and gives expression to a pure fidelity toward the possibility opened by the event.111
               
                  If truths lack objective strength, then their substance must be provided by the subjective persistence of fidelity that supplies the truth procedure with consistency.112
               
                  The substance of truth is faith. Fidelity is to be seen not as “a capacity, a subjective quantity, or a virtue” but as “a functional relation to an event.”113
               
                  Miller rightly points out that “whether finitude or infinity prevails depends o~<br>

Abstract: The challenge for the writer of tragedy is to make the experience of pain as meaningful for the audience as it is for the character who suffers. Tragic spectatorship must be, in some way, dangerous.
      
            But the physical distance between the actors and the audience prevents the direct contact needed to convey sensations of touch, of which pain is one especially complex type.2
         
            The process of pain perception, nociception, engages a host of bodily systems ranging from the skin to multiple areas of the brain; pain response involves physical, emotional, and cognitive reactions, further influenced by interpersonal and cultural factors.3
         
            As pain researcher Irene Tracy explains, the complexity of the neurobiological response to painful stimuli mirrors the complicated nature of what we generally mean by “pain”: “So there are all these different parts of the brain—these sort of attentional networks, these emotional networks, motivational networks, decision making networks, sensory areas. And because pain is a complicated, multi-dimensional, multi-factorial experience, it has to access all those different parts of the brain in order to generate the experience that is pain.”4
         
            Pain perception is a biological process that is part of the human experience of the world, but it is also unique to each individual. This combination of physical, cultural, cognitive, and affective qualities makes pain an experience that is both universal and subjective.5<br>

UNESCO defended this decision with two statements in 1974 and 1975, but renewed Israel's membership in 1977, after the United States threatened to withhold $40 million of funding from the organization.

Abstract: The fluting of the column shafts went through the same development. On the drawings from late January and early February, the flutes are traditional semicircular concavities (see
         Figure 15). In subsequent months their depth decreased, and the final design was a half oval formed around two tangent circles, approximating d'Espouy's rendition of the flutes at the Erechtheum (seeFigure 8). However, this design decision was likely prompted by an additional consideration. The architect started rethinking the conventional shape of the fluting while designing the furring that was to support the lath and plaster of the column (Figure 17). The design was not dictated by the physical limitations of the construction technology. The structure of the columns would not prevent making the fluting half-circular; and semicircular flutes were in fact the norm in most exhibition pavilions from this time period. Maybeck made the fluting shallower, and by doing so, revealed more of the coarse texture of plaster of the columns. His intention was developed in a series of studies that explored an increasingly shallow concavity.<br>

Abstract: Wu argues that a “fundamental logic” underlies the structure of burials (219), and that only by uncovering this logic can we truly understand Chinese tombs. This thesis is reflected in Wu’s decision to arrange the book thematically into chapters that represent what he considers the “three most essential aspects of any manufactured work”: spatiality, materiality, and temporality (14). Because he is not bound by the same constraints that accompany the more traditional chronological and individual approaches to studying tombs, Wu is able to draw freely from a large, albeit fragmented, body of material and textual evidence to support his points. A major strength of this book may also be perceived as a weakness: Wu seems to be able to offer explanations for practically all the visual phenomena in tombs. One may question the reliability of such a comprehensive explanation for such an enormous amount of information.<br>

Abstract: Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis, viewed by many as the masterpiece of the social gospel movement, has been confined to the dusty shelves of the library. Can we catch no glimpse of what astounded its massive reading public, no glimmer of Rauschenbusch's own sense of the work as a "dangerous book" written in fear and trembling? This article suggests that a generic analysis of Christianity and the Social Crisis might lead to surprising disclosures. Any generic analysis involves the discussion of a group of texts. Consequently this study proceeds via a comparison of the structure of Christianity and the Social Crisis with those of other works of a similar type which were produced between 1890 and 1915. The genre is isolated by utilizing the techniques of Tzvetan Todorov. Certain negative traits are specified which separate the genre from its neighbors. The positive leitmotif of a dual crisis-a crisis affecting society as a whole and the ramifications of that crisis within the Christian churches-is specified as the decisive trait of the genre. To deal with this leitmotif a specific structure was generated by the works under consideration. They provided-to pirate the words of Clifford Geertz in his landmark essay on modern ideologies-"maps of problematic reality" and "matrices for the creation of collective conscience." In designing their maps of problematic reality our authors worked along two separate but related vectors. The first of these vectors was constituted by a historical analysis of the origins of the present crisis, while the second consisted of a systemic analysis of the present social order. Each of these elements of the genre is examined in turn. The mapping of problematic reality by means of a historical and a structural analysis was geared towards provoking as well as defining the crisis. Crisis, once defined, demanded decision. Nevertheless the "permanent basis for action" which Rauschenbusch and others sought could not be groun~<br>

It is fitting, therefore, that FQS devotes a debate focusing on issues that are concerned with the many layers of decision making when it comes to ethics in qualitative research. In this contribution, I use a personal context to formally introduce the ethics debate. I extend an invitation to readers to contribute to this debate of ethical issues in qualitative research.<br>

Abstract: Research on information sharing has viewed this activity as essential for informing groups on content relevant to a decision. We propose and examine an alternate function of information sharing, i.e., the social construction of meaning. To accomplish this goal, we turn to social construction, social presence, and task closure theories. Drawing from these theories, we hypothesize relationships among the meeting environment, breadth and depth of information shared during a meeting, and decision quality. We explore these relationships in terms of the effects of both the media environment in which the group is situated and the medium that group members choose to utilize for their communication. Our study of 32, 5- and 6-person groups supports our belief that interpretation underlies information sharing and is necessary for favorable decision outcomes. It also supports the proposed negative effect of low social presence media on interpretation in terms of depth of information sharing; a low social presence medium, however, promotes information sharing breadth. Finally, the findings indicate that when in multimedia environments and faced with a relatively complex task, choosing to utilize an electronic medium facilitates closure and, therefore, favorable outcomes.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i23353270<br>

Author(s): Guery François<br>
Abstract: La précaution a été critiquée non en elle-même, mais comme « principe », à la fois sur le plan juridique et scientifique. Les formulations du principe prêtaient à confusion, à cause du jargon « scientifique » utilisé (cf. absence de preuves, de « certitudes scientifiques »). Liée à l'urgence, la précaution ressortit à une philosophie de l'agir, qui comporte menace, vulnérabilité, anticipation, appréhension, et c'est de ce côté qu'il faut chercher la logique de la précaution. En premier lieu, une « déduction sémantique a priori » (Derrida) permet de mettre en évidence les caractéristiques de la peur, qui justifie la précaution. En second lieu, un rappel de la tradition philosophique confirme cette déduction, rappel qui va d'Aristote (Rhétorique : ce qu'est la peur et comment on est quand on l'éprouve; Éthique à Nicomaque : le courage, l'intrépidité, la disposition acquise) à Heidegger (Être et Temps : la peur comme disposition insigne, esquisse de l'angoisse, du souci, de la responsabilité, de la résolution), en passant par des étapes essentielles : Augustin (la cura, la curiosité), Kant (derniers écrits), Nietzsche (Seconde Inactuelle). Enfin, et en conclusion, la précaution apparaît non comme une démission de la connaissance, mais comme une incitation à mieux scénariser, à mieux gérer l'avenir, en cultivant une imagination anticipative, complémentaire de l'innovation. If Precaution has been criticized, on both a legal and a scientific level, it is not as an approach in itself but as a Principle. The way the Precautionary Principle has been formulated was confusing, jargonistic : lack of proof, of scientific certainty.

Abstract: This article concerns itself with establishing and defining the concept of prophetic politics as a narrative-based political leadership. It focuses on the use of religious, mythical and otherwise culturally dominating narratives which are often taken for granted or as 'common sense.' By a skilful politician, these stories can be given new forms and used as tools of leadership. This article explores the differences between traditional prophesies in the religious context and political prophesies and shows how with the use of prophetic narratives the politician is able to keep politics from stagnation since every moment and every decision can be endowed with special importance in actualizing the vision that remains the fascinating but elusive goal of politics - whatever it is narrated to be. This might re-invigorate the citizens to participate more in politics. The focus of the article is on American politics since the American civil religion and the narrative tradition of the jeremiad provide ample tools for political prophets, but the concept is not restricted solely to America. I argue that well told narratives have great influence on how people think and that can be manipulated politically. This type of leadership opens new vistas for political candidates, but it also opens new vistas for researchers to use in their study of politics.<br>

Abstract: A response to James Barr on the issue of how to depict God's words in Genesis 2:17 if the warning of death as a consequence of disobedience appears unrealized in the subsequent narrative. Barr's point that 'lie' is an inappropriate depiction is accepted, but the issue is recast in terms of whether God's words would be sheqer, unreliable. An interpretation of the overall narrative, congruous with the decision about the nature of God's words, is offered.<br>

Abstract: Current debates surrounding liberalism and communitarianism, modernity and postmodernity, ethical theory and narrative ethics fail to account for shifting foundations of personal identity in an increasingly computer-mediated era of human communication. This paper aims to examine some of the conceptual assumptions about identity and community which are being radically undermined by rapidly evolving information networks and are therefore in need of redefinition. Additionally, I argue for an expansion of the literary imagination to include virtual, coauthored fiction sites where exploration of personal identity will bear upon future ethical and political decision-making.<br>

Abstract: Intensive care and the intensive care techniques in use have considerably changed our attitude towards death and dying –a process that had already been medicalized and professionalized. This study of four intensive care units (ICUs) in France and Britain brings to light the reality of death-related practices and resituates that reality at the core of professional relations and personal experience. Study results strongly suggest that the end-of-life decision is a genuine social construction: far from being purely objective and medical, it is heavily conditioned by context and actors' commitment. The search for professional autonomy and self-regulation has increased the ambivalence of the dying process, already complex because governed by extremely heterogeneous types of logic. This study shows that patient's death in an ICU is more dependant on the organization and culture of the ICU than on patient's own wishes or those of close relatives.<br>

Abstract: El presente trabajo analiza la forma de comprensión de los casos de aprobación y rechazo de acuerdos reparatorios en materias de violencia doméstica, cuando tanto la víctima como el imputado pertenecen al pueblo mapuche, que han sido resueltos desde el año 2011 por tribunales de la Región de La Araucanía. Se plantea que las formas de comprender estos casos por los tribunales y la doctrina no ha sido la correcta, por cuanto se han centrado en determinar la primacía exclusiva que tendría uno de los derechos en disputa por sobre el otro. Frente a ello, el artículo sugiere que la forma adecuada de entender estos conflictos multiculturales, y a la decisión judicial que se pronuncia sobre los mismos, es reconociendo el elemento "trágico" que se encuentra presente, y que se configura a partir de un reconocimiento de las características e importancia de los principios en colisión y de los bienes jurídicos que protegen. This paper analyzes the way of understanding the cases of approval and rejection of compensation agreements in matters of domestic violence, where both the victim and the accused belong to the Mapuche people, which have been resolved since 2011 by courts of the Araucanía Region. It argues that the ways of understanding these cases by the courts and the doctrine has not been proper, since ithas focused on determine the exclusive primacy that one of the colliding rights would have over the other. Facing this issue, the article suggests that the best way to understand these multicultural conflicts, and the judicial decision pronounced on them, is considering the "tragic" element present in these cases, which is configured from the recognition of the characteristics and importance of the principles in collision and the legal goods they protect.<br>

Publisher: Society for Historical Archaeology<br>

Author(s): McCarthy John P.<br>
Abstract: Much archaeological scholarship on consumption has approached its subject matter as the means to an end—e.g., as a way of studying socioeconomic status—rather than as a proper object of study in its own right. The "consumer choice" school, and, more recently, advocates of consumer behavior studies, have supported approaches that emphasize quantitative methods, at the same time downplaying the "qualitative" or symbolic aspects of consumption. A considerable body of literature on the symbolic aspects of consumption exists both in historical archaeology and other fields. The intention of this essay is to draw together this recent literature on consumption and combine it into a single approach that emphasizes shopping as the meaningful action at the very heart of consumption. With the emphasis on agency, this approach presents shopping as that crucial moment of transformation where identity, intention, and symbol combine in the decision to purchase, to own, an object.<br>

Publisher: Institute of Management Sciences<br>
Issue: i345213<br>
Date: 5 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Zigurs Marshall Scott<br>
Abstract: The past decade has brought advanced information technologies, which include electronic messaging systems, executive information systems, collaborative systems, group decision support systems, and other technologies that use sophisticated information management to enable multiparty participation in organization activities. Developers and users of these systems hold high hopes for their potential to change organizations for the better, but actual changes often do not occur, or occur inconsistently. We propose adaptive structuration theory (AST) as a viable approach for studying the role of advanced information technologies in organization change. AST examines the change process from two vantage points: (1) the types of structures that are provided by advanced technologies, and (2) the structures that actually emerge in human action as people interact with these technologies. To illustrate the principles of AST, we consider the small group meeting and the use of a group decision support system (GDSS). A GDSS is an interesting technology for study because it can be structured in a myriad of ways, and social interaction unfolds as the GDSS is used. Both the structure of the technology and the emergent structure of social action can be studied. We begin by positioning AST among competing theoretical perspectives of technology and change. Next, we describe the theoretical roots and scope of the theory as it is applied to GDSS use and state the essential assumptions, concepts, and propositions of AST. We outline an analytic strategy for applying AST principles and provide an illustration of how our analytic approach can shed light on the impacts of advanced technologies on organizations. A major strength of AST is that it expounds the nature of social structures within advanced information technologies and the key interaction processes that figure in their use. By capturing these processes and tracing their impacts, we can reveal the complexity of technology-organization r~<br>

son más sensibles a las pérdidas que a las ganancias. La situación anterior a 1973 se interpre-
taría más en términos de utilidades esperadas, con una precisión: los actores durante este pe-
riodo se mostraron singularmente risk-acceptant (situación diametralmente opuesta a la de los
años ochenta, en donde son risk-averse). Véase Daniel Kahneman y Amos Tversky, "Prospect

Publisher: Irish University Review<br>
Issue: i29777260<br>
Date: 12 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Lin Yu-chen<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the drama of selfhood and the attendant problem of ethics in Brian Friel's Faith Healer. Drawing from the tenets of Freudian psychoanalysis, I scrutinize the protagonist's narrative identity through fissures created by the discrepancy between his story and the other two characters' versions. These crevices register the protagonist's post-traumatic affects for an uncanny home, which, intertwined with his equally uncanny talent to become the place of trauma, compels him to return time and again instead of acknowledging its loss. Symptomatically, in his fixation on an uncanny home in order to disavow its loss, the protagonist sutures his privation, to such an extent that he not only bars memory exchange with other characters, but appropriates them into a master narrative. Given the fact that the three characters' stories are addressed to invisible auditors who converge with the play's actual audience, the healer's final act of authority is limited as long as it is subject to the audience's interpretation of his memory narrative. In its appeal to the audience's decision on ethical justice for the healer's narrative imagination among multiple proposals, this play is an exercise of poetical ethics of memory.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i30204873<br>
Date: 2 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Gardner Colin<br>
Abstract: Traditional discourses upon literature have been predicated upon the ability to refer to a text that others may consult (Landow, 1994, p. 33). Texts that involve elements of feedback and nontrivial decision-making on the part of the reader (Aarseth, 1997, p. 1) therefore present a challenge to readers and critics alike. Since a persuasive case has been made against a critical method that sets out to "identify the task of interpretation as a task of territorial exploration and territorial mastery" (Aarseth, p. 87), this paper proposes the use of readers in an empirically based approach to hypertext fiction. Meta-interpretation, a method that combines individual responses to a text, reading logs, screen recordings and limited qualitative/quantitative analysis, and critical interpretation is outlined. By analysing readers' responses it is possible to suggest both the ways that textual elements may have influenced or determined readers' choices and the ways that readers' choices "configure" the text. The method thus addresses Espen Aarseth's concerns and illuminates interesting features of interactive processes in fictional environments. The paper is divided into two parts: the first part sketches out meta-interpretation through consideration of the main problems confronting the literary critic; the second part describes reading research aimed at generating data for the literary critic.<br>

Abstract: In Time, Narrative, and History, David Carr argues against the narrativist claim that our lived experience does not possess the formal attributes of a story; this conclusion can be reinforced from a semiotic perspective. Our experience is mediated through temporal signs that are used again in the construction of stories. Since signs are social entities from the start, this approach avoids a problem of individualism specific to phenomenology, one which Carr takes care to resolve. A semiotic framework is also explicit about a theme Carr handles implicitly: the status of representation. Representation is internal to signification, mediating our experience not just retrospectively but prospectively in the planning and execution of action. A model is presented in which the temporal organization of experience and action is formally coordinated with the temporal organization of narrative. The model is then applied to a historical event: John Batman's attempt in 1835 to purchase land from some Aboriginal tribes around what is now Melbourne. The meaning of this event is not located only in historical writing about it but in the semiotic constitution of the event itself. Changes of meaning emerge from relations between events as new events-in this case the Australian High Court's Mabo decision-align with old ones. Finally, a number of contrasts are indicated between this model and proposals made by Arthur C. Danto, Hayden White, F. R. Ankersmit, Fernand Braudel, and Paul Ricoeur.<br>

Abstract: La réanimation et les techniques employées ont bousculé notre rapport à la mort, déjà professionnalisée et médicalisée. L'étude de quatre services de réanimation, en France et en Grande-Bretagne, permet de faire apparaître la réalité des pratiques concrètes de la mort et de la replacer au cœur des relations professionnelles et des expériences personnelles. Au terme de ce travail, la décision de fin de vie apparaît être une véritable construction sociale : loin d'être purement objective et médicale, elle est conditionnée par des effets de contexte et par l'engagement des acteurs. La recherche d'autonomie et d'autorégulation professionnelle renforce l'ambivalence du processus de "mourir" déjà complexe puisque régi par des logiques très hétérogènes. La mort dépend plus de l'organisation et de la culture de chaque service que de la volonté du patient ou de ses proches. /// Intensive care units and their techniques have considerably altered our attitude towards death as well as the death process - a process that had already been professionalised and medicalised. This study of four intensive care units in France and Britain brings to light the reality of deathrelated practices and resituates that reality at the core of professional relationships and personal experiences. Study results strongly suggest that the decision to end life is a genuine social construction : far from being purely objective and medical, it is heavily conditioned by context and actors' commitment. The search for professional autonomy and self-regulation has increased the ambivalence of the dying process, already complex because governed by numerous and heterogeneous logics. This study shows that our death depends more on the organization and the culture of the intensive care unit than on our own wishes or those of close relatives. /// Behandlung und technische Mittel in der Intensivstation haben unser Verhaltnis zum Sterben grundlegend verändert und es heute schon zu einer medizinischen Berufssache g~<br>

Abstract: A travers l'analyse de deux versions d'un chant Ju|'hoan (Namibie), l'une individuelle, l'autre collective, l'auteur propose une reflexion sur la notion de performance comprise comme action ou sequence d'actions qui donne forme, en temps reel, à une piece musicale. La mise en forme d'une piece est appréhendée comme une situation d'incertitude où les musiciens se trouvent face à un champ des possibles qu'ils explorent en fonction de leurs compétences, mais aussi de leur connivence avec les autres musiciens, et du contexte. Concrètement, l'analyse porte sur les intentions, les modalités de leur mise en ceuvre (stratégie, tactique), et les réalisations (prise de decision, conduites, interaction) des musiciens, mais aussi sur l'effet produit par la musique. Au-delà, penser la forme à la fois comme processus et comme accomplissement éphémère de ce processus permet d'entrer dans une ethnomusicologie dont l'enjeu n'est plus de mettre au jour les propriétés d'une musique, mais de comprendre comment des musiciens agissent.<br>

Article Title: The Politics of Leo XIII's Opening of the Vatican Archives: The Ownership of the Past<br>
Publisher: Society of American Archivists<br>
Issue: i40011862<br>

Abstract: In 1881, Pope Leo XIII (1878-1903) opened to scholarly research the Vatican Archives, a repository of documents recording papal history from the Middle Ages. Two years later, his letter Saepenumero considerantes, confirmed the opening and his motu proprio of May 1884 gave further instructions. The opening was entwined with both the broader world of Italian politics and the smaller political sphere of the archives itself. The "macropolitical" context was the ecclesiastical controversy about the papacy's role in Italian history, which informed Leo XIII's decision to expand access to the archives. The micropolitical context concerns the management of the archives and the politics of access inside the Vatican. In his memoirs published posthumously in 1947, Protestant scholar Theodor Sickel² shows how bureaucratic power struggles and disagreements on extending access affected a scholar interested in historical research for its own sake. Despite Leo XIII's appreciation for Sickel's work, some of the pope's subordinates tried to hinder access to the documents, a disjunction between papal policy and its implementation. In part, these obstructions reflected the difficulty of translating a general policy into concrete terms; but they also revealed a clash within the Curia. This conflict informs both Leo XIII's letter and Sickel's memoirs. Leo XIII's letter equates truth with apologetics, or the defense of the Catholic Church:³ for Leo XIII, the archives embodied the Church's memory and therefore its identity. Sickel's memoirs, on the other hand, illustrate the politics of archives management.<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i378430<br>

Author(s): White Stephen M.<br>
Abstract: Law professors and political scientists generally subscribe to opposed theories of Supreme Court decision making. Law professors, to a great degree, adhere to an internal view: Supreme Court justices decide cases according to legal rules, principles, and precedents. Political scientists follow an external view: justices decide cases according to their political ideologies or preferences. This article develops an interpretive-structural theory that harmonizes these seemingly opposed views. This interpretive-structural theory not only explains why the internal and external views often are both effective but also why, sometimes, one approach might be more effective than the other. The article concludes by comparing the interpretive-structural theory with the "new institutionalism" that is emerging in political science.<br>

Abstract: En 1950, Paul Ricœur publia une imposante Philosophie de la volonté, vite brocardée par la vague structuraliste et les critiques de toute « philosophie de la conscience ». On y trouve notamment une analyse du phénomène de l'hésitation qui contient bien des éléments encore pertinents. Phénomène bien connu, l'hésitation n'a pas été vraiment thématisée en tant que telle, même si, comme le montre Ricœur, l'histoire de la philosophie est susceptible d'aider à le faire. Mais le doute cartésien, par exemple, n'est guère hésitant. Ce chapitre fourmille d'analyses denses mais claires, d'allusions qu'il faut expliciter, de métaphores « vives » très riches, qui permettent de concevoir un sujet se cherchant dans l'hésitation avant de se choisir dans la décision. Il y a là un concept indispensable à toute théorie de l'action. Philosophie de la volonté (Philosophy of Will), a major work published by Ricœur in 1950, was quickly derided by members of the structuralist trend and by those critical of every single « philosophy of consciousness ». The book includes notably an analysis of the phenomenon of hesitation, many elements of which are still relevant. Although a well known phenomenon, hesitation has never been fully analyzed in itself, even though the history of philosophy, as Ricœur shows, might be helpful in such an endeavor. Cartesian doubt, for instance, shows hardly any hesitation. This chapter is replete with dense yet clear discussions, with allusions that require elucidation, and with a wealth of vivid metaphors which help us to envisage a subject in search of himself through hesitation, before choosing himself through decision. Such a concept is indispensable for any theory of action.<br>

Abstract: À partir d'une définition de l'éducation comme « relation dissymétrique, nécessaire et provisoire, visant à l'émergence d'un sujet », la pédagogie est proposée comme effort pour penser cette activité dans des situations données. Refusant une posture philosophique qui décrète l'existence du sujet pour le faire advenir, comme une attitude inspirée des sciences humaines qui abolit le sujet en réduisant ses actes à la résultante des forces qui s'exercent sur lui, la pédagogie peut se définir comme « anticipation contextualisée ». Dans cette perspective, elle requiert un discours qui exprime la singularité des sujets en situation et la mette en perspective d'universalité. Le récit peut avoir cette fonction et « faire théorie » sans, pour autant, s'abstraire des situations particulières qu'il décrit. La pédagogie comme « récits d'éducation » a alors pour fonction de favoriser la prise de décision éducative. Education being defined as "a dissymetric, necessary and temporary relation focusing on the emergence of a subject", pedagogy is considered as an endeavour to think this activity in given situations. If we refuse a philosophical position which decides the existence of a subject to make it turn into a reality - as an attitude inspired by human sciences which reduces the subject's acts to the resultant of forces exerced on him - pedagogy may be defined as a "contextualized anticipation". In this perspective, we must display the uniqueness of subjects in a specific situation and set it in a universal perspective. Narratives may have this function without neglecting the specificity of situations. Pedagogy as "narratives on education" is able to facilitate educational decision making.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40085908<br>
Date: 9 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Pestre Dominique<br>
Abstract: What I consider in this paper are various forms of government, various technologies and discursive regimes of government that are in common use today. What interests me are the categories and tools, practical dispositifs and languages that developed over the last decades 'to constitute, define, organize, and instrumentalize the strategies that individuals, acting freely, may use to deal with one another' (Foucault). The paper considers first the neo-liberal wish to reassert the individual as alone in responsibility for his/her own life after the unfortunate digression into Welfare Statism and Keynesian economics, source of all ills. It then focuses on some material and social technologies that encourage people to accept full and complete 'self-sovereignty'. This section leads to a discussion on the new demands (and resistance) society imposed on this liberal normative ideal. It notably considers the growing demands to 'participate' in decision processes and to be environmentally friendly. In section "Les Mots et Les Choses: A New Discursive Regime", it considers the discursive regime that progressively took shape and which currently permeates international governance bodies of all stripes—from the World Bank to the Conference of Parties for Climate Change. In the final section, it comes back to the initial question and considers what these changes actually mean for the democratic order as constituted over the past 250 years.<br>

Abstract: Le calcul économique, dans sa forme la plus connue, celle de l'analyse coûts/avantages, est depuis quelques années confronté à de multiples remises en cause. Considéré comme technocratique, partiel, voire partial, il est de plus en plus cantonné au rôle de composante parmi d'autres de l'aide à la décision publique. Le développement, dans le Royaume-Uni d'une nouvelle approche, multicritère, de l'évaluation des grands projets d'infrastructure de transport va-t-il sonner le glas du calcul économique ? Nous ne le pensons pas. Nous défendons au contraire la thèse selon laquelle il peut retrouver un rôle important. Mais, pour cela, il est nécessaire de reconsidérer le processus des choix collectifs. Dans cette nouvelle perspective, loin de constituer un processus purement technocratique, le calcul économique, à la lumière des travaux de Keynes et Schumpeter sur le rôle de la prévision et des prix, peut s'inscrire dans une forme renouvelée de maïeutique des choix collectifs, même dans le champ controversé des infrastructures de transport. Economic calculation, and especially cost benefit analysis (Coba), is more and more criticised and accused to be technocratic and partial, leading to a narrow view of projects. An example of this loss of credibility is the New Approach To Appraisal (NATA), implemented in Great Britain at the end of the 90': a multicriteria analysis where Coba gives only one information among many others, quantitative and qualitative. Nevertheless we don't think that we are facing an unavoidable decline of economic calculation. This paper emphasises the important role that Coba can keep within the public decision process. If we remember Keyne's and Schumpeter's points of view about the roles of forecasting and prices, economic calculation could be useful to help the emergence of collective choices, even in the controversial field of transport infrastructures.<br>

Abstract: Archaeology assumes itself as a discipline through a practice of boundary-making that merges the past with the present. It is, in this practice, increasingly critiqued for being ethnocentric and separating power from the communities it claims to represent. In response, archaeology is experiencing a turn toward "community". Examining two community archaeology case studies, we assess whether archaeology can be transformed into a discipline that productively participates in the liveliness and messy connectedness of objects, peoples, histories and cultures— in contrast to a conventionally detached practice of objectifying other peoples' lifeways. In both cases, archaeological and descent communities play direct and central decision-making roles in this traditionally "distanced" discipline. They demonstrate means of re-figuring archaeology as a participatory practice. Community-founded archaeology is thus shown to transform methods commonly supporting institutional reproduction into a radically indigenous, emically structured, set of knowledge practices and outcomes. Archeologie suppose elle-même comme une discipline à travers une pratique de fabrication limite qui fusionne le passé au présent. Il est, dans cette pratique, plus en plus critiqué pour avoir été puissance ethnocentrique et séparation des communautés qu'elle prétend représenter. En réponse, archéologie connaît un tournant vers une « communauté ». Examen de deux études de cas communautaires archéologie, nous déterminer si archéologie peut se transformer en une discipline qui productivement participe à la vivacité et la connectivité désordre des objets, des peuples, des histoires et des cultures—contrairement à une pratique conventionnelle détachée d'objectiver les modes de vie des autres peuples. En cas, archéologiques et descente communautés jouent des rôles décisionnels directes et centrales dans ce traditionnellement « distanciés » discipline.

Abstract: This essay explores a phenomenon familiar to archivists: the seamless moment of time and space within the remembering process when communities become aware of and must confront the fragility of public memory and make decisions about the management and preservation of their information resources. This decision point has recently been called the documentary moment. The authors' exploration of this concept focuses on the theories, strategies, methodologies, and processes formerly employed and now emerging at Library and Archives Canada (LAC) to facilitate the disposition of government's information resources. They also examine the challenges presented by the digital age on the documentary moment and whether corresponding philosophical or methodological changes to current institutional strategies, including macro-appraisal, are required.<br>

Abstract: If human beings were empirically shown to be irrational, would this finding destroy the foundations of economic science? We think not because we doubt that this postulate is needed as a foundation of economic science. We examine the laboratory experiments conducted by behavioral economists and experimental psychologists on human judgment and decision-making, using Bayes' Theorem and the Expected Value model We examine a number of issues: Can we base ourselves on experimenters' full rationality for doubting of human rationality? Are rational models anything else than handy tools? Do humans' minds function like rational tools or with rational tools? How an "irrational" human being could create anything "rational"? Should rationality be subordinated to reason? Nature being neither rational nor irrational, is there any point in applying the concept of rationality to one its constituents? If human beings were rational forms of life, would this specie have survived?<br>

Abstract: Au terme de recherches concernant l'inclusion ou l'exclusion de tel ou tel livre dans le canon biblique, les circonstances culturelles et politiques, doctrinales et ecclésiastiques entourant la définition du corpus biblique sont de mieux en mieux connues : le risque aujourd'hui est de réduire la clôture canonique à une décision juridique ou disciplinaire extérieure au contenu du Livre. 1 – En s'appuyant sur les études contemporaines de la naissance de la parole sur Jésus, on essaie ici de décrire l'éclosion et le développement de la dynamique canonique chrétienne à partir de l'idée juive de canon et de la pratique juive de l'« accomplissement des Écritures ». 2 – On décrit ensuite plusieurs procédés poétiques qui en résultent et qui font de la Bible canonisée un livre profondément unifié. 3 – On suggère enfin que les pratiques ecclésiastiques de la parole peuvent se comprendre comme la réception requise par cette poétique. After so many studies concerning the inclusion or exclusion of any given book in the biblical canon have been written, the cultural, political, doctrinal, and ecclesiastic circumstances surrounding the definition of the biblical corpus are more and more known. The risk today is to reduce the closure of the canon to a juridical or disciplinary decision exterior to the content of the Book. 1.) Employing contemporary studies of the beginnings of the word about Jesus, I try here to describe the formation and development of the Christian canonical dynamics. starting from the Jewish idea of the canon and the Jewish practice of "the fulfillment of the Scriptures". 2.) I then describe some poetic devices that result from this and which make the canonized Bible a profoundly unified book. 3.) I suggest finally that the ecclesiastical usage of the Word can be understood as the reception required by this poetics.<br>

Abstract: This article investigates the effects of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 in structuring an encounter over a decision about building a dam in central Arizona. From the vantage point of three groups with deep investments in the outcome of this decision, it analyzes how the interests and identities of these parties were transformed as a result of this encounter. In defining standing and the terms of relevance, in providing a political forum, and in requiring these groups to explain themselves to others, this law powerfully mediated the politics surrounding this controversial decision.<br>

Abstract: Abstract. One of the main issues in the long-form census controversy concerned the relationship between science and politics. Through analysis of the arguments and underlying assumptions of four influential and exemplary interventions that were made in the name of science, this paper outlines a normative account of this relationship. The paper nuances the science-protective ideals that critics invoked and argues that such conceptual resources are needed if science is to be protected from undue political encroachment. However, in their zeal to defend the rights of science critics claimed for it more than its due, eclipsing the value dimension of policy decisions and failing to respect the role of politics as the rightful locus of decision making for value issues. An adequate normative account of the relationship between science and politics in public policy must be capable not only of protecting science from politics but also of protecting politics from science.<br>

The theological implication of this is considerable: the primary task of a hermeneutics is not to bring about a decision in the reader but first to allow the world of being that is the “thing” of the biblical text to unfold’,

Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: prooftexts.30.issue-2<br>
Date: 04 2010<br>
Author(s): Siff David B.<br>
Abstract: R. Naḥman of Bratslav's magnum opus,
         Liqutey Moharan, expresses contradictory attitudes toward the value and ontological primacy of books as opposed to living speech. When his discourses are sorted by the date delivered, one can see a specific shift in attitude. R. Naḥman's emphasis on oral expression, in discourses leading up to 1804, is characteristic of Hasidism's shift from the literary approach of Kabbalah toward an orally driven mass movement. Rebbe Naḥman's later emphasis on printed books can be understood in light of his decision in 1804 to embrace the printed book as a mechanism for spreading his ideas, a decision that may have stemmed from his messianic aspirations. Ontologies of orality and literacy are thus exposed as shifting ideological responses to biographical and historical circumstances.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: complitstudies.51.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: The citation of sources is a common procedure employed by contemporary experimental poetry of varying levels of constraint. Witness the documentary impulse driving Mark Nowak's
         Shut Up Shut Down, Natasha Tretheway'sNative Guard, Van Jordan'sMACNOLIA,
               and Claudia Rankine's85
            Don't Let Me Be Lonely; the dismemberment of a legal decision in M. NourbeSe Philip'sZong!which she breaks down to the phonemic level, yet includes in an appendix in its original form; and the excerpting of legal documents in Vanessa Place'sStatement of Facts. A politically motivated, cut-and-splice method joins officious official language with pop culture in poems by Timothy Donnelly and Geoffrey G. O'Brien that mash up the USA Patriot Act with Bruce Springsteen's “Born to Run” (Donnelly) and Jean Genet'sQuerelle(O'Brien). Their constraints vary in strictness. Donnelly wrote “The Last Dream of Light Released from Seaports” from a repertoire of words “selected from successive pages” of the Patriot Act and combined with Springsteen's 1975 hit song, but he does not specify the method further, and in several of his other endnotes states that terms were selected “randomly.”
               For his part, O'Brien composed “They Met Only in the Evenings” using only words that appear in the Patriot Act, with one word per line replaced with a word from Genet. The political statement made by both poems stems as much from the fact that the Patriot Act itself is a document that imposes constraints on public activities (and redraws the boundaries between what is private and what is public) as from the re-authoring and re-contextualizing that takes place through the cut-up method. The fear of official language machines and the effects of duplicating and grafting recur throughout Donnelly's book. “We become like those who seek to destroy us,” he writes in a line borrowed from a 2006 misquote of a 1946 telegram from U.S. diplomat George Kennan.86

Abstract: Having chosen to emphasize the ethnographic literature, the author made the further decision to embrace the entire continent in his survey. To exclude Egypt, Ethiopia, and North Africa, as has commonly been done, could only have the effect of obscuring the influences which have impinged on Negro Africa from the north and northeast and of injecting an element of unnecessary guesswork into their interpretation. To exclude Madagascar, moreover, would eliminate a prime source of information concerning the cultural impact on Africa of contacts with India and Malaysia by way of the ancient monsoon trade across the Indian Ocean.”

Abstract: Derrida defines “religion without religion” as religion without “institutional dogma” or “an article of faith” (GD 49) or, in other words, without synagogue, church, or mosque. But even more fundamentally, it is religion without God. Transcendence does not disappear, and it is even expressed as “
            Mysterium tremendum” (GD 53). But every other is wholly other (tout autre est tout autre), and we need not turn to God to find mysterious transcendence; we encounter it in “each man and woman” (GD 82–83). This could be an affirmation of theimago dei, the likeness of created human selves to their divine creator. But this is not Derrida's meaning. While the question of God in a deconstructive context is objectively undecidable, undecidability calls for decision, and Derrida has made his: “We should stop thinking about God as someone, over there, way up there, transcendent, and what is more … capable, more than any satellite orbiting in space, of seeing into the most secret of the most interior places. It is perhaps necessary … to think of God and of the name of God without such idolatrous stereotyping or representation” (GD 108).<br>

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Setting aside for a moment the tendency of relativism (or extreme subjectivity) to enervate leaps toward the possible-impossible (of Henri Lefebvre's Utopia in the positive), in contemporary social and political thought (identified by David Harvey as leading—by way of its uncertainty—to a nonproductive “both/and” cul-de-sac),
         Utopiaanddystopiareally cannot be interchangeable, as their aims are diametrically opposed. Even when the sense thatdystopiais the opposite ofUtopiapersists in definitions of the two terms, common usage tends to muddy the affair. In common parlance, the move is from difference to a conception of dystopia as “inverted Utopia” and from there to a kind of interchangeability between them: “a strand of utopianism or dystopianism,” as one writer put it, suggesting their indivisibility.
               Conjoining the two terms establishes a “both/and” condition and at best promises only confusion or at worst presupposes failure. If the first drains Utopia of its oppositional (or critical) dimension, the second asserts that Utopia is always already dystopia, no matter how initially attractive its proposition. In contrast, it would be more productive to maintain the “either/or” divide (arrived at dialectically) argued for by Harvey in19
            Spaces of Hope(2000). Only by making a deliberate decision between alternatives, that is, only when one option is cut off, can life be promised to the other. It is no wonder, then, that the verbto decidecarries within its very meaning a sense of necessary certainty, and judgment as well.<br>

Abstract: Medical humanities and ethics are getting more and more important in Europe as essential disciplines of the core curriculum for health-care professionals. The idea of the physician as a technician shows itself to be unbearable because of the global historical changes we daily face in caring settings. We deal with chronic diseases, which require a sensitive physician/patient covenant and a good performance in communication skills1 because a whole life-style transformation is often necessary. Moreover, citizens are more informed about both the technological progress and their civil rights, so that a shared decision has to be prepared and implemented by exploring the emotional reactions to illness, by explaining the effects of different ways of treatment, and by revealing in advance the choices that could be taken.<br>
