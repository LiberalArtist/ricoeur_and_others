  Claire: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Author(s) SCHLOSSER JULIA<br>
  Abstract: Claire came to live with me in 2009. I made the decision to euthanize her on July 5, 2011, because she suffered from osteomyelitis, a painful bone infection. I’ve lived with animals since I was four. In my adult life, I have loved, nursed, and mourned the loss of beloved animal companions. But when I reflect on Claire’s life, I am haunted by questions that I never had to ask when those other animals died. Would she have rather I left her where I met her, living in a cardboard box in a windowless bathroom? Or would she have made<br>

  Realism and Rhetoric in International Relations from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: The conduct of international relations has always involved skillful use of persuasive discourse. Relations between states might depend on factors such as military capability and natural resources, but the decisions made about the conduct of peace and war are also a result of the successes, failures, habits, and nuances of persuasive appeal among elites and publics alike. For the most part, however, academic research in international relations has not focused on the forms and effects of conversations, speeches, debates, narratives, or discourses in political practice. This systematic inattention to the role of words in foreign affairs is the result of<br>

  Strategic Intelligence and Discursive Realities from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: The realist is right about one thing: Much of the time, international politics boils down to strategy. The calculation of advantage in the game of nations is the first condition, the final necessity, and—not to be underestimated—the continuing attraction for those who presume to be players. Therefore, it is not enough for post-realists to articulate a broader conception of scientific inquiry; if we are to move beyond realism, we shall have to provide decision makers with better instruments for strategic analysis. It may seem that these two objectives are mutually contradictory. For example, the post-realist perspective exemplifies the<br>

  CHAPTER 5  “A Few Hours Wrong”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn7rg">The Cosmic Time of Empire</a><br>
  Abstract: Saleem Sinai’s observation on time in India, near the beginning of Salman Rushdie’s
                  Midnight’s Children(1981), provocatively links cross-cultural temporal difference with uneven modernization and linguistic variance. Saleem cannot decide whether the difference between Indian and English time is simply a technical glitch in the Bombay power supply, correctible by a more even and equitable distribution of electric current, or whether it rests on a more fundamental cultural distance written into the very vocabulary and syntax of Hindi. His indecision is emblematic of a central crisis in the treatment of time in the Indian novel in English. Is there an<br>

  [PART THREE Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnncj">Reason to Believe</a><br>
  Abstract: An adequate theory of cultural agency needs both a nonreductionist concept of culture as something that can have an independent impact and a concept of human agency in which people can adopt cultural meanings because they understand these impacts. I have argued that such a theory can be built on the concept of imaginative rationality. In some situations people may certainly create meanings in order to avoid or escape from their problematic experiences, as neo-Marxists would have it. However, the Evangelical men studied here seem to create meanings in order to confront problematic experiences. These decisions to believe are made<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pp657">The Maternal Factor</a><br>

  SEVEN  Needs, Wants, and Interests from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pp657">The Maternal Factor</a><br>
  Abstract: Care ethics is oriented to needs rather than rights. This orientation seems exactly right in the context of families and small communities, but it becomes more difficult to sustain in larger settings. Indeed some philosophers have argued that the concept of needs is too complex to employ usefully in policy decisions. I mentioned earlier in my very brief discussion of a care-driven approach to justice that care ethics is centrally concerned with needs. In the same chapter, I explored some of the difficulties we face in caring at a distance and deciding which obligations are individual and which collective. Now<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pp75p">Gadamer’s Repercussions</a><br>
  Author(s) WAITE GEOFF<br>
  Abstract: A good place to start is from where and whom we distance ourselves, even if ultimately we all think, make our decisions, and act “in the emptiness of a distance taken.”¹ Well-known statements by Gadamer observe a certain distance from Nietzsche, and Gadamer is not the explicit subject of my intervention in this anthology devoted to him and his repercussions. An essay on Nietzsche may be out of place,

  3  Decisive Identity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130hsq3">The Unfolding God of Jung and Milton</a><br>
  Abstract: In his epics Milton attempts to portray decisive identity. By “decisive identity” I mean a conscious guiding of individuation wherein identity and character are created through moral decisions. Decisive identity does not imply creating what we initially are. Rather, it involves consciously deciding what we become, which requires a troublesome but indispensable element, freedom. Milton develops themes, character, and plot by showing the origins and consequences of identity-forming decisions. These decisions are the foci of moral judgment and meaning. In
                  Paradise LostandParadise Regainedthe crucial decisions are those by Adam and Eve causing man’s fall and those by<br>

  Author(s) Erickson Amy<br>
  Abstract: In August of 1997, I was actively second-guessing my decision to leave Vail, Colorado, to start the Master of Divinity program at Columbia Theological Seminary. My sister-in-law, Denise, a pastor in the Presbyterian Church (USA), trying to be encouraging, predicted that because I loved literature, I would surely love the Old Testament. Perhaps I was in a particularly skeptical mood, but her analogy struck me as untenable. It made as much sense as if she had said, “You love Colorado, and so surely you will love Georgia.” I couldn’t see the connection. I loved medieval tales of Arthur, Beowulf, eighteenth-century<br>

  9  Edith Stein: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wzzs4">The Phenomenology of Prayer</a><br>
  Author(s) WRIGHT TERRENCE C.<br>
  Abstract: In her autobiography, Edith Stein tells us that at the age of fifteen she “deliberately and consciously” gave up praying.¹ Perhaps the most significant experience between this decision and her return to the practice of prayer with her conversion to Catholicism at the age of thirty was her contact with Edmund Husserl and his theory of phenomenology. In fact it may be the case, as Jude Dougherty has observed,² that her religious conversion was made possible by her philosophical conversion to phenomenology. Husserl, himself a convert to Christianity, understood prayer in terms of the inward turn of his transcendental phenomenology.<br>

  Conditions for Hospitality or Defence of Identity? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wzzzq">The Conditions of Hospitality: Ethics, Politics, and Aesthetics on the Threshold of the Possible</a><br>
  Author(s) GAD ULRIK PRAM<br>
  Abstract: As one of the last decisions before it disassembled for the summer break in 2008, the Danish Parliament,
                  Folketinget, passed two bills to facilitate the participation of Danish municipalities in the International Cities of Refuge Network (ICORN).¹ On the face of it, it might be good news that yet another country opens its borders to writers targeted with threats and persecution. As a condition for refuge in Denmark, however, any writer granted “refuge” under the umbrella of ICORN now has to sign a rather peculiar document—a “Declaration on recognition of the fundamental values of the Danish society” (cf. Appendix).<br>

  FIVE  Of Actants, Forces, and Things from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x00jv">Bruno Latour in Pieces: An Intellectual Biography</a><br>
  Abstract: Latour’s conviction that Pasteur and his allies had “redefined the social link” was clearly the result of his focused analysis of late nineteenth-century biological and medical journals. Yet one can also read this statement as the consequence of a conscious decision with political undertones. Or at least this has been suggested by the British science historian Simon Schaffer in a review essay of

  CHAPTER 5  Derrida’s Remains from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x01v0">For Derrida</a><br>
  Abstract: In a remarkable passage I have cited in part as an epigraph, Derrida gives, in the fifth of his last seminars, one more definition of
                  l’autre, the other. The concept of the other, as I have partly shown in Chapter 1, plays a crucial role in Derrida’s later writings on ethics, responsibility, politics, friendship, decision, religion, sacrifice, death, and other topics. An example is the long meditation on the phrasetout autre est tout autre, “every other is wholly other,” inThe Gift of Death(GD, 82–115; DM, 114–57). In the last seminars, in a passage already cited<br>

  CHAPTER 9  “The War Has Not Ended”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x026n">Crediting God: Sovereignty and Religion in the Age of Global Capitalism</a><br>
  Author(s) Balke Friedrich<br>
  Abstract: Thomas Hobbes’s political philosophy is based on a paradox: Hobbes, one could say, gives too much and too little to the state at the same time. He can thus be seen in the tradition of Leo Strauss, as the father of liberalism, but also, from a liberal perspective, he is dismissed as the guardian of state absolutism. Hobbes stresses the absoluteness of state power, being the sovereign, that is highest, not surmountable power, so strong that he denies to the subjects aligned with each other in the person of the Leviathan every right to defy a sovereign decision or to<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x06pt">Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness</a><br>
  Abstract: There is a time of forgiveness. Such a time may arise when the acuteness of the pain stemming from a personal or moral injury has abated, when a relationship that is dear outweighs the hurt of an offense, or when a decision is made to put an end to the cycles of violence and revenge. In a grammatical analogy, forgiveness may be said to be like a period, marking an end—an end to feelings of rancor and resentment toward another.

  6  Love and Justice from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x06pt">Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness</a><br>
  Abstract: For Vladimir Jankélévitch, forgiveness presents a moral dilemma. The oscillation between the unfortunate and the wicked and the oscillation between love and evil imply a dilemma that Jankélévitch maintains is insoluble. This dilemma contains within it the tension between justice and forgiveness and forces a decision within morality itself, for forgiveness and love, according to Jankélévitch, introduce an asymmetry that is at odds with the symmetry implicit in ethics and in law. This moral dilemma consequently appears as the conflict between two moralities, or, as Jankélévitch says, as the paradox of morality itself: on the one hand, the system of<br>

  Abstract: A minimum standard of justice would seem to require that all U.S. children have equal access to U.S. educational institutions, and that any school admissions policy that would exclude a candidate on the basis of race or ethnicity is in clear violation of this principle. Such a basic standard has certainly been upheld by the judgment of the Supreme Court in lawsuits where it was contravened. But I want to argue that the Court in coming to such a decision not only might be failing to serve justice, but in fact would be compounding a grave injustice—at least in<br>

  Abstract: Barth’s doctrine of reconciliation in
                  CDIV highlights the contingent event of reconciliation as the “centre of all Christian knowledge.” Barth announces that no other topic is of such crucial importance; all theology stands or falls with the fundamental decisions made at this point: “To fail here is to fail everywhere. To be on the right track here makes it impossible to be completely mistaken in the whole.”¹ This implies that Barth’s theological interpretation of the reconciliation in Christ is fundamental also for his ethics. It will turn out, however, that matters are not as simple as Barth suggests when<br>

  Abstract: So far it has been argued that there is a high degree of correspondence between form and content in Lethem’s work, and that the genre decisions he makes are integral to his view of the world as a series of semi-imagined subcultural groupings or, to reprise Rick Altman’s term,
                  ‘constellated communities’(Altman, 1999: 161). In the eccentric family unit formed at the end ofAmnesia Moonand in Alice Coombs’ parallel campus world, one sees a yearning for workable mini-utopias congruent with the implicit (and sometimes explicit) ties formed between readers of genre fiction.

  Abstract: The Christian tradition has been characterized by its commitment to the significance of the Bible for life and thought. Indeed, Christian communal identity has largely been formed around a set of literary texts that together form canonical scripture. As David Kelsey remarks, acknowledging the Bible as scripture lies at the very heart of participating in the community of Jesus Christ, and the decision to adopt the texts of Christian scripture as “canon” is not “a separate decision over and above a decision to become a Christian.”¹ Yet the past two centuries have seen considerable change in the nature and function<br>

  Abstract: This chapter traces the inception of André Neher’s significant role in the renewal of French Jewish intellectual and spiritual life after the Shoah. Born in 1914 in Obernai, in the Bas Rhin region of France, he was educated as both a secular intellectual and a religiously observant Jew. (His family moved to Strasbourg, which became French in 1918.) In 1936, aged twenty-two, he began to teach German language and literature at the Collège de Sarrebourg while also pursuing yeshiva studies in Montreux, Switzerland.¹ Mobilized in 1939, Neher made a crucial life decision when the Vichy government removed him from teaching<br>

  Abstract: De manera reiterada, el siglo XX latinoamericano registró golpes de Estado, regímenes autoritarios y dictaduras militares. Muchas veces la práctica del terrorismo de Estado formó parte de esas experiencias políticas. Un número importante de países tiene como consecuencia un legado de violaciones de los derechos humanos. Argentina, Chile, México y Uruguay ilustran diferentes formas de represión que han afectado a varias generaciones. Esta obra estudia primordialmente las decisiones que han tomado los gobiernos en relación con las demandas de verdad y justicia.<br>

  Book Title: The Cruelest of All Mothers: Marie de l'Incarnation, Motherhood, and Christian Tradition-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dunn Mary<br>
  Abstract: In 1631, Marie Guyart stepped over the threshold of the Ursuline convent in Tours, leaving behind her eleven-year-old son, Claude, against the wishes of her family and her own misgivings. Marie concluded, "God was dearer to me than all that. Leaving him therefore in His hands, I bid adieu to him joyfully." Claude organized a band of schoolboys to storm the convent, begging for his mother's return. Eight years later, Marie made her way to Quebec, where over the course of the next thirty-three years she opened the first school for Native American girls, translated catechisms into indigenous languages, and served some eighteen years as superior of the first Ursuline convent in the New World. She would also maintain, over this same period, an extensive and intimate correspondence with the son she had abandoned to serve God. The Cruelest of All Mothers is, fundamentally, an explanation of Marie de l'Incarnation's decision to abandon Claude for religious life. Complicating Marie's own explication of the abandonment as a sacrifice carried out in imitation of Christ and in submission to God's will, the book situates the event against the background of early modern French family life, the marginalization of motherhood in the Christian tradition, and seventeenth-century French Catholic spirituality. Deeply grounded in a set of rich primary sources, The Cruelest of All Mothers offers a rich and complex analysis of the abandonment.<br>

  Abstract: In discussing the historical plausibility or otherwise of episodes or speeches in the Fourth Gospel, a number of important interpretative decisions have to be taken. These methodological issues cannot be discussed in detail in this essay. My own opinion, as stated in my study of Galilee and the Gospels, is as follows: “The fact that Galilee enters the ironic patterns that the author (John) seeks to develop, shows just how important the memories associated with the region were to Christian self-understanding, even when there is no concern to develop a realistic narrative of that setting” (Freyne 1988, 131–32).

  Abstract: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is driven by the idea that businesses are part of society and therefore ought to contribute positively to social conditions and goals. Some of these conditions and goals include the democratic principles of respect for human rights, the rule of law, and transparent decision-making. CSR proponents argue that businesses should be held accountable not only for their economic impact on society but also for the other non-economic consequences of their activities on society and the natural environment.¹ There is growing pressure on businesses to respect human rights and the rule of law wherever they operate, to<br>

Given my research experience and my relationships with Ngäbe people, here I examine and understand women’s roles in their relationships with men as they have changed in contexts related to globalization.¹ In 1964, I observed that women seemed to be passive observers of male decision-making in the public arena.

  Abstract: In all societies, there are differences in power between persons. There is not a single society where all adults have exactly the same influence over every decision, where everyone has exactly the same rights and duties. Social differentiation and inequality are, in other words, universal phenomena. The European ideas of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries about the ‘original primitive society’, where all humans supposedly had the same rank and were political equals, was completely devastated when the first professional ethnographers returned from the field. Even among very small groups, and even among peoples with very simple technology, differences in rank<br>

  Abstract: In this society, the white person has an everyday option not to think of herself in racial terms at all. In fact, whites appear to pursue that option so habitually that it may be a defining characteristic of whiteness: to be white is not to think about it.¹ I label the tendency for whiteness to vanish from whites’ self-perception the transparency phenomenon.² Because transparency is such a pervasive fact of whites’ conceptualization of ourselves, we have reason to be skeptical of ostensibly race-neutral decisionmaking by white decisionmakers. I propose that white decisionmakers adopt that deliberate skepticism as well regarding their<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1bw1kc5">Critical White Studies</a><br>

  Abstract: The most striking characteristic of whites’ consciousness of whiteness is that most of the time we don’t have any. I call this the
                  transparencyphenomenon: the tendency of whites not to think about whiteness, or about norms, behaviors, experiences, or perspectives that are white-specific. Transparency often is the mechanism through which white decisionmakers who disavow white supremacy impose white norms on blacks. [See also Chapters 15, 35, and 97. Ed.] Transparency operates to require black assimilation even when pluralism is the articulated goal; it affords substantial advantages to whites over blacks even when decisionmakers intend to effect substantive racial justice.<br>

And then, to group these objects according to your decision, to your will or whim, with the conviction that, grouped in just this way, they render with more truth and blatancy their meaning and significance into the field of obviousness; creating a profile of the ‘fabric’ of historical facts and layers – of which they give evidence – thereby revealing the malignancy of the era. Yugomuseum is the result of such a wish.<br>

  three  Satan in Story and Myth from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4ks4">Facing the Fiend</a><br>
  Abstract: Satan is part of the myth of evil and if we assume that the story is one way to approach the reality of evil, we need to examine the myth in more detail. From a secular viewpoint, any metaphysical approach to the question of evil does not work. The responsibilities for all human actions lay, since Kant, in the agent’s will and accordingly, so does the decision to commit an evil deed. Nevertheless, despite all efforts to explain human behavior with psychology, sociology, biology, and psychoanalysis, there seems to be an explanatory gap when it comes to actions that hurt<br>

  1  Peace Overtures, the Allies, and the Holocaust, 1942–1945 from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4n1q">Dealing with Dictators</a><br>
  Abstract: In a forgotten episode of World War II, the United States and Great Britain chose to provoke a German invasion of Hungary (and Romania) in order to “spread the Germans thin” in Western Europe and facilitate the Allied landing in France in 1944. This decision appears to have been made without concern for the last remaining Jewish community in Europe, then numbering 825,000 people, or for Hungarian democratic elements. Allied planners expected that the Germans would need ten to fifteen divisions to occupy Hungary, troops that would thus be rendered unavailable for the fighting in Normandy. No calculation seems to<br>

  Book Title: Religion and Violence-A Dialectical Engagement through the Insights of Bernard Lonergan<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Arcamone Dominic<br>
  Abstract: The aim of Religion and Violence is to engage dialectically key symbols of religiously motivated violence through the insights of Bernard Lonergan. Sociologists and psychologists argue the link between religion and violence. Religion is viewed more as part of the problem and not part of the solution to violence. Bernard Lonergan’s insights have helped the author arrive at a number of conclusions regarding the link between religion and violence. He argues that there is a difference between distorted religion and genuine religion, between authenticity and inauthenticity of the subject. Distorted religion has the capacity to shape traditions in ways that justify violence, while genuine religion heals persons, helps them make different moral decisions when confronted with situations of conflict, and aims to explore new ways of understanding themselves as shaping history toward progress. Further, Religion and Violence, while arguing from within the Catholic Christian tradition, nevertheless seeks to provide a number of categories that will speak to people from other cultural traditions. Since many of the examples of religious violence cited by commentators come out of the Islamic tradition, the author has evidenced and explored more authentic aspects of the Islamic tradition that would help provide a solution to violence.<br>

  Book Title: Red, White, and Blue-A Critical Analysis of Constitutional Law<br>
  Publisher: University Press of Kansas<br>
  Author(s): Levinson Sanford<br>
  Abstract: The first paperback edition of a classic of American constitutional theory. The book is divided into two parts. In Part I Professor Tushnet appraises the five major competing "grand theories" of constitutional law and interpretation, and, argues that none of them satisfy their own requirements for coherence and judicial constraint. In Part II the author offers a descriptive sociology of constitutional doctrine and raises critical questions as to whether a grand theory is necessary, is it possible to construct a coherent, useful grand theory, and is construction of an uncontroversial grand theory possible?Professor Tushnet's new Afterword is organized in parallel fashion to the original text. Part I offers a new survey of the contemporary terrain of constitutional interpretation. Part II provides an extended discussion of the most prominent of contemporary efforts to provide an external analysis of constitutional law, the idea of regime politics. This includes discussion of major court decisions, including

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ch7988">Red, White, and Blue</a><br>
  Abstract: The past few years have seen a remarkable revival of interest in comprehensive normative theories of constitutional law. These grand theories, as I will call them, attempt to provide justifications for the exercise of the power of judicial review in a democracy, that is, the power that courts whose judges are appointed for life have which allows them to displace decisions made by representatives of the people. Current interest in grand theory is striking for two reasons. First, despite the existence of competing grand theories, each one is in its essentials a revived and purified version of an earlier grand<br>

  4  Antiformalism in Constitutional Theory from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ch7988">Red, White, and Blue</a><br>
  Abstract: The preceding chapters have examined a number of efforts to explain why a small group of people, called judges, should be allowed to displace the otherwise legally authoritative decisions of a somewhat larger group of people, called legislators, who are selected by processes that seem closer to the normatively attractive mechanisms of democracy than those used to select judges.¹ These efforts attempt to provide “formalist” solutions to the countermajoritarian difficulty with which the liberal tradition is concerned. This chapter examines antiformalist attempts to displace concern with the countermajoritarian difficulty rather than to allay that concern. It argues that these antiformalist<br>

  Abstract: Canadian political thinkers are currently grappling with many difficult questions in the face of the need for critical existential decisions: 1) Can the Canadian federal system survive the sovereignty of Quebec and aboriginal groups? 2) Are the special rights that accompany group sovereignty necessarily divisive, and do they spell the doom of Canada as a nationstate? 3) Should immigrants to Canada enjoy the same cultural protection as aboriginal peoples and French Canadians? 4) Can community rights be accommodated within Canadian liberal-democratic institutions?<br>

Professionals and health care decision makers now wrestle with increasingly complex sets of challenges that must involve various types of professionals in programs of care. The result is that administrators, nurses, physicians, social workers and other professionals have had diverse roles to play in programs of care and, consequently, have insisted that their voices be heard in the decision-making process alongside the voices of patients and their families.

The performer, the ethnographer who documents the performance, the translator, an editor, or a publisher may decide that a feature of a story or song should be withheld or transformed, usually to protect someone or something from moral or spiritual contamination. Under ideal conditions, the performer should not feel<br>

  Author(s) BROPHY ALFRED L.<br>
  Abstract: Pre–Civil War Americans turned to all sorts of technology, from canals, steam power, and the telegraph to more obscure forms such as the daguerreotype and mining lamps, to hasten the pace of economic and moral progress. Law was another key technology they used. The law worked in favor of economic growth in several ways. First, judicial decisions self-consciously molded the law to promote economic efficiency. Second, legislatures used statutes to streamline credit markets, market transactions, and the formation of corporations. For the last several decades, scholars have often invoked Morton J.

  Abstract: Nuestras controversias morales, más allá de los asuntos concretos (

Lo mismo pasa con las decisiones judiciales. El juez, ¿debe discernir qué es lo objetivamente justo o injusto en un caso, o solo debe mediar entre intereses contrapuestos, igual de subjetivos?

  Book Title: Laudato Si-Carta encíclica de S. S. Francisco. Sobre el cuidado de la casa común<br>
  Publisher: Ediciones UC<br>
  Abstract: La nueva Encíclica del papa Francisco, Laudato si’, sobre el cuidado de la casa común, se centra en el cuidado de la tierra y las relaciones humanas que en ella se desarrollan. Es un texto con un fuerte acento social en torno al concepto de ecología integral, como paradigma capaz de articular las relaciones fundamentales de la persona: con Dios, consigo misma, con los demás seres humanos y con la creación. En el centro del recorrido de la Laudato si’ encontramos este interrogante: “¿Qué tipo de mundo queremos dejar a quienes nos sucedan, a los niños que están creciendo?" y sobre ella se plantea una serie de preguntas sobre el sentido de la vida, el trabajo y las relaciones sociales, entre otras. Si bien el mensaje de Francisco generará un impacto sobre las importantes y urgentes decisiones en el ámbito político ambiental, el texto posee una eminente riqueza “magisterial, pastoral y espiritual" propios de su naturaleza, cuya amplitud, profundidad y mensaje no pueden reducirse al aspecto de las determinaciones de las políticas ambientales.<br>

  Book Title: Taking Hold of the Real-Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Profound Worldliness of Christianity<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Harvey Barry<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer writes in one of his last prison letters that he had “come to know and understand more and more the profound this-worldliness of Christianity." In Taking Hold of the Real, Barry Harvey engages in constructive conversation with Bonhoeffer, contending that the “shallow and banal this-worldliness" of modern society is ordered to a significant degree around the social technologies of religion, culture, and race. These mechanisms displace human beings from their traditional connections with particular locales, and relocate them in their “proper places" as determined by the nation-state and capitalist markets. Christians are called to participate in the profound this-worldliness that breaks into the world in the apocalyptic action of Jesus Christ, a form of life that requires discipline and an understanding of death and resurrection. The church is a sacrament of this new humanity, performing for all to hear the polyphony of life that was prefigured in the Old Testament and now is realised in Christ. Unable to find a faithful form of this-worldliness in wartime Germany, Bonhoeffer joined the conspiracy against Hitler, a decision aptly contrasted with a small French church that, prepared by its life together over many generations, saved thousands of Jewish lives.<br>

  Abstract: When asked about the victory against Napoleon at Waterloo, the Duke of Wellington is said to have replied, “The battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton.” It was the habits and dispositions that the officers and soldiers of the British army learned in boarding school that enabled Great Britain to prevail in the encounter. Samuel Wells contends that Eton and Waterloo exemplify two distinct aspects of ethical thought and behavior, the first the long period of preparation, the second “the tiny episode of implementation—the moment of decision, or ‘situation.’” Of the two, says Wells, the<br>

Over the last two centuries, the energy industry has produced iconic figures whose biographies are studied by entrepreneurs, whose opinions about the market shape economies beyond the energy sector, and whose decisions channel a violent flow of petrodollars from extraction sites to private firms.

  Author(s) James Sarah<br>
  Abstract: To characterise John Capgrave as a writer of ‘literature’ has been, until recently, to court controversy, if not outright dissent. In his foreword to the Early English Text Society’s edition of Capgrave’s
                  Life of St Katherine, Frederick Furnivall spares no time to consider what, if any, literary merit might attach to the work, being instead concerned to provide a rather patronising author portrait before launching into an embittered attack upon Carl Horstmann’s editorial decision-making; the text, it seems, is of no more than antiquarian concern.¹ More recently M.

  Abstract: Sanctity, the quality of being holy, is by definition an inviolable state.¹ This chapter takes as its subject two plays that give dramatic shape to the life of Mary Magdalene, the sinner turned saint whose conversion might best be read as a crash course in becoming holy. They are: the Digby

Although migration may be a straightforward demographic event, the context in which it occurs and the mechanisms underlying it are often highly complex, and require careful study.

  Abstract: In the previous chapter I suggested that thinking with community and how – and to what – people construct belonging illuminates processes of social change and continuity from particular social locations or positions. Retirement migration was presented as a form and consequence of social change, involving both boundary spanning and reconstitution. The important role of nostalgia as a cultural resource in constructing belonging to different forms of community, evoking an imagined lost place or time, particularly for older people was also considered. In this chapter, I explore the reasons for women’s dislocation in and from the UK, and the decision-making<br>

  Abstract: Throughout this book we have followed women’s migration journeys across space and time as they spanned and reconstituted boundaries. Beginning with their pre-migration lives – characterised for many by fractured belonging in the UK – upper and more proximate structures enabled and facilitated their agency in moving to Spain in retirement. We have also seen that women’s positionalities and unique biographies are also significant in shaping migration choices, decision-making processes and their post-migration lives. I framed divergent migration trajectories in relation to two plot typologies: the quest and voyage and return. Those women who ultimately chose to remain in Spain<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1t89h5j">Localism and neighbourhood planning</a><br>
  Author(s) Sparling William<br>
  Abstract: Whether the state strategy of localism delivers on its promise of empowerment depends on the extent to which it devolves effective instruments of policy to citizens and communities. The devolution of localism is commonly conveyed by invitation to citizens to join local governance structures or be included in neighbourhood management projects (Lowndes and Sullivan, 2008). Citizens seldom acquire the right to make decisions as a collective, and it is rare for statutory power to be designed to be wielded by public participants rather than public officials (Bradley, 2015). This chapter examines the use of statutory planning powers to effect spatial<br>

  Abstract: At the time of writing in the summer of 2016, 1,900 neighbourhood plans were under way across England, and more than 200 had passed referendum and were being used to help make development decisions (Planning Aid England, 2016). A movement of citizen-planners had responded with pragmatic enthusiasm to the conditional and much-circumscribed opportunity to influence the look and feel of their communities. In no other case study of devolution, across a broad international canvas, do we see so vividly the liberatory and regulatory conflicts that arise from the assemblages of localism, or the tangled relations of power and identity that<br>

It is necessarily a product and reflection of its time, derived from the initiative of an individual, group or state. The production and reception of monuments are determined by three diachronic historical moments. First, the moment of the historical event or figure which it represents or denotes. Second, the moment at which the monument was conceived and constructed. Third, the moment(s) of its reception, when subjected to interpretation or debate due to its renewed political relevance, a decision to renovate or demolish the monument, or even<br>

  Abstract: From the nineteenth century until the mid-twentieth, European imperial powers imposed legal and economic restrictions on Siam, as Thailand was called until 1939. These restrictions limited Siam’s sovereignty in ways that made it comparable to a European colony. Siam, from this angle, appears colonized. However, this comparison uncritically locates Siam as a victim of the West without questioning the aggrandizing activities engaged in by Siam’s rulers or challenging the conformist historiography that it produces. Below I compare Siam to imperial Britain to reveal their arresting similarities. Siam most closely approximates patterns of British imperialism in its decision to create Islamic<br>

  Author(s) REICHBERG GREGORY M.<br>
  Abstract: Over the past few years a debate has arisen among proponents of just war thinking about the correct starting point for moral reflection on war. The debate concerns how moral reasoning should proceed when the just war criteria of legitimate authority, just cause, and right intention are made to inform decision making about resort to military force

The judicious use of the subjective camera is an especially effective technique when appropriately modified to evoke alien perspectives, those radically unlike our own.

  Abstract: The purpose of this chapter is to consider possibilities for sustainable management of highly migratory tuna fisheries in the Central and Western Pacific—specifically the area covered by the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of South Pacific Forum member countries and contiguous high seas areas. The chapter adopts a definition of common property as property that is controlled collectively by a defined group of decision-making units, rather than as no property or open access. Sustainability is defined as management that will enable long-term harvesting of the fisheries resources at their maximum sustainable yield. This chapter does not attempt<br>

  Abstract: Several common themes and conclusions have emerged from the contributions assembled in this volume. First, and perhaps not surprisingly, collective memories emerge in a variety of cultural and national contexts to greatly influence various foreign policies, bilateral relationships, and international affairs. Nevertheless, the ways in which collective memories become influential factors in decision making are not always as expected. The ways that memories are used as rhetorical weapons are often surprising. Although the emotions that are embedded in these memories-as-weapons are visceral and, as with other more conventional weapons, can be highly divisive and even dangerous.<br>

  Abstract: Sin and evil are categories traditional to Catholic theology, even if Lonergan’s analysis of them is his own. Bias, an inauthentic orientation caused by and causal of inauthentic actions, decisions, judgments, ideas, and experiences, is a concept more original to Lonergan. It is both the result of sin and a cause of further sin.¹ As such, bias functions in a way I find similar to Aristotle’s bad habits, or vices.² However, while Aristotle discusses vice as an extreme on either side of a golden mean, Lonergan analyzes bias in terms of conscious intentionality, social dynamics, and history.

  Abstract: Gaps between global ideals of HIV/AIDS prevention and the reality of local initiatives have been widely noted. Globally sanctioned interventions such as promoting rational decision making around sex, and the ABC model (Abstinence, Be faithful, and use Condoms), draw from behaviour models that regard sexual behaviour as risky when it deviates from narrowly defined norms. Assumptions about reasoned sexual practice are rooted in conceptions of human behaviour that assume individuals can and do routinely assess risks from a narrow rationalistic point of view, and modify their behaviour accordingly. When rational sex is put into practice, cracks show up almost immediately,<br>

  Abstract: A problem that reciprocally involved both subject matter and formality engaged the Abstract Expressionist painters of the middle and late forties. It was how to make paintings that would be powerful signifiers, and this led to decisions as to what signifiers could be properly referred to without compromising (too much) the flatness of the picture plane. The desire for a momentous content was constricted by the spatial requirement of flatness and by the historically influenced need to avoid direct citation of objects. Something of this train of thought can be seen in Barnett Newman’s reflections on the role of the<br>

  Abstract: Consider statutes and judicial decisions, two of the most common legal artifacts. If one accepts that statutes are not enacted by legislatures and that judicial decisions are not made by courts with a view to applying to foreign legal cultures, then legal borrowing across legal cultures is the practice of interrupting intention, which is a form of epistemic violence.¹ Statutes and judicial decisions nonetheless regularly find themselves being imported across legal cultures—that is, across cultures and languages—in order to underwrite local reforming agendas. In the process, these texts pass into new semiotic constellations. However, just as there cannot<br>

  Book Title: Professionalism in the Information and Communication Technology Industry-  Publisher: ANU E Press<br>
  Author(s): Selgelid Michael J.<br>
  Abstract: Professionalism is arguably more important in some occupations than in others. It is vital in some because of the life and death decisions that must be made, for example in medicine. In others the rapidly changing nature of the occupation makes efficient regulation difficult and so the professional behaviour of the practitioners is central to the good functioning of that occupation. The core idea behind this book is that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is changing so quickly that professional behaviour of its practitioners is vital because regulation will always lag behind.<br>

  Abstract: In the first chapter of this book the Hon Michael Kirby showed the difficulties of regulating new technologies, information and communications technology (ICT) included. These difficulties, we argued, highlight the need for a high level of professionalism in the ICT industry and sections two to six all focused on aspects of ICT professionalism. This section brings to the fore an important role for the ICT professional that has been in the background in at least some of the earlier papers but is discussed explicitly here; the ICT professionalʹs role in decisions regarding the development and use of technology in society.<br>

  Book Title: The Machine Question-Critical Perspectives on AI, Robots, and Ethics<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Gunkel David J.<br>
  Abstract: One of the enduring concerns of moral philosophy is deciding who or what is deserving of ethical consideration. Much recent attention has been devoted to the "animal question" -- consideration of the moral status of nonhuman animals. In this book, David Gunkel takes up the "machine question": whether and to what extent intelligent and autonomous machines of our own making can be considered to have legitimate moral responsibilities and any legitimate claim to moral consideration. The machine question poses a fundamental challenge to moral thinking, questioning the traditional philosophical conceptualization of technology as a tool or instrument to be used by human agents. Gunkel begins by addressing the question of machine moral agency: whether a machine might be considered a legitimate moral agent that could be held responsible for decisions and actions. He then approaches the machine question from the other side, considering whether a machine might be a moral patient due legitimate moral consideration. Finally, Gunkel considers some recent innovations in moral philosophy and critical theory that complicate the machine question, deconstructing the binary agent--patient opposition itself. Technological advances may prompt us to wonder if the science fiction of computers and robots whose actions affect their human companions (think of HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey) could become science fact. Gunkel's argument promises to influence future considerations of ethics, ourselves, and the other entities who inhabit this world.<br>

  Abstract: Moral philosophy has typically, in one way or another, made exclusive decisions about who is and who is not a legitimate moral agent and/or patient. We have, in effect, sought to determine the line dividing who or what is considered a member of the community of moral subjects from who or what remains outside. And we have done so by, as Thomas Birch (1993, 315) explains, assuming “that we can and ought to find, formulate, establish, institute in our practices, a criterion for (a proof schema of) membership in the class of beings that are moral

  Abstract: There is, perhaps, an excessive obviousness in the decision to focus on the concept of freedom in any discussion of Jean-Paul Sartre, since if there is one pre-eminently Sartrean theme, it is arguably that of freedom. However, precisely because of the dangers inherent in the ‘obviousness’, in regarding the chosen subject as already known and comprehended, but also because of the inevitably changing and evolving sense of the term in the context of a lifetime’s passionate engagement, we would be wrong to think that we fully understand Sartre’s repeated working through – ‘elaboration’ in the strongest Gramscian sense – of<br>

  Abstract: The publication of this book comes at a time when humanities in general, and the teaching of modern foreign languages in particular, feel threatened because of uncertainty in relation to financial and economic circumstances. French Studies departments already faced difficulties when, in 2004, the education department for England decided that a foreign-language GCSE was no longer required to access higher education, a decision that resulted in the dropping of language teaching in many secondary schools. Learning a foreign language is perceived in the UK as being difficult and, the subject having in essence become optional, few pupils enrol in language<br>

  Abstract: The idea of corruption as capture-by-evil captures many of our intuitions. Its use in law, however, is fraught with problems. As a dispositional concept, the idea of corruption as capture-by-evil potentially contravenes the idea that we should punish
                  acts, notpersons. In addition, invitations to decision makers to implement subjective ideas of evil are arguably invitations toward standardlessness, emotionally driven prosecutions, and other violations of basic guarantees of the rule of law.

  Abstract: Today democracy is increasingly recognized around the world as the only form of government with moral legitimacy. The problems of establishing and preserving truly democratic institutions, however, vary dramatically from culture to culture. Justice and Democracy explores these problems from a wide range of perspectives, theoretical and practical. It addresses problems related to the distortion of democratic decision-making by the gross disparities in wealth that arise in capitalist economies, and, in particular, focuses on the problems relating to the reconciliation of democratic values with the indigenous religious and social values of a culture.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wrjgw">Textual Intimacy</a><br>
  Abstract: Autobiographies by Religious Dwellers differ from those by Religious Debtors primarily by locating religion and its positive role in the present. While religion may also have been part of the past, the focus is on the way in which it helps to account for where the writer is at the time of writing. The emphasis is less on recovery than on discovery, on having found something or having reached a location, decision, or point of arrival that often is marked by a new or renewed affiliation.<br>

  Abstract: In 1975, my wife and I made what in retrospect was our second wisest decision—second only, that is, to our getting married a year earlier—which was to buy property in the San Francisco Bay Area. Along with the house came with what in Berkeley was a reasonably sized garden, which had several generations of previous plantings waiting to surprise us when the seasons changed. I can remember in particular my feeling of delight when in February a profusion of delicate yellow petals on tall stalks above a cluster of clover-like leaves broke through the ground seemingly everywhere.

  Book Title: A Theory of the Trial-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burns Robert P.<br>
  Abstract: Anyone who has sat on a jury or followed a high-profile trial on television usually comes to the realization that a trial, particularly a criminal trial, is really a performance. Verdicts seem determined as much by which lawyer can best connect with the hearts and minds of the jurors as by what the evidence might suggest. In this celebration of the American trial as a great cultural achievement, Robert Burns, a trial lawyer and a trained philosopher, explores how these legal proceedings bring about justice. The trial, he reminds us, is not confined to the impartial application of legal rules to factual findings. Burns depicts the trial as an institution employing its own language and styles of performance that elevate the understanding of decision-makers, bringing them in contact with moral sources beyond the limits of law.<br>

  Abstract: The rules of the trial are Plato’s revenge on the rhetoricians.

The point at issue between Mink Snopes and Jack Houston is a fence.¹ Unfenced or open range represented for Mink, and the southern tenantry, access to common use rights. Whereas, the principle, “fence stock, not crop,” served the interests of owners such as Houston. Varner, the magistrate, “fence rail…, thin,”² decides for Houston.

Moreover, we argued that it was only with the transcendent (what Rudolf Otto termed the

Merely to think in such terms marked a major break with all previous understandings of democratic politics. Historically, democracy rested on the idea that all the institutions of government were strictly responsible to the sovereign people, who alone determined the public interest. The government chosen by the people at the polls was supposed to implement the decisions of the voters, and the bureaucracy was merely an arm of the elected government. In this context, the phrase

  Abstract: The ability to imagine alternative scenarios is a ubiquitous, if not essential, part of human mental life.¹ It is a universal phenomenon, not a practice restricted to or more pronounced in Western culture.² Counterfactuals are routinely used by ordinary people and policymakers to work their way through problems, reach decisions, cope with anxiety, and make normative judgments. They are readily inspired by disconfirmed expectations and failed actions and the regrets they evoke.³ In these circumstances, counterfactual scenarios can empower us by making us believe that we could have brought about better outcomes.⁴ When people invent counterfactuals for any of these<br>

  Book Title: Politics and the Imagination-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Geuss Raymond<br>
  Abstract: In politics, utopians do not have a monopoly on imagination. Even the most conservative defenses of the status quo, Raymond Geuss argues, require imaginative acts of some kind. In this collection of recent essays, including his most overtly political writing yet, Geuss explores the role of imagination in politics, particularly how imaginative constructs interact with political reality. He uses decisions about the war in Iraq to explore the peculiar ways in which politicians can be deluded and citizens can misunderstand their leaders. He also examines critically what he sees as one of the most serious delusions of western political thinking--the idea that a human society is always best conceived as a closed system obeying fixed rules. And, in essays on
      Don Quixote, museums, Celan's poetry, Heidegger's brother Fritz, Richard Rorty, and bourgeois philosophy, Geuss reflects on how cultural artifacts can lead us to embrace or reject conventional assumptions about the world. While paying particular attention to the relative political roles played by rule-following, utilitarian calculations of interest, and aspirations to lead a collective life of a certain kind, Geuss discusses a wide range of related issues, including the distance critics need from their political systems, the extent to which history can enlighten politics, and the possibility of utopian thinking in a world in which action retains its urgency.<br>

  VIII  Celan’s Meridian from:

  Abstract: In October 1960 the German Academy for Language and Literature in Darmstadt made what might seem to be a highly peculiar decision. It presented the prestigious Georg-Büchner-Preis¹ for literature to the forty-year old poet Paul Celan, a man who had never spent any appreciable amount of time living in an officially German-speaking country. Celan was born in 1920 over a thousand kilometers east of Darmstadt in the city of Czernowitz in the Bukovina. Bukovina had been the most easterly province of the Austro-Hungarian empire between the late eighteenth century and the end of World War I. In 1918 it was<br>

To improve the conditions of poor people in Chicago would take the help of city hall and eventually even the federal government. With the help of labor unions and social-reform organizations, she was able to institute juvenile-court laws, the first “mother’s pension” law, tenement-house regulations, an eight-hour workday law for women, factory-inspection laws, and workers’ compensation.<br>

  Abstract: There is a wealth of secondary literature on Darwin’s species concept, covering many different perspectives of the topic.¹ Of the various accounts available, I have always been particularly intrigued by Frank Sulloway’s suggestion that Darwin’s choice of species concept was guided by “tactical” considerations. Among those tactical considerations was the decision to employ his fellow naturalists’ species concept, in order to speak to them “in their own language” (Sulloway 1979, p. 37). Implicit in the suggestion is that Darwin was a member of a fairly clear-cut community of naturalists. In order to communicate with them about natural history, either to<br>

  Abstract: Architectural design entails the conscious enactment of a comprehensive decision-making endeavour, which necessitates, on the part of the architect, a never-ending sequence of value judgements. In all cases, the formulation of judgements requires the explicit use of criteria. In this context, a criterion may be understood as a standard by which a thing is assessed. Whether explicitly expressed or not, the validity of the criteria depends upon how well they conform to corresponding human values, which, in turn, underpin judgements.

He had worked at McGill since his arrival in Canada in 1949 with good results, building up the theory and composition department, establishing the Electronic Music Studio, and forming his reputation as a teacher and a composer.

  Abstract: In an article written shortly before the passage of the Constitution Act, 1982, Peter Russell declared that in Canada there was no informed discussion about the proper purview of courts in a democratic society. As a consequence, Russell said, future court decisions based on the Charter would provide Canadians with a crash course in the promises and perils of judicial policy-making (Russell, 1982:33). After seven years of this crash course, what lessons have we learned about judicial policymaking? The most conspicuous lesson is that, in spite of numerous predictions to the contrary, Canadian courts have shown themselves, in cases covering<br>

  Abstract: As noted at the end of the last chapter, our focus throughout this study has remained on Schillebeeckx’s and Metz’s projects, and the decision to avoid transitioning toward a more general examination of prophetic and apocalyptic eschatologies was a deliberate one. I would be remiss, however, if that decision were allowed to conceal the larger theological milieu in which their projects developed. Here, I do not have in mind the numerous cultural, theological, and philosophical currents identified throughout our study that informed and gave direction, dialectically and otherwise, to Schillebeeckx’s and Metz’s eschatologies.

More than thirty years have elapsed since Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. led thousands of nonviolent protestors across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, to confront the racist phalanx of state police troopers defending segregation. The politics of resistance at that turbulent moment in our history gave new meaning to our sense of identity. The politics of soul in the 1960s was the personal and collective decision to fight for<br>

  4  Did Someone Say Autonomy? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qfs6k">Negotiating Justice</a><br>
  Abstract: Autonomy is both a value and a goal espoused by most theories of progressive lawyering, which are rooted in the presumption that most clients are competent and entitled to make informed decisions. Progressive lawyering literature calls for attorneys to practice in ways that foster rather than impede client autonomy. Indeed, autonomy often is seen as a component of respect for clients. It is also an expression and affirmation of the belief that clients and lawyers are equals, a form of resistance that seeks to challenge dominant notions of the hierarchical relationship between lawyers and clients, particularly between low-income clients and<br>

  5  Collaboration from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qfs6k">Negotiating Justice</a><br>
  Abstract: The previous chapter focused on the value of client autonomy. This chapter examines a technique of lawyering that has been called “collaborative lawyering,” which is in many ways closely tied to notions of autonomy. Collaborative lawyering models portray lawyers and clients as “co-eminent problem solvers.”¹ This term is rooted in a belief that both lawyers and clients can and should contribute knowledge and skills to the relationship, and that clients should make decisions and take actions. In this chapter, I briefly examine the basis for collaborative lawyering and advocate adoption of a broad definition of collaboration. Relying on that definition,<br>

  6  Lawyer and Client: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qfs6k">Negotiating Justice</a><br>
  Abstract: Progressive lawyering literature stresses the importance of focusing on clients. The basis for client-centeredness is respect for clients, client autonomy, and decision making. Legal services lawyers and clients in this study reveal a complex foundation for a practice centered on the individual client: the often transformative nature of the client-lawyer relationship for both client and lawyer. This takes place when lawyer and client open themselves to each other, even within the limited context of their legal services relationship. Beyond the material assistance clients seek from NELS, empathy, respect, and a feeling of connection are deeply powerful and affirming for people<br>

  Abstract: Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s apparently absolute defense of individual rights in her talk from 1892, “Solitude of Self,” rests on a sober confrontation with mortality. She was seventy-six years old, still vibrant intellectually but facing the increasing physical limitations of old age. The feminist movement she had piloted since the 1840s was shifting away from a broad natural rights defense of women’s equality in all areas of life into a narrower, more respectable campaign for the vote. Without question, she understood the importance of suffrage, for without the vote no person could participate in the great decisions of the day, in<br>

  Abstract: This chapter examines the specific phases and turning points of the life course that can influence the decision of young people to choose singleness as a way of life or become single by virtue of structural conditions. The research focused on a group of young, urban singles from Budapest. Singles are understood as those young adults at an age (25–40) typically devoted to family, living alone in their own household and having neither a durable partnership nor children. The population I studied was that of urban singles in their thirties from the upper social strata, having (at least) a<br>

  Abstract: Social workers are charged with entering the lives and moral worlds of families, many of whom have routinely experienced disrespect, and have longstanding histories of material and emotional deprivation. In entering such lives, social workers share with those they encounter universal experiences of loss and disappointment. However, there are additional issues that arise in the course of doing such a job involving the making of decisions that bring pain and hurt as well as joy and support with consequences that can endure for generations. This dual mandate (often known as care and control) is one to be treated with humility<br>

  Author(s) He Baogang<br>
  Abstract: In the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen Square event, the Chinese government has both tightened its authoritarian rule and introduced a wide variety of local mini-democratisation practices, including village elections, township elections, intra-party democracy, participatory and deliberative forums, and participatory budgeting. While these do not jeopardise the monopoly of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on political decision making, they illustrate major trends and characteristics of Chinese democratisation and highlight the Chinese hybrid model of democratisation. This chapter focuses on official democratic mechanisms and institutions initiated at the local level, rather than on more general aspects of democratisation, such as rights<br>

However, the decision to put this chapter first is not entirely arbitrary.¹ From a historical point of view, Castoriadis was one of the first major political and social theorists of the Left – a founding member of the famous

  Book Title: Cops, Teachers, Counselors-Stories from the Front Lines of Public Service<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Musheno Michael<br>
  Abstract: Whether on a patrol beat, in social service offices, or in public school classrooms, street-level workers continually confront rules in relation to their own beliefs about the people they encounter. Cops, Teachers, Counselors is the first major study of street-level bureaucracy to rely on storytelling. Steven Maynard-Moody and Michael Musheno collect the stories told by these workers in order to analyze the ways that they ascribe identities to the people they encounter and use these identities to account for their own decisions and actions. The authors show us how the world of street-level work is defined by the competing tensions of law abidance and cultural abidance in a unique study that finally allows cops, teachers, and counselors to voice their own views of their work.Steven Maynard-Moody is Director of the Policy Research Institute and Professor of Public Administration at the University of Kansas.Michael Musheno is Professor of Justice and Policy Studies at Lycoming College and Professor Emeritus of Justice Studies, Arizona State University.<br>

  Abstract: A western police officer asserts that both rules and her “own value system” are in play in deciding what to do. A western vocational rehabilitation counselor also acknowledges rules, referencing a “cookbook method” of decision making, but points to “what people need” as central to doing her job. A midwestern middle school teacher reveals a clash of values with policy and administration. The administration makes decisions on what is best for the student body, or what the teacher calls “the building.” In contrast, he “deals with faces”—the faces of kids and parents—and makes his decisions on a “kid-by-kid<br>

  Abstract: The purpose of our research is simple, even elemental: to collect and examine street-level workers’ everyday work stories to uncover their judgments as they see them. This simple goal belies the challenge of the interpretive task because these stories are often ambiguous and multilayered: they reference both rules and morality to defend decisions, reveal internalized as well as interactive conflicts, and document shifting positions over time. These stories are not philosophical discourses on law or fairness. They are pragmatic expressions about acts and identities and assertions of dominant yet jumbled societal views of good and bad behavior and worthy and<br>

  Abstract: Street-level decision making is complexly moral and contingent rather than narrowly rule bound and fixed. A fundamental dilemma—perhaps the defining characteristic—of street-level work is that the needs of individual citizen-clients exist in tension with the demands and limits of rules. This does not mean that rules do not permeate all aspects of street-level work (they do) or that most street-level actions are not consistent with law and policy (they are). The most common situation may be that the rules effectively fit the complexity of workers’ judgments about citizen-clients. When the rules and standard procedures fit the situation, street-level<br>

  Author(s) Walker Stephen G.<br>
  Abstract: A main axis of intellectual tension in the area of foreign policy analysis over the past forty years is the issue of the importance of “beliefs”¹ in the explanation and prediction of foreign policy decisions and outcomes. The seminal decision-making approach to foreign policy articulated by Snyder, Bruck, and Sapin at midcentury was partly in reaction to a skewed emphasis by the realist tradition on external circumstances (e. g., the balance of power) and the omission of beliefs in explaining foreign policy decisions.² Snyder and his colleagues argued that this strategy of explanation came at the expense of neglecting the<br>

  Abstract: Early on I was helped in my methodological decision making by the conventions of qualitative sociology. Some very general tools for working can be taken for granted. For example, the qualitative sociologist typically uses nonprobability sampling. If the researcher intends to conduct interviews, the interview format tends to be open-ended. The analysis usually emphasizes the perspectives of those whom one is studying, but also incorporates one’s own perspectives into analysis and documentation, the latter being the reflexive position described in chapter 3.<br>

It remains a commonplace not only within art history, but across the humanities in general, that traditional efforts to answer the age-old question “What is art?” are a waste of time at best and an ideological power play at worst. The problem is that a definitive theory of art amounts to a contradiction in terms.

  Abstract: Meeting Placestages an encounter between northern and southern understandings of meeting. In the northern tradition, which I broadly identify with the European and Anglo-American heritage of writing about society and its political organization, meeting is held to be an unqualified good. Freud talks about the goal of the human race in terms of an approach to unity, and a broad spectrum of writers have drawn on the evolution of Greek democracy around decision making in the agora to make a direct connection between the provision of public spaces where people can meet and the democratic enfranchisement of the public.<br>

It sets them against the backdrop of Italian architectural discourse on identity that surfaced during the Fascist period (1922–1943) and continued to weigh heavily on the decisions of architects and urban designers in postwar democratic Italy.

  Abstract: Because of changes in medical technology, the birth of a baby born with severe defects now signals a moment of decision.¹ It is a decision about medical treatment; it is also a decision about what meanings the family and society want to give to the life of the infant. It is a decision that cannot be answered by reference to rights—or without them. finally, it is a decision about patterns and qualities of relationships beyond that one family.² Babies who in earlier times would have died may now be rescued through surgery and other medical intervention, but the intervention<br>

  Abstract: Pondering the question of “style” in historiographical narration, Hannah Arendt notes: “The question of 
                  style is bound up with the problem of understanding which has plagued the historical sciences almost from their beginnings.”¹ What is the “style” of Arendt’s monumental Origins of Totalitarianism, the text we are primarily concerned with here? And how does its efficacy relate to the problem of understanding totalitarianism? In her response to political philosopher Eric Voegelin, one of the first reviewers of Origins, Arendt elaborates on her decision to, as it were, allocate more historiographical legitimacy to the valences of metaphorical thinking than to statistical<br>

  Book Title: Condemned to Repeat?-The Paradox of Humanitarian Action<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Terry Fiona<br>
  Abstract: Humanitarian groups have failed, Fiona Terry believes, to face up to the core paradox of their activity: humanitarian action aims to alleviate suffering, but by inadvertently sustaining conflict it potentially prolongs suffering. In
         Condemned to Repeat?, Terry examines the side-effects of intervention by aid organizations and points out the need to acknowledge the political consequences of the choice to give aid. The author makes the controversial claim that aid agencies act as though the initial decision to supply aid satisfies any need for ethical discussion and are often blind to the moral quandaries of aid. Terry focuses on four historically relevant cases: Rwandan camps in Zaire, Afghan camps in Pakistan, Salvadoran and Nicaraguan camps in Honduras, and Cambodian camps in Thailand.<br>

  Abstract: In considering the ancient art of rhetoric’s passion for classification, Roland Barthes observes, “
                  tell me how you classify and I’ll tell you who you are.” This gnomic promise suggests that we can discover a certain truth of identity in the taxonomic decisions made by different rhetorical cultures. Barthes clarifies this declaration by writing that “the taxonomic option implies an ideological one: there is always a stake in where things are placed,” and he later calls taxonomic variation the “place of place.”¹ I have been arguing that the “place” of vernacular rhetoric must be understood as England, and Barthes’ reflections on<br>

  Late Medieval Representations of Storytelling and Story-Performance from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt169wfdd">Cultural Performances in Medieval France</a><br>
  Author(s) Loysen Kathleen A.<br>
  Abstract: The decision to re-enact on the page a scene of oral storytelling is extraordinarily prevalent in late-medieval French literature, as it will continue to be throughout the sixteenth century. Texts such as the anonymous
                     Cent nouvelles nouvelles(1462) and the anonymousÉvangiles des quenouilles(ca. 1470–80)¹ experiment with the staging of oral storytelling in a range of ways, using embedded narratives, the structural device of the frame, and the depiction of storytelling circles. Scenes of oral storytelling are fertile ground for inquiry regarding late medieval practices of story transmission, especially the dynamic relation between performance and audience reception.²<br>

An all-white grand jury had indicted him, and this all-white petit jury convicted Hale, an “illiterate, destitute” nineteen-year-old, of the murder of a forty-year-old white man, W. R. Toon.

  Abstract: In Leipzig Nietzsche had become friends with Heinrich Romundt (1845– 1919), another classical philologist who joined the Philological Society, or Philologischer Verein, co-founded by Nietzsche. But both Nietzsche and Franz Overbeck, the theologian, were amazed by Romundt’s decision in February 1875 to convert to Roman Catholicism and become a priest. Writing to Erwin Rohde on 28 February 1875, Nietzsche described Romundt as “a domestic problem, a house ghost” (ein Hausleiden, ein Hausgespenst), and expressed his indignation at Romundt’s decision in a way that might surprise us: “Our good, pure, Protestant air!

Journal Title: Ethics<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: et.2001.112.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 2001<br>
Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: Instructive as his book is, Popkin could also have explored in greater depth yet the relationship between historical scholarship and expressions of the self. By focusing on autobiographies alone, he misses an opportunity to examine how such texts and scholarly publications related to (and possibly affected) one another, most notably in their divergent or convergent patterns of self‐representation. The boundary between autobiographical and scholarly writings may be more porous than Popkin intimates. Paul Hollander’s recent study of academic acknowledgments arrives, for instance, at conclusions that mirror Popkin’s regarding self‐representation and professional norms (“Acknowledgments: An Academic Ritual,”
   Academic Questions15, no. 1 [2001–2]: 63–76). Likewise, one could question why Popkin limited himself to the discursive analysis of published sources and “the motives that historian‐autobiographers acknowledge in their texts” (78). Autobiographies are also social practices that call for systematic research outside the text, in archival and published sources (and, perhaps, interviews as well). But Popkin is too good a historian not to know this. His book is by and about historians; it is dedicated to historians, but it is not only for historians. Its chief objective may well be to show how much the historian’s autobiography has contributed “to the literature of personal life writing” (8). In this respect as in many others,History, Historians, and Autobiographyis a success.<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau. For reading the current essay, my particular thanks to Catherine Desbarats, Eric Jabbari, James Ron, and Michael Wasser, as well as to Tim Rowse, Desley Deacon, Ann Curthoys, and John Docker for helpful suggestions. I am of course solely responsible for the content. The research for this essay was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. 1 Jean Comaroff and John L.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 437 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne political, economic, and cultural colonialism-fields the authors argue are in any case impossible to disaggregate.9 The programmatic claims that lend Of Revelation and Revolution its force also, however, cause some interesting tensions in the book. The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M. Larson, "'Capacities and Modes of Thinking': Intellectual Engagements and Subaltern Hegemony in the Early History of Malagasy Christianity," AHR 102 (October 1997): 969-1002; Richard Elphick and Rodney Davenport, eds., Christianity in South Africa: A Political, Social, and Cultural History (Berkeley, Calif., 1997); and many other works discussed in David Chidester, Judy Tobler, and Darrel Wratten, Christianity in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography (Westport, Conn., 1997). The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86.

This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject.

There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm).

The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 448 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh a series of rather peripheral white missionaries. Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843. The LMS Directors overturned the dismissal and censured Philip. 37 An interesting point of contrast is provided by Janet Hodgson, "A Battle for Sacred Power: Christian Beginnings among the Xhosa," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree. The lines 38 Terence Ranger, "The Local and the Global in Southern African Religious History," in Hefner, Conversion to Christianity, 65-98. 39 Karel Schoeman, A Thorn Bush That Grows in the Path: The Missionary Career of Ann Hamilton, 1815-1823 (Cape Town, 1995); LMS-SA, 8/3/B: Robert Moffat to LMS, Lattakoo, July 12, 1821.

In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410.

Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work. Taylor is of course a Christian Hegelian, whose view of the emergence of the modern self is certainly influenced by Hegelian dialectics, in however inexplicit a fashion.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Abstract: These criticisms and oversights notwithstanding, there are many redeeming aspects to the book. Insofar as hermeneutics and exegesis are essential for any understanding of religious texts and traditions, Thistleton's work is a good way to be introduced to a complex history, the thorny debates, and the diverse approaches that have come to constitute its history and development. And the copious references that are made throughout and at the end of each chapter will enable readers to probe more deeply into a thinker, subject, or historical period of interest to them.<br>

Author(s): Bowman Sharon<br>
Abstract: In sum, this is one of the most important books on selves or the practical side of personhood in the last decade. It is also well written; the particular arguments are virtually always clear, and it is not too hard to keep track of their role within in the larger argument of the book. Some portions rise to an almost literary style and provide a rich survey of key ideas in twentieth-century French philosophy, while others engage quite originally with scholarship in moral psychology and theories of self-knowledge that will be more familiar to analytic readers. This work also complements the more detailed ethical theory on Larmore’s other books. Despite its relative inattention to volitional aspects of practical identity, and some questionable moves in the critique of authenticity, then, this work is still highly recommended.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Author(s): Rauschenbusch Walter<br>
Abstract: Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis, viewed by many as the masterpiece of the social gospel movement, has been confined to the dusty shelves of the library. Can we catch no glimpse of what astounded its massive reading public, no glimmer of Rauschenbusch's own sense of the work as a "dangerous book" written in fear and trembling? This article suggests that a generic analysis of Christianity and the Social Crisis might lead to surprising disclosures. Any generic analysis involves the discussion of a group of texts. Consequently this study proceeds via a comparison of the structure of Christianity and the Social Crisis with those of other works of a similar type which were produced between 1890 and 1915. The genre is isolated by utilizing the techniques of Tzvetan Todorov. Certain negative traits are specified which separate the genre from its neighbors. The positive leitmotif of a dual crisis-a crisis affecting society as a whole and the ramifications of that crisis within the Christian churches-is specified as the decisive trait of the genre. To deal with this leitmotif a specific structure was generated by the works under consideration. They provided-to pirate the words of Clifford Geertz in his landmark essay on modern ideologies-"maps of problematic reality" and "matrices for the creation of collective conscience." In designing their maps of problematic reality our authors worked along two separate but related vectors. The first of these vectors was constituted by a historical analysis of the origins of the present crisis, while the second consisted of a systemic analysis of the present social order. Each of these elements of the genre is examined in turn. The mapping of problematic reality by means of a historical and a structural analysis was geared towards provoking as well as defining the crisis. Crisis, once defined, demanded decision. Nevertheless the "permanent basis for action" which Rauschenbusch and others sought could not be grounded upon ideological conviction alone. It required both concrete guidelines for praxis and the creation of an institutional matrix to mobilize the moral forces of the society, to form public opinion. These works then as ideological matrices for the creation of collective conscience were also designed to precipitate the transformation of the Church into an agent of human emancipation. The art of the genre was also an act. But in an age noted for "writing-as-action" the exemplars of the genre laid a complexly interwoven, carefully stressed foundation for Christian involvement in social change. Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis appears at the end of this analysis as the unsurpassed formulation of this distinctive genre.<br>

Abstract: This paper concerns the problem of how to give historical explanations of scientist's decisions to prefer one theory over another. It is argued that such explanations ought to contain only statements about the beliefs and preferences of the agents involved, and, in particular, ought not to include evaluative premises about the theories themselves. It is argued that Lakatos's attempt to build into such historical explanations premises of an evaluative kind is deficient. The arguments of Laudan to the effect that such explanations depend crucially upon evaluative assumptions about the rationality or irrationality of decisions are examined. It is argued that they do not establish the need for such assumptions. Similar criticisms are then shown to be applicable to a version of the 'hermeneutical' model of explanation for human actions.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, I explore the meaning of bodily integrity in disfiguring breast cancer. Bodily integrity is a normative principle precisely because it does not simply refer to actual physical or functional intactness. It rather indicates what should be regarded and respected as inviolable in vulnerable and damageable bodies. I will argue that this normative inviolability or wholeness can be based upon a person's embodied experience of wholeness. This phenomenological stance differs from the liberal view that identifies respect for integrity with respect for autonomy (resulting in an invalidation of bodily integrity's proper normative meaning), as well as from the view that bodily integrity is based upon ideologies of wholeness (which runs the risk of being disadvantageous to women). I propose that bodily integrity involves a process of identification between the experience of one's body as "Leib" and the experience of one's body as "Körper." If identification fails or is not possible, one's integrity is threatened. This idea of bodily integrity can support breast cancer patients and survivors in making decisions about possible corrective interventions. To implement this idea in oncology care, empirical-phenomenological research needs to establish how breast cancer patients express their embodied self-experiences.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in confusing motives with causes; irrationalism, which advocates a "liberté d'indifférence", basing itself on the same premise as rationalism, and confusing motives with causes, is wrong in seeing the negation of the very existence of motives as the one way of saving human freedom. Both views disregard the fact that human action is impossible and cannot be understood without motives and that this, in turn, does not mean a determination of man in a mechanical way, for motives are not a part of nature but rather an organic element in a specific human situation—voluntary action. Human freedom is the freedom peculiar to a finite being immersed in time. Both those who stress passivity and receptivity and those who stress the dynamic creating ability of the self are wrong; both those who thought that freedom is possible only on the basis of clear and distinct motives and that action is nothing but the end of deliberation (St. Thomas) and those who thought that freedom is possible only by an irrational emergence of the vital ego (Bergson) or by negating the existence of any previous determination of the self (Sartre) are mistaken. A true human decision is composed of two elements; given motives and values on the one hand, and non-intellectualist spontaneous choice on the other. Duality is peculiar to human action. This is made more explicit in dealing with the more fundamental involuntary elements; character, sub-consciousness and life. Man acts freely from a finite and determined point of view; he acts in a clear and transparent way on the basis of confused and amorphous data; he lives his freedom when thrown into life. Necessity is inherent in man; it is one of his modes of being. There is no "inner freedom" on the one hand and "objective" causal necessity on the other. This conception of human action as both activity and passivity is reminiscent of Merleau-Ponty's statement in his "Philosophie du perception": "Le monde est déjá constitué, mais aussi jamais complètement constitué.... Il n'y a donc jamais déterminisme et jamais choix absolu, jamais je ne suis chose et jamais conscience nue". There is no dilemna between determinism and irrationalism, just as there is none between extended substance and thinking substance; there is dialogue.<br>

Abstract: This article concerns itself with establishing and defining the concept of prophetic politics as a narrative-based political leadership. It focuses on the use of religious, mythical and otherwise culturally dominating narratives which are often taken for granted or as 'common sense.' By a skilful politician, these stories can be given new forms and used as tools of leadership. This article explores the differences between traditional prophesies in the religious context and political prophesies and shows how with the use of prophetic narratives the politician is able to keep politics from stagnation since every moment and every decision can be endowed with special importance in actualizing the vision that remains the fascinating but elusive goal of politics - whatever it is narrated to be. This might re-invigorate the citizens to participate more in politics. The focus of the article is on American politics since the American civil religion and the narrative tradition of the jeremiad provide ample tools for political prophets, but the concept is not restricted solely to America. I argue that well told narratives have great influence on how people think and that can be manipulated politically. This type of leadership opens new vistas for political candidates, but it also opens new vistas for researchers to use in their study of politics.<br>

Abstract: In order to manage our daily lives, we make many decisions based on empirical evidence derived from instrumental action. At the other extreme, we are often attracted by a so-called postmodern solution that invites us to make arbitrary choices. In the education system, the pressing dilemma should not be a choice between standards of competence or unthinking relativism, but how to take action towards intercultural tolerance. Establishing a small teacher training course for a group of British Muslims has shown that communicative action informed by understanding can be disabled by the instrumentality of positivist frameworks, such as those used by government inspectors. In philosophy, Ricoeur offers a provisional dialectic of hope that can be used to show why neither positivist methods, rational analytic philosophy, postmodernity nor any one belief system for interpreting the world should be allowed to exert hegemonic control. The ethicopractical philosophy of Ricoeur also offers a reconstructive view of reality that helps us to rehabilitate belief in human nature and encourages us to seek solutions to conflicts of interpretation in understanding others. It is applied, in this instance, to project work with Muslim women in the UK, in which an ontology of action shows the power of working collaboratively towards an understanding of oneself as another.<br>

Abstract: In his famous paper, What Is It Like To Be A Bat?, Thomas Nagel argues against a reductive physicalist account of consciousness by highlighting what he calls "the subjective character of experience". In this paper I will argue that Nagel's insight is important for understanding the value placed on patient autonomy in medical ethics. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience brings with it the necessity for an epistemological humility with respect to the lives of others and what can be said to be "right" for them. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience lies at the heart of empathy and our capacity to make decisions that genuinely reflect respect for the patient's autonomy. Through the example of a case involving extreme medical intervention, I identify some impediments to the proper recognition of autonomy. These kind of cases highlight the significance of affective responses with respect to the subjective character of experience, and, by extension, to our capacity to imagine and act in accordance with another's perspective. I argue that affective responses are appropriate and needed considerations in the case where one must attempt to assume another's perspective in order to respect autonomy. I conclude that understanding that experience has an irreducibly subjective character is essential to respecting patient autonomy.<br>

Abstract: Much archaeological scholarship on consumption has approached its subject matter as the means to an end—e.g., as a way of studying socioeconomic status—rather than as a proper object of study in its own right. The "consumer choice" school, and, more recently, advocates of consumer behavior studies, have supported approaches that emphasize quantitative methods, at the same time downplaying the "qualitative" or symbolic aspects of consumption. A considerable body of literature on the symbolic aspects of consumption exists both in historical archaeology and other fields. The intention of this essay is to draw together this recent literature on consumption and combine it into a single approach that emphasizes shopping as the meaningful action at the very heart of consumption. With the emphasis on agency, this approach presents shopping as that crucial moment of transformation where identity, intention, and symbol combine in the decision to purchase, to own, an object.<br>

Abstract: Este trabajo está dedicado a todos los que, como Maximilian M. Kolbe (1894-1941), son capaces e dar su vida por otros, sin pedir nada a cambio, sin furia y sin rencor, tan sólo porque su idea de Dios omprende a la humanidad. Kolbe murió en un «búnker de inanición» del campo de exterminio de uschwitz. Entregó voluntariamente su vida a cambio de la de otro prisionero que era padre de familia. l suplicio del hambre (inanición absoluta) duró catorce días, en los que fallecieron seis condenados; uego, una inyección letal liquidó a los tres moribundos restantes, que «tardaban» demasiado. Así acabó olbe. La pena se dictó como castigo colectivo por la fuga de otro preso del bloque

Abstract: The past decade has brought advanced information technologies, which include electronic messaging systems, executive information systems, collaborative systems, group decision support systems, and other technologies that use sophisticated information management to enable multiparty participation in organization activities. Developers and users of these systems hold high hopes for their potential to change organizations for the better, but actual changes often do not occur, or occur inconsistently. We propose adaptive structuration theory (AST) as a viable approach for studying the role of advanced information technologies in organization change. AST examines the change process from two vantage points: (1) the types of structures that are provided by advanced technologies, and (2) the structures that actually emerge in human action as people interact with these technologies. To illustrate the principles of AST, we consider the small group meeting and the use of a group decision support system (GDSS). A GDSS is an interesting technology for study because it can be structured in a myriad of ways, and social interaction unfolds as the GDSS is used. Both the structure of the technology and the emergent structure of social action can be studied. We begin by positioning AST among competing theoretical perspectives of technology and change. Next, we describe the theoretical roots and scope of the theory as it is applied to GDSS use and state the essential assumptions, concepts, and propositions of AST. We outline an analytic strategy for applying AST principles and provide an illustration of how our analytic approach can shed light on the impacts of advanced technologies on organizations. A major strength of AST is that it expounds the nature of social structures within advanced information technologies and the key interaction processes that figure in their use. By capturing these processes and tracing their impacts, we can reveal the complexity of technology-organization relationships. We can attain a better understanding of how to implement technologies, and we may also be able to develop improved designs or educational programs that promote productive adaptations.<br>

Abstract: This essay explores the drama of selfhood and the attendant problem of ethics in Brian Friel's Faith Healer. Drawing from the tenets of Freudian psychoanalysis, I scrutinize the protagonist's narrative identity through fissures created by the discrepancy between his story and the other two characters' versions. These crevices register the protagonist's post-traumatic affects for an uncanny home, which, intertwined with his equally uncanny talent to become the place of trauma, compels him to return time and again instead of acknowledging its loss. Symptomatically, in his fixation on an uncanny home in order to disavow its loss, the protagonist sutures his privation, to such an extent that he not only bars memory exchange with other characters, but appropriates them into a master narrative. Given the fact that the three characters' stories are addressed to invisible auditors who converge with the play's actual audience, the healer's final act of authority is limited as long as it is subject to the audience's interpretation of his memory narrative. In its appeal to the audience's decision on ethical justice for the healer's narrative imagination among multiple proposals, this play is an exercise of poetical ethics of memory.<br>

Abstract: Traditional discourses upon literature have been predicated upon the ability to refer to a text that others may consult (Landow, 1994, p. 33). Texts that involve elements of feedback and nontrivial decision-making on the part of the reader (Aarseth, 1997, p. 1) therefore present a challenge to readers and critics alike. Since a persuasive case has been made against a critical method that sets out to "identify the task of interpretation as a task of territorial exploration and territorial mastery" (Aarseth, p. 87), this paper proposes the use of readers in an empirically based approach to hypertext fiction. Meta-interpretation, a method that combines individual responses to a text, reading logs, screen recordings and limited qualitative/quantitative analysis, and critical interpretation is outlined. By analysing readers' responses it is possible to suggest both the ways that textual elements may have influenced or determined readers' choices and the ways that readers' choices "configure" the text. The method thus addresses Espen Aarseth's concerns and illuminates interesting features of interactive processes in fictional environments. The paper is divided into two parts: the first part sketches out meta-interpretation through consideration of the main problems confronting the literary critic; the second part describes reading research aimed at generating data for the literary critic.<br>

Abstract: The combined works of John Dewey and Jerome Bruner provide a framework spanning a century of educational thought which can inform curriculum decisions concerning students' educational development, especially for middle school students whose waning of motivation toward school has been well documented by researchers and has long concerned parents and teachers. This framework, combined with recent contributions of motivation and interest researchers, can create broad understandings of how to collaboratively construct effective educational contexts. As early as 1913, Dewey specifically looked at the pivotal role of students' genuine interests in Interest and Effort in Education. Our current research focus on how students' interest can inform curricular contexts marks the recent shift showing an increased use of interest in education research since 1990. In this article, we discuss our study of a team-taught double classroom of sixth grade students whose interests were determined through a series of brainstorming sessions, and individual and focus group interviews. Students' interests fell into six categories centering around subject areas such as Drama, Science, and Animal Studies. Learning contexts were constructed around four of these subject areas. Students participated in their first or second choice of subject area group. We found significantly higher scores on measures of Affect and Activation if students participated in their first choice group. We found intra-group unities of preferred and dispreferred ways of learning which distinguished each group from the class as a whole. Finally, our findings indicated that students reliably described their genuine interests over time. Students' interests were found to be effective tools for informing curriculum decisions in the creation of sixth grade learning contexts.<br>

Abstract: Although anthropologists have discredited use of the liberal and secular concept of "agency" for explaining Muslim women's behavior, their evidence comes from women who still appear rather agentive to Western readers, hence, muting the necessity and consequences of discovering and applying the women's own ethical and religious terms in their analysis. In Guinea's rural Fouta Djallon, women are not prone to mobilize and make self-interested decisions with immediately observable outcomes. Therefore, understanding them on their own terms requires greater attention to their religious frameworks, namely, to their use of visions of creation and afterlife to define themselves and strategize for redemption.<br>

Abstract: Making sense of new information technology (IT) and the many buzzwords associated with it is by no means an easy task for executives. Yet doing so is crucial to making good innovation decisions. This paper examines how information systems (IS) executives respond to what has been termed organizing visions for IT, grand ideas for applying IT, the presence of which is typically announced by much "buzz" and hyperbole. Developed and promulgated in the wider interorganizational community, organizing visions play a central role in driving the innovation adoption and diffusion process. Familiar and recent examples include electronic commerce, data warehousing, and enterprise systems. A key aspect of an organizing vision is that it has a career. That is, even as it helps shape how IS managers think about the future of application and practice in their field, the organizing vision undertakes its own struggle to achieve ascendancy in the community. The present research explores this struggle, specifically probing how IS executives respond to visions that are in different career stages. Employing field interviews and a survey, the study identifies four dimensions of executive response focusing on a vision's interpretability, plausibility, importance, and discontinuity. Taking a comparative approach, the study offers several grounded conjectures con-cerning the career dynamics of organizing visions. For the IS executive, the findings help point the way to a more proactive, systematic, and critical stance toward innovations that can place the executive in a better position to make informed adoption decisions.<br>

Abstract: À partir d'une définition de l'éducation comme « relation dissymétrique, nécessaire et provisoire, visant à l'émergence d'un sujet », la pédagogie est proposée comme effort pour penser cette activité dans des situations données. Refusant une posture philosophique qui décrète l'existence du sujet pour le faire advenir, comme une attitude inspirée des sciences humaines qui abolit le sujet en réduisant ses actes à la résultante des forces qui s'exercent sur lui, la pédagogie peut se définir comme « anticipation contextualisée ». Dans cette perspective, elle requiert un discours qui exprime la singularité des sujets en situation et la mette en perspective d'universalité. Le récit peut avoir cette fonction et « faire théorie » sans, pour autant, s'abstraire des situations particulières qu'il décrit. La pédagogie comme « récits d'éducation » a alors pour fonction de favoriser la prise de décision éducative. Education being defined as "a dissymetric, necessary and temporary relation focusing on the emergence of a subject", pedagogy is considered as an endeavour to think this activity in given situations. If we refuse a philosophical position which decides the existence of a subject to make it turn into a reality - as an attitude inspired by human sciences which reduces the subject's acts to the resultant of forces exerced on him - pedagogy may be defined as a "contextualized anticipation". In this perspective, we must display the uniqueness of subjects in a specific situation and set it in a universal perspective. Narratives may have this function without neglecting the specificity of situations. Pedagogy as "narratives on education" is able to facilitate educational decision making.<br>

Abstract: O artigo procura discutir a contribuição da perspectiva antropológica para a análise de conflitos, contrastando a ênfase da Antropologia na pesquisa empírica com a orientação predominantemente doutrinária que caracteriza o Direito. Dialogando com textos de repercussão significativa na Antropologia do Direito, o artigo realça a importância da dimensão simbólica dos direitos, caracterizada como aspecto central do universo empírico investigado, e sem a qual demandas por direitos, acordos e decisões judiciais não podem ser adequadamente compreendidos. The article makes a brief assessment of the contribution of Anthropology's perspective to the analysis of conflicts, contrasting Anthropology's emphasis in empirical research with the doctrinarian approach that predominates in Law. Drawing on significant texts in the Anthropology of Law, the article highlights the symbolic dimension of rights, characterized as a core aspect of empirical data, and without which demands for rights, judicial agreements and decisions cannot be adequately understood.<br>

Abstract: A community, in the same way as an individual, can follow as a normal way of behaviour — or as a wanted criteria for behaviour — for all future circumstances to decide discretionally, «case by case», or to define in a moment in time the rule (or a set of rules) that must be valid for the future. To define rules in a community has been indicated by some authors (Geoffrey Brennan and James M. Buchanan particularly) as a way to exit from a situation of a war of every man against every other man, as in the Hobbesian jungle, on one side, and from a situation dominated by a Leviathan on the other. This in a perspective where rules of a common living have been set through a social contract. The rules established through this contract would also form the criteria for a just conduct, in the end therefore for criteria of justice. The essay analyzes the situations and the conditions in which constraining oneself can be rational, even as it is not definible that in all circumstances constraining is more rational than not constraining oneself, that it is more desirable to have rules rather than discretionary decisions, the definition of ways of behaviour rather than the pre-definition of outcomes. As for what concerns the problem of justice, it is indicated how through a contractarian and constitutional procedure rules can be put by unanimous consent, but the problem of the foundation of the same rules remains unresolved. Rules do not seek truth, but only express values accepted by the counterparts in a certain moment in time, and have individuals as sources of these values.<br>

Abstract: Archaeology assumes itself as a discipline through a practice of boundary-making that merges the past with the present. It is, in this practice, increasingly critiqued for being ethnocentric and separating power from the communities it claims to represent. In response, archaeology is experiencing a turn toward "community". Examining two community archaeology case studies, we assess whether archaeology can be transformed into a discipline that productively participates in the liveliness and messy connectedness of objects, peoples, histories and cultures— in contrast to a conventionally detached practice of objectifying other peoples' lifeways. In both cases, archaeological and descent communities play direct and central decision-making roles in this traditionally "distanced" discipline. They demonstrate means of re-figuring archaeology as a participatory practice. Community-founded archaeology is thus shown to transform methods commonly supporting institutional reproduction into a radically indigenous, emically structured, set of knowledge practices and outcomes. Archeologie suppose elle-même comme une discipline à travers une pratique de fabrication limite qui fusionne le passé au présent. Il est, dans cette pratique, plus en plus critiqué pour avoir été puissance ethnocentrique et séparation des communautés qu'elle prétend représenter. En réponse, archéologie connaît un tournant vers une « communauté ». Examen de deux études de cas communautaires archéologie, nous déterminer si archéologie peut se transformer en une discipline qui productivement participe à la vivacité et la connectivité désordre des objets, des peuples, des histoires et des cultures—contrairement à une pratique conventionnelle détachée d'objectiver les modes de vie des autres peuples. En cas, archéologiques et descente communautés jouent des rôles décisionnels directes et centrales dans ce traditionnellement « distanciés » discipline. Ils montrer les moyens de retrouver l'archéologie comme une pratique participative. Archéologie communauté fondée est ainsi montré à transformer les méthodes communément soutien institutionnelle reproduction en un jeu radicalement indigène, emically structuré, de connaissances pratiques et les résultats.<br>

Abstract: This essay explores a phenomenon familiar to archivists: the seamless moment of time and space within the remembering process when communities become aware of and must confront the fragility of public memory and make decisions about the management and preservation of their information resources. This decision point has recently been called the documentary moment. The authors' exploration of this concept focuses on the theories, strategies, methodologies, and processes formerly employed and now emerging at Library and Archives Canada (LAC) to facilitate the disposition of government's information resources. They also examine the challenges presented by the digital age on the documentary moment and whether corresponding philosophical or methodological changes to current institutional strategies, including macro-appraisal, are required.<br>

Abstract: If human beings were empirically shown to be irrational, would this finding destroy the foundations of economic science? We think not because we doubt that this postulate is needed as a foundation of economic science. We examine the laboratory experiments conducted by behavioral economists and experimental psychologists on human judgment and decision-making, using Bayes' Theorem and the Expected Value model We examine a number of issues: Can we base ourselves on experimenters' full rationality for doubting of human rationality? Are rational models anything else than handy tools? Do humans' minds function like rational tools or with rational tools? How an "irrational" human being could create anything "rational"? Should rationality be subordinated to reason? Nature being neither rational nor irrational, is there any point in applying the concept of rationality to one its constituents? If human beings were rational forms of life, would this specie have survived?<br>

Abstract: Résumé. L'un des principaux problèmes dans la controverse entourant le recensement détaillé concernait la relation entre la science et la politique. En analysant les arguments et les hypothèses sous-jacentes de quatre interventions influentes et exemplaires faites au nom de la science, cet article rend un constat normatif de cette relation. Il nuance les idéaux protecteurs de la science que les critiques ont invoqués et avance que de telles ressources conceptuelles sont nécessaires pour protéger la science d'un empiètement politique indu. Cependant, dans leur zèle à défendre les droits de la science, les critiques en ont réclamé plus que nécessaire, ce qui a occulté la dimension de la valeur des décisions politiques et n'a pas respecté le rôle de la politique en tant que point légitime de prise de décision sur les questions de valeur. Un constat normatif adéquat de la relation entre la science et la politique dans la politique gouvernementale doit non seulement protéger la science contre la politique, mais aussi la politique contre la science.<br>

Abstract: This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of the “(as yet) untold story” to consider the relationship between James Joyce's 1904 short story “Eveline” (in
         Dubliners) and Colm Tóibín's award-winning 2009 novel,Brooklyn. Although Tóibín has denied the influence of Joyce in general, there are many similarities in the storyworlds of the two protagonists, Eveline Hill and Eilis Lacey: Eveline wishes to leave her father's home in Dublin but stays, whilst Eilis would prefer to remain at home but is forced to emigrate. Both act according to their perception of their mother's wishes and the rightness of their decisions has preoccupied readers. Through close analysis of thought and speech presentation, this essay shows that interpretive responses to the actions of Eveline and Eilis are inextricably linked to the formal qualities of each text.<br>

Abstract: R. Naḥman of Bratslav's magnum opus,
         Liqutey Moharan, expresses contradictory attitudes toward the value and ontological primacy of books as opposed to living speech. When his discourses are sorted by the date delivered, one can see a specific shift in attitude. R. Naḥman's emphasis on oral expression, in discourses leading up to 1804, is characteristic of Hasidism's shift from the literary approach of Kabbalah toward an orally driven mass movement. Rebbe Naḥman's later emphasis on printed books can be understood in light of his decision in 1804 to embrace the printed book as a mechanism for spreading his ideas, a decision that may have stemmed from his messianic aspirations. Ontologies of orality and literacy are thus exposed as shifting ideological responses to biographical and historical circumstances.<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>

Abstract: Medical humanities and ethics are getting more and more important in Europe as essential disciplines of the core curriculum for health-care professionals. The idea of the physician as a technician shows itself to be unbearable because of the global historical changes we daily face in caring settings. We deal with chronic diseases, which require a sensitive physician/patient covenant and a good performance in communication skills1 because a whole life-style transformation is often necessary. Moreover, citizens are more informed about both the technological progress and their civil rights, so that a shared decision has to be prepared and implemented by exploring the emotional reactions to illness, by explaining the effects of different ways of treatment, and by revealing in advance the choices that could be taken.<br>
