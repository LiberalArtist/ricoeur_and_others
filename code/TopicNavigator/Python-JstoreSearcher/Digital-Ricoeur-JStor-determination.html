  Abstract: In the “Epistemo-Critical Prologue” to
                  The Origin of the German Tragic Drama, Benjamin establishes allegory in a realm out of the reach of aesthetics and idealism. Allegory is characterized by violence and is not at all beautiful, admittedly lacking “all ‘symbolic’ freedom of expression, all classical proportion, all humanity” (166;Der Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels145). Any time allegory is subjected to the critical palate of philosophical taste, it will seem a bitter alternative to beauty. However, by discrediting the presumed authority of aesthetics (the beautiful) and idealism (the symbolic determination of the object as a reflection of the object<br>

  Abstract: Despite his explicit separation of the concepts of God and Being, Martin Heidegger, in his later philosophy, treats them with a certain structural similarity.¹ That is, both God and Being lie beyond the calculating attempts to possess and wield them by a technological society bent on mastery. At the same time, however, this very technological epoch is a determination of Being, or in the

  Abstract: Rk: The most characteristic feature of your work has been its determination to “deconstruct” the Western philosophy of presence. I think it would be helpful if you could situate your program of deconstruction in relation to the two major intellectual traditions of Westem European culture—the Hebraic and the Hellenic. You conclude your seminal essay on the Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Levinas with the following quotation from James Joyce’s

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x07vw">Committing the Future to Memory: History, Experience, Trauma</a><br>
  Abstract: To argue for a rigorous reading of the “end” of historical time in Hegel is, in some sense, the condition for thinking the experience of narrative time in a mode other than that of the simple linearity of continuous progression. In Chapter 3, we demonstrated how Hegel’s complex mode of narrating the pastness of “art in its highest determination” generates an understanding of past and future that goes beyond the notion of two distinct moments on a temporal continuum and conceives narrative temporality in terms of how an aspect of futurity is at work in it, not as a horizon<br>

  Book Title: Labors of Imagination: Aesthetics and Political Economy from Kant to Althusser-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mieszkowski Jan<br>
  Abstract: This book is a major new study of the doctrines of productivity and interest in Romanticism and classical political economy. The author argues that the widespread contemporary embrace of cultural historicism and the rejection of nineteenth-century conceptions of agency have hindered our study of aesthetics and politics. Focusing on the difficulty of coordinating paradigms of intellectual and material labor, Mieszkowski shows that the relationship between the imagination and practical reason is crucial to debates about language and ideology.From the Romantics to Poe and Kafka, writers who explore Kant's claim that poetry sets the imagination freediscover that the representational and performative powers of language cannot be explained as the products of a self-governing dynamic, whether formal or material. A discourse that neither reflects nor prescribes the values of its society, literature proves to be a uniquely autonomous praxis because it undermines our reliance on the concept of interest as the foundation of self-expression or self-determination. Far from compromising its political significance, this turns literature into the condition of possibility of freedom. For Smith, Bentham, and Marx, the limits of self-rule as a model of agency prompt a similar rethinking of the relationship between language and politics. Their conception of a linguistic labor that informs material praxis is incompatible with the liberal ideal of individualism. In the final analysis, their work invites us to think about social conflicts not as clashes between competing interests, but as a struggle to distinguish human from linguistic imperatives.<br>

  Abstract: The vision of the self that emerges from Kleist’s reading of Kantian ethics differs sharply from the figure of specular self-determination generally associated with Idealist thought. In forcing us to reconsider the assumption that language can be a medium of rational activity, Kleist seems to part company from those inheritors of Kant who accord ultimate primacy to the authority of reason. At the same time, one could argue that Kleist shares with both Kant and the Idealists a sense of the volatile power of literary language and a more general concern with the historical dimensions of artistic creation.

  Abstract: In our tracking of the metaphoric initiative, we have seen how processes of natural evolution unfold via a logic of replication, genetic causes and effects, governed by the principle of natural selection. We asked the following questions. Is this same unconscious process at work in culture? If it is, how are we to understand ourselves as free and self-determining? If it is not, that is, if the terms and conditions of evolutionary change have themselves changed in the cultural domain, what power of agency or self-determination, if any, do we gain?

  Abstract: In the previous chapters we have seen a constant attentiveness in Latin American thinkers toward thinking in light of their concrete situation. This situated thought finds a profound opening in Enrique Dussel’s insight concerning Latin American thought as arising out of a radical exteriority beyond the possible control, determination, and manipulation of Western European and North American thought and culture. We also saw that such experience is pre-rational, inasmuch as it ultimately refers us to a sensibility found at the heart of the disposition that differentiates us as human, namely the encounter of other humans in a proximity sustained by<br>

  Abstract: After our initial look at how certain aspects of Hegel’s account of desire might transform the concept of individuality, we turned to possible repercussions for his theories of juridical ordering and the state. Then, a third textual movement attempted an articulation of subjectivity, history and infinity, the foremost aim of which was to show that the Hegelian subject exceeds all egological reductions, analytics of finitude or anthropological limitations. That is to say, Hegel leaves us with a subject sufficiently inclusive to allow for both reflections on models of institutional association, as well as modes of determination or the process of<br>

It appears to have played an indispensable role in the elaboration of a fundamental facet of Benjamin’s thought: the double determination of human life as both creaturely (or natural) and supernatural, and thus of a concept of life derived from its relationship to these<br>

Human religious experience and discourse cannot escape social situational, determination and life connection, which refers to the socio-historical location of human experience and social discourse. Given this, religion is an eminently social and cultural thing, implementing its spiritual meaning connected with the depth of human spiritual life: the ultimate concern.

  Abstract: In French and several other languages, the notion of judgment designates both a “faculty” or “capacity” and an action that takes place within the sphere of public or private relations. It can have a general neutral signification (that of an evaluation about the adequacy of means to ends or to the quality of the ends themselves). But more often it designates, in dissymmetrical fashion, the determination of a deserved or undeserved sanction upon the action of a subject, especially when the action in question is a “crime” or a “delict.”<br>

  Abstract: At first glance, historians may not look like the best candidates for facilitating a resolution of the history problem. This is because historians have traditionally used the nation as a primary unit of analysis, helping to naturalize it as a primordial entity. They have also created professional associations and delimited their membership along national borders, consistent with the nationalist logic of self-determination; for example, when Japanese historians write about the history of Japan, they often talk among themselves without consulting with foreign historians who study Japan.

Roberto Benigni’s Oscar-winning film about a condemned man’s determination to shield his son from the worst life brings shows the creative force of the will triumphing over genocide. By adopting the right attitude, the film argues, we have the capacity to transform the gloomiest reality into something tolerable. Shortly after

Threats to the Constitution by Christian right-wingers working alongside members of the Government currently target the right to abortion and the right to same-sex marriage, and normative understandings of womanhood seem to be gaining ground in multiple ways (Schuhmann, 2009a).

  Abstract: The boom in transportation and communication technology initiated in the last century has drastically changed the social and spatial geography of most European cities. Much in line with the work of Saskia Sassen,¹ Manuel Castells describes the new “informational city” as the “urban expression of the whole matrix of determination of the Informational Society, as the Industrial City was the spatial expression of the Industrial Society”.² Cities can be seen as hubs in the global network of people, information and goods, and – depending on their centrality in networks of finance, labour, production and information – such a position in<br>

  Abstract: Action analysis in both sociology and economics faces a persistent tension. To understand how individuals differ in their behavior, we may need to define each individual’s characteristics, preferences, and resources at the onset of the course of action. This essentially leads to a long-term, propelling view of the causal determination of individual action. However, as action unfolds sequentially, within an environment of interactions, people learn from each other and about themselves in ways that cannot be fully anticipated. Can we, simultaneously, fully define the identities of social actors and the situations that bring those actors together? My view is that<br>

Like Cooper, he faced the complete loss of his dwindling audience as reward for his persistence.

Consider what has become a virtual axiom among scholars of nations and nationalism, namely that nationalists’ concern for self-determination invariably leads to a desire for sovereignty, for the complete control over a state. When applied to multinational federations, the axiom supports the assumption that the members of the minority nations will, at the very least, favour decentralization.

According to Anthony Giddens, distinguishing features of modernity include a basic trust in the transformative potential of human agency and social institutions as well as new perceptions of determination and ambiguity that leave little room for religious cosmologies (1994: 36).

This book thus introduces the concept of antiphilosophy, speaks of its constitution and pertinence with respect to psychoanalysis, and examines the consequences of such a determination through a sequence of case-studies. Although the concept has some highly abstract aspects and a somewhat forbidding intellectual history, it is deployed here, first, as a kind of corrosive of received ideas, and, second, as an affirmative means of characterising psychoanalysis that captures something essential, if often elided, about the peculiar status of the practice.<br>

Whereas the salons and sociability of Gertrude Stein, Muriel Draper and other modernists have been celebrated as the gathering of kindred spirits, the Black Arts Movement’s assessments of the Harlem Renaissance set it up as an interracial party or spectacle of assimilation, in which the self-determination of the Negro was constantly jeopardised.

With his “experiment in living,” Thoreau expressed in dramatic and conclusive form the abolitionists’ determination to separate their movement from the civil institutions of the political public sphere and from any positive representation of a people.

  Author(s): Adebanwi Wale<br>
  Abstract: Nation as Grand Narrative offers a methodical analysis of how relations of domination and subordination are conveyed through media narratives of nationhood. Using the typical postcolonial state of Nigeria as a template and engaging with disciplines ranging from media studies, political science, and social theory to historical sociology and hermeneutics, Wale Adebanwi examines how the nation as grand narrative provides a critical interpretive lens through which competition among ethnic, ethnoregional, and ethnoreligious groups can be analyzed. Adebanwi illustrates how meaning is connected to power through ideology in the struggles enacted on the pages of the print media over diverse issues including federalism, democracy and democratization, religion, majority-minority ethnic relations, space and territoriality, self-determination, and threat of secession. Nation as Grand Narrative will trigger further critical reflections on the articulation of relations of domination in the context of postcolonial grand narratives.

  Book Title: Love and Death in Goethe-`One and Double'<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Dye Ellis<br>
  Abstract: Goethe, in association with his younger Romantic compatriots the Schlegels, Novalis, Fichte, and Schelling, struggled with the subject-object dichotomy, and tried to bridge the gap between self and other, consciousness and nature. His theory and practice prefigured the Romantics' determination to display and interrogate the linguistic and cultural structures informing their own thinking and modes of representation--what Goethe calls one's "Vorstellungsart." His work exploits, subverts, and supplants inherited conventions and signs, demonstrating with virtuosic irony that literature is a system of texts, pre-texts, and pre-established but dynamic conceptual models. 'Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double"' explores Goethe's use, in a wide range of his poetry and prose, of the theme of 'Liebestod' (love and death) and related embodiments of the paradox of unity in duality. Ellis Dye also examines Goethe's use of other themes related to love and death--the 'femme fatale', the 'vagina dentata, Frau Welt', the Lorelei, venereal disease, the 'Lustmord' --and considers issues of selfhood and individuation as well as the possibility that the love-death theme contains an implicit gender bias toward the existential fact of personal separateness. Poems, plays, and novels are dealt with, nevertheless, as works of art, not only as illustrations of an idea or as points of intersection in a system of rhetorical conventions, and are examined for intellectual cohesiveness, elegance, and integrity of design as well as special meanings and effects. ' Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double" ' explores the meaning of the central theme of Romantic poetry in the works of the most important Romantic poet of all. Students of literary culture, both the lay reader and the Goethe specialist, will be enlightened by its approach and find pleasure and instruction in its revelations. Robert Ellis Dye is professor of German at Macalester College.<br>

When communist regimes in Eastern Europe came under violent threat in the 1950s—in east Germany in 1953 and Hungary in 1956—soviet troops intervened to subdue those challenges. A very different problem arose in 1968, when Czechoslovakia embarked on a dramatic, but entirely peaceful, attempt to change both the internal complexion of communism and many of the basic structures of Soviet–East European relations.

The thesis can be seen as comprising six components: 1) the creation of different institutional apparati that separate religion from politics, 2) the depoliticization and privatization of religion, 3) the decline in religious belief, 4) the development of cultural identity, 5) the rise of the state as governmental form, and 6) the production of capitalist markets.¹ Together these components describe the new phenomenon that constitutes modernity as different from religious and traditional cultures.

Abstract: Patten presents a detailed explication and defense of Hegel’s conception of freedom as rational self‐determination. On such a view, inherited from Kant, being free involves more than the absence of coercion or being able to do as one pleases. Freedom requires actors to self‐legislate their behavior such that the good reasons motivating them override their contingent desires and inclinations. Given standard objections to Kant’s idea of autonomy, and Hegel’s own statements of those objections, Patten carefully analyzes Hegel to demonstrate both that he does in fact hold a related view, and that his view does not fall prey to the same problems as Kant’s. Central to Patten’s interpretation of Hegel is the idea that free agents will be ones who act in ways harmonious with those features of modern life and the modern state that establish the conditions Hegel thinks are necessary for the realization and sustenance of individual freedom.<br>

Abstract: A frightening consequence thus imposes itself: to claim to define what a man is leads to or at least opens the possibility of leading to the elimination of that which does not correspond to this definition. Every political proscription, every racial extermination, every ethnic cleansing, every determination of that which does not merit life—all of these rest upon a claim to define (scientifically or ideologically) the humanity of man; without this claimed guarantee, no one could put such political programs into motion. Even the worst of modern tyrants needs reasons and concepts. Here we find a new
         experientia crucis: in order to kill a human being, it is necessary to have the permission to kill. But in order to have that, it is first necessary to be able to deny to such and such a human being (the well‐named “So and So”) his or her face and thus his or her humanity; and one gets there by defining and comprehending humanity through concepts, by fixing its limits and, in this way, discovering the one who cannot claim humanity, and thus can or ought to die. Here a metaphysical proposition in appearance perfectly neutral takes on the aspect of a silent threat: every determination is a negation, or more exactly (because in the event the issue is extension alone), “figura non aliud quam determinatio, et determinatio negatio est” (“figure is nothing but limitation, and limitation is negation”).23Determining amounts to denying (and not the inverse, for if determination is sufficient for denial, a negation does not always suffice to determine). Determining the humanity of man thus amounts to making an end of him.<br>

Abstract: It seems likely, as Yates notes (Yates, “Genres of Organizational Communication,” p. 314), that tab stops made indentation easier and therefore the typing of lists (and, later, bullets?). It should also be remembered that the spatial organization of the document provided the model for the Graphical User Interface (GUI) or computer desktop. It is not an accident that the commercial/bureaucratic scene and not, say, the laboratory, left this crucial imprint on computer design. This point should deter us from lapsing into technodeterminist styles of argument when we are dealing with a mutual interaction of social forms and technology. For an unapologetically technodeterminist argument on the relation between the typewriter and writing, see Friedrich Kittler,
               Gramophone, Film, Typewriter,trans. Geoffrey Winthrop‐Young and Michael Wutz (Stanford, Calif., 1999). Kittler is interested in Nietzsche’s use of the typewriter as a consequence of his failing vision and by extrapolation in the determination of the most rarified philosophical discourse by media. He is also interested in the emergence of a corps of women writers (typists), but uninterested in the kind of writing that was actually typed by women in large organizations.<br>

Abstract: The thesis that comparative theology presupposes the sublation of traditional apologetics entails two subclaims. The first of these is that the objective contrasts apologetics draws between faith communities give expression to an underlying religious attitude that is more basic. A desire to express communal loyalty takes the form of establishing the unique identity of that religious community. The determination of communal identity is in turn achieved through the formulation of contrasts between the respective teachings of the home community and its rivals. In other words, apologetics can be analyzed into two elements, namely, the objective representations of rival teachings, on the one hand, and what is expressed through these representations, namely, a concern with establishing communal identity, on the other. A corollary to this analysis is that apologetics is like myth in that a concealment of its underlying expressive intent belongs to its very nature such that it is fundamentally transformed when this expressive component is recognized as such. The second claim is that our current knowledge of the complexity and internal diversity of religious traditions has revealed the generalizations upon which interreligious contrasts are based to be conceptual constructs that reflect the interests of the individual or group making the comparisons. This knowledge thus makes it increasingly difficult for apologetics to conceal its underlying concern with establishing identity. Unable to execute its characteristic function of concealment, traditional apologetics gives way to comparative theology.<br>

Abstract: This is where theories of feminist agency typically run into trouble, and Meyers’s view, despite its grounding in experience, is no exception. She argues that “what is important for women’s self‐determination is that, whether they choose to become mothers or not, they find discursive means to symbolize their particular relations to motherhood and through these self‐figurations resist their homogenization in matrigynist ideology” (54). Women are to consider “what it would be like to inhabit a proposed figuration by constructing scenarios in which the figuration guides their conduct and by viscerally imagining themselves acting out those scenarios” (55). She makes similar claims about the other cultural images she explores, and she always insists that such “discursive innovation is not by itself enough” (55). The problem arises not over the apparent similarity between these acts of imagination and the gender performativity Meyers rejects but over what else is needed.<br>

Abstract: Opposition to this tradition comes from those philosophers and scientists who take individual or social consciousness as their primary reference point; their aim is to explain the realm of nature as a mental, cultural, or spiritual construct. They do not accept the ontological implications of the scientific view of the world at face value, and they are usually dismissed by their opponents as idealists. According to Gare, this tradition includes George Berkeley, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, G. W. F. Hegel, theorists of hermeneutics, neo‐Kantians, Hegelian Marxists, and some of the pragmatists, phenomenologists, and ordinary language philosophers [
         5]. Being a much less coherent tradition of thought than scientific materialism, this tradition tends to divide itself; on the one hand, there are those who assume that consciousness is individual or transcendental and those who argue that it is essentially social, cultural, or spiritual. On the other hand, there are those who assume that consciousness is contemplative, as well as those who insist that praxis precedes reflective or theoretical thinking. But, according to Gare, “what all such thinkers have in common is a refusal to be bound by the categories of reductionist science and a determination to do justice to the creativity and freedom of consciousness” [5, p. 4].<br>

Abstract: As Frei discusses in
         The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative, the study of philology and the grammar of scripture has been a central component of redaction and historical criticism. By and large, grammatical study has examined the language of scripture in light of the uses of language in the historical settings in which texts were written. Grammatical analysis took the form of historical analysis of the verbal forms used in the composition of the texts; as Frei writes of Johann Philipp Gabler, it “meant working out from a text’s words, as used at the time they were written, and the single, and never more than single, meaning of the text and its author, quite regardless of one’s estimate of the soundness of his position.”37This single, ostensive meaning of words, in association with the world of the author, subsequently permeated historical‐critical studies, dogmatic theology, and hermeneutics. This historical determination of grammatical meaning comes to fruition in the work of Schleiermacher, whose hermeneutics oscillated dialectically between the poles of psychological, “technical” interpretation and grammatical interpretation. Grammatical understanding involves understanding “the discourse as a focus within a language as a whole, characterized by its relation to the total linguistic stock” of the author, for whose completion, quoting Schleiermacher, “there would have to be a complete knowledge of the language.”38While grammatical interpretation is necessary, and always remains incomplete, the “divinatory” element of psychological interpretation governs and guides the interpretation, leading the reader to the text’s meaning, in knowing the author better than she knows herself.<br>

Author(s): Todorova Maria<br>
Abstract: How did people look at the whole event when it took place? Naturally there were supporters and detractors, but how was each position actually articulated? As an important party/government decision, the determination to embalm Dimitrov and display him in a mausoleum emulating the one on Red Square was not meant to be publicly discussed, only publicly appreciated. Disapproval could hardly be articulated in a written form at the time, except outside the country, so evidence for that reaction exists mostly in the form of actions and personal memories. In 1956, for instance, there was a plot to blow up the mausoleum during a demonstration so that the whole Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP) could be eradicated.
         40This was a case where the mausoleum was targeted less as a symbol than as a functional site, one that was more accessible than other places where the party assambled.41Beyond that, the commandant of the mausoleum, Colonel Gergov, reported only two serious incidents of disrespectful behavior: one anonymous, the other involving a foreigner. The first took place when a bag was abandoned in the mausoleum's wardrobe but, after a brief period of concern, it turned out to be full of stones and bricks. The other occurred when the rather inebriated deputy military attaché of the French embassy began marching behind the mausoleum's honor guard. He was sent away but returned in half an hour and tried to take one of the soldiers' guns.42<br>

Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>

Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: In response to Patočka’s claim that Christianity has failed to adequately thematize what a Person is—that is, the Person that penetrates the soul with its glance without in turn being seen and that constitutes the soul as a responsible self—Derrida writes that such a reference to “inadequate thematization … seems to appeal to some ultimate adequacy of thematization that could be accomplished” (
      GD,p. 27). Let us remind ourselves of the fact that, in the tradition of responsibility, its Greek moment may come the closest to the ideal of full thematization because it demands knowledge of the reasons, the aim, the meaning of what is done and of the circumstances of one’s decisions or actions. Although Derrida emphasizes that we must be continually aware of the fact that whenever we do not sufficiently thematize whatresponsibilitymeans some irresponsibility insinuates itself into our actions, he also remarks that this is always and everywhere the case. No action, if it is to be a responsible action, is ever consciously or cognitively sufficiently determined. Derrida adds: “One can sayeverywherea priori and nonempirically” (GD,p. 26). If this is so, it is because an action must transcend knowledge to be responsible as well as to include knowledge of what responsibility means. Unless it is the execution of a preestablished theorem or norm, an action merits the titleresponsibleonly if it is also effectuated without full theoretical determination. It follows from this that the thematization of responsibility is, for structural reasons, always lacking—even in the case of the Platonic notion of responsibility rejected by Patočka on the basis that it makes responsibility a function of the knowledge of the good. This is even more the case for the heretically Christian conception of responsibility. Derrida observes that thematization
            
      is, if not denied, at least strictly limited in its pertinence by that other more radical form of responsibility that expos~<br>

Abstract: What Simmel was to point to at the turn of the century in
         The Philosophy of Money,his important cultural supplement to Marx’sCapital,was the establishment of a cultural formation no longer constrained by enforcing periodicity in order to satisfy individual emotions and wants. It was now possible, at any given moment, to buy anything for money. Such a culture was able to overcome the limits set by space and time and thus the need to delineate definite periods compelling the determination of a framework for action. In Simmel’s reckoning, all that was necessary, under the circumstances of this vision of a lived, endless present, was the will and capacity of the individual to act upon objective conditions. For those who possess the means to carry out this desire, the present will always appear as indistinguishable from the future; for others, the present can only mean uncertainty and offer hope for a better future. Moreover, it was the absence of periodicity demanded by capitalism that rendered invisible the coexistence of multiple temporalities in the present and their claims on both the past and future. Yet Simmel never explained the historical conditions that might account for the interruption of a concern for periodicity in the present; he had decided in advance to remain silent on the formation of capitalist society. Moreover, he was looking at the absence of periodicity from the perspective of consumption and consumers, not production, workers, and wages, which would have demanded instituting a framework determined by temporal markers. The sudden manifestation or awareness of the importance of periodicity would in fact reflect the punctual, cyclical crises produced by capitalist accumulation itself, as it would undermine the capacity to buy anything, anytime, especially for those whose future was always the day after. In this regard, the manifestation or awareness of the demand for periodicity at certain moments would signify a symptom of critical instabi~<br>

Abstract: A reading of the

The first of these is the illusory nature of the phenomenal world, a presupposition of the alleged quietism and ethical indifference of the Brahmin sage.112The second is the understanding of brahman as an inert and pallid abstraction, an “abstract unity without determination,” as Hegel puts it.113<br>

Author(s): Plate Liedeke<br>
Abstract: As Rich defines it, “re‐vision … is an act of survival” because it leads to autonomy and self‐determination. By identifying sources of oppression and charting their mechanics of reproduction, re‐vision was meant to retrieve an authentic sense of self that was not defined by patriarchal society. To reveal that there is nothing natural about the stories that sustain social organization and its gendered division of labor was to rescue women from the confines of domesticity. Indeed, revealing that they are stories to begin with, myths that are passed off as timeless truths but that can be told differently, was considered the first step in the process of emancipation that was to lead, through the stages of consciousness‐raising and political action, to the radical transformation of the public sphere. French feminist Hélène Cixous voices views similar to Rich’s when she asks what would happen if the myths that sustain the patriarchal order were to be demystified and claims, “Then all the stories would have to be told differently, the future would be incalculable, the historical forces would, will, change hands, bodies; another thinking as yet not thinkable will transform the functioning of all society” (
         1981, 93). Gesturing toward all those women re‐writers re‐visioning the great narratives of the West while resonating intertextually with Rich’s words, Cixous adds:
               
         Well, we are living through this very period when the conceptual foundation of a millennial culture is in process of being undermined by millions of a species of mole as yet not recognized.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: Schopenhauer’s rejection of individual will’s self‐serving egoism bespeaks a greater concordance than he is willing to acknowledge between his views and Augustine’s avocation of the perfectibility of
         voluntas. As discussed, to Augustine the harder one’s individual intention strives to coincide with love, the better one gets to know oneself; and the better one gets to know oneself, the more diaphanous becomes the diaphragm separating one’s real self from its ideal reflection in the mirror of introspection. Self‐knowledge is self‐making in Augustine, and this self‐making consists of the transformative self‐denial whereby one purposefully modifies one’s own will until a coincidence is reached between desire and love. Schopenhauer accuses Augustine of “expressing in a naïve way” the role played by will in one’s self‐determination. According to Schopenhauer, when Augustine draws an analogy inDe civitate Deibetween “gravity [as] the motion of the body” and “love [as] the motion of the soul,” he is confusing the “real necessity” bestowed on both motions by the same cause, that is, by the self‐deployment of will in time and space, with the soul’sliberum arbitrium indifferentiae, that is, the undifferentiated free will whereby the soul, contrary to the body’s deterministic fate, chooses its own destiny.56There is no “undifferentiated free will,” hence no perfectible self in Schopenhauer; one either succumbs to the necessity of will’s self‐deployment or affirms one’s freedom by obstructing it, by boycotting it. Schopenhauer is an Augustinian reductionistmalgré soi—a revisionist of Augustine’s avocation of the perfectibility of the self. Schopenhauer’s reductionism is reflected in the lack of direction intrinsic to his project of self‐emancipation from the dominion of will. In Augustine the obstruction of the instinctive drive of self‐interest is a figuratively upward movement (momentum), deriving its direction from the self‐abnegation, the weightlessness of love;57in~<br>

Abstract: From the outset
         Communicationstreated cinema as but one star in a huge constellation of processes and artifacts. And it was determined to treat cinema in a disciplined manner, as an alternative to the proliferating “amateur” film journals of the New Wave era. At the same timeCommunicationswanted to avoid merely applying traditional academic disciplines to popular culture in the manner of thefilmologiegroup, and it certainly wanted to replace the latter's positivist profile with something startlingly new. Indeed, it hoped to score the same kind of revolution within the academy as the New Wave had scored in the real world of film production and distribution. The very first issue featured Barthes's “The Photographic Message,” an article that would become fundamental for film studies and for its author's later bookCamera Lucida. Morin's contribution was called “The Culture Industry”; he also introduced a dossier on the current phenomenon of the New Wave. The veering of this journal and of Morin away from postwar aesthetics and sociology became unmistakable in the fourth issue, titled “Recherches semiologiques” (1967). Promoting undisguised disciplinary determination we find Claude Bremond and a very young Tzvetan Todorov writing on literary systems, while Christian Metz debuts with one of his most far‐reaching essays, “Cinéma: Langue ou langage.” Barthes appears twice, first with the famous “Rhetoric of the Image” and then with the complete text of “Elements of Semiology.”30<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: This emphasis—for example, one “must act in order to receive” (N5554, fol. 11v), and God as a “prior actuality” (N4816)—brings Coleridge far closer to Marion’s analysis than to Derrida’s, insofar as prayer responds to an always already present effect, claim, gift, or call. Marion presents prayer as language directed at a requisite (
         aition, or cause) from whom beings “receive themselves … as requestants.”64This is why he later argues that Derrida’s objections hold only if naming God is seen as attempting to overcome a lack or deficiency in one’s intuition of God. Marion insists that the intuition is, by contrast, present as an excess—a saturated phenomenon—that demands a proliferation of names: father, love, beauty, holiness, and so on.65Naming, in this infinitely multiplying sense, would thus be not a determination of God but a way of guarding against the illusion that any one name of God is determinative.66Yet if prayer responds and bears witness to a certain call already made on the subject, Marion arguably renders prayer too easy. After all, it is only a minor shift from the human experience of loving to praising God as love.67<br>

Abstract: Second, reference to uneven numbers commemorates miraculous victories on the battlefield in nascent Islam. In Sura 8 we hear that the numbers to defeat may be tenfold: “If there are twenty among you with determination, they will vanquish two hundred; and if there are a hundred, then they will vanquish one thousand” (8:65). The third phase of the last instructions invokes the same kind of legend:
            
                  Miraculous assistance is revealed also in Sura 3:124–26:When you see the masses of the unbelievers, remember the Confederates (
               al‐ahzab), whose numbers were approximately 10,000 thousand fighters, and how God gave victory to His servants the believers [Muslims].
                  
            Remember when you said to the faithful, “Is it not sufficient that your Lord should send for your help three thousand angels from the heavens? Indeed if you are patient and take heed for yourselves, and the (enemy) come rushing at you suddenly, your Lord will send even five thousand angels on chargers sweeping down.” And God did not do so but as good tidings and to reassure your hearts—for victory comes from God alone.”<br>

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: Obsessed with his afterlife yet disdaining to be dissolved into God's heaven, Faustus develops a relation in his mind to the devil as his solution to his dilemma. By adopting the “metaphysics of magicians,” Faustus finds a way, he thinks, to control the terms of his own death, securing for himself an eternity of continued embodiment and lack of self-transcendence. Indeed, at first Faustus passionately catalogs the epicurean marvels that he will command his spirits to procure—the “orient pearl” (1.1.85), the “princely delicates” (1.1.87)—but it becomes increasingly clear over the course of the play that whatever worldly rewards magic may afford him are secondary. Thus when Valdes promises Faustus that by magic he will gain fame and sex and money if only he will “be resolute” (1.1.135), Faustus answers in a way that tells more than he knows: “Valdes,” he says, “as resolute am I in this / As thou to live” (1.1.136–37). His resolution to live indicates less Faustus's determination to satisfy himself than his determination to save himself, to use magic to self-create the materialized afterlife, the embodied end, he most ardently desires. Thus the ability to conjure up and play with spirits is what he wants; magical personation enables him to face his own death and what is then to come, for it enables him to experience being, as Faustus believes, already in hell, where he will not only continue to walk, dispute, eat, and give lectures but also participate in delightful entertainments that celebrate personation itself. That is why Faustus is so easily distracted from repentance and doubt by the apparently trivial shows that the devil stages for him, or that he thinks he conjures up himself.
      32Far from being inexplicably minor applications of the exalted magical power Faustus supposedly possesses, those pageants and dumbshows are at the very core of the satisfaction that Faustus looks to magic to afford him. The spirits personating poetic figures give Faustus visible ~<br>

Abstract: First, it is not clear that Larmore’s evidence for mimetism (chap. 2) shows anything more than Charles Taylor or Wittgenstein have argued concerning meaning in general: our efforts to shape a practical identity must employ a shared language (32). That deliberation by reflection “consists in comparing ourselves to someone else” only seems evident if it amounts simply to Mead’s or Habermas’s point that reasons are dialogical or intersubjective (41), which Larmore repeatedly affirms (34). The thesis becomes dubious if instead it means that all persons are primarily motivated by tuitive motives such as envy, desire for status, or comparative advantage or that our achieving reputation in the eyes of others is fundamental to us, as Larmore’s examples often suggest (31, 46). Second, following “models” need not amount to “heteronomy” (35) since all plausible conceptions of personal autonomy admit sources of agentive capacities that influence a child in her upbringing without her choosing them; these are the educative processes that enable self-determination to start. Third, the theory of mimetism that Larmore reconstructs from René Girard seems to make any radical innovation in the history of ideas impossible. How then could the Troubadours have introduced the concept of romantic love (35)? How could cultures grow or develop if nothing is not copied from the past? Fourth, rejecting a latent self that subsists “deep inside us … unsullied by all that we have borrowed from others” (37) implies that unreflective emoting and action (or ‘flow’) is not more likely to constitute an experience of “being wholly ourselves” (55). Yet Larmore retains a version of Stendhal’s idea that completely unreflective experience is more “natural” (27) and provides one kind of authenticity since it leaves out the perspective of others that reflection always brings (64). This negative definition does not allow us to distinguish authentic spontaneity from merely careless or thoughtless ways of being ~<br>

Author(s): Regan Ethna<br>
Abstract: Not content to engage the discourses of theology and human rights by way of definition and description, Regan constructively engages both discourses, building on the work of Karl Rahner, Johann Baptist Metz, and Paul Ricoeur. The heart of the text is this constructive mode. Regan develops a theological anthropology that sees human flourishing, the aim of human being, in a “generosity of existence” (15), which is grounded in and flows from a capacity for God (76). Generosity of existence is the idea that life consists in both giving and receiving toward greater flourishing of oneself, others, and a community of being (112). The notion of generosity of existence includes a capacity for self-determination and is therefore protected by a human rights discourse that seeks to defend a zone of individual human autonomy. But this theological anthropology is not exhausted by individual autonomy. Rather, it links an individual capacity for self-determination to a responsibility for “making oneself” in response both to God and to the embeddedness of human life (82). In this sense, human rights ought to be taken seriously by any theologian who believes human beings ought to orient their lives to God, because violations of human rights severely impair this capacity and impede the possibility of responding to a divine call. She attributes the revelation of a mystical dimension to human rights activism to the insights of liberation theology, which highlights a divine element embedded in the struggle for human rights. But Regan also sees liberation theology as contributing several insights to secular liberal human rights discourse, including an awareness and acknowledgment of the systematic and structural constraints that limit the capacities of the poor of the world to flourish, and highlighting the importance of basic sociocultural rights.<br>

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Badiou’s attempt to “extract a formal, wholly secularized conception of grace”
         
               from the Pauline texts and to exploit their political potential while disregarding Paul’s theological commitments stems, basically, from his rejection of transcendence as such. Bonhoeffer’s nonreligious interpretation aimed to redefine God’s transcendence understood in a sense of other-worldliness so that it could be found in immanence (“God is beyond even in the middle of our lives”187
            
               ), that is to say, in the “neighbor who is within reach in any given situation.”188
            
               The God of Bonhoeffer is, in a sense, an absent God, a God who in the midst of the world remains invisible and silent until Christians make God present and visible by their participation in Jesus’s being for others. While Bonhoeffer radically reinterprets the traditional Christian notion of transcendence, Badiou simply does away with it. In this regard, he represents “a shared new determination to grapple with the legacy of the death of God in a deeper way than ever before, re-making philosophy from the ground up as a thinking ‘without God.’”189
            
               When Badiou speaks of the “death of God,” what he means by “God” is not only the metaphysical God with whose death Nietzsche and Heidegger were concerned (the end of onto-theology) and whose death enables the return of a “more divine” God. In light of his ontology, all three meanings of the word “God” that he distinguishes, that is, the living God of religion, the conceptual God of metaphysics, and the God of the poets, become superfluous.190
            
               As a consequence, even a theological understanding of religion—as, for instance, “a personal communion between God and human beings”191
            
               —that could be accepted by Bonhoeffer cannot stand in the face of Badiou’s radical dismissal of transcendence. However, when we look at the reality~<br>

Abstract: Nietzsche’s famous admonition will be recalled: “Truths are illusions of which we have forgotten that they are illusions, metaphors which have become worn by frequent use and have lost all sensuous vigor, coins which have lost their embossing and are now treated as metal and no longer as coins” (quoted in
            Ricoeur 1978, 379–80). In a genealogy spanning Vico, Herder, and, later, the speculative philology that came out of German Romanticism, there is a repeated insistence that the primary use of metaphor is in a conceptualizing role and not one of adornment or embellishment via poetic transposition; this is also taken up by Max Müller, who writes: “The old metaphor was rather the result of a need, and was usually not so much the transfer of a word from one concept to another as the creation or more accurate determination of a new concept using an old name” (quoted inCassirer 1973, 107–8 [M. Müller,Das Denken im Lichte der Sprache]). Where philosophical work is concerned, images of the sensory space have routinely been extended metaphorically in an effort to grasp the ideal, including a metaphorics of what is held to be suprasensory; as Ernst Cassirer observes: “It is as though all intellectual and ideal relationships could only be made accessible to the linguistic consciousness by projecting them into space and ‘reproducing’ them there analogically. Only in the relationships of ‘together,’ ‘apart’ and ‘adjoining’ does this consciousness acquire the means to represent the most heterogeneous qualitative connections, dependencies and oppositions” (Cassirer 1985, 162).<br>

Publisher: The Johns Hopkins University Press<br>
Issue: i20486733<br>
Date: 2 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Addis Adeno<br>
Abstract: The assertion of prescriptive and adjudicative universal jurisdictions by some countries in relation to a handful of offenses that are classified as international or universal crimes (e.g. genocide) has led to a great deal of controversy. Those who favor universal jurisdiction argue that certain acts (often crimes) affect all of us, not just the specific individual or group of victims or the country of which the victims are nationals. It is therefore legitimate, they argue, for any state to punish or suppress such acts regardless of any traditional jurisdictional connection between the alleged acts and the state asserting jurisdiction. The availability of universal jurisdiction is premised on the presumed effect of certain crimes on humanity as a whole. Those who commit these offenses are referred to as hostis humani generis--enemies of human kind. Skeptics argue that the idea of universal jurisdiction is conceptually incoherent, inconsistent with the principle of political self-determination, and has great potential to be an instrument of political mischief. While they disagree on the conceptual coherence and utility of the notion of universal jurisdiction, both proponents and opponents view its function in purely instrumental terms, to provide the condition for punishing or suppressing certain offenses that affect all of us. This article argues that universal jurisdiction also serves another, less articulated purpose. It has a constitutive function as well. It is partly a process through which the identity of the international community is imagined and enacted. It is an expression of a sense of ourselves (a community of humankind) at given moments of time. This article argues that neglect of this constitutive dimension leads to an incomplete analysis of universal jurisdiction.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: The present article explores some currently disputed issues regarding the relationship between temporality, memory, and the self. To exemplify and to concretely examine the problems under consideration, a phenomenological analysis of dementia illnesses is proposed. The first objective of this article is to develop an appropriate concept of the self, apt to describe the experience of dementia patients. To this aim, the different positions in the debate regarding the preservation of the self in dementia patients are first critically assessed. Subsequently, it is shown how the phenomenological distinction between the basic sense of self, often indicated as the minimal self, and the higher forms of narrative self-consciousness and identity can fruitfully contribute in this debate. The second objective of the article is a more concrete qualification of the minimal self. Particularly, the determination of the minimal self as un-extended in time is challenged. On the basis of the phenomenology of time and implicit body memory, and still exemplarily referring to the analysis of dementia illnesses, it will be argued that a concrete description of basic self-experience necessarily needs to take its spatio-temporal unfolding into account.<br>

Abstract: This paper analyzes the different types of narrative self-reference employed in the autobiographical works of Felicitas Hoppe and Péter Esterházy. It argues that these texts illustrate and reflect an anthropological condition which can be described as ›eccentric positionality‹, a term coined by Helmuth Plessner, or ›constitutive homelessness‹. Self-narrating is both the expression of and compensation for that condition. According to Paul Ricœur it can be seen as an attempt to understand what is essentially indefinable: the individual self. Narrative configurations place different events, actions and perceptions in a (mostly) coherent order. By doing so, they configure the individual self as a being that changes in time. The novels by Hoppe and Esterházy display and simulate different modes of self-narrating between historicization and fictionalization, namely self-discovery (Selbstfindung), self-invention (Selbsterfindung), and self-determination (Selbstbestimmung). As these modes are confronted with different types of problems, they reflect the complex relationship of a person to herself as both the narrator and the protagonist of her life story.<br>

Abstract: En réaction au libéralisme rawlsien pour qui le droit est référé à la liberté d'action des individus, le mouvement communautarien a voulu référer le droit à l'identité culturelle (individuelle ou collective), lui assignant, ultimement, la fonction de stabiliser cette identité. Pour ces auteurs, le lien entre identité et droit est interne, ce qui ouvre la voie à ce qu'on a appelé « les paradoxes de l'identité démocratique » et conduit à la notion problématique de droits collectifs. On montrera ici comment une telle notion repose sur une « réduction identitaire » , par principe opérée au point de vue objectivant de la troisième personne, privant par là même les acteurs sociaux de leur capacité d'autodétermination, À cette vision anti-libérale dans son fondement, qui fait de la sécurité identitaire son horizon, on opposera la vision d'une identité risquée qui ne préjuge pas dogmatiquement des constituants identitaires de chacun et ouvre ainsi la voie aux authentiques principes de la coexistence multiculturelle. In reaction to Rawlsian liberalism, which relates law to freedom of action, the Communitarian movement wants to relate law to cultural identity (individual or collective), assigning it, ultimately, the function to stabilize this identity. For Communitarianism the relationship between identity and law is internal, which opens the path to what has been called « the paradoxes of democratic identity » , and leads to the problematic notion of « collective rights » . It is shown here how such a notion rests on an « identity-reduction » , which by principle is operated from a third-person perspective, depriving individuals of their capacity of self-determination. In opposition to this fundamentally anti-liberal vision, the notion of an open identity is proposed, which doesn't dogmatically predetermine the identities of everyone and opens therefore the path to the basic principles of a multicultural coexistence.<br>

Abstract: L'article qui suit envisage quelques unes des questions que soulève aujourd'hui la notion d'identité aussi bien individuelle que collective dans le politique. En prenant appui notamment sur les réflexions d'Ernst Tugendhat dans Conscience de soi et autodétermination, je suggère que les préoccupations identitaires et les interrogations autour d'une crise de l'identité gagnent à être abordées à partir de la notion de projection et de détermination de la volonté et des actions plutôt qu'en termes de traits définitionnels statiques. Je suggère aussi que l'étude doit prendre en compte non seulement la situation dans ses dimensions individuelles et collectives mais aussi les conditions de désorientation que produit désormais l'incertitude concernant l'idée de l'humain elle-même. In this paper I consider some of the issues raised by the notion of identity in the political area to-day. Drawing upon the reflections of Ernst Tugendhat in his book Selbstbewusstsein und Selbstbestimmung, I suggest that contemporary problems of identity, individual and collective as well, and namely the idea of a postmodern crisis of political identities, are better understood when we view them in terms of projects and determination of actions. I also suggest we have to take into account not only individual and collective aspects of identity but also our inability to define our idea of what it is to be human.<br>

Abstract: Selon la philosophie moderne la pensée est une production de la subjectivité, la volonté est une auto-détermination et le temps est une auto-affection. Kierkegaard offre une autre compréhension de la vie volontaire en envisageant une volonté brisée par le prochain, par le temps et par Dieu. La patience n'est pas pour Kierkegaard un accident de notre caractère, mais la condition pour devenir une personne. Cela suppose de laisser de côté toute compréhension purement psychologique de la patience. La vraie persévérance s'oppose totalement à l'obsession de se blinder par rapport au monde. Entre l'endurance stoïcienne et la patience chrétienne comme patience dans l'espérance il n'y a pas d'essence commune. Kierkegaard montre que la patience de l'amour est une passivité qui est la voie du salut. For modem philosophy meaning is a product of subjectivity, will is a self-determination, and time is a self-affection. Kierkegaard gives us another meaning for a voluntary life by considering desire that is broken by the will of another man, time and God. Patience is not for Kierkegaard an accident of character but is the condition to becoming a person. It is necessary to ignore a purely psychological understanding of patience. True perseverance is radically opposed to an obsessive existence blinded to the world. Between the stoic conception of endurance and Christian patience there is no common essence. For Kierkegaard, the patience of love is a form of passivity that can save Mankind.<br>

Author(s): Rettig Salomon<br>
Abstract: Studies of laboratory research in the natural sciences have shown the significance of crossexperimenter dialogue in the determination of scientific facts. Behavioral and social scientists have largely ignored that role in the construction of scientific facts. A dialogic data base differs epistemogically from strict behavioral observations because of its retroductive and dialectic character. Its symbolic nature calls for hermeneutic efforts designed to achieve and assess consensual rather than empirical validation. Its ultimate aim is social organization rather than prediction and control. In view of this distinction, experimental research of human behavior must show the integration of the empirical and dialogic bases of behavioral data so as to more accurately reflect its constructive nature.<br>

Abstract: This study among the Maneo (Seram, Indonesia) focuses on the pragmatics of kinship knowledge. Through an extended investigation of a stranger's arrival, I untangle processes of recognition from those guiding the determination of relatedness. Recognition establishes the continuity of experience; as such, verity is a measure of the adequacy as opposed to accuracy of observation: a fact that contributes to the possibility of misrecognition. By contrast, relatedness is contingent upon the expression and suppression of different, sometimes contradictory historical ties. [kinship, knowledge, pragmatism, Maneo, Indonesia]<br>

Abstract: Orientation required a consideration of the continents known as Europe and Africa. How are they located in global space and in relationship to each other, and what are and have been the meanings coming from these loci? I have characterized the invention of “the continent of Europe” in ritual terms borrowed from Theodor Gaster to hint at this dimension. In like manner, the determination of any geographical space has implications for all other spaces within that field. These implications occur with greater or lesser speed and intensity in relationships to specific temporal rhythms. In other words, any valid form of orientation in the modern world must presuppose the transcultural nature of the globe since the fifteenth century. This orientation must of necessity take into account the interaction and exchanges of matter of land and lands, water and watery passages, and the bodies, commodities, as well as ideas.<br>

Abstract: This theory of the legitimacy of the intuition or prima facie sense of our own unique individuality is supported by Brentano's ontological position on the I as substance and substance itself as the principle of individuation. In this matter of the individuation of the I-substance there is thus a serious tension. On the one hand, the preferred consideration for Brentano is that something is individuated properly through its ultimate distinguishing determination or feature, the infima species. On the other hand, Brentano is convinced that what distinguishes all our acts ultimately is that they are acts of this substance, this I. Here the third-personal thing-ontology and first-personal phenomenological ontology seem inextricably bound up with one another.<br>

Issue: philrhet.46.2.issue-2<br>

Abstract: To sketch how prefiguration works in public memory, I return briefly to the example of contemporary juvenile biographies. Such texts are shaped by enduring commonplaces of U.S. public culture that “prefigure” the narratives in the texts and thus render them intelligible on a basic level to members of that broader culture. Individual life stories become recognizable historical narratives because they resonate with late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century American perceptions of historical action. The introduction to the popular Americans All series of biographies provides an example. This widely circulated series published in the 1960s and 1970s features dozens of juvenile biographies. These books focus on individuals that have “uniquely contributed to the American way of life,” including figures such as Henry Ford, Martin Luther King Jr., and Sojourner Truth. Elaborating on these generic contributions, a short introduction to each text explains that “often despite great odds, these famous people have attained success in their fields through the good use of ability, determination, and hard work” (Patterson 1970, inside cover). Readers of this series learn not only about individual people; they learn about the public culture in which these lives were lived and in which these stories were constructed. As Ricoeur explains, “To understand a story is to understand both the language of ‘doing something’ and the cultural tradition from which proceeds the typology of plots” (1984, 1:57). The “language of ‘doing something’” that shapes children's biographies often stems from cultural assumptions about what it means to be historically significant. Did the subject have a lasting impact on society? Was she or he associated with other prominent figures? In American public culture, other values affect the way in which individual lives will be narrated: liberal individualism; the myth of progress and its individualized variant, “personal growth”; and the ideal of freedom, amo~<br>
