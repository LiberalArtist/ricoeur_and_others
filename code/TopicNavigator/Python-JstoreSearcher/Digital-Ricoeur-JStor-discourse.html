  Book Title: The Political Style of Conspiracy-Chase, Summer, and Lincoln<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Pfau Michael William<br>
  Abstract: The turbulent history of the United States has provided a fertile ground for conspiracies, both real and imagined. From the American Revolution to the present day, conspiracy discourse-linguistic and symbolic practices and artifacts revolving around themes, claims, or accusations of conspiracy-has been a staple of political rhetoric. Some conspiracy theories never catch on with the public, while others achieve widespread popularity. Whether successful or not, the means by which particular conspiracy theories spread is a rhetorical process, a process in which persuasive language, symbolism, and arguments act upon individual minds within concrete historical and political settings.Conspiracy rhetoric was a driving force in the evolution of antebellum political culture, contributing to the rise and fall of the great parties in the nineteenth century. One conspiracy theory in particular-the "slave power" conspiracy-was instrumental in facilitating the growth of the young Republican Party's membership and ideology.
      The Political Style of Conspiracyanalyzes the concept and reality of the "slave power" in the rhetorical discourse of the mid-nineteenth-century, in particular the speeches and writing of politicians Salmon P. Chase, Charles Sumner, and Abraham Lincoln. By examining their mainstream texts, Pfau reveals that, in addition to the "paranoid style" of conspiracy rhetoric that inhabits the margins of political life, Lincoln, Chase, and Sumner also engaged in a distinctive form of conspiracy rhetoric that is often found at the center of mainstream American society and politics.<br>

  Conspiracy Rhetoric at the Center and Fringe from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt13x0p8c">The Political Style of Conspiracy</a><br>
  Abstract: It is unfortunate that at a juncture in history when conspiracy theories of various sorts increasingly populate the diverse locales of public spheres around the world, the study of conspiracy discourse continues to be hobbled, rather than enabled, by the legacy of the paranoid style. Too many scholars studying conspiracy still conceive of conspiracy discourse as uniformly deranged and dangerous. While a number of scholars have attempted to move beyond the oversimplifications and pejorative assumptions of the paranoid style in their engagements with mainstream conspiracy texts, few have brought to the issue Hofstadterʹs critical sensitivity and concern with discursive form.¹<br>

  Book Title: Superchurch-The Rhetoric and Politics of American Fundamentalism<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Edwards Jonathan J.<br>
  Abstract: Christian Fundamentalism is a doctrine and a discourse in tension. Fundamentalists describe themselves as both marginal and a majority. They announce the imminent end of the world while building massive megachurches and political lobbying organizations. They speak of the need for purity and separation from the outside world while continually innovating in their search for more effective and persuasive ways to communicate with and convert outsiders. To many outsiders, Fundamentalist speech seems contradictory, irrational, intolerant, and dangerously antidemocratic. To understand the complexity of Fundamentalism, we have to look inside the tensions and the paradoxes. We have to take seriously the ways in which Fundamentalists describe themselves to themselves, and to do that, we must begin by exploring the central role of "the church" in Fundamentalist rhetoric and politics. Drawing on five fascinating case studies,
      Superchurchblends a complex yet readable treatment of rhetorical and political theory with a sophisticated approach to Fundamentalism that neither dismisses its appeal nor glosses over its irresolvable tensions. Edwards challenges theories of rhetoric, counterpublics, deliberation, and civility while offering critical new insights into the evolution and continuing influence of one of the most significant cultural and political movements of the past century.<br>

  Book Title: Enigmas of Sacrifice-A Critique of Joseph M. Plunkett and the Dublin Insurrection of 1916<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Cormack W. J. Mc<br>
  Abstract: Enigmas of Sacrifice: A Critique of Joseph M. Plunkett and the Dublin Insurrection of 1916is the first critical study of the religious poet and militarist Joseph M. Plunkett, who was executed with the other leaders of the Dublin insurrection of 1916. Through Plunkett the author gains access to areas of nationalist thought that were more often assumed or repressed than publicly formulated.In this eye-opening book, W. J. Mc Cormack explores and analyzes Plunkett's brief life, work, and influence, beginning with his wealthy but dysfunctional family, irregular Jesuit education, and self-canceling sexuality. Mc Cormack continues through Plunkett's active phase when amateur theatricals and a magazine editorship brought him into the emergent neonationalist discourse of early twentieth-century Ireland. Finally, the author arrives at Holy Week 1916, when Plunkett masterminded the forgery of official documentation in order to provoke and justify the insurrection he planned. Mc Cormack analyzes Plunkett's significant texts and provides context through critical perspectives on his milieu.Enigmas of Sacrificeis unique in its effort to understand a major figure of Irish nationalism in terms that reach beyond political identity.<br>

  Book Title: Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy-The Living Art of Michael C. Leff<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Henry David<br>
  Abstract: What distinguishes the study of rhetoric from other pursuits in the liberal arts? From what realms of human existence and expression, of human history, does such study draw its defining character? What, in the end, should be the purposes of rhetorical inquiry? And amid so many competing accounts of discourse, power, and judgment in the contemporary world, how might scholars achieve these purposes through the attitudes and strategies that animate their work?
      Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy: The Living Art of Michael C. Leffoffers answers to these questions by introducing the central insights of one of the most innovative and prolific rhetoricians of the twentieth century, Michael C. Leff. This volume charts Leff 's decades-long development as a scholar, revealing both the variety of topics and the approach that marked his oeuvre, as well as his long-standing critique of the disciplinary assumptions of classical, Hellenistic, renaissance, modern, and postmodern rhetoric.Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy includes a synoptic introduction to the evolution of Leff 's thought from his time as a graduate student in the late 1960s to his death in 2010, as well as specific commentary on twenty-four of his most illuminating essays and lectures.<br>

  Abstract: Rhetorical arguments generally deal with confused notions, with ideas and concepts that do not admit of a single, unequivocal meaning.¹ Consequently, rhetorical argumentation normally does not begin with fixed axioms in the manner of demonstrative reasoning. Instead rhetoricians must draw their starting points from accepted beliefs and values relative to the audience and the subject of discourse. When these beliefs and values are considered at a high level of generality, they become “commonplaces” or “common topics” for argumentation: the attempt to render a systematic account of such topics therefore has been a major concern of rhetorical theory from antiquity to<br>

  Abstract: The conduct of international relations has always involved skillful use of persuasive discourse. Relations between states might depend on factors such as military capability and natural resources, but the decisions made about the conduct of peace and war are also a result of the successes, failures, habits, and nuances of persuasive appeal among elites and publics alike. For the most part, however, academic research in international relations has not focused on the forms and effects of conversations, speeches, debates, narratives, or discourses in political practice.

  Abstract: In 1936 General Francisco Franco and other military leaders revolted against the Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic, plunging the country into a devastating civil war that would last until 1939.

  Book Title: Symposium of the Whole-A Range of Discourse Toward an Ethnopoetics<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Rothenberg Diane<br>
  Abstract: Symposium of the Wholetraces a discourse on poetry and culture that has profoundly influenced the art of our time, with precedents going back two centuries and more. Beginning with a reassertion of the complexity of poetry among peoples long labeled "primitive" and "savage," many recent poets have sought to base a new poetics over the fullest range of human cultures. The attempt to define an ethnopoetics has been significantly connected with the most experimental and future-directed side of Romantic and modern poetry, both in the Western world and, increasingly, outside it. As a visionary poetics and as a politics, this complex redefinition of cultural and intellectual values has involved a rarely acknowledged collaboration between poets and scholars, who together have challenged the narrow view of literature that has excluded so many traditions.In this gathering, the Rothenbergs follow the idea of an ethnopoetics from predecessors such as Vico, Blake, Thoreau, and Tzara to more recent essays and manifestos by poets and social thinkers such as Olson, Eliade, Snyder, Turner, and Baraka. The themes range widely, from the divergence of oral and written cultures to the shaman as proto-poet and the reemergence of suppressed and rejected forms and images: the goddess, the trickster, and the "human universe." The book's three ethnographic sections demonstrate how various poetries are structured and composed, how they reflect meaning and worldview, and how they are performed in cultures where all art may be thought of as art-in-motion.Among the poetries discussed are the language of magic; West African drum language and poetry; the Huichol Indian language of reversals; chance operations in African divination poetry; picture-writings and action-writings from Australia and Africa; and American Indian sacred-clown dramas and traditional trickster narratives. The cumulative effect is a new reading of the poetic past and present-in the editors' words, "a changed paradigm of what~<br>

  Book Title: The Cosmic Time of Empire-Modern Britain and World Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Barrows Adam<br>
  Abstract: Combining original historical research with literary analysis, Adam Barrows takes a provocative look at the creation of world standard time in 1884 and rethinks the significance of this remarkable moment in modernism for both the processes of imperialism and for modern literature. As representatives from twenty-four nations argued over adopting the Prime Meridian, and thereby measuring time in relation to Greenwich, England, writers began experimenting with new ways of representing human temporality. Barrows finds this experimentation in works as varied as Victorian adventure novels, high modernist texts, and South Asian novels—including the work of James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, H. Rider Haggard, Bram Stoker, Rudyard Kipling, and Joseph Conrad. Demonstrating the investment of modernist writing in the problems of geopolitics and in the public discourse of time, Barrows argues that it is possible, and productive, to rethink the politics of modernism through the politics of time.<br>

  Abstract: When this policeman downplays AIDS, he is not ignoring the emergence of the epidemic; rather, he reflects a recurrent discourse around HIV/AIDS that emphasizes policing and surveillance of China’s border regions.¹ Borders here provide a liminal space where many transactions occur and where the spread of HIV in Sipsongpanna, an autonomous minority prefecture bordering Laos and Burma, symbolizes what Arjun Appadurai (1996) characterizes as late-twentieth-century cross-border migrations. These mass migrations of peoples, goods, services, and now viruses color a moving transnational canvas.

  Abstract: Our exploration of the complex relationship between literature and space began with a legendary account of the origin of Sanskrit literature and a literary-theoretical discourse on Sanskrit styles and their regional dimensions. Both perspectives are conditioned by a conceptual matrix fundamental to Sanskrit thought for ordering and explaining the diverse phenomena of culture and society as elements in a transregional network closely related to Sanskrit’s own nonlocalized mode of existence. But there are other, literary linkages between literature and space.

  Book Title: Cannibal Talk-The Man-Eating Myth and Human Sacrifice in the South Seas<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Obeyesekere Gananath<br>
  Abstract: In this radical reexamination of the notion of cannibalism, Gananath Obeyesekere offers a fascinating and convincing argument that cannibalism is mostly "cannibal talk," a discourse on the Other engaged in by both indigenous peoples and colonial intruders that results in sometimes funny and sometimes deadly cultural misunderstandings. Turning his keen intelligence to Polynesian societies in the early periods of European contact and colonization, Obeyesekere deconstructs Western eyewitness accounts, carefully examining their origins and treating them as a species of fiction writing and seamen's yarns. Cannibalism is less a social or cultural fact than a mythic representation of European writing that reflects much more the realities of European societies and their fascination with the practice of cannibalism, he argues. And while very limited forms of cannibalism might have occurred in Polynesian societies, they were largely in connection with human sacrifice and carried out by a select community in well-defined sacramental rituals.
      Cannibal Talkconsiders how the colonial intrusion produced a complex self-fulfilling prophecy whereby the fantasy of cannibalism became a reality as natives on occasion began to eat both Europeans and their own enemies in acts of "conspicuous anthropophagy."<br>

  Abstract: Georges Bataille and Maurice Blanchot's mutual interest in the Lascaux cave paintings signals their common concern to construct a discourse of origin in relation to art. Both writers consider origin in terms of the anxiety-filled questioning surrounding the ontological and historical aporias that have plagued Western thought, including those that appear under the banner of the Modern and the Postmodern. Both ask: what kind of discourse presides over the disconcerting doubling of reality performed by the first artists? For Bataille, origin is bound up with the ritual significance of eroticism and death as these underpin all forms of artistic endeavour;<br>

  Abstract: One difference between shame and embarrassment in Rousseau can be stated quite simply. Shame is a passion productive of discourse. The confessing done under its aegis seems marvelously able to serve as an action of which to be ashamed, and so to provoke more confession. Embarrassment, on the other hand, is tonguetied, an anacoluthon in the grammar of feelings. Where, under influence of timidity, Rousseau manages to blurt something out nonetheless, the effect is not to end the silence but most often to prolong it, rendering the hapless speaker even more incapable of timely speech.

  Book Title: Labors of Imagination: Aesthetics and Political Economy from Kant to Althusser-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mieszkowski Jan<br>
  Abstract: This book is a major new study of the doctrines of productivity and interest in Romanticism and classical political economy. The author argues that the widespread contemporary embrace of cultural historicism and the rejection of nineteenth-century conceptions of agency have hindered our study of aesthetics and politics. Focusing on the difficulty of coordinating paradigms of intellectual and material labor, Mieszkowski shows that the relationship between the imagination and practical reason is crucial to debates about language and ideology.From the Romantics to Poe and Kafka, writers who explore Kant's claim that poetry sets the imagination freediscover that the representational and performative powers of language cannot be explained as the products of a self-governing dynamic, whether formal or material. A discourse that neither reflects nor prescribes the values of its society, literature proves to be a uniquely autonomous praxis because it undermines our reliance on the concept of interest as the foundation of self-expression or self-determination. Far from compromising its political significance, this turns literature into the condition of possibility of freedom. For Smith, Bentham, and Marx, the limits of self-rule as a model of agency prompt a similar rethinking of the relationship between language and politics. Their conception of a linguistic labor that informs material praxis is incompatible with the liberal ideal of individualism. In the final analysis, their work invites us to think about social conflicts not as clashes between competing interests, but as a struggle to distinguish human from linguistic imperatives.<br>

It is far from obvious, however, whether Kant’s efforts to develop a model of practical human autonomy are in any sense “clarified” by his statement that poetry “sets the imagination free.” A great deal of scholarship on Romanticism has relied, implicitly or explicitly, on the assumption of a substantive connection between creativity and liberty—if not their outright identity—but this position is rarely evaluated by trying to use it as a vantage point from<br>

  Book Title: Written Voices, Spoken Signs-Tradition, Performance, and the Epic Text<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAHANE AHUVIA<br>
  Abstract: These innovative essays by leading scholars of Homer, oral poetics, and epic invite us to rethink some key concepts for an understanding of traditional epic poetry. Egbert Bakker examines the epic performer's use of time and tense in recounting a past that is alive. Tackling the question of full-length performance of the monumental
         Iliad, Andrew Ford considers the extent to which the work was perceived as a coherent whole in the archaic age. John Miles Foley addresses questions about spoken signs and the process of reference in epic discourse, and Ahuvia Kahane studies rhythm as a semantic factor in the Homeric performance. Richard Martin suggests a new range of performance functions for the Homeric simile. And Gregory Nagy establishes the importance of one feature of epic language, the ellipsis. These six essays centered on Homer engage with fundamental issues that are addressed by three essays primarily concerned with medieval epic: those by Franz BÃƒÂ¤uml on the concept of fact; by Wulf Oesterreicher on types of orality; and by Ursula Schaefer on written and spoken media. In their Introduction the editors highlight the underlying approach and viewpoints of this collaborative volume.Reviews of this book:"Despite its wide range of topics and approaches, the volume has a clear thematic focus. All contributors seek to leave behind the more formal concerns of past generations of scholars and aim instead at an understanding of orality as that which is (conceptually or actually) close, immediate, or performed. In their joint search for the new picture, classicists, linguists, and medievalists discover a range of different 'oralities'."<br>

  Abstract: A negative, pejorative characterization of informal housing areas,

  Abstract: In

By engaging with the contemporary apocalyptic turn in Caribbean studies and lived reality, he not only provides important historical contextualization for a general understanding of apocalypse in the region but also offers an account of the state of Haitian society and culture in the decades before the 2010 earthquake. Inherently interdisciplinary, his work ranges widely through Caribbean and Haitian thought, historiography, political discourse, literature, film, religion, and ecocriticism in its exploration of whether culture in these various forms can shape the future of a country.<br>

The fall of the Berlin Wall seemed to announce the start of the “happy ’90s,” and gave rise to Francis Fukuyama’s utopian idea of the “end of history,” the belief that “liberal democracy had, in principle, won out, that the advent of a global liberal community was hovering around the corner, and that the obstacles to this<br>

Part One inquires into the rhythms of faith as it interacts with themes of uncertainty and doubt, the nature of theological discourse, the task of systematic theology, evangelism and the various ways in which theology is done. Part Two discusses the importance of place in relation to the church, and themes of innovation, undecideability and new forms of monastic community. Part Three addresses themes in discipleship: simplicity, mysticism, the passions and pilgrimage. A red thread connecting these essays is the character of the triune God who is the energy and life in between all things.<br>

Essays by leading scholars ground their discussions of theory and method in richly detailed ethnographic case studies.

Among other things, it explicitly provided for the retention of racial profiling on the part of the police while freeing police departments from having to keep track of the race of the people they arrested or detained. The ballot measure, promoted using liberal, antiracist rhetoric, would have frustrated all attempts to demonstrate discriminatory patterns of surveillance, arrest, or harassment by police.

  Abstract: What does the cross, both as a historical event and a symbol of religious discourse, tell us about human beings? In this provocative book, Brian Gregor draws together a hermeneutics of the self-through Heidegger, Gadamer, Ricoeur, and Taylor-and a theology of the cross-through Luther, Kierkegaard, Bonhoeffer, and Jüngel-to envision a phenomenology of the cruciform self. The result is a bold and original view of what philosophical anthropology could look like if it took the scandal of the cross seriously instead of reducing it into general philosophical concepts.<br>

  Abstract: The purpose of this chapter is to work out two related claims regarding how to think about the fallen self, i.e., the self in sin. First, following on the relational ontology we sketched in the previous chapter, we need to think about sin relationally rather than in terms of substance and accidents. Second, in order to understand sin, we need recourse to figurative discourse. Taking Ricoeur as a point of departure, in the first section we will see why reflection on sin and evil requires a hermeneutics of figurative discourse.

  Book Title: What Is Fiction For?-Literary Humanism Restored<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Harrison Bernard<br>
  Abstract: How can literature, which consists of nothing more than the description of imaginary events and situations, offer any insight into the workings of "human reality" or "the human condition"? Can mere words illuminate something that we call "reality"? Bernard Harrison answers these questions in this profoundly original work that seeks to re-enfranchise reality in the realms of art and discourse. In an ambitious account of the relationship between literature and cognition, he seeks to show how literary fiction, by deploying words against a background of imagined circumstances, allows us to focus on the roots, in social practice, of the meanings by which we represent our world and ourselves. Engaging with philosophers and theorists as diverse as Wittgenstein, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Foucault, Derrida, F. R. Leavis, Cleanth Brooks, and Stanley Fish, and illustrating his ideas through readings of works by Swift, Woolf, Appelfeld, and Dickens, among others, this book presents a systematic defense of humanism in literary studies, and of the study of the Humanities more generally, by a distinguished scholar.<br>

  Publisher: University of Arizona Press<br>
  Author(s): YOUNG PHILIP D.<br>
  Abstract: The Spanish word
      mestizajedoes not easily translate into English. Its meaning and significance have been debated for centuries since colonization by European powers began. Its simplest definition is "mixing." As long as the term has been employed, norms and ideas about racial and cultural relations in the Americas have been imagined, imposed, questioned, rejected, and given new meaning.Mestizaje and Globalizationpresents perspectives on the underlying transformation of identity and power associated with the term during times of great change in the Americas. The volume offers a comprehensive and empirically diverse collection of insights concerning mestizaje's complex relationship with indigeneity, the politics of ethnic identity, transnational social movements, the aesthetic of cultural production, development policies, and capitalist globalization, with particular attention to cases in Latin America and the United States.Beyond the narrow and often inadequate meaning of mestizaje as biological and racial mixing, the concept deserves an innovative theoretical consideration due to its multidimensional, multifaceted character and its resilience as an ideological construct. The contributors argue that historical analyses of mestizaje do not sufficiently understand contemporary ways that racism, ethnic discrimination, and social injustice intermingle with current discourse and practice of cultural recognition and multiculturalism in the Americas.Mestizaje and Globalizationcontributes to an emerging multidisciplinary effort to explore how identities are imposed, negotiated, and reconstructed. The chapter authors clearly set forth the issues and obstacles that Indigenous peoples and subjugated minorities face, as well as the strategies they have employed to gain empowerment in the face of globalization.<br>

The authors provide summaries of ‘Enlightenment’, ‘Romantic’ and ‘Victorian’ anthropology, from the cultural theories of Morgan and Taylor to the often neglected contributions of German scholars. The ambiguous relationship between anthropology and national cultures is also considered. The book provides an unparalleled account of theoretical developments in anthropology from the 1920s to the present, including functionalism, structuralism, hermeneutics, neo-Marxism and discourse analysis. There are brief biographies of major anthropologists and coverage of key debates including totemism, kinship and globalisation.

  Abstract: Trends and fashions come and go in the social sciences, but rarely without leaving something useful behind. From Foucault, we have kept concepts about discourse, power and regimes of knowledge; from Bourdieu, habitus, doxa and forms of capital; from Marxism, a sustained critical interest in power and economics; and from structuralism, the acknowledgement that the human mind functions in a particular way, frequently by way of contrasts. Nonetheless, structuralism, in its original form, is all but forgotten today. Few take up the cues left by 1960s and 1970s Marxism. Neither ethnoscience nor ethnomethodology are read as anything but intellectual history<br>

  Abstract: Unmistakably the recipients of Philippians told their own stories and took initiatives to make major shifts in identity and behavior related to their narratives. Joining a new group with a foreign orientation was the product of a narrative that began with deficiencies, closely related to their social and economic situation, and belonging to the assembly played a major role in surmounting them. But their initiatives are hidden under the initiatives of another—Paul. They are subjects of his discourse rather than spokespersons of their own. Is it possible for them to speak for themselves?<br>

  Book Title: The Hidden God-Luther, Philosophy, and Political Theology<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): MJAALAND MARIUS TIMMANN<br>
  Abstract: In this phenomenological reading of Luther, Marius Timmann Mjaaland shows that theological discourse is never philosophically neutral and always politically loaded. Raising questions concerning the conditions of modern philosophy, religion, and political ideas, Marius Timmann Mjaaland follows a dark thread of thought back to its origin in Martin Luther. Thorough analyses of the genealogy of secularization, the political role of the apocalypse, the topology of the self, and the destruction of metaphysics demonstrate the continuous relevance of this highly subtle thinker.<br>

  Abstract: It may seem an odd thing to think and speak of the influence of Dietrich Bonhoeffer on Karl Barth. Born in 1886, Barth was a half-generation older than Bonhoeffer (born 1906). Bonhoeffer was only twelve years old when Barth published his theological epoch making

Bonhoeffer studied Barth’s work and was influenced by him as a student, such that hisHabilitationsschrift, Act and Being, was written in large part in dialogue with Karl Barth’s work. Even though this work contains critical elements,¹ this criticism should be seen within a shared discourse—a discourse established by Barth into which Bonhoeffer enters.<br>

  Author(s): Jones Jude<br>
  Abstract: The Varieties of Transcendence traces American pragmatist thought on religion and its relevance for theorizing religion today. The volume establishes pragmatist concepts of religious individualization as powerful alternatives to the more common secularization discourse. In stressing the importance of Josiah Royce's work, it emphasizes religious individualism's compatibility with community. At the same time, by covering all of the major classical pragmatist theories of religion, it shows their kinship and common focus on the interrelation between the challenges of contingency and the semiotic significance of transcendence.<br>

  Abstract: When studied carefully, Royce’s mature thought—in general, as well as in the field of his philosophy of religion—has the potential to stimulate interest in ideas that, in a narrowly professionalized discourse, tend to be out of sight today. By learning from James’s explorations of religious experience, and by critically reassessing and redimensioning James’s pragmatism in a “Peirceanized” manner,¹ Royce develops a community-oriented, postdialectically dialectical,² semiotically informed, “reflective” theory of interpretation.

Memory discourse, in particular on the memory of war and its traumas, is often a legitimating instrument in the contest to elaborate who serves as hero and who as traitor during the war and afterward. In post-revolutionary Iran, the onset of the Iran-Iraq War allowed for the articulation of new if shifting parameters for ideological commitment and heroism, as well as treachery or cowardice.

  Abstract: In the early 20th century, movie stars often seemed to offer everything that real men did not. This essay explores how the female cinema audience in Imperial Germany responded to male movie stars and how their emerging movie fandom was linked to the contemporary discourse about nationality, national identity and patriotism during World War I. A telling example for this discussion is the German fan magazine debate about whether or not it was acceptable to “adore” the Norwegian actor Gunnar Tolnaes, who played characters as “foreign” as an Indian maharaja, instead of the German supreme commander, Paul von Hindenburg.<br>

  Book Title: Archaeology and Memory-  Publisher: Oxbow Books<br>
  Author(s): Borić Dušan<br>
  Abstract: Memory can be both a horrifying trauma and an empowering resource. From the Ancient Greeks to Nietzsche and Derrida, the dilemma about the relationship between history and memory has filled many pages, with one important question singled out: is the writing of history to memory a remedy or a poison? Recently, a growing interest in and preoccupation with the issue of memory, remembering and forgetting has resulted in a proliferation of published works, in various disciplines, that have memory as their focus. This trend, to which the present volume contributes, has started to occupy the dominant discourses of disciplines such as sociology, philosophy, history, anthropology and archaeology, and has also disseminated into the wider public discourse of society and culture today. Such a condition may perhaps echo the phenomenon of a melancholic experience at the turn of the millennium. Archaeology and Memory seeks to examine the diversity of mnemonic systems and their significance in different past contexts as well as the epistemological and ontological importance of archaeological practice and narratives in constituting the human historical condition. The twelve substantial contributions in this volume cover a diverse set of regional examples and focus on a range of prehistoric and classical case studies in Eurasian regional contexts as well as on the predicaments of memory in examples of the archaeologies of 'contemporary past'. From the Mesolithic and Neolithic burial chambers to the trenches of World War I and the role of materiality in international criminal courts, a number of contributors examine how people in the past have thought about their own pasts, while others reflect on our own present-day sensibilities in dealing with the material testimonies of recent history. Both kinds of papers offer wider theoretical reflections on materiality, archaeological methodologies and the ethical responsibilities of archaeological narration about the past.<br>

  Abstract: A growing number of professional theologians today seek to push theological inquiry beyond the relative seclusion of academic specialization into a broader marketplace of public ideas, and to recast the theological task as an integrative discipline, wholly engaged with the issues and sensibilities of the age. Accordingly, such scholars seek to draw upon and engage the insights and practices of a variety of cultural resources, including those of the arts, in their theological projects. Arguing that poetry can be a form of theological discourse, Mahan shows how poetry offers rich theological resources and instruction for the Christian church. In drawing attention to the peculiar advantages it affords, this book addresses one of the greatest challenges facing the church today: the difficulty of effectively communicating the Christian gospel with increasingly disaffected late-modern people.<br>

  Abstract: In chapter 4 we sought to understand what the book of Joshua was about as discourse. We asked, ‘What are the concerns of this text and what was it composed to achieve in the kinds of context in which it would have been heard and used ‘originally’?’ But this is not the same as reading Joshua
                  as Christian Scripturetoday, and I suggest that it is within the canonical as well as the contemporary context that Joshua ought to be read by the Christian if it is to be read well today. In very general terms, we saw in chapter<br>

  Author(s) WABEL THOMAS<br>
  Abstract: The adjective “post-metaphysical,” often used in philosophical parlance to describe so-called postmodern construals of God, is ambiguous. It can either be interpreted as an attempt to develop non-metaphysical accounts of God, or it can be understood as an attempt to spell out a post onto-theological God, i.e. a God not construed as a being among beings thought of in a foundationalist manner: as
                  causa suior as a cause that is the cause of itself. It is my impression that many theologians and philosophers of religion have a tendency to identify metaphysical discourse on God with onto-theological discourse on God.<br>

  Abstract: Christian theology, which is discourse about God and things related to God, and divine revelation, which is discourse about God’s self-disclosures from individuals and communities that have come to believe them, possess two distinguishing characteristics: 1) both discourses, almost without exception, are proclamatory and certain, made in the assertive mode;² and 2) both discourses tend to become systematic in nature, due to a joining of faith assertions with philosophic inquiry.<br>

  Abstract: Theological discourse, whether implicitly or explicitly, is in search of some kind of justification. It was because of its contamination by various intellectual heresies, old and new, that often this justificatory practice rather than letting the discourse flow beyond itself, tended to lead it into the fortress of a regulatory concept, practice or institution or a contingent or illusory foundation. But as history so often witnesses, it is precisely when discourse guards itself most securely that it must face the most formidable objection because it loses its ecstatic character, ceasing thus to reflect the overriding feature of its source.<br>

These chronicle his encounter with the covenant theology instilled in the theological understanding of his companions, converts, and antagonists. One indicator of its status as the common currency of theological discourse is Wesley’s confidence that his use of its technical terminology would be understood by his audience.

Such readings lead, inter alia, to an individualistic view of salvation in which the gospel is not freely given, but necessitated because of human sinfulness. I applaud<br>

  Book Title: God's Wounds-Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of the Divine Suffering, Volume 2. Evil and Divine Suffering<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the second volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, vol. 2, Evil and Divine Suffering. The larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, then to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. This second volume of studies proceeds on the basis of the presuppositions of this symbol, those implicit attestations that provide the conditions of possibility for divine suffering-that which constitutes divine vulnerability with respect to creation-as identified and examined in the first volume of this project: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life-the imago Dei as love. The second volume then investigates the first two divine wounds or modes of divine suffering to which the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally attest: (1) divine grief, suffering because of betrayal by the beloved human or human sin; and (2) divine self-sacrifice, suffering for the beloved human in its bondage to sin or misery, to establish the possibility of redemption and reconciliation. Each divine wound, thus, constitutes a response to a creaturely occasion. The suffering in each divine wound also occurs in two stages: a passive stage and an active stage. In divine grief, God suffers because of human sin, betrayal of the divine lover by the beloved human: divine sorrow as the passive stage of divine grief; and divine angui~<br>

  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the first volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Divine Vulnerability and Creation. This study first develops an approach to interpreting the contested claims about the suffering of God. Thus, the larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. Through this approach, this volume of studies into the Christian symbol of divine suffering then investigates the two major presuppositions that the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally hold: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life - the imago Dei as love. When fully elaborated, these presuppositions reveal the conditions of possibility for divine suffering and divine vulnerability with respect to creation.<br>

  Abstract: At the Speed of Light There is Only Illuminationcollects a dozen re-evaluative essays on Marshall McLuhan and his critical and theoretical legacy; from intellectual adventurer creating a complex architecture of ideas to cultural icon standing in line in Woody Allen's Annie Hall. Given McLuhan's prominent status in many academic disciplines, the contributors reflect a multi-disciplinary background. John Moss and Linda Morra chose the essays from a gathering of McLuhan's academic devotees. The contribution - from "McLuhan as Medium" and "McLuhan in Space" to "What McLuhan Got Wrong" and "Trouble in the Global Village" - to provide a kaleidoscope of new views. As Moss writes of the collected essays: "Some are big and some are small, some exegetic and some confessional, some stand as major statements and others are sidelong glances; some resonate with the concerns of public discourse and others are private or privileged or impious and provocative. Each consists of many parts, each a design on its own. They speak to each other…they may have come together as one version of what happened."<br>

Brigitte Bardot may some day be elected to the Collège de France. Simone Signoret is virtually there already. The intellectual is the one in whose discourse the public hears, directly or indirectly, the echo of its ultimate ends. One is an intellectual only on the basis of elective criteria.¹<br>

  Abstract: As discussed in the introduction, a central concern of this book is how to think differently about the American West, to decentralize and dislocate the ways it has so often been considered, even among so-called revisionist writers and scholars, so that we might see westness as part of a larger system of discourse, beyond the national imaginary, pointing in many directions at once. As I have written elsewhere, “The American West is more than geography, it is a complex, unstable signifier that has been given meaning by those who have lived within it, passed through it, conquered it, settled, farmed,<br>

  Abstract: Among the luxury goods traded by the elite during the late Ming and early Qing were actors.¹ Not only individual actors but entire troupes were bestowed on friends, bequeathed to relatives, or sold. Their circulation served to create and maintain networks of social exchange, in much the same manner as did gifts of fine ceramic wares, calligraphic scrolls, and ancient bronzes. The cultural prestige of the actor as a luxury good was, in turn, predicated on a highly refined discourse of connoisseurship, typified by the theater aficionado Pan Zhiheng’s 潘之旦(1556–1622) disquisitions on the art of acting, which were collected<br>

My sense is that every hermeneutical situation has the structure of this quarrel, which is governed by a logic that is by turns exclusionary and allegorical.

  Author(s): Fernández Christian<br>
  Abstract: This edited volume offers new perspectives from leading scholars on the important work of Inca Garcilaso de la Vega (1539-1616), one of the first Latin American writers to present an intellectual analysis of pre-Columbian history and culture and the ensuing colonial period. To the contributors, Inca Garcilaso's
      Royal Commentaries of the Incaspresented an early counter-hegemonic discourse and a reframing of the history of native non-alphabetic cultures that undermined the colonial rhetoric of his time and the geopolitical divisions it purported. Through his research in both Andean and Renaissance archives, Inca Garcilaso sought to connect these divergent cultures into one world.This collection offers five classical studies ofRoyal Commentariespreviously unavailable in English, along with seven new essays that cover topics including Andean memory, historiography, translation, philosophy, trauma, and ethnic identity. This cross-disciplinary volume will be of interest to students and scholars of Latin American history, culture, comparative literature, subaltern studies, and works in translation.<br>

Introducing readers to key thinkers and activists-such as Abu Zaid, a free-thinking Egyptian Qur'an scholar; Abdolkarim Soroush, an academic and former member of Khomeini's Cultural Revolution Committee; and Amina Wadud, an American feminist who was the first woman to lead the faithful in Friday Prayer-Amirpur reveals a powerful yet lesser-known tradition of inquiry and dissent within Islam, one that is committed to democracy and human rights. By examining these and many other similar figures' ideas, she reveals the many ways they reject fundamentalist assertions and instead call for a diversity of opinion, greater freedom, and equality of the sexes.<br>

This interest accounts for the discovery of ethnic and local roots as well as for the construction of common pasts to bind communities and give meaning to their collective fates.

  Abstract: Metaphor and the Slave Tradeprovides compelling evidence of the hidden but unmistakable traces of the transatlantic slave trade that persist in West African discourse. Through an examination of metaphors that describe the trauma, loss, and suffering associated with the commerce in human lives, this book shows how the horrors of slavery are communicated from generation to generation.Laura T. Murphy's insightful new readings of canonical West African fiction, autobiography, drama, and poetry explore the relationship between memory and metaphor and emphasize how repressed or otherwise marginalized memories can be transmitted through images, tropes, rumors, and fears. By analyzing the unique codes through which West Africans have represented the slave trade, this work foregrounds African literary contributions to Black Atlantic discourse and draws attention to the archive that metaphor unlocks for scholars of all disciplines and fields of study.<br>

The combination of culturalist critique, moral judgment, and risk-taking that these activities required and called forth signifies a change in the conceptualization of working and lower class life among male intellectuals in the 1890s, especially among those we associate with what we are calling the “discourse of the abyss.” If the model of the earnest<br>

  Abstract: The Letter to the Romans is, by ancient epistolary standards as well as our own, very long. No wonder the latter chapters have often been neglected.

Some modern scholars have performed the same surgery. More often, commentators have treated Paul’s discourse about the status of Israel in chapters 9–11 as a kind of personal excursus, interesting for insights into Paul’s problems but not of much relevance to ours. The real message<br>

  Abstract: The suppression of some conceptual elements and forms of discourse already found in ancient Jewish circles is characteristic of the rather homogeneous type of rabbinic discourse. Though allowing divergences of opinion and, one may even claim, encouraging, preserving, and studying them for generations, the ancient rabbis nevertheless controlled the nature of the topics on which divergences are allowed. No allegorical or symbolic interpretations of the Bible, abundant as they were in Alexandrian Judaism (especially Philo), were given access to the exegetical methods characteristic of rabbinic literature. Alchemy, astrology, philosophy, and physical sciences remained at the margin of rabbinic discourse. A<br>

  Abstract: Unlike those of us today who wish to study the philosophy of Edmund Husserl, Eugen Fink did not gain his understanding of phenomenology primarily from texts. Whereas we are faced with the massive collection of manuscripts in the Husserl Archives at Louvain and the continuing publication of selections from them in the Husserliana series, Fink listened to Husserl himself, spoke with him, thought with him. It was not the written line of what Plato called “dead discourse” but “the living speech”³ of Husserl’s own teaching that he followed.

  Book Title: Whose Freud?-The Place of Psychoanalysis in Contemporary Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Woloch Alex<br>
  Abstract: One hundred years after the publication of
      The Interpretation of Dreams,Freud remains the most frequently cited author of our culture-and one of the most controversial. To some he is the presiding genius of modernity, to others the author of its symptomatic illnesses. The current position of psychoanalysis is very much at issue. Is it still valid as a theory of the mind? Have its therapeutic applications been rendered obsolete by drugs? Why does it still figure in debates about sexual identity, despite its rejection by many feminists? How does it contribute to cultural analysis?This book offers a new assessment of the status of psychoanalysis as a discipline and a discourse in contemporary culture. It brings together an exceptional group of theorists and practitioners, such partisans and critics of Freud as Frederic Crews, Judith Butler, Leo Bersani, Juliet Mitchell, Robert Jay Lifton, Richard Wollheim, Jonathan Lear, and others.These contributors, who are active in literature, philosophy, film, history, cultural studies, neuroscience, psychotherapy, and other disciplines, debate how psychoanalysis has enriched-and been enriched by-these fields.<br>

If, as I believe, Freudian ideas tell us nothing that is empirically warrantable about the mind but much about the pitfalls of question-begging discourse, then presumably the application of those same ideas to cultural problems will itself run the risk of overconfidence and even circularity.

A historical and comparative overview of related terms – exile, émigré, expatriation, travel, emigration/immigration, diaspora, and nomadism – helps us understand displacement as a dynamic migrant experience that may range from being totally negative to very positive. Exiles are reconciled to their present predicament and have nostalgic feelings for the past; émigrés are actively involved in the contemporary literary process in the homeland and seek to return; emigrants/immigrants integrate and adapt themselves<br>

By contrasting different semiotic perspectives, I contemplate a variety of constituent pseudo-evidences in current discourse on the destiny of the human race, at the dawn of wide scale technical and cultural transformations made possible by the manifest possibility of human cloning in the relative short term. From these pseudo-evidences, the tropes “genetic code” and its “decrypting” appear fundamental to me.<br>

  Book Title: Redescribing the Gospel of Mark-  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Merrill P.<br>
  Abstract: This final volume of studies by members of the Society of Biblical Literature's consultation, and later seminar, on Ancient Myths and Modern Theories of Christian Origins focuses on Mark. As with previous volumes, the provocative proposals on Christian origins offered by Burton L. Mack are tested by applying Jonathan Z. Smith's distinctive social theorizing and comparative method. Essays examine Mark as an author's writing in a book culture, a writing that responded to situations arising out of the first Roman-Judean war after the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 CE. Contributors William E. Arnal, Barry S. Crawford, Burton L. Mack, Christopher R. Matthews, Merrill P. Miller, Jonathan Z. Smith, and Robyn Faith Walsh explore the southern Levant as a plausible provenance of the Gospel of Mark and provide a detailed analysis of the construction of Mark as a narrative composed without access to prior narrative sources about Jesus. A concluding retrospective follows the work of the seminar, its developing discourse and debates, and the continuing work of successor groups in the field.<br>

  Abstract: La presente Tesis estudia las relaciones entre la ciencia y la poesía. Nuestro trabajo aborda el modo en que el conocimiento científico modula la creación literaria, así como algunos de los procedimientos del pensamiento literario. Las hipótesis de investigación reposan sobre dos niveles de la escritura de Lorand Gaspar: la dimensión epistemológica del discurso poético y su valor cognitivo. A partir del análisis de un corpus literario se propone una metodología de estudio que atiende a la complejidad epistemológica y cognitiva de la enunciación poética. Tres apartados teóricos organizan la investigación de algunos de los procesos del pensamiento poético: percepción, emoción y metáfora. Lo anterior se enmarca en una argumentación que favorece la transdisciplinariedad mediante estrategias de análisis literario que integran consideraciones de carácter interdisciplinar.This thesis studies the relations between Science and Poetry. The research approaches the way in which the scientific knowledge modulates the literary creation, as well as some of the procedures of the literary thought. The hypotheses of investigation rest on two levels of Lorand Gaspar’s writing: the epistemological dimension and the cognitive value of the poetic discourse. Based on the analysis of a literary corpus this research proposes a methodology of study that attends to the epistemological and cognitive complexity of the lyrical enunciation. Three theoretical chapters organize the investigation of some of the processes of the poetical thought: Perception, Emotion and Metaphor. This research takes place in an argumentation that favors transdisciplinarity by means of literary analysis strategies, which integrate several considerations of interdisciplinary nature.Cette Thèse s’articule autour des relations entre la poésie et la science.

  Author(s) MARTIN BETTY ANN<br>
  Abstract: Noted anthropologist clifford geertz defines culture as “the ensemble of stories we tell ourselves about ourselves” (448). In keeping with this theory, Fred Inglis suggests that identity is formed through a process whereby we observe and “inhabit the narratives of how to live” available within a given culture (“Culture and Sentiment” 2). Such narratives generally reflect the dominant discourse and accepted range of meanings in relation to socially defined roles. In terms of the negotiated meaning of motherhood, however, there is a growing tension between competing narratives and representations that highlight the juxtaposition between culturally constructed fantasies of maternal perfection<br>

In these films, a mother’s role is clear and unambiguous: to sacrifice herself for the sake of her children—even giving her own life if necessary—so that they could be promoted in social, economic, and cultural ways. However, in the1980s, with the return of democracy in Argentina and Latin America, a break happened in the hegemonic discourse of the stereotypical ideal mother figure (as well as the<br>

I would like to suggest that we are missing a word for the opposite of “crisis.” The trends that we commonly encounter in comparative and global histories are growth, stagnation, stability, and crisis.

Focusing on the twin themes of crisis and innovation, this book aims to illuminate linkages between the two periods, beginning with the representation of cultural politics and the reform of narrative discourse and culminating in the radical heritage bequeathed<br>

Though the core of some of these traditions may go back to the historical Jesus, their final forms are the results of years of hard use by the church that completely reshaped them into the voice of the church.

As with the activities of acquisition and collection, reconstruction is a matter of selection: the curator chooses which film clips will end up in the final restoration print.

The events of 9/11 forced upon us the radical reevaluation of the ways in which we engage in critical discourses. Not that we need to invent new ways of addressing the events around us, because, as Schiller already noted in his letter to Goethe, “everything is already there, so it needs only to be extricated.”<br>

  Abstract: Levinas’s essay “God and Philosophy” is contemporaneous with
                  Otherwise Than Being or Beyond Essenceand develops theological implications of the argument left largely unthematized in what we might call themagnum opusof Levinas II.¹ Levinas sets the God of the Bible over against “the philosophical discourse of the West” and its interpretation of rationality; and he taunts “rational theology” for accepting “vassalage” to philosophy’s claim to be “the amplitude of an all-encompassing structure or of an ultimate comprehension” which “compels every other discourse to justify itself before philosophy” (GP153–54). We are reminded of Heidegger’s critique of onto-theology.<br>

  Author(s) Corigliano Stephanie<br>
  Abstract: In European theological discourse, the various projects of comparative theology often are confronted with two reproaches: first, that they are not distinguishable from a pluralistic theology of religions,¹ and second, that they are not distinguishable from some types of religious studies.² The interesting point is that both assertions are traceable to the same fundamental critique, even if they obviously diverge in its specific interpretation. This criticism addresses the apparent relativization of Christology as the dogmatic normative core of all Christian theology. Confronting this objection against the comparative projects, in the first part of the paper I will address comparative and<br>

                  The Future of an Illusion(1927), religion is akin to an obsessional neurosis of childhood; just as children may be hoped (and helped) to outgrow their neuroses, so too might humankind overcome the obsessional neurosis that is religion.¹ A few sentences later in the same text, Freud is even less sparing, and religion approaches the level of<br>

  Abstract: Taking on himself the oppositions that generate the discourse of literary history, Hart Crane assumes a sacrificial role in American poetry. Just as Emily Dickinson dissects Christian and transcendental poetics, Crane plays against each other his two major influences—an Eliotic formalism with its roots in French Symbolism, and a Whitmanic organicism.¹ Crane has been repeatedly judged a failure on the grounds that his Symbolist and Whitmanic visions are incompatible; less often, he has been defended on the same grounds. For example, Sherman Paul sees that the “‘confusion’ in Crane’s work is not inadvertent, as Tate and others believe, but<br>

  Abstract: In Plato’s

Untethered words wander around aimlessly, whence we get our concept of ambiguity or the waywardness of discourse. However, the tying down of one’s words is not easy. In fact, sometimes Socrates makes it sound like the question is all that can be justifiably put into words. For the rest one should keep silent, or speak only in the most guarded fashion, darkly, and then perhaps only of<br>

  Book Title: Norms of Rhetorical Culture-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Farrell Thomas B.<br>
  Abstract: Rhetoric is widely regarded by both its detractors and advocates as a kind of antithesis to reason. In this book Thomas B. Farrell restores rhetoric as an art of practical reason and enlightened civic participation, grounding it in its classical tradition-particularly in the rhetoric of Aristotle. And, because prevailing modernist world views bear principal responsibility for the disparagement of rhetorical tradition, Farrell also offers a critique of the dominant currents of modern humanist thought.Farrell argues that rhetoric is not antithetical to reason but is a manner of posing and answering questions that is distinct from the approaches of analytic and dialectical reason. He develops this position in a number of ways: through a series of bold reinterpretations of Aristotle's
      Rhetoric; through a detailed appraisal of traditional rhetorical concepts as seen in modern texts from the Army-McCarthy hearings to Edward Kennedy's memorial for his brother, Mario Cuomo's address on abortion, Betty Friedan'sFeminine Mystique, and Vaclav Havel's inaugural address; and through a fresh appraisal of theories on the character of language and discourse found in contemporary philosophy, literary criticism, anthropology, deconstructionism, Marxism, and especially in Habermas's critical theory of communicative action.<br>

  Abstract: Nobody admits to liking rhetoric very much. But almost everyone admits to having occasionally been seized and transported by a discourse which changed or influenced their life and priorities. It is a commonplace that such discourse is rare, the exception that proves our (usually untested) rule. But all practices need to have outstanding exemplars, touchstones of accomplishment. And virtually by definition, such outstanding cases will be rare. It is probably not possible to determine whether great or eloquent rhetoric is rarer now than it was in the various golden ages of the past. Nor do I think that the determination,<br>

  Book Title: The Cinema of the Soviet Thaw-Space, Materiality, Movement<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oukaderova Lida<br>
  Abstract: Following Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, the Soviet Union experienced a dramatic resurgence in cinematic production. The period of the Soviet Thaw became known for its relative political and cultural liberalization; its films, formally innovative and socially engaged, were swept to the center of international cinematic discourse. In The Cinema of the Soviet Thaw, Lida Oukaderova provides an in-depth analysis of several Soviet films made between 1958 and 1967 to argue for the centrality of space-as both filmic trope and social concern-to Thaw-era cinema. Opening with a discussion of the USSR's little-examined late-fifties embrace of panoramic cinema, the book pursues close readings of films by Mikhail Kalatozov, Georgii Danelia, Larisa Shepitko and Kira Muratova, among others. It demonstrates that these directors' works were motivated by an urge to interrogate and reanimate spatial experience, and through this project to probe critical issues of ideology, social progress, and subjectivity within post-Stalinist culture.<br>

  Book Title: Blood in the Sand-Imperial Fantasies, Right-Wing Ambitions, and the Erosion of American Democracy<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Bronner Stephen Eric<br>
  Abstract: Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, clouds of ash blackened the skies over New York City, Washington, D.C., and rural Pennsylvania. In the wake of the destruction, the United States seemingly entered a new era marked by radical changes in the nation's discourse and in the policies of the Bush administration. With the toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the invasion of Iraq, and saber rattling elsewhere, America's global war on terror began to take shape. Lofty rhetoric about expanding democracy and defending freedom filled the halls of elite power and dominated mainstream media coverage of American politics. Blood in the Sand offers both an incisive analysis and a confrontational critique of America's recent international pursuits and its dominant political culture. Stephen Eric Bronner challenges the notion that everything changed in the aftermath of 9/11. He shows instead how a criminal act served to legitimize political manipulation and invigorate traditional nationalistic enthusiasms for militarism and imperial expansion. Employing his own experiences in the Middle East, Bronner acknowledges -- but refuses to overstate -- recent progressive developments in the region. He criticizes the neo-conservative penchant for unilateral military aggression and debunks the dubious notion of fostering democracy at gunpoint. While Bronner analyzes authoritarian repression, human rights violations, shrinking civil liberties, and severe socioeconomic inequalities, Blood in the Sand is neither a narrow political diatribe nor a futile exercise in anti-American negativism. The author honors America by condemning the betrayal of the nation's finest ideals by so many of those who, hypocritically or naively, invoke those ideals the most. Bronner sheds new light on those who insist on publicly waving the flag while privately subverting that for which it stands. Blood in the Sand sounds a clarion call for revitalizing the American polity and reshaping foreign policy along ~<br>

  Author(s): Shain Yossi<br>
  Abstract: Only recently have international relations scholars started to seriously examine the influence of collective memory on foreign policy formation and relations between states and peoples. The ways in which the memories of past events are interpreted, misinterpreted, or even manipulated in public discourse create the context that shapes international relations.
      Power and the Pastbrings together leading history and international relations scholars to provide a groundbreaking examination of the impact of collective memory. This timely study makes a contribution to developing a theory of memory and international relations and also examines specific cases of collective memory's influence resulting from the legacies of World War II, the Holocaust, and September 11. Addressing concerns shared by world leaders and international institutions as well as scholars of international studies, this volume illustrates clearly how the memory of past events alters the ways countries interact in the present, how memory shapes public debate and policymaking, and how memory may aid or more frequently impede conflict resolution.<br>

  Book Title: Theology and the Boundary Discourse of Human Rights-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): REGAN ETHNA<br>
  Abstract: What are human rights? Can theology acknowledge human rights discourse? Is theological engagement with human rights justified? What place should this discourse occupy within ethics? Ethna Regan seeks to answer these questions about human rights, Christian theology, and philosophical ethics. The main purpose of this book is to justify and explore theological engagement with human rights. Regan illustrates how that engagement is both ecumenical and diverse, citing the emerging engagement with human rights discourse by evangelical theologians in response to the War on Terror. The book examines where the themes and concerns of key modern theologians-Karl Rahner, J. B. Metz, Jon Sobrino, and Ignacio Ellacuría-converge with the themes and concerns of those committed to the advancement of human rights. Regan also critically engages with the "disdain" for rights discourse that is found in the postliberal critiques of John Milbank and Stanley Hauerwas.

  Book Title: Telling Stories-Language, Narrative, and Social Life<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nylund Anastasia<br>
  Abstract: Narratives are fundamental to our lives: we dream, plan, complain, endorse, entertain, teach, learn, and reminisce through telling stories. They provide hopes, enhance or mitigate disappointments, challenge or support moral order and test out theories of the world at both personal and communal levels. It is because of this deep embedding of narrative in everyday life that its study has become a wide research field including disciplines as diverse as linguistics, literary theory, folklore, clinical psychology, cognitive and developmental psychology, anthropology, sociology, and history. In
      Telling Storiesleading scholars illustrate how narratives build bridges among language, identity, interaction, society, and culture; and they investigate various settings such as therapeutic and medical encounters, educational environments, politics, media, marketing, and public relations. They analyze a variety of topics from the narrative construction of self and identity to the telling of stories in different media and the roles that small and big life stories play in everyday social interactions and institutions. These new reflections on the theory and analysis of narrative offer the latest tools to researchers in the fields of discourse analysis and sociolinguistics.<br>

  Abstract: ANIME IS A STYLE OF ANIMATION, commonly referred to as Japanese animation, that is popular not only in Japan but around the world. This popularity is in part due to the intriguing stories and the interesting roles played by anime characters. Using a discourse-based microanalysis, this chapter examines the role of speech styles in the context of storytelling, especially focusing on the role of style shifting in Japanese. Using anime as data, I attempt to show how people choose certain linguistic resources to present various images of themselves or others to fulfill various communicative goals.

  Abstract: If historically the line between fiction and philosophy has often been blurred—as Plato’s dialogues, Nietzsche’s aphorisms, and the twentieth-century proliferation of existentialist literature in a number of genres all attest—this is especially true in the case of African American philosophy, which by necessity in America has had its roots in nonacademic forms of writing. As John P. Pittman points out in
                  African American Perspectives and Philosophical Traditions(1997), to define philosophy only in terms of a specialist discourse is to leave out “an entire world of intellectual life, and for traditionally excluded groups, any ‘representation’ at all” (xii).<br>

  Author(s): DOR GEORGE WORLASI KWASI<br>
  Abstract: In the first-ever ethnographic study of West African drumming and dance in North American universities the author documents and acknowledges ethnomusicologists, ensemble directors, students, administrators, and academic institutions for their key roles in the histories of their respective ensembles. Dor collates and shares perspectives including debates on pedagogical approaches that may be instructive as models for both current and future ensemble directors and reveals the multiple impacts that participation in an ensemble or class offers students. He also examines the interplay among historically situated structures and systems, discourse, and practice, and explores the multiple meanings that individuals and various groups of people construct from this campus activity. The study will be of value to students, directors, and scholars as an ethnographic study and as a text for teaching relevant courses in African music, African studies, ethnomusicology/world music, African diaspora studies, and other related disciplines.<br>

  Abstract: Economic and political ideology stubbornly assume center-stage thematic positions in discourse on globalization. Accordingly, it is not surprising when a student who walks into my world music class after leaving a class discussion on the global economy at an International Studies Institute, for example, challenges his world music teacher (myself) for “falsely claiming” globalization for the domain of music cultures. Certainly, such may not be the reaction of students from cultural studies, diaspora studies, ethnomusicology, anthropology, and other culture-related cognate disciplines.

  Book Title: Troubling Natural Categories-Engaging the Medical Anthropology of Margaret Lock<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KIELMANN KARINA<br>
  Abstract: Where do our conventional understandings of health, illness, and the body stem from? What makes them authoritative? How are the boundaries set around these areas of life unsettled in the changing historical and political contexts of science, technology, and health care delivery? These questions are at the heart of Troubling Natural Categories, a collection of essays honouring the tradition of Margaret Lock, one of the preeminent medical anthropologists of our time. Throughout her career, Lock has investigated how medicine sets boundaries around what is deemed "normal" and "natural," and how, in turn, these ideas shape our technical and moral understandings of life, sickness, and death. In this book, nine established medical anthropologists - all former students of Lock - critically engage with her work, offering ethnographic and historical analyses that problematize taken-for-granted constructs in health and medicine in a range of global settings. The essays elaborate cutting-edge themes within medical anthropology, including the often disturbing, inherently political nature of biomedicine and biotechnology, the medicalization of mental health processes, and the formation of uniquely "local biologies" through the convergence of bodily experience, scientific discourse, and new technologies of care. Troubling Natural Categories not only affirms Margaret Lock's place at the forefront of scholarship but, with these essays, carves out new intellectual directions in the medical social sciences. Contributors include Sean Brotherton, Vinh-Kim Nguyen, Junko Kitanaka, Stephanie Lloyd, Dominique Behague, and Annette Leibing.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, I describe pluralism as an approach to securing legitimacy for laws that govern democracies. While I assume that no other approach is acceptable, and that pluralism is a prerequisite for democracy, I argue first that pluralism has a problem. I also argue that the most promising attempt to resolve this problem – Habermas’s theory of discourse – fails to do so. To conclude, I suggest that another Habermasian term – truthfulness – might be developed in a way that addresses the problem of pluralism.<br>

  Abstract: As the preceding chapters show, this study of community must remain in the interrogative. Attempts to draw clear-cut conclusions on community would result in a discursive stasis, whereby the larger context of modernity and postmodernity—as late modernity or an intensification of the tensions between discourse and practice that characterise modernity—would be lost. The notion of community in postmodern Spain can be seen to be foregrounded in political and cultural contexts over emphases on nation or state. Nevertheless, community is itself a problematic concept: necessarily fluid in order to survive in current contexts, yet loaded with the fixed structures<br>

  Book Title: Rhetoric and Hermeneutics in Our Time-A Reader<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hyde Michael J.<br>
  Abstract: This thought-provoking book initiates a dialogue among scholars in rhetoric and hermeneutics in many areas of the humanities. Twenty leading thinkers explore the ways these two powerful disciplines inform each other and influence a wide variety of intellectual fields. Walter Jost and Michael J. Hyde organize pivotal topics in rhetoric and hermeneutics with originality and coherence, dividing their book into four sections: Locating the Disciplines; Inventions and Applications; Arguments and Narratives; and Civic Discourse and Critical Theory.Contributors to this volume include Hans-Georg Gadamer (one of whose pieces is here translated into English for the first time), Paul Ricoeur, Gerald L. Bruns, Charles Altieri, Richard E. Palmer, Calvin O. Schrag,.Victoria Kahn, Eugene Garver, Michael Leff, Nancy S. Streuver, Wendy Olmsted, David Tracy, Donald G. Marshall, Allen Scult, Rita Copeland, William Rehg, and Steven Mailloux.For readers across the humanities, the book demonstrates the usefulness of rhetorical and hermeneutic approaches in literary, philosophical, legal, religious, and political thinking. With its stimulating new perspectives on the revival and interrelation of both rhetoric and hermeneutics, this collection is sure to serve as a benchmark for years to come.<br>

  Author(s) Mailloux Steven<br>
  Abstract: It is well known that late medieval literary theory owes much to Aquinas’s reconciliation of human rhetoric with the divine revelation of truth in the text of Scripture. Aquinas and those theorists who followed his method accomplished this rapprochement by redrawing the boundaries between the literal and the spiritual senses of Scripture and assimilating rhetorical language to the literal sense. Aquinas’s critical move has been much studied for its impact on the exegetical theory and practice of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, especially for its new emphasis on the contributions of human authors to Scriptural discourse.

  Abstract: For a long time, the historical precedence of the Bible vis-à-vis the Qurʾan polarized the question of their interrelationship, reducing it solely to influence and borrowing, or even, in the case of extreme polemics, to plagiarism and parody. And yet, a simple shift in perspective allows us to view the question in a completely different light. In fact, the Qurʾanic text elaborates a discourse on its own status as scripture and on its relation to previous revelations. By starting with what the Qurʾan says about scriptural context, we find a whole universe of thought opening up to us, one that<br>

  Book Title: Aliens and Sojourners-Self as Other in Early Christianity<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DUNNING BENJAMIN H.<br>
  Abstract: Early Christians spoke about themselves as resident aliens, strangers, and sojourners, asserting that otherness is a fundamental part of being Christian. But why did they do so and to what ends? How did Christians' claims to foreign status situate them with respect to each other and to the larger Roman world as the new movement grew and struggled to make sense of its own boundaries?
      Aliens and Sojournersargues that the claim to alien status is not a transparent one. Instead, Benjamin Dunning contends, it shaped a rich, pervasive, variegated discourse of identity in early Christianity. Resident aliens and foreigners had long occupied a conflicted space of both repulsion and desire in ancient thinking. Dunning demonstrates how Christians and others in antiquity capitalized on this tension, refiguring the resident alien as being of a compelling doubleness, simultaneously marginal and potent. Early Christians, he argues, used this refiguration to render Christian identity legible, distinct, and even desirable among the vast range of social and religious identities and practices that proliferated in the ancient Mediterranean. Through close readings of ancient Christian texts such as Hebrews, 1 Peter, theShepherd of Hermas, and theEpistle to Diognetus, Dunning examines the markedly different ways that Christians used the language of their own marginality, articulating a range of options for what it means to be Christian in relation to the Roman social order. His conclusions have implications not only for the study of late antiquity but also for understanding the rhetorics of religious alienation more broadly, both in the ancient world and today.<br>

  Abstract: Not all early Christians thought that speaking about themselves as aliens was a good thing. While numerous texts of the first and second centuries were making exactly this move (as evidenced by our analysis thus far), this was not the only conceptual option available to Christians as they thought about their identity and what its legitimate relationship ought to be to the rhetoric of alienation. Thus there were (perhaps not surprisingly) voices of protest to the increasingly common strategy of constructing the Christian self as other. These voices were not separate or outside the contested discourse of formative Christian identity,<br>

The memory discourse is quickly expanding. There is a growing number of different approaches to cultural memory which exist side by side without taking much notice of one another, let alone engage in a discussion of their various underlying axioms and goals.

  Book Title: The Sacredness of the Person-A New Genealogy of Human Rights<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Skinner Alex<br>
  Abstract: According to Joas, every single human being has increasingly been viewed as sacred. He discusses the abolition of torture and slavery, once common practice in the pre-18th century west, as two milestones in modern human history. The author concludes by portraying the emergence of the UN Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 as a successful process of value generalization. Joas demonstrates that the history of human rights cannot adequately be described as a history of ideas or as legal history, but as a complex transformation in which diverse cultural traditions had to be articulated, legally codified, and assimilated into practices of everyday life. The sacralization of the person and universal human rights will only be secure in the future, warns Joas, through continued support by institutions and society, vigorous discourse in their defense, and their incarnation in everyday life and practice.<br>

  Abstract: Fraleigh's brilliantly inventive fusions of philosophy and movement clarify often complex philosophical issues and apply them to dance history and aesthetics. She illustrates her discussions with photographs, dance descriptions, and stories from her own past in order to bridge dance with everyday movement. Seeking to recombine the fractured and bifurcated conceptions of the body and of the senses that dominate much Western discourse, she reveals how metaphysical concepts are embodied and presented in dance, both on stage and in therapeutic settings.<br>

  Abstract: Most pedagogical discourse in the 1990s revolved around critical pedagogies that generally mirror James Berlin’s image of social-epistemic rhetoric. While much other work was done in the period, it inevitably evoked the social-epistemic question: does this pedagogy seek to produce the proper political subject and corresponding critical text? The emergence of technological contexts in the middle and later 1990s changed the landscape in which this question would arise. The Internet opened the way for completely new social and pedagogical contexts. Much critical pedagogy began to focus on media literacy as decoding the dominant political assumptions and values in films and<br>

  Abstract: In the 1970s two well-known French philosophers clashed swords. Their

As we have seen, Paul Ricoeur argues convincingly inLa Métaphore vivethat metaphor is a cognitive tool, that it helps in certain circumstances to articulate our experience of the world. Ricoeur’s analysis is anchored to the established phenomenological precepts of Kant and Husserl, for in order that metaphor may refer, its transgressive character must ultimately be tamed by the master discourse of philosophy. However, according to Jacques Derrida’s deconstructive practice, the philosopher’s discourse is itself shot through with metaphor. It<br>

  Abstract: In the discourse of cultural theory it seems that there is considerable confusion, or at least deep ambivalence, concerning the status and function of maps and mapping. In this context it is important to note that mapping tends to be treated by cultural theorists less in terms of its specific histories and methodological principles than as a set of concepts that are often employed in explicitly metaphorical ways – ‘mapping’, then, rather than strict cartography. On the one hand, there is a tendency to equate mapping with the apparatuses of the state and of social control, as a sort of graphic<br>

  Abstract: This chapter examines the degree to which Northern Irish poets can establish an authorial presence in their texts and how authoritative they feel when, ‘mired in attachment’,¹ they write about politically sensitive issues. Since a quotation establishes a gap between the quoting text and what is quoted, its effect on the poet’s authoritative voice is ambiguous: even if a quotation is used as an embellishment, ‘a mere appendage to the main discourse’, it is also ‘paradoxically privileged, as it appears as a stylistic exemplum’.² Similarly, if the citation is used as

  Abstract: Anything (material or nonmaterial) can be the object of our awareness, attention, or questioning mind. Whenever we ask “what is this?” we enter into an inquiring frame of mind. When we research something, we formalize this intuitive process to establish a definition for qualitative discourse or quantitative testing. We define the thing we seek to know more about. Then we have a basis for communicating the findings. The results of the research will rest on our basic understanding and definition of the thing we are investigating.

Because natural philosophy allowed its practitioners, in the words of Isaac Newton, to discourse about God “from the appearances of things,” one searches almost in vain for references to “natural philosophy and religion.” Some writers expressed concern about tension between faith and reason, but they never pitted religion against science.¹<br>

  Abstract: Gustav Gustavovich Shpet is re-emerging as a major figure in twentieth-century intellectual history. As the person who introduced Russia to phenomenology, he has had a powerful impact on a wide range of intellectual debates in Russia and beyond. This impact, however, was ignored or consciously downplayed in the USSR. Starting in the 1930s, Shpet became largely invisible in official Soviet scholarly discourse, a tendency that was only exacerbated during the decades after his execution in 1937.

But life writing also plays a part in the making of what I call “companionable objects”—those things with which we have ethical and affective ties.

  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Folkart Barbara<br>
  Abstract: When Hermes handed over to Apollo his finest invention, the lyre, in exchange for promotion to the status of messenger of the gods, he relinquished the creativity that gave life to his words.The trade-off proved frustrating: Hermes chafed under the obligation to deliver the ideas and words of others and resorted to all manner of ruses in order to assert his presence in the messages he transmitted. His theorizing descendants, too, allow their pretentions to creatorship to interfere with the actual business of reinventing originals in another language.Just as the Hermes of old delighted in leading the traveller astray, so his descendants lead their acolytes, through thickets of jargon, into labyrinths of eloquence without substance.Charles Le Blanc possesses the philosophical tools to dismantle this empty eloquence: he exposes the inconsistencies, internal contradictions, misreadings, and misunderstandings rife in so much of the current academic discourse en translation, and traces the failings of this discourse back to its roots in the anguish of having traded authentic creativity for mere status.<br>

Yet it is not required that anyone listen to him. Indeed, no one pays attention to the chief’s word … and he, in fact, says nothing…. The discourse of the chief is empty precisely because he is separated from power. The chief must move in the element of the word, which is to say, at the opposite pole<br>

  Abstract: THE MEANING of the term “intelligentsia” was far from immutable between the 1890s and the 1920s. Tracing developments in the revolutionary discourse over a span of three decades, I would like, in the present chapter, to sketch a brief history of “the intelligentsia” in Russian Marxism. Such a history, however, is not susceptible to straightforward chronological presentation. Notions do not develop in the same way biographies do. The main events in the history of notions cannot be precisely defined, let alone dated. Thus, new definitions of the intelligentsia did not simply coincide with the familiar milestones in the history of<br>

  Author(s) WHEELER WENDY<br>
  Abstract: The Russian theorist Mikhail Bakhtin (1895–1975) provides a valuable set of tools for ecocritical analysis and a method of approaching literary works and their interrelationship with the material world. Bakhtin’s attitude toward language positions him in opposition to Ferdinand de Saussure and Saussurean linguistics. Instead, he can be aligned with his contemporary, Émile Benveniste, as well as current linguists such as George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, who have emphasized discourse over language. This emphasis leads to seeing speaking and writing as individual acts undertaken at particular moments in specific configurations of the world. That recognition of immersion leads to<br>

  Abstract: A further question about self-accounts that is worth raising concerns the importance of narrative discourse for self-accounts. This question takes two forms. The first and more particular form is whether or not giving a self-account requires narrative. Does the act of telling you who I am and narrative discourse have a natural or necessary interdependence? The second form of the question, which arises from the first, is the cultural standing of narrated self-accounts. Are they, for example, specific to our own culture, or can they be thought of as constituting a more general human phenomenon?<br>

  Book Title: Locating the Destitute-Space and Identity in Caribbean Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): Radović Stanka<br>
  Abstract: While postcolonial discourse in the Caribbean has drawn attention to colonialism's impact on space and spatial hierarchy, Stanka Radović asks both how ordinary people as "users" of space have been excluded from active and autonomous participation in shaping their daily spatial reality and how they challenge this exclusion. In a comparative interdisciplinary reading of anglophone and francophone Caribbean literature and contemporary spatial theory, she focuses on the house as a literary figure and the ways that fiction and acts of storytelling resist the oppressive hierarchies of colonial and neocolonial domination. The author engages with the theories of Henri Lefebvre, Michel Foucault, and contemporary critical geographers, in addition to selected fiction by V. S. Naipaul, Patrick Chamoiseau, Beryl Gilroy, and Rafaël Confiant, to examine the novelists' construction of narrative "houses" to reclaim not only actual or imaginary places but also the very conditions of self-representation.<br>

  Book Title: Essays from the Edge-Parerga and Paralipomena<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): JAY MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Over his distinguished career as a European intellectual historian and cultural critic, Martin Jay has explored a variety of major themes: the Frankfurt School, the exile of German intellectuals in America during the Nazi era, Western Marxism, the denigration of vision in twentieth-century French thought, the discourse of experience in modern Europe and America, and lying in politics.
         Essays from the Edgeassembles Jay's writings from the intersections of this intellectual journey. Several essays focus on methodological debates in the humanities and social sciences: the limits of interdisciplinarity, the issue of national or universal philosophy, cultural relativism and visuality, and the implications of periodization in historical narrative. Others examine the concept of "scopic regime" and the metaphors of revolution and the gardening impulse. Among the theorists treated at length are Theodor Adorno, Hannah Arendt, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault. The essays also include several of Jay'sSalmagundicolumns, dealing with subjects as varied as the new Museum of Modern Art in New York, the impact of Colin Wilson's The Outsider, and the demise of thePartisan Review.<br>

Similarly, Cook shows that love poetry proceeds out of a profound failure of language resulting from the opacity of discourse, its lack of neutrality, or the fugitive transparency of reference. Writing Lovers also explores race, ethnicity, age, and sexual identity within the context of the passionate excesses of amatory discourse.<br>

In this sense, the cultural and social are two sides of a common history.

Clowes examines the technical innovations meta-utopian writers have made in style, image, and narrative structure that inform fresh modes of social imagination. Her analysis leads to an inquiry into the intended and real audiences of this fiction, and into the ways its authors try to move them toward more sophisticated social discourse.<br>

  Abstract: Where does meta-utopian narrative stand in the general crisis of social imagination and the parallel crisis of representational aesthetics? Born in isolation, Russian meta-utopian fiction is certainly not an isolated phenomenon. It parallels the renewed attention to language, semiotic play, and narrative structure that has figured so importantly in the West in opening up new insight into ideological structures. Its challenge to maximalist, bipolar thinking and its argument for the middle ground makes meta-utopian fiction very much of a piece with current social, literary, and philosophical discourse.

  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Goodheart Eugene<br>
  Abstract: Eugene Goodheart examines the skeptic disposition that has informed advanced literary discourse over the past generation, arguing that the targets of deconstructive suspicion are fundamental humanistic values. "[This book] is a fair-minded, generous critique of the deconstructionist theories of Jacques Derrida, Paul de Man, and their followers. These writers have argued that language is so inherently slippery it can never express a speaker's intended meaning. The critic's role, in their view, is to explore the contradictions, subtexts, and metaphorical byways of works that may be most radically deceptive when they appear simple. Critics have castigated this language-centered skepticism as a form of nihilism geared to multiply numbingly similar readings of already familiar texts. Mr. Goodheart's objection is more subtle. He suggests that the philosophical orientation of deconstructive critics leads them to overemphasize the tricky propositional sense of words at the expense of the broader impact of literature--its power to wound, thrill, or transform us."--Morris Dickstein, The New York Times Book Review<br>

Yet the very need to insist upon so categorical a disjunction reveals that contamination is always possible, that the chasm may prove only a threshold, a shifting margin habitually traversed by the discourse of any text. There is a sense in which the poetics Mallarmé sought was haunted at its very inception by what it would most deny, by the inherent availability of language to the public rhetoric of “les journaux.”<br>

  Abstract: Robert Nozick's
                  Anarchy, State, and Utopia(1974), along with John Rawls’sA Theroy of Justice(1971), radically changed the landscape in analytic political philosophy. For much of the preceding half-century, under the influence of logical heavy emphasis on empirical verifiability, much of moral philosophy was taken up with metaethics (e.g. the semantics of moral discourse), with little attention given to normative moral theories. Moreover, to the extent that normative theories were considered, utilitarianism was the centre of attention. This all changed with the publication of Rawls’s articulation and defence of liberal egalitarianism and Nozick’s libertarian challenge to the legitimacy of<br>

  REFLECTIONS ON THE HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SYMBIOSIS from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvsxn">Between Muslim and Jew</a><br>
  Abstract: The late Shlomo Dov (Fritz) Goitcin (1900–1985) characterized the central relationship of Jews with Muslims in the first centuries of Islam as one of “creative symbiosis.” This usage has been institutionalized in the study of Judeo-Arabica, and shows no immediate signs of being dislodged from its preeminence.¹ The concept
                  symbiosiswas first transposed from biology to the study of Jewish history by German Jewish intellectuals. Its most salient usage was in reference to their own cultural situation.² Alex Bein’s influential study, “Discourse on the Term ‘German-Jewish Symbiosis,’” appeared at that time, as an appendix to his essay (revealingly enough)<br>

  Abstract: The essays, each demonstrating anthropology's profound influence on this important cultural movement, are organized according to discourse type: from the comparativist text of Frazer, to the ethnographies of Boas, Benedict, Mead, and Hurston, and on to the surrealist experiments of the College de Sociologie. Meanwhile the book's orientation shifts from essays that approach anthropology from the vantage points of literariness and textual power to those that contemplate what bearing the junction of cultural theory and anthropology can have upon present and future social institutions.<br>

  Abstract: Born in Minden, Westphalia, in 1858, Franz Boas was clearly an extraordinary figure, not only a teacher, but a

Boas published extensively on linguistics, on folklore, art, race, and, of course, ethnography, a fabled “five foot shelf,” of materials on the Kwakiutl. Yet Boas did not, like his contemporaries Sigmund Freud and Ferdinand de Saussure, found what Foucault refers to as a field of discursivity, a written discourse that gives rise to the endless possibility of further discourse,<br>

  Abstract: In the course of discussing the concept of historical interpretation in the opening chapter, I quoted R. G. Collingwood on the proper way to understand “what a man means.” This phrase was conventional in 1939, the publication date of Collingwood’s book. This nuance of his discourse helps to date him by placing him within a set of conventions about gender. Such conventions have changed so much in the ensuing fifty years that if an Oxford professor of philosophy were to use this phrase today in a similar context, it would seem pointed.<br>

  Abstract: The purpose of this chapter is to analyze morality and ethics in cinema. This analysis is based on the assumption that morality and ethics are discourses of conduct and character. Moral discourse concerns itself with the appropriateness of conduct and action relative to situations. Rather than prevent changes in conduct and character, morality (at least in its cinematic forms) aims to control their flow and regulate their transformation (see Deleuze 1992 on control). The extent and effectiveness of these efforts can be recognized in the regularities of movement they produce. Ethics also involves movement and change, but it is concerned<br>

On the whole, the revolutionary ideologies expressed values that were far from liberal; thus they provided fertile ground for the emergence of the intellectuals. TheDéclaration des droits de I’homme et du citoyen(1789) together with the writings of Sieyès, who is quite representative of his time, and the discourse of the Jacobins, show a convergence of ideas that share a perception of reason and its function in the workings of society.<br>

  Abstract: Exploring Polanyi's lesser-known works as well as The Great Transformation, Baum provides a more complete and nuanced understanding of Polanyi's thought. He examines Polanyi's interpretation of modern economic and social history, clarifies the ethical presuppositions present in Polanyi's work, and addresses how Polanyi's understanding of the relation between ethics and economics touches on many issues relevant to the contemporary debate about the world's economic future. Baum argues that we should look to Polanyi's understanding of modern capitalism to reinstate the social discourse and, in political practice, the principles of reciprocity and solidarity. He points to examples, both in Canada and abroad, of attempts to formulate alternative models of economic development and to create new forms of institutional and cultural intervention.<br>

Bell addresses the problems inherent in the term aphorism, the narrative and discourse function of aphorism within the genre of the novel, the interrelation between the structure of aphorism and the epistemological and hermeneutical functions this sub-genre may perform as a component part of the narrative fabric, the "national" character of aphoristics, and the problems that arise from "anthologizing" a novel's aphorisms.<br>

  Abstract: It is not surprising that Antoine de Saint-Exupéry would demonstrate a penchant for aphoristic discourse, in light of his early attraction to Nietzsche and his lifelong admiration for Pascal. Whether it is a question of influence or simple affinity matters little for our purposes here; suffice it to say that we are often reminded of the sententiousaphoristic style of these two predecessors as we read Saint-Exupéry’s text. The most clear-cut manifestation of the style in question occurs in Saint-Exupéry’s highly aphoristic

  Book Title: Diasporic Feminist Theology-Asia and Theopolitical Imagination<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Kang Namsoon<br>
  Abstract: How do we navigate the question of identity in the fluid and pluralist conditions of postmodern society? Even more, how do we articulate identity as a defining particularity in the disappearance of borders, boundaries, and spaces in an increasingly globalist world? What constitutes identity and the formation of narratives under such conditions? How do these issues affect not only discursive practices, but theological and ethical construction and practice? This volumes explores these issues in depth. Diasporic Feminist Theology attempts to construct feminist theology by adopting diaspora as a theopolitical and ethical metaphor. Namsoon Kang here revisits and reexamines today’s significant issues such as identity politics, dislocation, postmodernism, postcolonialism, neoempire, Asian values, and constructs diasporic, transethnic, and glocal feminist theological discourses that create spaces of transformation, reconciliation, hospitality, worldliness, solidarity, and border-traversing. This work draws on diverse sources from contemporary critical discourses of diaspora studies, cultural studies, ethnic studies, postmodernism, postcolonialism, and feminism and feminist theology from a transterritorial space. This book is a landmark work, providing a comprehensive discourse for feminist theology today.<br>

  Book Title: The Sense of the Universe-Philosophical Explication of Theological Commitment in Modern Cosmology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Nesteruk Alexei V.<br>
  Abstract: The Sense of the Universe deals with existential and phenomenological reflection upon modern cosmology with the aim to reveal hidden theological commitments in cosmology related to the mystery of human existence. The book proposes a new approach to the dialogue between science and theology based in a thorough philosophical analysis of acting forms of subjectivity involved in the study of the world and in religious experience. The uniqueness of this book is that it uses recent advances in phenomenological philosophy and philosophical theology in order to accentuate the existential meaning of cosmology as the discourse that ultimately explicates the human condition. The objective of the book is not to make a comparative analysis of the cosmological scientific narrative and that of the Bible, or the Fathers of the Church (in what concerns the structure of the universe), but to reveal the presence of a hidden theological dimension in cosmology originating in the God-given ability of humanity to discern and disclose the sense of creation. The book contributes to the synthesis of appropriation and incorporation of modern philosophical ideas in Christian theology, in particular its Eastern Orthodox form.<br>

This hidden predicament lies in the fact that cosmology is being constructed from within the

He asks how history transcends the obsessive 'linguistic' turn, which has been hegemonizing literary/discourse analysis, and focuses greater attention on historical experience and where history stands in relation to our understanding of ethics, religion and the current state of global politics that underlines the manipulation and abuse of history.<br>

  Retelling Train Stories from:

  Abstract: To what extent do extreme experiences call for an extreme historiography? What discourse or critical response can do justice to the corporeal and psychological effects, among many others, of immobility in trains? The telling of such effects is as burdensome for the victim as it is for the person reading, listening to, or watching a testimony. Anthropologist Michael Jackson argues that the ethnographic impulse of “co-existence” with suffering is perhaps the most that can be achieved through an ethical engagement with the other.¹ Still, the quest for explanation remains paramount: “But can the intellectual succeed in accomplishing what the sufferer<br>

  Book Title: Culture and Rhetoric-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Tyler Stephen<br>
  Abstract: While some scholars have said that there is no such thing as culture and have urged to abandon the concept altogether, the contributors to this volume overcome this impasse by understanding cultures and their representations for what they ultimately are - rhetorical constructs. These senior, international scholars explore the complex relationships between culture and rhetoric arguing that just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric. This intersection constitutes the central theme of the first part of the book, while the second is dedicated to the study of figuration as a common ground of rhetoric and anthropology. The book offers a compelling range of theoretical reflections, historical vistas, and empirical investigations, which aim to show how people talk themselves and others into particular modalities of thought and action, and how rhetoric and culture, in this way, are co-emergent. It thus turns a new page in the history of academic discourse by bringing two disciplines - anthropology and rhetoric - together in a way that has never been done before.<br>

  Author(s) Ames Michael M.<br>
  Abstract: In
                  The conflict of interpretations(1974), Paul Ricoeur makes a distinction between three types of knowledge based on their different epistemological ascriptions. These distinctions provide a useful starting point for discussion about the variants of anthropological discourse and their relationship with what I have termed elsewhere, ‘the three museologies’ (Shelton 1995b: 7). Briefly, Ricoeur distinguishes between what we might call a culture’s operative discourses, disciplinary regimes of knowledge, and critical philosophy. This latter practice subjects the first two narrative forms to analytical scrutiny or, to use a postmodernist idiom, fields a sustained ‘incredulity to meta-narratives’ (Lyotard 1984: xxiv).

  Book Title: Synthetic Biology and Morality-Artificial Life and the Bounds of Nature<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Murray Thomas H.<br>
  Abstract: Synthetic biology, which aims to design and build organisms that serve human needs, has potential applications that range from producing biofuels to programming human behavior. The emergence of this new form of biotechnology, however, raises a variety of ethical questions -- first and foremost, whether synthetic biology is intrinsically troubling in moral terms. Is it an egregious example of scientists "playing God"?
      Synthetic Biology and Moralitytakes on this threshold ethical question, as well as others that follow, offering a range of philosophical and political perspectives on the power of synthetic biology.The contributors consider the basic question of the ethics of making new organisms, with essays that lay out the conceptual terrain and offer opposing views of the intrinsic moral concerns; discuss the possibility that synthetic organisms are inherently valuable; and address whether, and how, moral objections to synthetic biology could be relevant to policy making and political discourse. Variations of these questions have been raised before, in debates over other biotechnologies, but, as this book shows, they take on novel and illuminating form when considered in the context of synthetic biology.ContributorsJohn Basl, Mark A.

  Abstract: The jurisprudential movements of the 1980s deepened and advanced a process of crisis and transition in modern jurisprudence. The most striking facet of this transformation has been the success of new forms of jurisprudential discourse or “law talk” in penetrating, subverting, and decentering the conventional forms of legal discourse. The proliferation of different jurisprudential discourses has erased the lines between description and advocacy, making it much more difficult for traditionalists to maintain their belief in neutral and objective law. A new understanding of language and interpretation has fired the imagination of legal scholars as they reexamined and critiqued the polar<br>

It was found that until very recently,

  Abstract: Historians have often treated the introduction of women’s suffrage as a narrative of linear progress. In this view, women’s exclusion from the suffrage resulted from ageold prejudices, which, gradually and inevitably, gave way to modern egalitarian ideas. Recent scholarship, however, has complicated this story by emphasising the intractability of the issue. Enlightenment and republican discourse talked in universal terms, but constructed the citizen as public man in opposition to private woman, creating a feminine ‘other’ in order to create a ‘universal’, which was in fact gendered, masculine (Sowerwine 2010: 19).

  Abstract: Cognitive approaches to metaphor show a great diversity in themselves, and this diversity is mirrored by the variety of strands within Lakoff’s own work. In his individual work since 1990, Lakoff has concentrated a great deal of his energy on applying metaphor theory to politics. Adopting the role of the engaged intellectual, he has used the concepts of folk theories, narrative theory and conceptual metaphor to analyse the discourse of political rhetoric in studies such as his accounts of the two wars in Iraq. He offered a book-length account of the deficiencies of Democrat Party rhetoric in

  Abstract: In advocating a change of direction for research on youth, Angela McRobbie (1994: 186) asks ‘what are the discourses within which “different, youthful, subjectivities” are constructed? How are they expressed?’ In exploring language, power and young people, this chapter maps some of the discursive constructions of self that articulate youth identities in everyday modern life. It examines the ways in which language is taken up and used as resistance to mainstream norms and values. It looks at the sorts of discourse practices drawn upon to constitute, shape and signal membership of particular youth cultures. And, as contemporary social change demands<br>

  Book Title: The Discursive Construction of National Identity-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Unger J. W.<br>
  Abstract: How do we construct national identities in discourse? Which topics, which discursive strategies and which linguistic devices are employed to construct national sameness and uniqueness on the one hand, and differences to other national collectives on the other hand? The Discursive Construction of National Identity analyses discourses of national identity in Europe with particular attention to Austria.In the tradition of critical discourse analysis, the authors analyse current and on-going transformations in the self-and other definition of national identities using an innovative interdisciplinary approach which combines discourse-historical theory and methodology and political science perspectives. Thus, the rhetorical promotion of national identification and the discursive construction and reproduction of national difference on public, semi-public and semi-private levels within a nation state are analysed in much detail and illustrated with a huge amount of examples taken from many genres (speeches, focus-groups, interviews, media, and so forth).In addition to the critical discourse analysis of multiple genres accompanying various commemorative and celebratory events in 1995, this extended and revised edition is able to draw comparisons with similar events in 2005. The impact of socio-political changes in Austria and in the European Union is also made transparent in the attempts of constructing hegemonic national identities. Key Features:*Discourse-historical approach.*Interdisciplinarity (cultural studies, discourse analysis, history, political science).*Multi-method, multi-genre.*Qualitative case studies.<br>

  Abstract: Since the 1970s, the term ‘discourse’ has become common currency in an everyday research sense in a variety of humanities and social science disciplines, including the applied branches of linguistics. Because of the wide-ranging use of this term, a variety of meanings have been attributed to it (see Ehlich 1993, p. 145, and Ehlich 1994), which has led to considerable semantic fuzziness and terminological flexibility. In the following we will briefly describe the concept of discourse as it is currently employed in the context of the research activities carried out at the University of Vienna, which have also informed the<br>

  Abstract: My engagement with the work of Laclau has focused on the importance of combining a Lacan-inspired awareness of lack and of the limits of discourse (the Lacanian conceptualisation of negativity qua encounter with the real) with a more substantive dimension, crucial for understanding political life and especially the affective aspect of identification processes: the axis of enjoyment in its different modalities and in its continuous interaction with the discursive constitution of our social and political reality, with the materiality of the signifier. As we have seen, such an articulation requires a delicate balancing act between negativity and positivity. If the<br>

  Abstract: Both Ferguson’s image of an ideal civil society and the Griersonian figure of the industrious citizen celebrate social participation. Yet the ‘spaces’ in which virtuous behaviour can flourish are rather different. For Ferguson, civil society constitutes an intermediate realm between the family and the state that in the modern context requires communication among strangers; for Grierson, model citizens effectively become

  Abstract: The idea of complexity outlined in the first chapter provides the theoretical backdrop to the rest of the argument in this book, in particular the position that ‘in a complex world there are no simple binaries’ (Mol and Law 2002: 20). This is a pivotal insight insofar as it unsettles and disrupts many prevalent ideas in democratic discourse, not the least of which is the assumption that democratisation and the inculcation of democratic practice around the world is the forerunner to a reduction in political conflict. Although binaries can help to reduce complexity and thus make it ‘readable’, the resulting<br>

A foundational argument here is Roman Ingarden’s discussion of temporal perspective in

  Book Title: Modernism and Magic-Experiments with Spiritualism, Theosophy and the Occult<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson Leigh<br>
  Abstract: While modernism’s engagement with the occult has been approached by critics as the result of a loss of faith in representation, an attempt to draw on science as the primary discourse of modernity, or as a hidden history of ideas, Leigh Wilson argues that these discourses have at their heart a magical practice which remakes the relationship between world and representation. As Wilson demonstrates, the courses of the occult are based on a magical mimesis which transforms the nature of the copy, from inert to vital, from dead to alive, from static to animated, from powerless to powerful. Wilson explores the aesthetic and political implications of this relationship in the work of those writers, artists and filmmakers who were most self-consciously experimental, including James Joyce, Ezra Pound, Dziga Vertov and Sergei M. Eisenstein.<br>

  Author(s): Miller Sean<br>
  Abstract: In
      Strung Together: The Cultural Currency of String Theory as a Scientific Imaginary,Sean Miller examines the cultural currency of string theory, both as part of scientific discourse and beyond it. He demonstrates that the imaginative component of string theory is both integral and indispensable to it as a scientific discourse. While mathematical arguments provide precise prompts for physical intervention in the world, the imaginary that supplements mathematical argument within string theory technical discourse allows theorists to imagine themselves interacting with the cosmos as an abstract space in such a way that strings and branes as phenomena become substantiated and legitimized. And it is precisely this sort of imaginary-which Miller calls ascientific imaginary-duly substantiated and acculturated, that survives the move from string theory technical discourse to popularizations and ultimately to popular and literary discourses. In effect, a string theory imaginary legitimizes the science itself and helps to facilitate a virtual domestication of a cosmos that was heretofore remote, alien, and incomprehensible.<br>

But on closer scrutiny, this novel string theoretical imaginary betrays, like the exposition within string theory technical discourse, its own incoherences.

  Book Title: Heidegger and Criticism-Retrieving the Cultural Politics of Destruction<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Pease Donald E.<br>
  Abstract: In Heidegger and Criticism: Retrieving the Cultural Politics of Destruction, William Spanos examines the controversy, both in Europe and the United States, surrounding Heidegger and recent disclosures about his Nazi past. Not intended as a defense or apology for Heidegger’s thought, Spanos instead affirms the importance of Heidegger’s “antihumanist” interrogation of the modern age, its globalization of technology, and its neo-imperialist politics. The attack on Heidegger’s “antihumanist” discourse (by “liberal humanists” who have imported the European debated into the United States) aligns ideologically with the ongoing policing operations of William Bennett, Allan Bloom, E.D. Hirsch, Roger Kimball, Dinesh D”Souza, and others in the spheres of higher education and cultural production. Throughout his arguments, Spanos focuses not so much on Heidegger the historical subject as on the transformative cultural political discourses and practices, implicit in and enabled by Heidegger’s interrogations of Being and Time, that have led to the contemporary emergence of the multiplicity of resistant “Others” colonized by hegemonic discursive formations, all the while reminding us that Heidegger’s philosophic interrogations eventually generate a diverse body of transgressive writing and an oppositional intellectual climate in the West.<br>

  Abstract: Martin Heidegger’s destructive phenomenology has shown that modern philosophy, from Descartes through Kant and Hegel to the discourse of positive science, constitutes an “anthropology” that fulfills the imperatives of a metaphysical or logocentric concept of truth and thus brings “philosophy to its end.”¹ Simultaneously, in dis-closing the temporality being that the (anthropo)logos as Word or Presence encloses (covers over and forgets), Heidegger’s destruction of the tradition points to a hermeneutics of being that is capable of surpassing metaphysics (
                  Überwindung), to a postmodern hermeneutics of dis-covery, in which a disclosed temporality is given ontological priority over Being.² What I wish to<br>

I will acknowledge representations and media contexts beyond photography and film or narratives that involve a critical reflection on the production and reproduction of public memory in moving images. I stress the thematic persistence of the trace in documentary, while at the same time reflecting on the limitations of the phenomenological discourse in relation to contemporary media.

Consequently, there can be no essential gender discourse, only gender discourses in articulation with other discourses, like those of nation, race/caste, religion, family, class, and sexuality, all of which articulate with one another and generate a variety of social identities.

In order to account for the gap between enunciation and utterance, Lacan introduces a first distinction that splits the “I” of the discourse of the subject from the enunciation.

  Abstract: In a sense, to speak of foreign policy presupposes the availability of a given spatialization of the world in terms of us and them. Conventionally, foreign policy is the set of actions by “us” out “there.” In the modern, post-Westphalian world of nation-states, foreign policy constitutes the actions of state elites who try to maintain, at minimum, something called “our national security” and to further at every opportunity something called “our national interest.” This discourse of foreign policy is amnesiac about the relative novelty of its central identities and the dialectical character of its antinomies.

This is Derrida’s opportunity to investigate the role of representation in language. “Representation” has a variety of senses, and Derrida argues that through all the registers of its meaning, the “fundamental distinction between reality and representation” cannot be drawn, since in language it is impossible to distinguish them.<br>

Habermas’s reading of Freud, in

Roberts refers to the work of Hent de Vries, Eric Santner, and Stanley Cavell, each of whom exemplifies encounter and response in their writings as they traverse philosophy and religion to expose secular thinking to religious thought and practice. This approach highlights the resources religious discourse can offer to a fundamental reorientation of critical thought. In humanistic criticism after secularism, the lines separating the creative, the pious, and the critical themselves become the subject of question and experimentation.<br>

  Abstract: Shoulson is unconvinced of a direct link between a specific collection of rabbinic writings and Milton's works. He argues that many of Milton's poetic ideas that parallel midrash are likely to have entered Christian discourse not only through early modern Christian Hebraicists but also through Protestant writers and preachers without special knowledge of Hebrew. At the heart of Shoulson's inquiry lies a fundamental question: When is an idea, a theme, or an emphasis distinctively Judaic or Hebraic and when is it Christian? The difficulty in answering such questions reveals and highlights the fluid interaction between ostensibly Jewish, Hellenistic, and Christian modes of thought not only during the early modern period but also early in time when rabbinic Judaism and Christianity began.<br>

These arguments often polarize around simplistic reductions, making efforts at reconciliation impossible. Yet more rational stances do exist, positions that broker a peace between relativism and religion in people's public, private, and ethical lives.<br>

  Abstract: Among the numerous “conflicts” that characterize contemporary philosophical and intellectual discourse, the one between laicism¹ and religion—between the need for democratic states to promote confessional pluralism and substantial relativism, and the supposedly peremptory, authoritarian, and hegemonic culture of the religions—is emerging as one of the most crucial and important. The debate on the laicity of the state in France or in Turkey, the theologization of politics in the United States, the discussion of so-called postsecular society in Germany, the ongoing debate in Italy about the relation between relativism and faith, and the polemical fury over the clash of<br>

  Abstract: In the United States a first impression would imply that the ethical turn has crystallized around a particular discourse of catastrophe that emerged in the last decade of the twentieth century. With a fin de siècle mindset, various cultural and literary historians argued for the centrality of catastrophe, as a historical experience, concept, or narrative trope, in understanding the era that had just come to an end. In the early 1990s, cultural critic Cathy Caruth already referred to it as “our own catastrophic era.”¹ About a decade later, the editors of a collection of essays on mourning and loss echoed<br>

  Book Title: Chinese History and Culture-Sixth Century B.C.E. to Seventeenth Century<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Duke Michael S.<br>
  Abstract: From Yü Ying-shih's perspective, the Dao, or the Way, constitutes the inner core of Chinese civilization. His work explores the unique dynamics between Chinese intellectuals' discourse on the
      Dao, or moral principles for a symbolized ideal world order, and their criticism of contemporary reality throughout Chinese history. Volume 1 ofChinese History and Cultureexplores how theDaowas reformulated, expanded, defended, and preserved by Chinese intellectuals up to the seventeenth century, guiding them through history's darkest turns. Essays incorporate the evolving conception of the soul and the afterlife in pre- and post-Buddhist China, the significance of eating practices and social etiquette, the move toward greater individualism, the rise of the Neo-Daoist movement, the spread of Confucian ethics, and the growth of merchant culture and capitalism. A true panorama of Chinese culture's continuities and transition, Yü Ying-shih's two-volume Chinese History and Culture gives readers of all backgrounds a unique education in the meaning of Chinese civilization.<br>

  Abstract: Both “individualism” and “holism” are Western concepts whose introduction into Chinese intellectual discourse is a matter of only recent historical development.¹ This does not mean, however, that as categories of analy sis these two concepts are totally inapplicable to the study of early Chinese thought. As a matter of fact, we find in the long history of Chinese political and social thought a wide range of views that can be legitimately characterized as either holistic or individualistic. In this study, the Neo-Daoist movement since the end of the Han dynasty will be explored as an example of one type of<br>

  Book Title: Chinese History and Culture-Seventeenth Century Through Twentieth Century<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Duke Michael S.<br>
  Abstract: From Ying-shih Yü's perspective, the
      Dao, or the Way, constitutes the inner core of Chinese civilization. His work explores the unique dynamics between Chinese intellectuals' discourse on theDao, or moral principles for a symbolized ideal world order, and their criticism of contemporary reality throughout Chinese history. Volume 2 ofChinese History and Culturecompletes Ying-shih Yü's systematic reconstruction and exploration of Chinese thought over two millennia and its impact on Chinese identity. Essays address the rise of Qing Confucianism, the development of the Dai Zhen and Zhu Xi traditions, and the response of the historian Zhang Xuecheng to the Dai Zhen approach. They take stock of the thematic importance of Cao Xueqin's eighteenth-century masterpieceHonglou meng(Dream of the Red Chamber) and the influence of Sun Yat-sen'sThree Principles of the People, as well as the radicalization of China in the twentieth century and the fundamental upheavals of modernization and revolution. Ying-shih Yü also discusses the decline of elite culture in modern China, the relationships among democracy, human rights, and Confucianism, and changing conceptions of national history. He reflects on the Chinese approach to history in general and the larger political and cultural function of chronological biographies. By situating China's modern encounter with the West in a wider historical frame, this second volume ofChinese History and Cultureclarifies its more curious turns and contemplates the importance of a renewed interest in the traditional Chinese values recognizing common humanity and human dignity.<br>

  Abstract: Nowadays the term “modernization” has lost much of the popularity it once enjoyed during the 1950s in the heyday of American modernization theory. In recent academic discourse, the place of “modernization” has been taken over by a number of “posts” beginning with “postmodern.” It is significant to note, however, that as early as the 1970s, some of the leading modernization theorists already found it necessary to reformulate the original thesis by way of clarification or modification. As a response to a widespread dissatisfaction with many of the assumptions of initial modernization studies, Daedalus devoted a whole special issue in 1973<br>

  Book Title: The Last Cannibals-A South American Oral History<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): BASSO ELLEN B.<br>
  Abstract: An especially comprehensive study of Brazilian Amazonian Indian history, The Last Cannibals is the first attempt to understand, through indigenous discourse, the emergence of Upper Xingú society. Drawing on oral documents recorded directly from the native language, Ellen Basso transcribes and analyzes nine traditional Kalapalo stories to offer important insights into Kalapalo historical knowledge and the performance of historical narratives within their nonliterate society. This engaging book challenges the familiar view of biography as a strictly Western literary form. Of special interest are biographies of powerful warriors whose actions led to the emergence of a more recent social order based on restrained behaviors from an earlier time when people were said to be fierce and violent. From these stories, Basso explores how the Kalapalo remember and understand their past and what specific linguistic, psychological, and ideological materials they employ to construct their historical consciousness. Her book will be important reading in anthropology, folklore, linguistics, and South American studies.<br>

  Abstract: From the early 1920s to the late 1950s the dialectic of modernism and tradition, whether classical or vernacular, characterized the Italian state’s architectural patronage.¹ This essay investigates post–World War II state-sponsored building initiatives, mainly housing, and the architectural debates accompanying their design and realization. It sets them against the backdrop of Italian architectural discourse on identity that surfaced during the Fascist period (1922–1943) and continued to weigh heavily on the decisions of architects and urban designers in postwar democratic Italy. The essay focuses on the role that appropriation of extant vernacular building traditions and the abandonment of classicism<br>

  Abstract: In interpreting verbal utterance, as already noted, we can be called on to interpret oral speech or to interpret text. The two activities are different, but not entirely different. One paradigmatic form of interpretation in oral performance is that of reciprocal discourse or conversation between two (or more) persons in which an utterance of one interlocutor gives rise to another utterance by the other interlocutor, that to another by the first, and so on.

It is not individual narratives or theories that effect the transformation, though the importance of individual texts should not be underestimated as a measure of the evolving logic of trial. Rather, an entire cultural phenomenon is required to mediate the transition from a hermeneutic of happiness to a hermeneutic of trial: sentimentalism.

  Book Title: Edinburgh German Yearbook 9-Archive and Memory in German Literature and Visual Culture<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Osborne Dora<br>
  Abstract: In recent years, the discourse of memory - and of German memory culture in particular - has become increasingly concerned with questions of the archive. An archive can refer to a physical place, the material found there, or the system that orders this material; in its broadest sense, it might refer to something public (records housed in a municipal building), or something private (photographs in a family album). The material and documentary qualities of the archive confer on it an authenticating function attributed only cautiously to memory, but theories of the archive have questioned the status of material, documentary vestiges of the past. Memory and the archive are inextricably linked, but how does this affect the mediation of the past? This volume explores the changing relationship between memory and the archive in German-language literature and culture since 1945. Contributions approach this topic from a range of perspectives (film, visual culture, urban culture, digital technology, as well as literature) and offer illuminating studies of Harun Farocki, Anselm Kiefer, Thomas Demand, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Jürgen Fuchs, Stefan Wolter, and Sasa Stanisic.

It isthe general system of the formation and transformation of statements.”¹ Because statements emerge as meaningful discourse at a given time, their appearance is accompanied by the possibility that they might not appear. They thereby point to the ways in which language is an event, the possibility of something being said or not said, a matter of whether enunciations even take place<br>

  Book Title: Cultural Capital, Language and National Identity in Imperial Spain-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): BINOTTI LUCIA<br>
  Abstract: This innovative study examines the cultural mechanisms in early modern Spain that led to the translation, imitation and selective adoption of the values embodied by the Italian Renaissance. These mechanisms served to delineate a national tradition that addressed the needs of a changing society and gave a "Spanish" physiognomy to the Italian experience, which ultimately led to the Golden Age. By examining such important texts as the sentimental fictions of Diego de San Pedro and Juan de Flores, the Spanish translation of Orlando Furioso, Don Quixote, and the Polifemo, Binotti first describes the conditions imposed on book production by both the expectations of an elite audience and the limitations of the printing market while outlining the process of the creation of an expressive poetic language and the quest for literary models. She then looks at Ambrosio de Morales' chronicles and Bernardo de Aldrete's Del Origen, showing how a cultural discourse founded on foreign scholarship paved the way for the establishment of innovative-and autochtonous-methods of historical and scientific analysis in the early seventeenth-century.

  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): ESTRADA ISABEL M.<br>
  Abstract: Este libro evalúa la aportación del documental cinematográfico y televisivo producido en España a partir de los años 90 al debate en torno a la memoria de la represión franquista, por un lado, así como a la construcción de la identidad democrática, en términos más generales. Propongo que tanto los documentales con un enfoque histórico explícito como aquellos cuya mirada retrospectiva se realiza sin referentes tan concretos cuestionan el proyecto político teleológico concebido durante la Transición. La primera parte de mi estudio trata de la memoria histórica de la guerra civil específicamente y, la segunda, de la memoria en un sentido socioeconómico para apuntar el déficit de agencia del sujeto en la democracia neoliberal. En última instancia se reivindica la marginalidad social de la víctima a la vez que se deja al descubierto su obliteración de los procesos democráticos. Isabel M. Estrada is Visiting Assistant Professor, Franklin & Marshall College. ENGLISH VERSION This book examines how a selected group of documentaries made since 1995 for both film and television inform the debate centered on the so-called "recuperation of memory" of the Spanish Civil War and dictatorship. Estrada contends that these documentaries modify Spanish identity as it was conceived by the teleological historical project of the transition. The narrative of mass media should be examined in order to comprehend the process of the "recovery of memory" that culminated in the Law of Historical Memory (2007). She carries out a comparative analysis of the visual discourse of the documentary and the narrative discourses of history and testimony, paying special attention to the relations of power among them. Using theoretical frameworks provided by Badiou, Adorno, Renov, and Ricoeur, this study ultimately sheds light on the status of the victim in the context of Spain's neoliberal democracy. Isabel M.

  Abstract: The study of medieval law occupies a unique niche within traditional academic discourse. A concentration on philological precision, challenges pertaining to manuscript study, and the ʹinternal languageʹ of jurisprudence have at times over-shadowed the consideration of the wider societal implications of medieval law and curtailed its use in the investigation of broad themes of social and cultural history. This is particularly true of the thirteenth-century Anglo-Jewish legal corpus, the study of which has been relegated to a select few articles and studies.¹<br>

The first and only analysis of Levski’s posthumous fate is Genchev’s chapter on “Vasil Levski in the Bulgarian historical memory,” which he published in his 1987 book on Levski. In it, Genchev makes an attempt to explain the abrupt turn in the Levski discourse after the Balkan Wars and the First World War. He contends that history itself vindicated Levski’s ideas. The reason for this, according to Genchev, is the critical reassessment<br>

  Abstract: Following the above motto and photograph, the present study starts from an apparent paradox dealing with a subject that undergoes a dichotomic representation. While the motto contests a proletariat in re, the photograph affirms it blatantly through corpor(e)ality. The aim of presenting this paradox is to draw attention to the condition of industrial workers in socialism and its representation after the fall of the regime.

  Abstract: It was a pleasure to read a sober yet hopeful assessment of the condition Europe finds itself at the present. It is both a relevant analysis for European politicians as well as an intellectual challenge so needed in the contemporary, often cynical, often superficial discourse about all things European. A remark from the text could become a motto for the EU in the best of our enlightenment and liberal traditions: “There is no essence of Europe, no fixed list of European values. There is no ‘finality’ to the process of European integration.” (A cheer for the triple negative—a perfect<br>

  Book Title: Given World and Time-Temporalities in Context<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Tyrus<br>
  Abstract: The interconnections of time with historical thought and knowledge have come powerfully to the fore since the 1970s. An international group of scholars, from a range of fields including literary theory, history of ideas, cultural anthropology, philosophy, intellectual history and theology, philology, and musicology, address the matter of time and temporalities. The volume’s essays, divided into four main topical groups question critically the key problem of context, connecting it to the problem of time. Contexts, the essays suggest, are not timeless. Time and its contexts are only partly “given” to us: to the primordial donations of time and world correspond our epistemic, moral, and practical modes of receiving what has been granted. The notion of context may have radically different parameters in different historical, cultural, and disciplinary situations. Topics include the deep antiquity, and the timeless time of eternity, as well as formal philosophies of history and the forms of histories implicit in individual and community experience. The medium specific use of time and history are examined with regard to song, image, film, oral narration, and legal discourse.<br>

  Book Title: Imperfection and Defeat-The Role of Aesthetic Imagination in Human Society<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nemoianu Virgil<br>
  Abstract: Literature is defined in a challenging way as the "science" of imperfection and defeat, or else as a type of discourse that deals with defeat, loss, uncertainty in social life, by contrast with virtually all disciplines (hard sciences or social sciences) that affirm certainties and wish to convince us of truths. If in real history most constructive attempts end up in failure, it follows that we ought to have also a field of research that examines this diversity of failures and disappointments, as well as the alternative options to historical evolution and progress. Thus literature serves an indispensable role: that of gleaning the abundance of past existence, the gratuitous and the rejected being placed here on an equal level with the useful and the successful. This provocative and unusual approach is illustrated in chapters that deal with the dialectics between literary writing and such fields as historical writing, or religious discourses, and is also illustrated by the socio-historical development of East-Central Europe.<br>

Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: Lara follows others in questioning how sharp the distinction is. Commentators such as Thomas McCarthy have focused on the relation between the moral aspects of discourse, concerned with questions of justice, and ethical aspects, concerned with values and conceptions of good. Lara focuses on the relation between discourse over norms and narrative structure. She first expands Habermas’s account of illocutionary force to include not only well‐argued reasons but also “powerfully imaginative speech” (p. 2), and she then associates imaginative speech with narratives that are revealing in their effects. Coming to an agreement with others over the validity of norms is not a question simply of raising and redeeming validity claims. Moral claims have the capacity to engage us, instead, insofar as they are parts of narratives of power and oppression, indignity and response, indifference and the articulation of authentic identities. Lara shows how this reconceived notion of illocutionary force figures in struggles for recognition in the public sphere: citizens present to one another conceptions of subjectivity, notions of morality, and expectations about the good life and restructure them together.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: What about the last dimension of the constitution of moral action, the dimension of practical reason? Ricoeur agrees with Hans‐Georg Gadamer that judgment and interpretation cannot be removed from the application of laws and principles to particular cases. Hence, he also accepts Ronald Dworkin’s argument against legal positivism. Because legal positivism identifies the meaning of a law with its original intent, it is left no recourse in hard cases that seem to be outside the purview of this intent except to appeal to the discretionary power of the judge. In contrast, Ricoeur emphasizes a criterion of validity that looks to the narrative coherence of a legal judgment in view of the history of the legal enterprise. Yet, Ricoeur thinks that Dworkin misses the opportunity to coordinate his “narrativist notion of fit” (p. 114) with a theory of argumentation borrowed from Habermas and the Erlangen School. Just as Rawls’s theory of justice lends formalism to the selection of principles of justice within a community of shared understandings and aspirations, Habermas’s discourse theory lends formalism to Dworkin’s interpretive judgments insofar as interpreters must argue for their interpretations under a set of discourse rules. Indeed, Ricoeur sees the ideal endpoint of a trial as a kind of ideal speech situation in which both winner and loser recognize each other as subjects of rights whose causes should have been heard, who made plausible arguments, and whose arguments were heard (p. 131).<br>

Abstract: The two main empirical cases presented here portray “civil society”—the public or potentially public settings in which uncoerced participants engage in ongoing, voluntary association, outside of the immediate demands of family, work, or government (Walzer
         1992; Barber1984; Alexander1995, p. 6; Fraser1992; Habermas1992; Cohen and Arato1992). Many scholars and politicians have worried about the “tone” of American civic life, lamenting what they hear as narrowness in American public discourse (e.g., Hughes1993; Etzioni1996; Hunter1994,1991; Gitlin1995; MacIntyre1981; Marty1997; Bellah et al.1985; Wuthnow1998; Putnam2000,1995). Groups such as ACES and the Buffalo Club are just the sorts of places these observers would search for the cultivation of civic engagement and public spiritedness (Alexander1995; Boyte and Evans1986; Cohen and Arato1992; Fraser1992; Goldfarb1980; Goodwyn1978; Habermas1992;1989. Rosenzweig1983; Ryan1985; Tocqueville [1831]1969). A study of culture in interaction offers a more systematic method for analyzing the “tone” of these groups. Thus, the bar patrons and the suburban activist group’s styles were not just not neutral, transparent conveyors of cultural meanings. Neither were they justpro‐ orantidemocratic. The concept of culture in interaction operationalizes an insight from students of public life such as Dewey (1927), Mead (1964), and others that meaning and practice—or “content and form”—are intertwined, creating varied kinds of openings for members to become democratic citizens.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Abstract: We have thus followed a strange movement, a sort of coming and going between perceiving subjects and perceived objects, a zoom effect like that of a camera trying to set the right distance with its object in order to achieve a maximum degree of clarity—total transparency. On the one hand, we have seen how the tricky adjustment between the multiplicity of stabilized representations of Hawking and my face‐to‐face interaction with him has fragmented his identity. Like an impressionist painting, distance allows us to see what proximity causes us to lose. The layering of the multiplicity of narratives about Hawking reveals the stable identity of an individual that face‐to‐face contact does not allow. The closer we get to the object‐subject, the further we move from it. We no longer know who or where he is. All the categories we normally use in thinking about a person, a body, a machine, a mind, an interaction, a conversation, a text, and speech are blurred. In his presence, Hawking seems even more difficult to seize than we had imagined. The reason is, first, because, as we have shown, the depth of the social body (the one that talks of the other as much as of itself and allows the accumulation of self‐definitions), normally visible but unnoticed in any interaction, is absent in his case. Second, the internal functioning of the flesh‐and‐blood body, normally invisible, becomes visible and distributed here (the
      Iandlegsare mixed in the same discourse and are detached from the body; they are before him while his voice is next to him, and the flesh‐and‐blood body is collectively taken care of) and omnipresent (it appears at different moments during the interaction). Third, the machine, by the coordination of the actions it allows, disturbs the interaction as much as it creates it. This is where the confusion and fragmentation of identity is pursued by recomposition. Here we follow, step by step, how the machine to which this silent body is attached makes the component~<br>

Abstract: Beginning in the early 1960s, and punctuated by Foucault’s 1966
         Les mots et les choses(The Order of Things) and his 1969L’archéologie du savoir(The Archaeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language), poststructuralist critiques of truth claims and the imperialism of global history, a rethinking of the certainty of words and concepts in an “archeology (that is, a deconstruction) of the social sciences” struck at the heart of long‐standingAnnalisteprinciples.91Whether studying social control, discipline, power, or sexuality, old assumptions were dissected and new agendas initiated. The 1976Il formaggio e i vermi(The Cheese and the Worms) by Carlo Ginzburg and the 1979 launching ofmicrostoriaby Ginzburg, Carlo Poni, and Edoardo Grendi—practiced in France by Le Roy Ladurie in his 1975Montaillouand 1979Carnival in Romans—fostered a new kind of ethnographic history of everyday life that focused on the individual.92“The revival of narrative,” whether from Lawrence Stone’s famous 1979Past and Presentarticle or Paul Ricoeur’s 1983–85Time and Narrative,was to restore the story to history and to return to the event, as Pierre Nora had called for in his 1974 essay inFaire de l’histoire.
            93Pierre Bourdieu’s 1979La distinctionpushed for a reconciliation between events and structure.94By emphasizing that systems of oppositions are not stable structures but are constantly in the process of becoming, being made and remade, Bourdieu’s project to understand how social reality is constructed gets us closer to incorporating practice and perception with objective categories and suggests a way of bridging the gap between the endless details of one thing after another and causal explanation. This list of keyAnnalisteideas and methods derived from theMéditerranée’s problematic could include sharp criticism like that of François Dosse; the constructive response of Jacques Revel on theAnnalesparadigms, the social sciences, and the construction of the social; Pierre N~<br>

Author(s): Robbins,  Jeffrey W.<br>
Abstract: The question then becomes: to what extent does the pattern of ontotheology permit such distinctions? For Marion, not at all, since the God of ontotheology is stigmatized as a philosopher’s God to be overcome in the search for a truly theological thought of God. When Robbins claims that Marion provides a model of philosophical theology to the extent that “[he] accepts the bounds established by the ontotheological condition” (p. 101), there is either a massive misreading of Marion or what is meant by ontotheology remains imprecise. Some clarity might be achieved by sticking to Heidegger, who offers the classic conceptualization of ontotheology. For Heidegger, ontotheology is the answer to the question “How does God enter philosophy?” As such, it would not allow conversation between philosophy and theology because the God it thinks, even theologically, is already the God of philosophy. In Robbins’s work, by contrast, ontotheology stands for a “synthesis” (p. 11), a “dialogue” (p. 14), or a “mixed discourse” (p. 15) of philosophy and theology that best resists the corrosive fragmentation and dangerous purification of thought and culture. I cannot help but feel that in the transition from overcoming ontotheology to accepting it, what is being saved or maintained is not what was being overcome.<br>

Abstract: Accordingly, Meyers examines the role of a series of gender‐specific images in women’s agency, addressing pronatalism, mother‐child imagery, the family, narcissism, aging, and sexuality. Each of these topics could occupy a book, and one hopes that Meyers will expand on the ideas developed here. The strength of this approach is the familiarity of the subject matter to a large audience—although not to all women—and Meyers strives to remain conscious of the fact that she cannot make universal claims about women. But many readers will find something in the text that resonates with their own experience. (Meyers’s discussion relies in part on interviews with women.) For example, when she criticizes “matrigyno‐idolatry” (32) or the pressure to become a mother, she does not merely report on tensions that some women face. Nor does she simply analyze the power of social discourse to manipulate women’s choices. Rather, she sticks to her middle path, demonstrating persuasively that there is currently no space in matrigyno‐idolatrous discourse for genuine autonomy for women, and she makes a parallel point for each set of images she examines. Whatever choice one makes—including the choice to remain childless, which, she correctly points out, is seldom considered by feminist theorists—there is a cultural image ready at hand to define and constrict women’s agency.<br>

Abstract: The reader of the text is absent when the author is writing, but we can also speak of the absence of the writer at the event of reading. Ricoeur argues that a text replaces dialogue that would otherwise connect the voice of one to the hearing of another [
         21]. This semiautonomy is analogous to fixation by writing to the extent that Ricoeur argues that we can use “fixation” to encompass all comparable phenomena in the sphere of the transmission of discourse. As he shows, discourse is language as event or language as used, but discourse that is fixed in a manner analogous to writing signals the presence of text. In this way, Ricoeur extends the concept of “text” to include all document‐like objectifications [38]. Fixation is more to do with autonomy of the text than it is to do with what constitutes the text. So, it is apparent that a text is a semiautonomous achievement of discursive operations and that it is available to be read in another place and time by an audience. For Ricoeur, this is the semantic autonomy of the text. Appropriation by the reader as audience, which is discussed below, is the counterpart of the semantic autonomy of the text [39,40]. On the way toward appropriation, the reader interprets the text through the mediation of reading [14].<br>

Abstract: An important critique of the race‐gender analogy has been offered by Siobhan B. Somerville (
         2000), who argues that simple analogies between race and gender/sexuality actually perpetuate a separation between the two and obscure the ramifications of a specific history of analogizing at a particular historical moment. Somerville’s project is to demonstrate that such analogies have a specific history, that “the formation of notions of heterosexuality and homosexuality emerged in the United States through (and not merely parallel to) a discourse saturated with assumptions about the racialization of bodies” (2000, 4).17The discourse on race, that is, facilitates the discourse on sexuality. So I speculate that the possibilities for decolonizing (white) feminist/gender/sexuality theories might lie precisely in analyses grounded in a specific, local moment, for these analyses would begin the work of undoing the universalism that has been the mark of whiteness.<br>

Abstract: This form of sympathy that manifests itself in the body is called “natural” (
      naturale) and relates to two other kinds of sympathetic connections: “imaginary” (fantastica) and “rational” (razionale). In this three‐part concept of sympathy, Tesauro summarizes a rhetorical process in which “human discourse” (human discorso) holds the primary position. According to Tesauro, “rational sympathy causes the imaginary [sympathy], and because of its influence on blood the imaginary brings about the natural.”76Conversely, a natural sympathy produces internal images, which lead to discourse, “so that a natural love eventually becomes a virtuous habit.”77<br>

Abstract: Ultimately, Frei’s analysis leads to the conclusion that understanding the grammar of the text in terms of its historical linguistic context—in other words, with reference to the culture outside the text itself—divorces the meaning or subject matter of the text from the narrative cohesion of scripture, such that a practice that finds “meaning” in the ascriptive, figural resonances between passages fades from view. “Where hermeneutics and interpretation are governed by the conviction that the interpreter’s unique stance and process of understanding are face to face with that same motion within the discourse to be interpreted, and that this affinity alone (apart from the `linguistic stock’) is the ground for understanding what is being said, such ‘surface’ reading, finding character and society firmly related—a reading, moreover, which discovers the continuity of the narrative in its very contingency—must be viewed as superficial or worse.”
         39In the conclusion toEclipse, Frei suggests that if one divorces grammatical interpretation from its psychological cohort, it may serve as a more appropriate interpretive approach for recovering a narrative sense: “If they are not [united], it still does not necessarily follow that grammatical interpretation can do justice to the obviously narrative features of such realistic texts as the biblical stories. But it does follow that of these two it alone is a candidate, since it alone is concerned with verbal connections.”40<br>

Abstract: In 1974, in the second issue of
      Critical Inquiry, David Richter, then an assistant professor at Queens College and a student of Sheldon Sacks, predicted that the future of theory would be a battle among genre critics. He had already decided that the neo‐Aristotelians, the Chicago school, had won out over neo‐Kantians and the New Critics.16Thus Tzvetan Todorov and Paul Hernadi, he predicted, would be read, not E. D. Hirsch and Murray Krieger. However, at the same time that he was making his predictions, Denis Donoghue and Frank Kermode were arguing, in footnotes, over the correct translation, meaning, and applicability of Jacques Derrida’s “Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences.”<br>

Abstract: Unfried's article itself can be approached in different ways. One can see it as a case of speculative interpretation, based not on first‐hand research but on a priori models. This is, of course, a more charitable way of saying that it is a case of sloppy research, given the fact that by the time he was writing his article there had already been numerous Bulgarian publications on the novel cultural treatment of former monuments, the mausoleum included.
         56But one can also treat it as a case of scholarly balkanism: the notion that explanatory approaches to phenomena in southeastern Europe often rest upon a discourse (in the Foucauldian sense)—or upon what might be called a stable system of stereotypes by those who shun the notion of “discourse”—that places the Balkans in a cognitive straitjacket. InImagining the Balkans,I refrained from generalizing about scholarly output, maintaining that the scholarly project moves along different lines than does the production of popular mythology and only occasionally intersects with it. My caveat was: “This is not to say that a great number of the scholarly practitioners of Balkan studies in the West do not share privately a staggering number of prejudices; what it says is that, as a whole, the rules of scholarly discourse restrict the open articulation of these prejudices.”57I still believe this to be true, and if I have erred, it is only in the direction of too much leniency.<br>

Abstract: To the ear of a theological ethicist, however, this emphasis on children’s agency raises significant questions. The notion that agency defines what it means to be human has profound problems even when it comes to adults. Postmodern ethics of various kinds has shown that human life in society is fundamentally conditioned by a number of non‐agential factors. These include historical and cultural traditions, shared social narratives, systems of power, commitments to common goods, biological and evolutionary needs, intersubjective norms of dialogue and relationship, transcending sources of social meaning, and needs for receptivity and responsiveness toward persons and cultures that are other. Jürgen Habermas argues that since ethics confronts human life with a “pluralism of ultimate value orientations,” it must be grounded ultimately not in the expression of subjective agency but in procedures of larger “intersubjective discourse” that allow for mutual dialogue to arise and flourish between diverse points of view.
         38Ricoeur has criticized one‐sided ethics of agency as masking the mere utilitarian pursuit of self‐interest in which the powerless silently lose out.39More emphatically, Levinas has shown how the ethics of agency can be used to justify social violence (Levinas himself was a Jewish survivor of the Holocaust) in permitting those with the greatest social agency to “totalize” shared moral worlds. Ethics should begin, according to Levinas, in agency’s very opposite: the otherness of the other calling the self to “a passivity more passive still than the passivity of matter.”40<br>

Abstract: A genuine atmosphere of deliberation requires three principles: “The basic premise of reciprocity is that citizens owe one another justifications for the institutions, laws, and public policies that collectively bind them. … Together with reciprocity, two other principles specify the conditions of democratic deliberation. The principle of publicity requires that reason‐giving be public in order that it may be mutually justifiable. The principle of accountability specifies that officials who make decisions on behalf of other people, whether or not they are electoral constituents, should be accountable to those people” [
      34, pp. 133, 135]. Within the framework of rights (encompassing justice as fairness) and the process of deliberation according to a discourse ethical approach, librarianship can be better able to address the difficult issues it faces. The reality of pluralism necessitates both rights and deliberation. Deliberation, as a process, cannot help but be dialectical. As has been shown here, there are differing conceptions of right and good, of intellectual freedom and censorship, even of ethical theories. To at least some extent, the discussion and controversy surrounding these issues are antinomies, contradictions between statements that each has reasonable grounds. Dialectics, as a means of resolving contradictions and reconciling division, has its foundations in Hegel. Steven Smith ably summarizes the key elements of a dialectical approach:
               It is by such an approach that we, as a profession, can arrive at a fully formed practical and normative ethics. It would be fruitless to ignore the divisions and disagreements; they must be addressed dialogically. Further, the dialogue is inescapably phenomenological (as described above) in that legitimacy, which includes beliefs and voice, must be assumed by all, with regard to all. The foregoing is an attempt to further the dialogue.Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. ~<br>

Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: The Christianity of Patočka’s texts on the care of the soul and European responsibility is not just any Christianity. It is not only an essential but also a heretical conception of Christianity. According to Patočka’s highly stratified genealogy of responsibility, the history of the responsible self is built upon the heritage of the Platonic conception of the care of the soul through a series of ruptures and repressions “that assure the very tradition they punctuate with their interruptions” (
      GD,p. 7). Although the novel twist to which Christianity subjects the theme of the care of the soul consists, according to Patočka, in an “about‐face” by means of which Christianity seeks to extricate itself from its Platonic inheritance, Christianity has proved unable to think through and draw the radical implications of its mutation of the theme in question precisely because its overcoming of Platonism is not complete.11As Derrida points out, if European Christianity is at its heart still haunted by the persistent presence of a type of Platonism—and of a type of Platonic politics—it is, according to Patočka, because it “has not sufficiently repressed Platonism in the course of its reversal, and it still mouths its words” (GD,p. 23). Now, the specificity of the reversal that the motif of the care of the soul undergoes in Christianity consists in this: the responsibility of the self or of the soul does not derive from knowledge of the Divine, the cosmos, or the Good, but from the soul’s exposure to the gaze of an other, ultimately the gaze of God as a Person, a gaze that constitutes the soul as a person and, for that, as a responsible self. Indeed, the Christian version of the care of the soul is unable to come into its own because it continues to subordinate responsibility (and decision making) to knowledge, the knowledge of the Good, just as is the case with the Platonic model. Patočka inscribes his discourse on Europe, responsibility, and politics “within the perspect~<br>

Abstract: Moral Creativityis also a book about Paul Ricoeur. Throughout, Wall turns to Ricoeur’s philosophical and religious thought for theoretical support, using a wide range of primary and secondary literature. Wall works from a Ricoeurian idea that the self is a synthesis of activity and passivity, freedom and finitude. He finds in this ontology of selfhood a basis for conceiving of creativity as the activity of inventing free action amid the limitations of finitude. This anthropology is then tied to Ricoeur’s work on narrative identity, love, ideology, and other topics. Wall’s exegesis of Ricoeur is accurate and astute, succinctly connecting the thinker’s early and late writings on selfhood. The book faults Ricoeur for having an insufficient sense for the entrenchment of social/cultural injustice and for the radical otherness of other people. The discussion of Ricoeur and Emmanuel Levinas on otherness is one of the most interesting parts of the book but also an argument that might need expansion. Wall laments Ricoeur’s decision to separate philosophy from religious discourse, claiming this was a purely pragmatic decision whereby “Ricoeur ultimately does himself a disservice” (181). This may be so, but regardless of intent, wouldn’t we have to say that such a separation is part of the thought world projected by Ricoeur’s writings? Patching over this separation may bring Ricoeur closer to writers of the current “theological turn” of postmodernism but possibly at the price of losing one of Ricoeur’s great virtues—his usefulness in mediating between postmodernism and the modernity that insists on dividing religion and reason.<br>

Abstract: If, for Halbwachs, history delegitimizes the “lived
         (vécu)past,” it is possible to observe a similar impulse occurring elsewhere, namely, Japan, where Yanagita Kunio produced a history(Meiji Taishoshi: Sesohen)on the model of an immense tableau comprised of past and present customs mingling together in 1920s Tokyo and actually envisaged history’s vocation as recording the cohabitation of different customs reflecting mixed temporalities in the present. In Peru at around the same time, Jose Carlos Mariátegui was reflecting on the intersection of historical times coexisting in conflict within a developmental framework and with the figure of unevenness that clearly signified the noncontemporaneity of the contemporaneous.32And in our time this fixation on the historical present as the punctual point of mixed temporalities has appeared more frequently, throughout the world, as evidenced by Chinua Achebe’s novelization of the conflict produced by clashing times in eastern Nigeria(The Arrow of God)—the visualization of temporal islands where contacts and collisions have taken place and have launched the production and spread of culturalmétissage—and even Achille Mbembe’s formulation of the entanglements of time employed to explain the postcolony. In fact, there are innumerable examples of the noncontemporaneous contemporary that can be recruited from the domains of literature, cinema, and, obviously, sociology, an immense literature analyzing the conflicts of tradition and modernity that, especially in the great cities of the world, take place between immigrant parents and their children, among the claims and practices of diasporic peoples in the heart of modern metropolitan life, and within virtual pockets of a transplanted Third World. Also, movements like the Zapatistas in Chiapas have managed to balance the cyclical time of the indigenous community with a political project of liberation inscribed in a Marxian narrative of modernity (though free of progressivist~<br>

Abstract: The second problem concerns something that the postmodernists have tried to show about the correspondence theory. The epistemological justification for this theory’s foundation rests upon the notion of the possibility of universal truth. This implies that all veridical propositions can be verified and accepted by everyone regardless of language or culture. What the postmodernists have protested is simply that this supposed universalism is strictly a European view of the objectivity of truth, given that this view has yield power over intellectual discourse, and thus is not necessarily shared or even comprehended by other cultural traditions [

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede-~<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: Now psychoanalytic, now generic and historical, broader methodologies collide—merge and rework each other—across the medial (in this case linguistic) workings of text, including their workings upon us. That dialectical interplay of historicist (over against idealist) discourse out of which the novelistic genre arose, stressed by McKeon as epistemological versus ethical, does not vanish into its hermeneutic spiral. Such a dialectic sustains the very terms of reading's feedback loops, where the checks and balances of thematized form and formalized value are reconfigured yet again in the zone of uptake—a
         responseby no means detached, as etymology might suggest, from the judgments associated with responsibility. Whether or not, for such reasons, we would want to call narratography an ethics of reading in its own right, one thing is clear. Its formal vigilance is anything but cold to the exposed ethical discrepancies of content. Exactly because it does not subordinate medial hypersensitivity to a broader comprehension of a governing narrative system, it can become a rigorously epistemological mode of textual attention.<br>

Abstract: In the present article I have undertaken the examination of individual volition in Augustine, the church father who introduced the idea of “free will” (liberum arbitrium) in religious discourse. Augustine’s portentous contribution to the discussion of volition as a token of identity and a reflection of self‐awareness consists of the identification of desire with love. To Augustine, our soul (
         animus) is not a constant and immutable attribute, but the expression of a perfectible self, which wills its own optimal instantiation when it desires first and foremost to love. After discussing Augustine, I proceeded to examine the different way whereby Marcel, the protagonist ofÀ la recherche du temps perdu, curbs his own conscious volition, which he considers an incurable source of personal egoism, in order for his better self to surrender to the love buried in his unconscious memory.<br>

Abstract: This concern about character opens up a second idea to which I want to direct attention: the connection between dispositions and the wider culture that shapes them. What is lacking in just‐war discourse is attention to the cultural forces that inform, and often corrode, expressions of courage and a commitment to fairness in times of national duress. On that score, we must attend to how social location affects our perceptions of ourselves and others. Because our affections are shaped by ethos and culture, it behooves us to consider how cultural images and political rhetoric bear upon the imagination, feelings, and “habits of the heart.”
         11That is to say, given the dynamic relationship between character and culture, moral assessment of the former cannot overlook the quality of the latter.12We must therefore interrogate how cultures ask their members to imagine themselves and their opponents when they consider putative claims to justice in the recourse to war.<br>

Abstract: Now, the “world,” as I understand it, is a concept one uses for the complex ecology of reflexively interacting environments and the values historically etched into them. As human power grows through technological means, so too does our responsibility and also, interestingly, the world. In fact, our global age is a time of many worlds arising and reflexively interacting around the planet, and this challenges human beings to orient existence amid the possible collision and clash of diverse value orientations.
         34The current attacks on human agency in the name of the fate of Being, like Heidegger's, or nonpersonal social forces, in different ways by Luhmann and Foucault, are wide of the mark. The increase of power expands rather than effaces agency and responsibility; it creates new worlds, for good or ill. We must, then, insist on the work of ethics within the academy since it provides a normative discourse of power and responsible agency linked to the articulation and analysis of the lived structure of reality as itself structured through the interactions among agents and surrounding historically shaped environments. On this point, the religions and the legacy of humanism were right to explore agents who fashion worlds.<br>

Abstract: The prospect of the decline of those debates in a media studies milieu is more worrisome than the putative mutation of their topic. For our seasoned ability to understand how the movies have functioned and to question how they came to function this way can guide the study of whatever audio‐visions attract our attention.
         65The fact is that many of the best minds in the humanities turned from literary, philosophical, sociocultural, or historical pursuits to account for the most imposing medium of the twentieth century. They produced often complex, ingenious, and passionate arguments and positions. They produced a way of thinking and cultivated an instinct of looking and listening. Even if much of what has been written could be discarded without real loss, this discourse—this drive to understand the workings of films—is precious. To have this subsumed by some larger notion of the history of audio‐visions, to have it dissipate into the foggy field of cultural studies, for instance, or become one testing ground among others for communication studies would be to lose something whose value has always derived from the intensity and the focus that films invite and often demand.<br>

Author(s): Mrozik,  Susanne<br>
Abstract: In another respect, however, Mrozik’s work moves beyond the aims of classical historical and philological research by attempting to engage this text as a “living argument” that has implications for how contemporary scholars and religious practitioners should engage in ethical reflection. This engagement represents the second goal of her work, to “explore the ethical implications of the
      Compendium of Training's discourse on bodies for both medieval and contemporary audiences” (7), a goal that she takes up explicitly only in a brief concluding chapter. This project clearly resonates with the work of other contemporary scholars, including those who, influenced by feminist and postcolonial critiques of positivist methodologies, emphasize the intersubjective character of human encounter and understanding. Here Mrozik, drawing on Ricoeur’s work, employs a feminist “hermeneutics of recovery and suspicion” that seeks to take seriously the truth claims presented by the text as a valuable resource for contemporary ethics while also critiquing the text’s validation of particular social hierarchies, including those based on sex and caste. The author questions the assertion of some scholars that Indian Mahayana Buddhism invariably represented an elevation of the status of Buddhist women and argues against attempts to downplay evidence of sexual inequality by recourse to the Buddhist doctrine of “emptiness.” For Mrozik, the diverse forms of human embodiment provide the ground on which a serious engagement with ideals of human virtue must proceed.<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: Coleridge’s concern with the language of prayer broaches issues fundamental to some of the most recent scholarly analyses of prayer, and a comparison can be helpful in both directions. In particular, I want to consider the dialogue between Jean‐Luc Marion and Jacques Derrida.
         54The debate begins with Marion’s 1977 book,The Idol and Distance, in which a negative theological premise initiates the query, “What language can be suitable to distance?”55He resolves that, given that divine gifts cross this distance, the language must be praise, which “indicates the passage from discourse to prayer. … But how, in its turn, can prayer constitute a rigorous language that nevertheless remains in distance?”56His answer is that prayer is not predication (thus remaining within the negative theological imperative of “distance”) but rather the expression of how God inheres in his relation to me, a formulation cited as “praise as (something).” Thus the connoisseur of beauty might praise God as beauty, or the lover might praise God as love, yet without claiming that such a relation is exhaustive or predicative.<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: For the most part, Franke’s theory of poetic language as negative theology is persuasive and helpful in illuminating the complex relationship between religion and literature. With apocalypse, the two converge: religion needs literary discourse to reveal and reveil the transcendent, and literature performs an apocalyptic function that opens us to new possibilities of speaking, knowing, and being. However, what Franke calls apocalyptic could just as well be identified as metaphorical or symbolic, and for this, greater attention to the allegorical tradition, Romantic literary theory, and the hermeneutics of Paul Ricoeur would be helpful. Franke is aware of these connections, but they remain undeveloped.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 605587<br>
Date: 6 2010<br>
Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: This antipathy became glaringly apparent in the 1690s during the Quietist Affair, a protracted debate over the limits of spiritual abandon in the mystic tradition. The controversy pitted against each other Bossuet and Fénelon, two of the most prominent theological figures of the period, and required the intervention of both Louis XIV and Innocent XII. The immediate cause of the conflict was Fénelon's defense of his spiritual mentor, Jeanne-Marie Guyon, who held that the pure love of God required the soul to be stripped of all its powers of independent reflection and activity, even to the point of surrendering its hope for salvation. Guyon's doctrine, Bossuet charged, contradicted the Church's teachings on the need for the self to see a transcendent yet personal good in religious devotion.
         32This polemic, I have argued elsewhere, was structured around two rival sets of claims. Bossuet and his partisans articulated their position in terms of a discourse of self-ownership that valorized the human subject's possession of, and accountability for, its ideas, actions, and other belongings. Fénelon and Guyon, in contrast, formulated a discourse of dispossession calling for the soul to surrender itself and all its goods to the directives of divine will.33These discourses, and the broader cultures of personhood associated with them, were predicated on conflicting reactions to the problem of transcendence: while proponents of self-ownership stressed the similarities between human and divine agency, advocates of dispossession called on the self to relinquish its place in favor of God.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: All this could work in an adaptation of Tillich’s writing without addressing his intuitionism until we now take up the way to discern and think of the promise in specific gifts and promises. Because the promissory token is itself not a gift in the rudimentary sense but only the initial sign of what the donor promises, its being as possibility additionally enables discourse and debate about the promise. The doubled character of the promise or prophetic can also enable us to think about prophetic criticism as itself debatable. Its status as knowledge is not final and is revisable since the token is but a trace of the final promised gift. It invites trust but does not demand it. This means that any sign already is partaking of the ordinary economy of exchange of gifts.<br>

Issue: 655202<br>

Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: Blanchot's response to the inadequacy he recognizes in Lévinas's philosophy is to rewrite it through the production of commentary. In the prefatory note to
         The Infinite ConversationBlanchot suggests that the volume should itself be understood as participating in thedésoeuvrementthat characterizes writing. This is a writing that “is called upon to undo the discourse in which, however unhappy we believe ourselves to be, we who have it at our disposal remain comfortably installed” (EI, p. viii;IC, p. xii). Insofar as Blanchot's essays on Lévinas also participate in the activity of writing, these essays deform Lévinas's thought by doubling it through commentary. Commentary, as Blanchot understands it, participates in literature by repeating the work. Blanchot describes his method as one that leaves the text empty by “translating it in its ambiguity through an interrogation henceforth still more ambiguous since it bears this ambiguity, bears upon it, and ends by becoming dissipated in it” (EI, p. 571;IC, p. 390).<br>

The world as we know it and study it is filled with material‐textual, or material‐discursive, hybrids—instruments; machines; illustrations; diagrams; maps; charts; physical models; computer simulations—that are simultaneously part of the material world andinstrumentsfor our knowing and manipulating it. They are all, in their own way, what I like to callmaterial metaphors: embodied metaphors‐in‐action!9<br>

Abstract: Here, we come a bit closer to the seductive nature of Augustinian rhetoric. Deprived of clock time, the “since the day I learnt of you” turns into the magic of memory and oblivion. A-causally and counterintuitively it is a world turned upside down. Memory and time (
      ex quo) function asle marteau sans maître, the “hammer of existence,”esse solum, that is ordered as well as given and is incapable of not being confessed and lived, the song that cannot be silenced and cannot disappear from memory and expectation. Oblivion is the silent performance of precisely that: the loss of sound, as a means of survival—in sinful forgetfulness—vis-à-vis that “beauty so old and so new” contained in the ultimate expression of time as present: the temporality of thesero te amavi. But what exactly is being expressed in thesero te amavi? Moreover, if this simultaneity of memory and oblivion is expressed, that is still not the same as the divine voice sounding on its own account. Here, we touch upon the ultimate enigma ofConfessions: the hammer of existence, “Da quod iube, iube quod vis”/“Grant what you command and command what you will.”
            Who is able to withstand the lure—and violence—of that song that, as far as sonority is concerned, cannot be distinguished from the “beauty so old and so new”? One is reminded of Kafka here—the hammer of existence—and his story of the Sirens' song:22
         
            It would be little respectful to Kafka and Augustine to make one-to-one comparisons between this passage and the AugustinianProof that inadequate, even childish measures may come to the rescue.
            To protect himself from the Sirens, Ulysses put wax in his ears and had himself chained to the mast of his ship. Of course, all travelers before him could have done the same, except those whom the Sirens had already allured from afar, but it was known to all the world that such things were of no help whatever. The song of the Sirens could penetrate everything, and th~<br>

Abstract: The text covers a lot of ground, delving into many of the touch points between theology and human rights and endeavoring to demonstrate how those points can be sources of mutual enrichment rather than conflict. At times the comprehensive scope of the text, which draws on the insights of so many, makes it a challenging read and leaves the reader wanting more development and illustration of the fruits of the author’s argument. Overall, the text is an important contribution to the constructive engagement between theology and human rights discourse and is a serious challenge to those in either camp who would peremptorily reject the insights of the other.<br>

Abstract: Abnormal genital discharges, corpses and creeping things—confronting these unpleasant realities in the Priestly purity regulations of the Hebrew Bible (e.g., Leviticus 11–15; Numbers 19) is too much for many people, scholars included, to stomach. Nevertheless, a brave few have attempted to find some redeeming value in this corpus by deciphering the meanings concealed within this systematic code. Despite their efforts to uncover a discourse on abstract social or theological categories, the gruesome details of these stipulations are not particularly hospitable to interpretations that are rooted in an abstract, disembodied mode of rationality.<br>

Abstract: Vincent Crapanzano adopts an aphoristic/interrogative style. He first asks whether it is possible to distinguish an anthropology of morality from the morality of anthropology. Insofar as we have not had a coherent anthropology of morality, I hope not—but I wonder if this implies a moral dimension of anthropology that goes beyond professional ethics. His second intervention suggests I fail to recognize that moral anthropology has often deflected ethnographic study of morality, though the newer studies to which I call attention do incorporate an ethnographic approach. He also wonders whether insistence by American anthropologists on egalitarian relationships in the field is an imposition of American values; one could extend this query to the well-intentioned but ironically nonegalitarian appropriation in the ethnographic aim of giving voice to the oppressed indigenous. Crapanzano’s third aphoristic query raises the relation among descriptive, normative, and universal morality while stopping short of asking how the rhetoric of the universal to which he refers might be related to the distinction between cultural and moral relativity. His fourth reflection is framed in terms of two distinctions (between political and moral, and between psychological and moral), but especially in the American society to which he refers it might be just as fruitful to put moral, political, and psychological idioms and attributions into a triangular relationship. Aphorism five is an injunction to consider the meta-moral, and I take this to mean both how morality is defined and where it fits into social discourse and ethnographic practice.<br>

Abstract: Despite these caveats,
   Contemplative Nationis highly recommended for scholars of Jewish studies, religious studies, philosophy, and theology. The book is an excellent example of how to apply hermeneutical theories to the study of Judaism, how to bridge the gap between continental philosophy and analytic philosophy, and how to expand the scope of Jewish studies by appreciating the nature of theological discourse. While Judaica scholars could use the book in university-level courses, and rabbis could apply its approach to synagogue life, the claim that “Israel” is a “contemplative nation” will hardly resonate with most Jews today. It is very doubtful that the book could “guide the way for [the] future” of the Jewish people’s survival (226), precisely because Jews today are overwhelmingly secular, and the culture in which Jews live, both in Israel and in the Diaspora, is anti-intellectual and antitheological. Furthermore, if Fisher is so keen on Philo, he should have also reminded his readers of the fate of Philo’s enterprise: it was no coincidence that Philo became one of the Church Fathers and that his exegetical/hermeneutical project was not adopted by the tradition that became normative Judaism. When “Israel” denotes a nation of divine contemplators, “carnal Israel” (namely “Israel” as a historical, cultural, and ethnic entity) is marginalized, denigrated, and persecuted. It is true that Jewish religious life is theological, but being Jewish cannot be reduced to contemplating God.<br>

Abstract: King Lear, it would seem, does this in spades. The tragedy assails us in our unknowing. At play’s end, we are baffled and bewildered—and compelled to speak even so. But what can we say? Or, to put a finer point on the question, what can we say that will not violate the terms of our speaking? Can we speak in a way that does not reduce or thematize? If it is true that great literature, likeLear, can imitate a form of ethical discourse, is it possible for literary criticism to do the same? As I draw this essay to a close, I would like to touch briefly on this question by considering how a Levinasian perspective might influence not only our experience of the drama but also our critical reception of it. In doing so, I make what is admittedly a perilous leap from stage plays to scripture, proposing to think about Levinas’s approach to the Talmud as both a mode and model of literary criticism.

Abstract: Peperzak critiques the self-image of philosophy as “strictly autonomous thought, in the strong, wholly independent, and autarkic sense of this word” (129). Philosophy in this, typically modern, mold starts with a laudable commitment to freedom but ends up “obsessed by the sovereign position of an ego on top of a panoramic universe” (156) and coldly abstracted from the particularities of individual thinkers, its discourse closed off from relation to others.<br>

Article Title: The Correspondence of Fronto and Marcus Aurelius<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: ca.2013.32.issue-2<br>
Date: 10 2013<br>
Abstract: This paper seeks to bridge two aspects of Fronto's letters, erotics and rhetoric, by demonstrating that Fronto himself merges the two areas in his discourse with Marcus Aurelius about their relationship. Whereas some letters suggest an unequal relationship based on power, others encourage the identification of Fronto with Marcus. Fronto achieves this identification by structuring their relationship itself as a metaphor in which he and Marcus are equated and linked by epistolary bonds. I close by discussing why the epistolary genre in particular is an apt site for the merger of metaphor and love.<br>

Article Title: Is Culture a Problem for Social Psychology?<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: irqr.2008.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 05 2008<br>
Abstract: Culture has been regarded as an anathema to psychology as an empiricist research tradition. Despite the explosive growth of research on culture and psychology over the last decade of the 20
         thcentury and its importance in Asian social psychology, the ontological and epistemological tension between psychology as a science and psychology as a cultural/historical discipline introduced in the writings of the thinkers of the Enlightenment and counter-Enlightenment still lingers on in the contemporary discourse of psychology. Clifford Geertz once ominously suggested that cultural psychology may have chewed more than it can. In this paper, the interpretive turn in social science as exemplified by writings of Charles Taylor and Paul Ricoeur is reviewed and discussed how it may impinge on the practice of Asian social psychology as an empirical science in methodological, epistemological, and ontological respects. It is argued here that the current practice of Asian social psychology is largely, though not entirely, free of the challenges mounted by these theorists, and that Asian social psychology has an advantage of not encumbered by this traditional tension due to a monist ontology that is prevalent in Asia.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: jams.2002.55.issue-3<br>
Date: 12 2002<br>
Author(s): Calcagno Mauro<br>
Abstract: Conventional views of text/music relationships in early Italian opera focus on the imitation of affections. But by dealing exclusively with the referential meanings of texts (e.g., emotions, images, and concepts) these views overlook an important aspect of music's interaction with language. In opera, music also imitates language's contextual and communicative functions—i.e., discourse, as studied today by the subfield of linguistics called pragmatics. In his operas Monteverdi fully realized Peri's ideal of “imitating in song a person speaking” (“imitar col canto chi parla”) by musically emphasizing those context-dependent meanings that emerge especially in ordinary language and that are prominent in dramatic texts, as opposed to poetry and prose. Such meanings are manifest whenever words such as “I,” “here,” and “now” appear— words called “deictics”—with the function of situating the speaker/singer's utterances in a specific time and place. Monteverdi highlights deictics through melodic and rhythmic emphases, repetition, shifts of meter, style, and harmony, as part of a strategy to create a musical language suited to opera as a genre and to singers as actors. In
         Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patriaandL'incoronazione di Poppea, this strategy serves large-scale dramaturgical aims with respect to the relationships among space, time, and character identity, highlighting issues also discussed within the contemporary intellectual context.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: jams.2004.57.issue-3<br>
Date: February 2005<br>
Author(s): Higgins Paula<br>
Abstract: Within the theoretical framework of Roland Barthes's writings on myth and ideology, this essay seeks to expose the historical legitimation project through which the mythmaking, universalizing rhetoric of musical genius that has long surrounded the figure of Ludwig van Beethoven came to infiltrate scholarship on Josquin des Prez, culminating in his late twentieth-century apotheosis. Contextualizing the composer's reception history with respect to the debates between Joseph Kerman and Edward Lowinsky in 1965 and especially the 1971 Josquin Festival-Conference, the author suggests that the ideological refashioning of Josquin in the image of Beethoven has simultaneously shaped and derailed the intellectual trajectory of early music scholarship in the past thirty years. By privileging a discourse of musical genius in the service of which, among other concerns, the canon of works attributed to the composer is being decimated beyond historical recognition, the richness and complexity of the musical culture of which he was a vital part risks being overshadowed and obfuscated by the disproportionate amount of attention invested in his singular accomplishments. The essay advocates a resolute historicization of sixteenth-century discourses of creative endowment, a critical reassessment of the role of authentication scholarship in Josquin studies, and a renewed sensitivity to the imbrication of mythologies of musical genius in music historiographies of both the past and the present.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: lal.2005.17.issue-1<br>
Date: 03 2005<br>
Author(s): Hiddleston Jane<br>
Abstract: This article examines the conflicts of 1990s Algeria and Assia Djebar's critique of these events using the flexibility and experimentation of the novel form. The entrenched government of the Front de Libération Nationale has been engaged in an ongoing conflict with a group of radical, underground Islamist terrorists, and the result has been that both parties attempt to quash any political or cultural dissent. The government clings to its policy of strict Arabization, while the Islamists fight for the invention of a thoroughly new spiritual, Islamic community, necessarily in harmony with itself. Djebar's
         Le Blanc de l'Algérie (Algerian White)challenges both the Islamists and the government by exposing the limits of their stultifying rhetoric, and by describing the author's own experiences of bereavement using an alternative language resistant to generic norms. Djebar upholds unique, creative forms of commemoration that refuse to conform to the demands of Islamist ideology or sanctioned political rhetoric, and that can mimic her deceased friends' own singular art forms. At the same time, Djebar's commemorative text seeks a language free from convention-bound formulae and able to transcend the linear progress of a narrative necessarily evolving through time. In this sense,Le Blanc de l'Algérieuses both content and form to deconstruct the layers and masks of commemorative discourse, and the political misuse of those masks. The novel engages with the difficulties of creating an appropriate discourse of mourning while stretching and opening out existing rhetorical forms.<br>

Author(s): Selby Gary S.<br>
Abstract: Abstract:This essay argues that in 1 Thessalonians, Paul uses eschatological discourse—language about the end of hme—in order to evoke a symbolic world-view in which his readers become God's elect, living at the end of time and awaiting the sudden, imminent retum of Christ from heaven. This self-identification explains their present misfortunes, while at the sam.e time demanding that they fulfill the ethical and moral demands of the Christian faith. More broadly, this essay points to the role that eschatological discourse played within early Christianity in general, suggesting that it formed a central, paradigmatic drama which helped to define ontological and teleological reality for the movement's adherents.<br>

Abstract: The numerous changes and improvements which have been wrought in teacher education courses in the last two decades have not, apparently, satisfied the critics. Ironically, the reverse seems to have occurred, as recent events on both sides of the Atlantic testify. This essay argues that the developments of the last two decades in educational research and teacher education, which have yielded a wealth of new ideas and procedures, have also yielded a confusing proliferation of educational ideologies. In short, it suggests that the ascendancy of a diffuse, unselfcritical, and often combative discourse within educational studies has effectively eclipsed the more important question which must first be tackled if educational studies are to have a coherent, robust focus. This question, which is pursued in the second section of the paper, asks: is the educational enterprise, properly conceived, a distinctive, autonomous or sui generis enterprise with purposes of its own which are universal, or is it essentially a subservient enterprise, a vehicle for one or other currently prevailing ideology (cultural, technological, political, religious, etc.)? In exploring this question the essay puts to work some enduring insights from contemporary European philosophy, arguing that education as a 'practical hermeneutic discipline' holds a singular promise. Some important consequences of this promise for educational studies and teacher education are then considered.<br>

Author(s): Yehoshua Dani<br>
Abstract: The introduction of entrepreneurial education (EE) in the Israeli education system is discussed in this article as an example of the introduction of new curriculum. We argue that this introduction should be construed as a consequence of major ideological changes in Israel and its education system, a change from collectivist to individualistic values. We open with an analysis of a Ministry of Education publication that introduces the EE program and find that it is loaded with references to Zionist myths. We suggest that relying on references to these myths in promoting EE reflects a need to disguise the discontinuity between the social values behind the new curriculum and the traditional collectivist values of pioneering Zionism. We note that the Israeli programs exercise EE in groups, whereby the responsibility for the new ventures is shared by the group members. We suggest that adopting the group method indicates a compromise between a completely individualistic and competitive approach to entrepreneurship and a collectivist approach to coping with new tasks-which is more in line with traditional Zionist values. We argue that the change of atmosphere from collectivism to individualism is a result of demographic and economic processes that have occurred since the establishment of the Israeli state, and that these processes may be exposed through observing the Israeli youth movements and the public discourse. We believe that the gradual shift from collectivism to individualism is a central factor in explaining the timing of EE's introduction in Israel.<br>

Journal Title: Studies in Art Education<br>
Article Title: A Pedagogy to Expose and Critique Gendered Cultural Stereotypes Embedded in Art Interpretations<br>
Publisher: National Art Education Association<br>
Issue: i256762<br>
Date: 7 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Weber Karen<br>
Abstract: The feminist pedagogical approach introduced here can raise self-awareness about gender inscriptions that people bestow on what they perceive. Gender inscriptions are normative assumptions formed as abstract idealized perceptions of gender (Hayles, 1992). These inscriptions are embedded in society's signs and discourse and appear natural, yet they are often at odds with our lived-experiences. As we expose these "normative" stereotypes we recognize that these constructed perceptions are attitudes that prejudice art as noteworthy or insignificant. Stereotypes of females tend to be aligned with qualities not highly valued in this society and do not match prevalent definitions of art and artists. My goal in presenting this study is to encourage its use as a teaching approach that exposes gender stereotypes and the devaluation of women artists. In this interpretive content analysis, I studied viewer rationales used for inscribing an artist's gender when looking at art in order to render visible gendered cultural inscriptions. Responses suggest that gender inscription impacts how viewers interpret a work, and how men and women diverge in describing similar themes.<br>

Article Title: Reconstructing the Fair Use Doctrine<br>
Publisher: Harvard Law Review Association<br>
Issue: i257579<br>
Date: 6 1, 1988<br>
Author(s): Alters William W.<br>
Abstract: The fair use doctrine, codified at 17 U. S. C. § 107, permits a court to excuse a putatively infringing use of copyrighted material when the circumstances surrounding the use make it "fair." In this Article, Professor Fisher criticizes the doctrine - and in particular the changes wrought by two recent Supreme Court decisions - and considers how it might be improved. The most serious of the many problems with current fair use jurisprudence, he maintains, is that it rests on considerations derived from four disparate philosophic traditions; this incoherent foundation makes the application of the doctrine unpredictable and aggravates the cacophony of contemporary legal argumentation. To alleviate these problems, Professor Fisher considers two alternative strategies for reconstructing the field. First, he examines fair use from an economic standpoint, arguing that, by comparing the various entitlements that might be accorded copyright owners in terms of the incentives they provide for creativity and the costs they impose on consumers, courts could employ the doctrine to increase efficiency in the use of scarce resources. Second, building on a discussion of the limitations of the economic approach, Professor Fisher deploys a "utopian" analysis of fair use, suggesting how the doctrine might be recast to incorporate particular conceptions of the "good life" and the "good society." So formulated, the fair use doctrine would contribute to the realization of a more just social order and a more integrated legal discourse.<br>

Abstract: Michel Foucault in "Revolutionary Action: 'Until Now' " (an interview),
Language, Counter-Memory, Practice: "By humanism I mean the totality of discourse
through which Western man is told: 'Even though you don't exercise power, you can
still be a ruler. Better yet, the more you deny yourself the exercise of power, the more
you submit to those in power, then the more this increases your sovereignty,' Human-
ism invented a whole series of subjected sovereignties: the soul (ruling the body, but
subjected to God), consciousness (sovereign in a context ofjudgment, but subjected to
the necessities of truth), the individual (a titular control of personal rights subjected to
the laws of nature and society), basic freedom (sovereign within, but accepting the
demands of an outside world and 'aligned with destiny'). In short, humanism is
everything in Western civilization that restricts the desirefor power ..." (221 )<br>

Author(s): Woods Meenakshi<br>
Abstract: An attempt is made in this paper to arrive at a typology of teachers within the specific context of two forms of discourse, ideological and educational, which constitute a particular school in India. It is suggested that the mode of recruitment, the teachers' perspectives on and adaptations to the particular ideology and the role, and their commitment to the same are significant factors contributing to the shaping of a teacher typology. In this particular context, the teacher is thus both defined by and perpetuates the two forms of discourse in the school. The data on which this paper is based was collected in 1981 through the use of questionnaires, interviews (both structured and unstructured) and observation.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263722<br>
Date: 12 1, 1960<br>
Author(s): Edwards William J.<br>
Abstract: Part 1 shows that while Edwards and Berkeley both regard nature as God's discourse and speak of this discourse in similar ways, Edwards differs from Berkeley in believing that the signs of this discourse signify spiritual and divine realities. Part 2 explains why Edwards thought it reasonable to believe that our world is a world of types and images. Because our world is a world of resemblances and imitations, because spiritual things are its "alpha and omega," and because its beauty is a reflection of God's beauty, our world can be expected to contain images or shadows of divine things. Scripture provides evidence that this expectation is realized. Part 3 shows that these images are not symbols but emblems, and that because emblems are consciously invented, their occurrence implies theism. Part 4 attempts to show that, given the assumptions of classical Christian theism, it is in principle no more difficult to decipher the meaning of the book of nature than to decipher the meaning of an allegorical poem or tale. Part 5 criticizes Perry Miller. Edwards's reflections on types were not influenced by the new science. He did not anticipate Coleridge on the imagination, nor did he "elevate nature to a level of authority coequal with revelation."<br>

Author(s): Stevenson Walter J.<br>
Abstract: Recent study of the nature of textuality as such opens new insights for the study of the Bible. Although individual parts of the Bible have oral antecedents, the Bible as a whole has existed only as a text, and a unique kind of text, folded back on itself out of communal memory as no other book has been. A text is a monument. Textuality establishes a special relationship between discourse and death. Spoken words are exchanges between living persons. The text presents its message as well if its author is dead as it does if he or she is alive. Print is even more bound to death than writing is. In comparison with oral performance-delivery of an oration, song-a text physically has certain special alliances with past time. All texts come out of the past. Literature as text is psychologically retrospective: its effects typically include an element of nostalgia. Because of its future orientation, culminating in the closing words of Revelation, "Come, Lord Jesus" (as against typical narrative closes such as "They lived happily ever after"), the Bible has an unusual relationship to textuality: it is not literature in the way other texts are. Typical narrative plot structures existence retrospectively: the story is organized back from the conclusion. This retrospective organization is maximized by writing, which tightens plot and makes more of re-cognition, a kind of return to the beginning (the past) and hence a cyclic pattern. In addition to being related intimately to death, writing and print are also limitlessly fecund, the central forces in the evolution of consciousness, once they appear. The fecundity of writing and print, like other fecundity in human existence, is achieved by passage through death. "Unless the grain of wheat dies." The Word of God in the Person of Jesus Christ is conceived of by analogy with the spoken word. The Father speaks the Word, the Son (eo verbum quo filius); he does not write the Word, who would then by biblical attestation be not life but d~<br>

Article Title: Ideology and Alienation: Theses on the Interpretation and Evaluation of Theologies of Liberation<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263710<br>

Abstract: Through the provision of a set of theses for the interpretation and evaluation of theologies of liberation, this paper attempts to mediate the existing conflict between academic theologians and theologians of liberation. It seeks to establish the legitimacy of theological discourse focused on the problem of alienation and liberation if carefully executed according to a clear set of guidelines. The paper begins with the argument that all interpretations of theologies of liberation must begin with an analysis of the theological genre within which these works fall. After insisting that theologies of liberation belong neither to the genre of systematic theology nor that of Christian social ethics, the paper develops the second thesis that theologies of liberation are best understood as members of a genre whose distinctive characteristics and functions are analogous to those intrinsic to secular ideologies. This thesis hinges upon a revisionist understanding of ideology drawn from the works of Clifford Geertz et al. and upon a careful specification of the generic similarities between the two forms of discourse. The second part of the paper moves from the level of interpretation to that of evaluation. It argues that theologies of liberation share with ideologies a tendency to occlude self-critical reflection. It suggests that a conscious recognition that theologies of liberation do not exhaust the possibilities of theological discourse but are relative models which select and interpret Christian symbols and doctrines in the light of the central dynamic of alienation and liberation might provide an antidote to this pathology. It maintains with Rosemary Ruether that there is no absolutely adequate model of alienation and liberation and that various models of alienation and liberation must be "interstructured" in order to overcome the perspectival biases of models which focus upon a single root of oppression. To establish relative degrees of adequacy between various theologi~<br>

Abstract: Creativity is seen as inherent in the developmental potential of the individual and of society as well. This "yen for becoming" is felt at all ages, and is in fact recognized as associated with the realization of the profoundest aspirations of man. Its origin is detected in early childhood. It is deeply rooted in the associative trend of thought and action, a trend which tends to perpetuate itself in the direction of unending abundance and novelty. The process assumes passage from awareness to memory, and even to the subconscious. The thought of the moment dips into the past, awakens memories, even those seemingly forgotten, reactivates all that is pertinent for the creation of new structures. It is believed that this tendency is essentially dynamic, endowed with energy which drives toward endless realizations. Nothing dies in the subconscious, as Freud pointed out. Each past experience is apt to return into consciousness and engage in a double process of homogenization and heterogenization, of convergent and divergent currents. Here the combinations, or commutations and permutations, are indefinite, an array which defies any computer. Creativity calls into play all energized experiences, present and stored, cognitive and affective, perceptual and conceptual, sensory and motoric, verbal and non-verbal, taxonomic and functional, real and symbolic; it constantly provokes new patterns. The richer the content of experience, the greater the possibility of innovation. The creative construction starts with the activation of readily available knowledge, the elements of which trigger related material in the memory and the subconscious. The movement is derived from active associations that continue to connect the units, and is oriented toward specific goals, leading to eventual syntheses, which may be expressed in either action or discourse. Here we face an unfurling, which coincides with interpretation, the unlocking of the new meaning built from the past upon the first mean~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i269832<br>
Date: 9 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Woods Peter<br>
Abstract: Economics is privileged in contemporary government policy such that all human transactions are seen as economic forms of exchange. Education has been discursively restructured according to the logic of the market, with education policy being increasingly colonised by economic policy imperatives. This paper explores some of the consequences of this reframing which draws upon metaphors from industrial and business domains. This paper examines a significant dimension of teaching that currently has marginal presence in official discourse: social contingency. We argue that social contingency is characterised by a variety of distinctive features that include unpredictability, relationality and ethical demands. The significance of social contingency is highlighted by a comparison with industrial production, which is organisationally contingent, and craft production, which is characterised as materially contingent. We argue that the different nature of contingency in these domains makes them inappropriate as metaphors for teaching. We explore the nature of social contingency and some of the practical and ethical consequences of the failure to articulate this in official discourse. Its absence in such discourse is illustrated by consideration of competence statements in the Initial Teacher Education context. We argue that the neglect of social contingency is founded on assumptions of teacher sovereignty that are both philosophically and ethically unsustainable.<br>

Issue: i208500<br>

Abstract: This commentary article focuses on a crucial moment in the formation of Peruvian Creole nationalism: the 1836-9 Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation. Nationalist sentiments expressed through the anti-confederationist press, satiric poetry and pamphlets, glorified the Inca past while spurning the Indian present. During this period, a nationalist, essentially racist, rhetoric whose roots can be traced to the late eighteenth century, took shape. This rhetoric would provide the foundations of an ideology which has prevailed in Peruvian history. This rhetoric reached its peak in the twentieth century, while evolving into a historiographical discourse instrumental to the exercise of power and which is now in crisis.<br>

Article Title: Speech Acts and Written Texts: A Reading of a Seventeenth-Century Ottoman Historiographic Episode<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303098<br>
Date: 7 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): White Gabriel<br>
Abstract: The article draws on a doctoral dissertation which suggests a different approach to Ottoman historical texts. Its chief argument is that contrary to current scholarly assumptions, the seventeenth-century Tarih-i Al-i Osman works are not unstructured mines of information useful only for the reconstruction of extrinsic referents. Informed by the so-called linguistic or literary turn in some quarters of historical scholarship, the dissertation approaches the historical texts as a historiographic corpus that constitutes a narrative discourse containing a variety of interpretations, judgments, and meanings conveyed by various forms of language. The article itself is a reading of a historiographic story, the Haile-i Osmaniye (Ottoman tragedy), in the light of a twofold scholarly debate over (1) the author's intentions, and (2) the speech/writing polarity. The story covers the deposition and assassination of Osman II as well as the subsequent second reign of Mustafa I (May 1622-September 1623). After identifying the central historical account of the event, from which the entire historiographic story evolves, I propose a double reading of it: (1) the central text is interpreted as an oral address (i.e., a speech situation) delivered to and intended for a specific audience; (2) the central text is analyzed in terms of its use by seventeenth-century historians who integrated it into their histories and for whom this text represented a written artifact rather than a speech situation.<br>

Issue: i303097<br>

Author(s): Yizhar Tamar<br>
Abstract: How is metaphor possible? How is it interpreted? What is the place of the phenomenon of metaphor in a theory of meaning and in semantics? The following assumptions guide this study: (1) There is a semantics of metaphor; (2) metaphors are governed by rules that, in turn, govern the process of accepting and interpreting metaphorical utterances; (3) one theory should be able to deal with three kinds of metaphors-poetic metaphors, dead metaphors, and ordinary-discourse metaphors which are not completely dead, frozen, inventive, or innovative; (4) metaphors have a logical-semantic basis; (5) all modularities of language should be taken into account (age, exposure, dialect, context, open textures of meanings, etc.); and (6) a theory of metaphor should yield criteria for evaluating the beauty and value of metaphors.<br>

Article Title: Extended Metaphor in Automobile Fan Discourse<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303122<br>
Date: 10 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Yates Ingrid<br>
Abstract: This article investigates the use of extended metaphor in automobile fan discourse. It starts out with a definition of extended metaphor as literary, consciously sustained metaphor, and goes on to redefine it as consciously sustained but not exclusively literary; extended metaphor can also be found in consumer discourse. The article proceeds to describe the body of automobile fan discourse, its text types and communicative functions. Next, the article gives an overview of the most frequently used metaphorical concepts by which cars are represented. Particular attention is paid to those concepts that humanize or animate the car. Against this background, a text from the magazine Car & Driver that lobbies against safety legislation for sport utility vehicles is then analyzed. It is shown that the author skillfully employs two extended metaphors to argue his cause: CARS ARE CREATURES, THESE CREATURES ARE MALTREATED, and CONSUMER RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ARE MALTREATERS OF CARS. These concepts are sustained throughout the text through both lexical choices and grammatical patterns. It is shown that the metaphorical concept THE CAR IS HUMAN/ANIMATE is a powerful tool of the ideology of automobilism that is consciously drawn upon and reinforced in a specific text.<br>

Issue: i209985<br>

Author(s): Rabinow Richard J.<br>
Abstract: Against the background of disputes about modernity and post-modernity in philosophy, this paper probes the differences among Gadamer, Habermas, and Rorty. Focusing on the themes of praxis, phronesis, and practical discourse, it is argued that what initially appear to be hard and fast cleavages and irreconcilable differences turn out to be differences of emphasis. The common ground that emerges is adumbrated as "non-foundational pragmatic humanism". Although there are important differences among these three thinkers each of their voices contributes to a coherent conversation in developing "moral-political vision".<br>

Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
Abstract: The first part of the essay explore's three features of Wolterstorff's account of God as a performer of speech acts: (1) the claim that God literally speaks, suggesting that this claim needs something like a Thomistic theory of analogy as an alternative to univocity and mere metaphor; (2) the claim that speaking is not reducible to revealing; and (3) the political implications of these claims, especially in relation to Habermasian theory. The second part focuses on the theory of double discourse, which seeks to make sense of the notion that God speaks to us through the human voices of prophets, apostles, and especially of Scripture, and seeks to show that a fuller account of the speech act by which God deputizes or appropriates human speech is needed. The final section suggests that Ricoeur and Derrida are not the threat to his theory that Wolterstorff takes them to be and that their emphasis on the text, rather than the author, makes sense in contexts where we have only the text to consult.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>
Issue: i20011066<br>
Date: 1 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Bentz Valerie Malhotra<br>
Abstract: This paper is a reflection on the boundaries of academic discourse as I came to be acutely aware of them while attempting to teach a graduate seminar in qualitative research methods. The purpose of the readings in Husserl and Schutz and the writing exercises was to assist students trained in quantitative methods and steeped in positivistic assumptions about research to write phenomenological descriptions of lived experience. "Paul" could not write the assigned papers due to a diagnosed writing "disability" but he did submit fictional stories and sketches which beautifully illustrated the concepts of Husserl and Schutz. Paul's disability presented a natural "bracketing" experiment which brought the positivistic assumptions surrounding academic research and writing to the forefront. I engaged in verbal dialogues with Paul, in which he discussed the philosophical ideas. My work with Paul highlighted the extent to which the academic lifeworld marginalizes those who seek to write from the heart, disguising even the work of those philosophers who wish to uncover direct experiences.<br>

Author(s): Hahm Chaibong<br>
Abstract: This paper reflects on the implications of postmodern political discourse for East-Asian politics. It argues that the postmodernist deconstruction of modern epistemology and politics provides an opportunity for the reappraisal and rehabilitation of Confucianism in East Asia. First, the paper begins with an account of Cartesian epistemology which undergirds the liberal conceptions of selfhood and politics. Second, it provides a brief history of the Neo-Confucian synthesis and the resulting epistemology based on an intersubjective and ethical understanding of being human. Third, it gives an account of how East Asian thinkers have until recently tried to overcome Confucianism as a way of achieving modernity. Fourth, it attempts to show how the Heideggerian deconstruction of Cartesian epistemology reveals the intersubjective and ethical nature of Dasein which allows for a reevaluation of Confucianism. Fifth, this paper describes earlier attempts by East Asians to go beyond modernity and the way they have led to detrimental consequences. It concludes that the current debate should proceed with a more careful and balanced consideration of both modernity and Confucianism.<br>

Abstract: If Descartes's "Cogito" can be held as the opening of the era of modern subjectivity, it is to the extent that the "I" is taken for the first time in the position of foundation, i.e., as the ultimate condition for the possibility of all philosophical discourse. The question raised in this paper is whether the crisis of the "Cogito", opened later by Hume, Nietzsche and Heidegger on different philosophical grounds, is not already contemporaneous to the very positing of the "Cogito".<br>

Abstract: We argue that the processes underlying institutionalization have not been investigated adequately and that discourse analysis provides a coherent framework for such investigation. Accordingly, we develop a discursive model of institutionalization that highlights the relationships among texts, discourse, institutions, and action. Based on this discursive model, we propose a set of conditions under which institutionalization processes are most likely to occur, and we conclude the article with an exploration of the model's implications for other areas of research.<br>

Abstract: Conventionally, proposals to improve working relations between sociology and history have been interdisciplinary. The present essay advances an alternative approach-consolidation of sociohistorical inquiry as a transdisciplinary enterprise. All socio-historical inquiry depends on four elemental forms of discourse: discourse on values, narrative discourse, social theoretical discourse, and the discourse of explanation. Though inquiry is transdisciplinary in the problematics of these discourses, concrete methodology typically is oriented either toward theorization in relation to cases (historical sociology) or toward comprehensive analysis of a single phenomenon (sociological history). Varying the articulated relations among the four forms of discourse once for historical sociology and again for sociological history yields eight ideal typical strategies of inquiry. The four strategies of historical sociology include universal history, theory application, macro-analytic history, and contrast-oriented comparison. The parallel strategies for sociological history are situational history, specific history, configurational history, and historicism. These ideal types offer standard reference points that help clarify the underpinnings of a diverse range of scholarly practices.<br>

Abstract: Contemporary social theory has turned increasingly to concepts such as civil society, community, and the public sphere in order to theorize about the construction of vital, democratic, and solidaristic political cultures. The dominant prescriptions for attaining this end invoke the need for institutional and procedural reform, but overlook the autonomous role of culture in shaping and defining the forms of social solidarity. This article proposes a model of solidarity based on the two genres of Romance and Irony, and argues that these narrative forms offer useful vocabularies for organizing public discourse within and between civil society and its constituent communities. Whilst unable to sustain fully-inclusive and solidaristic political cultures on their own, in combination the genres of Romance and Irony allow for solidaristic forms built around tolerance, reflexivity, and intersubjectivity.<br>

Abstract: Easterling 1997 (supra, p. 43 n. 1) è un esempio eccellente di questo approccio. Si ve-
dano in particolare i saggi di P. Cartledge, S. Goldhill e E. Hall. Vedi P. Vidal-Naquet, Lo

'Lontano da Dioniso', pp. vii-xxvii per una disamina degli approcci politici, e non solo,
alia tragedia.
È opportuno precisare che la parola "discorso" è usata qui e altrove come francesismo
(vedi fr. "discours"), nel senso sviluppato da Michel Foucault di insieme di enuncian che
producono 'sapere' su particolari concetti o oggetti, e che generano le regole del dicibile
e del conoscibile di questi concetti; si parla in questo senso di discorso legale, estetico,
religioso etc. Questo senso in realtà si è molto esteso, specie in area anglo-americana: si
veda ad es. B. Lincoln, Discourse and the Construction of Society, Oxford 1989, che parla di
"discourse of all forms - not only verbal, but also the symbolic discourses of spectacle,
gesture, costume, edifice, icon, musical performance, and the like", p. 4, in un'ottica di
rapporti sociali di potere (elite vs. classi subordinate).<br>

Abstract: The logic of Indonesian subjectless and tenseless expressions appears to have cultural implications, just as the use of tenses in English scientific writing entails much more than grammatical minutiae. A. L. Becker has pointed out that tense in English functions in a "coherence system" that pervades and transcends grammar. A parallel coherence system is suggested for Indonesian, based not on tense but on topic. Paul Ricoeur's distinction between LANGUAGE and DISCOURSE is the basis of the claim that Indonesian sentences cohere on the bond between grammatical subject and discourse topic. Examples are drawn from a number of contexts that call forth passive sentences in Indonesian. The article concludes on another suggestion by Becker. The Indonesian topic may be part of a larger deictic category of person, which may be related in discourse to orientation in space--both physical and social--of participants in the speech event. If this suggestion is correct, then the contrast between English and Indonesian coherence systems may be found in the opposition tense/time vs. person/space.<br>

Abstract: This article reviews some new international releases in the field of discourse analysis in the tradition of Michel FOUCAULT. This kind of Foucauldian discourse analysis is related to other forms in the wider interdisciplinary field of discourse analysis. Nonetheless, it can be demonstrated that the Foucauldian form of discourse analysis is the most relevant one for contemporary analysis in the social sciences. It is argued that in the German social sciences the term "discourse analysis" is primarily used for theoretical social research or is used for empirical social research, without disclosing discourse-analytic methodology. Since the 1990s, the development of empirical methodologies for social discourse analysis in Germany has intensified. From it's beginning in the late 1960s, French methodology of discourse analysis has been empirically orientated. Here, the work of Michel PÊCHEUX is the central influence in which the epistemology of discourse analysis is thoroughly discussed and theorized. In France, PÊCHEUX continued the work of Michel FOUCAULT and, since then, one can speak of a Foucauldian tradition of discourse analysis, namely "French Discourse Analysis" (FDA). This review outlines the state-of- the-art of the transformation of Foucauldian discourse theory into a discourse-analytic methodology as a new kind of qualitative social research. For this reason, the influence and the analytic tools of linguistics are critically reviewed and a comparison of FDA in France and Foucauldian discourse analysis in Germany is undertaken. The first book reviewed is a British monograph from Glyn WILLIAMS that describes the development of French discourse analysis in the context of structuralism and post-structuralism. The book contains a thorough update of French discourse analysis and is path breaking for German readers of the discourse-analytic work of Michel PÊCHEUX. The volume comes on the heels of a new German handbook of social discourse analysis (edited by KELLER; ~<br>

Author(s): Keller Reiner<br>
Abstract: The contribution outlines a research programme which I have coined the "sociology of knowledge approach to discourse" (Wissenssoziologische Diskursanalyse). This approach to discourse integrates important insights of FOUCAULT's theory of discourse into the interpretative paradigm in the social sciences, especially the "German" approach of hermeneutic sociology of knowledge (Hermeneutische Wissenssoziologie). Accordingly, in this approach discourses are considered as "structured and structuring structures" which shape social practices of enunciation. Unlike some Foucauldian approaches, this form of discourse analysis recognises the importance of socially constituted actors in the social production and circulation of knowledge. Furthermore, it combines research questions related to the concept of "discourse" with the methodical toolbox of qualitative social research. Going beyond questions of language in use, "the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse" (Wissenssoziologische Diskursanalyse) addresses sociological interests, the analyses of social relations and politics of knowledge as well as the discursive construction of reality as an empirical ("material") process. For empirical research on discourse the approach proposes the use of analytical concepts from the sociology of knowledge tradition, such as interpretative schemes or frames (Deutungsmuster), "classifications", "phenomenal structure" (Phänomenstruktur), "narrative structure", "dispositif" etc., and the use of the methodological strategies of "grounded theory".<br>

Abstract: Actual efforts to use Michel FOUCAULT's ideas about discourse for empirical research induce a linguistic bias which misses FOUCAULT's interests in power/knowledge. Against such tendencies, this article argues for a grounding of discourse theory and empirical discourse research in the sociology of knowledge, especially in the German-based Hermeneutische Wissenssoziologie, which follows the BERGER/LUCKMANN approach to knowledge. For the purposes of empirical discourse research on knowledge, the author first considers the interpretative dimension of research. Then, some conceptual tools for knowledge analysis are presented (interpretative scheme, classification, phenomenal structure, narrative structure). Third, drawing on grounded theory and sequential analysis, concrete work on texts is discussed. Finally, the article insists that discourse research should not be reduced to the analysis of spoken or written texts. Instead, different kinds of materiality—for example as dispositifs—have to be considered.<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'efforce de montrer comment le roman de John Barth LETTERS opère une réorientation radicale de la relation classique entre histoire et fiction. Glissant de la représentation incertaine du réel dans la fiction — et de l'Histoire dans l'histoire — à la notion plus productive du réel comme fiction, LETTERS utilise le discours de/et sur l'Histoire comme une métaphore de la fiction qui éclaire de façon précieuse le fonctionnement du récit. This essay attempts to show how John Barth's novel LETTERS radically reorients the classical relationship between history and fiction. Shifting from the uncertain representation of the real inside the fiction — and of History within the story — to the more productive notion of the real as a fiction, LETTERS uses the discourse of/and about History as a metaphor of fiction which sheds valuable light on the functioning of the narrative.<br>

Abstract: Across cultures, narrative emerges early in communicative development and is a fundamental means of making sense of experience. Narrative and self are inseparable in that narrative is simultaneously born out of experience and gives shape to experience. Narrative activity provides tellers with an opportunity to impose order on otherwise disconnected events, and to create continuity between past, present, and imagined worlds. Narrative also interfaces self and society, constituting a crucial resource for socializing emotions, attitudes, and identities, developing interpersonal relationships, and constituting membership in a community. Through various genres and modes; through discourse, grammar, lexicon, and prosody; and through the dynamics of collaborative authorship, narratives bring multiple, partial selves to life.<br>

Abstract: The Subject of this essay, as well as the intention behind it, is to examine the problems connected with the relationship between sociology and the theme of the person. The paper's position is that this theme has a substantial (and not only formal) centrality within a sociological analysis, which is intended to be critical, in the sense used by Theodor Adorno of this term, and is, therefore, naturally, problematic. This discourse implies that the analysis cannot be limited only to codes and factual dynamics (numbering, classify, aggregating-disaggregating) which reduce the sociological discourse to mere sociography.<br>

Article Title: Words and things in Yucatán: poststructuralism and the everyday life of Mayan multiculturalism<br>

Abstract: This article draws on ethnographic examples to examine how rural Maya-speakers in the Mexican state of Yucatán ground the experience of identity politics in quotidian engagements with pre-Hispanic objects and utterances in the Maya language. My argument is intended as a revision of models of critical scholarship that have been influenced by poststructuralism and that place an overwhelming emphasis on discourse as a modality through which politically viable identities are created and performed. Specific examples show how vernacular multiculturalism is shaped by the agency of forms of language use and physical objects that have been a part of local life-worlds long before the popularization of Mayan identity politics. This offers some potentials for collaborative work that have not been fully explored in poststructural critiques of representation. L'auteur s'appuie sur des exemples ethnographiques pour étudier la manière dont les locuteurs du maya vivant dans les zones rurales de l'état mexicain du Yucatán fondent leur expérience de la politique identitaire sur une interaction quotidienne avec les objets et énoncés préhispaniques de la langue maya. Son argumentation se veut une remise en cause des modèles universitaires critiques influencés par le poststructuralisme, qui mettent lourdement l'accent sur le discours en tant que modalité permettant de créer et de réaliser des identités politiquement viables. Des exemples concrets montrent comme un multiculturalisme vernaculaire se constitue par l'action des formes d'usage du langage et des objets matériels qui faisaient partie de la vie locale longtemps avant que la politique identitaire maya se popularise. Cette approche offre un potentiel de travail en collaboration qui n'a pas été complètement exploré par les critiques poststructuralistes de la représentation.<br>

Article Title: A COHESIVE SHAMBLES: THE CLASH'S `LONDON CALLING' AND THE NORMALIZATION OF PUNK<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23013006<br>

Abstract: The Clash's London Calling was released just at the moment when the British punk movement seemed to be imploding. From the earliest reviews, it was received as a musical masterpiece that drew on many styles while still managing to be `punk' in some sense. This article argues that London Calling normalized punk, allowing it to be more than an event: punk could henceforth be assimilated into traditional musical discourse and aesthetics. As a careful balancing act between punk street-cred and mainstream musical values, London Calling allowed a double reading. Punk fans could find in it what they sought: anti-establishment anger and at times a messy, disdainful approach to conventional musicianship. At the same time critics and listeners who had come since the late sixties to assimilate rock into a Romantic (or post-Romantic) system of `art' values could find in it what they sought: stylistic growth, organic coherence, originality, and even a `universal' narrative of struggle, triumph, and redemption played out across the album. It is possible to isolate not only a story, but musical connections between the songs (keys, recurrent motifs, and topoi) all laid out in a logical manner. However, unlike concept albums in the seventies' progressive rock style against which punk reacted, London Calling often calls attention away from its musical coherence, and even its textual coherence, rather than towards it—such as by the last-minute addition of a bonus track that disrupts the narrative and key schemes established earlier. The ease with which the album can be praised in established musical language should not completely obscure its potential (and the general potential of punk) to undercut and confront conventional musical discourse.<br>

Abstract: I argue that the aporetic character of clemency must be understood in terms of its unmerited and merited character to achieve the underlying purposes of justice within criminal justice: justice as fairness (punishment must be deserved and proportionate) and justice as restoration (repair of the harm to victims and society and the reintegration of offenders) are paramount goals. Rather than destabilizing political order, pardons can render productive potential tensions between justice as fairness and justice as restoration. Taking as my conceptual point of departure Paul Ricoeur's claims about the suprajuridical and supraethical character of pardon, I develop the argument through three central sections: an excursus into historical and contemporary practices of clemency in the United States; a critical analysis of the merited and unmerited aspects of clemency with respect to remorse and atonement theories within theological and legal discourse; and a normative engagement with pardons and felony disenfranchisement.<br>

Abstract: Tannaitic rabbis permit wedding processions but prohibit practices associated with these festivities, including the wearing of bridal crowns. Studies of rabbinic ritual based on social scientific models have overlooked the historical disjunction between Tannaitic and Amoraic evidence for weddings. This study explores this puzzling combination of prohibitions and permissions by making use of Catherine Bell's discussion of ritualization. Attention to practice as outlined by Bell leads to a renewed focus on the textual framing of Tannaitic discourse concerning wedding processions. This focus in turn leads to the recognition that the early rabbis create their own vision of wedding practice through negotiating their own historic moment—end-times. The larger eschatological context explored at the end of Sotah with its talk of extreme ascetic responses to end-times provides a framework for understanding Sotah's limited prohibitions concerning wedding processions and reveals a compromise reached by the various agents that remains otherwise obscured.<br>

Slave narratives, in general, and Frederick Douglass’s works, in particular, have created a serious difficulty for their modern readers and interpreters as representations of the otherwise silent community of black slaves. Silence here denotes their inability to enter certain domains of discourse. Thus, they appear` silent despite the rich African American traditions of music, song, and story-telling, which helped to preserve their cultural identity but could not be written into the mainstream culture. The article poses questions concerning the ability of one intellectual voice to represent the collectivity of black experience and of black slaves. This does not diminish the literary value of Douglass's writing but undermines the use of it as a historical document<br>

Abstract: Globalization has unsettled conventional, nationally based political belief systems, opening the door to emerging new global political ideologies. While much analytic focus has been on ideational transformations related to market globalism (neoliberalism), little attention has been given to its growing number of ideological challengers. Drawing on data collected from 45 organizations connected to the World Social Forum, this article examines the political ideas of the global justice movement, the key antagonist to market globalism from the political Left. Employing morphological discourse analysis and quantitative content analysis, the article assesses the ideological coherence of "justice globalism" against Michael Freeden's (1996) three criteria of distinctiveness, context-bound responsiveness, and effective decontestation. We find that justice globalism displays ideological coherence and should be considered a maturing political "alter"-ideology of global significance. The evidence presented in this article suggests the ongoing globalization of the twenty-first-century ideological landscape.<br>

Author(s): de Mello e Souza André<br>
Abstract: A large and increasing share of international humanitarian and development aid is raised from nongovernmental sources, allocated by transnational NGOs. We know little about this private foreign aid, not even how it is distributed across recipient countries, much less what explains the allocation. This article presents an original data set, based on detailed financial records from most of the major U.S.-based humanitarian and development NGOs, which allows us for the first time to map and analyze the allocation of U.S. private aid. We find no support for the common claim that aid NGOs systematically prioritize their organizational self-interest when they allocate private aid, and we find only limited support for the hypothesis that expected aid effectiveness drives aid allocation. By contrast, we find strong support for the argument that the deeply rooted humanitarian discourse within and among aid NGOs drives their aid allocation, consistent with a view of aid NGOs as principled actors and constructivist theories of international relations. Recipients' humanitarian need is substantively and statistically the most significant determinant of U.S. private aid allocation (beyond a regional effect in favor of Latin American countries). Materialist concerns do not crowd out ethical norms among these NGOs.<br>

Abstract: The present paper is an analysis of the functioning of memory, selective memory and oblivion (or to put it differently—the game of remembering, partial remembering and forgetting) in Poland during the period of democratic transformation which, after long years of dictatorship and the hibernation of public discourse, ensures freedom of speech and encourages expression of different beliefs as well as articulation of divergent interests. It defines two distinct layers of memory and oblivion and, consequently, two main types of hidden or repressed elements which may be dubbed "skeletons in the nation's history closet." One is linked with the pre-communist past (before 1945), while the other is connected with the communist past (1945-1989). The latter is linked to political differences—within the same ethnic group—which presently constitute a very hot issue but are less likely to be inherited over more than two generations. The former comprises mostly nationwide skeletons, related mainly to contacts between the Polish and other ethnic groups and involving the sense of collective identity, collective pride, collective guilt, and collectively suffered injustice. On the one hand, these skeletons are currently still more willingly kept in the closet because they can be detrimental to the perception and self-perception of the national group as a whole, but on the other hand the memory of these ethnic and religious conflicts is more likely to be inherited and internalized by future generations for much longer. The question of how to facilitate the process of removing the nationwide skeletons from the national memory closet seems, therefore, all the more important.<br>

Abstract: Cet article vise à mettre en valeur le niveau discursif du langage des géographes. Plus particulièrement il se penche sur la métaphore. Celle-ci est d'abord cernée en tant que procédé mis en œuvre dans tout discours. Puis l'exemple de l'organicisme, très répandu dans la pensée du siècle dernier, est utilisé pour examiner les principales modalités de l'emploi d'une métaphore, celle de l'organisme, dans les discours géographiques. A partir de cet examen, on en vient à préciser les finalités de cet emploi et la portée générale du langage métaphorique en géographie. Il apparaît que le recours à la métaphore révèle la nature profonde de l'activité scientifique, aussi bien dans ses dimensions cognitives que créatrices. The aim of this article is to emphasize the discursive level of the language of geographers. More particularly, it is concerned with metaphor. First, metaphor is characterized as a method which is used in any discourse. Then, thanks to the example of organicism which was wide-spread in nineteenth century thought, the major patterns of the use of a metaphor in geographic discourses (the metaphor of the organism) are investigated. It is then possible to specify what are the main reasons for such a use of metaphor and what is the full significance of metaphorical language in geography. It becomes clear that the resort to the use of metaphor reveals the true nature of scientific activity, in its cognitive as well as creative dimensions.<br>

Abstract: Le patrimoine est devenu un terme particulièrement utilisé dans le vocabulaire politique et culturel tout autant qu'il est devenu très usité dans le monde académique. De l'avis de bien des auteurs, tout serait devenu patrimoine. Certains s'inquiètent de cette inflation patrimoniale, considérée comme un symptôme d'un nouveau rapport au temps présent. Cette contribution tente de montrer, en partant du champ d'investigation travaillé par les géographes, que toutes ces approches peuvent en réalité être reconsidérées de manière plus globale. Ce texte pose l'hypothèse qu'elles s'inscrivent dans une chronogenèse, c'est-à-dire une mise en récit des éléments épars grâce à la création d'un discours caractérisé par une accumulation de signes et d'éléments permettant de penser et de se représenter linéairement l'image-temps. En s'inspirant notamment du travail engagé par P. Ricœur sur la notion de temporalité, ce texte défend l'idée que les éléments patrimonialisés participent d'une logique de mise en intrigue, et plus largement d'une mise en cohérence d'éléments hétérogènes, servant à articuler des récits. Ceux-ci autorisent à repenser une certaine unité de l'histoire de l'humanité dans son rapport au monde physique. Heritage has become a very common term in political and cultural discourse, as well as a widely used term in the academic world. Numerous authors have pointed out that everything has become heritage, and expressed concern that such terminological inflation can be seen as a symptom of a new relationship to the present. Based on investigations conducted primarily by French geographers, this paper explores this academic research as revealing a process of "Chronogenesis" (Chronogenèse) : in this, scattered elements are embedded into a narrative, creating a discourse characterized by an accumulation of signs and elements that allows a linear conception and representation of the image and time. Inspired by the work of P. Ricœur on the notion of temporality, this article~<br>

Abstract: Jürgen Schlaeger describes autobiography ("a discourse of anxiety") and biography ("a discourse of usurpation") as "distinctly different kinds of rhetorical constructions with different legitimizing strategies, grounds of authority, and points of view." Focusing on the memoirs of Teresa and Anna, daughters of the poet and writer, Roy Campbell (1901—1957) and his wife Mary (1898—1979), this essay examines the challenges arising when autobiography arbitrates biography.<br>

Abstract: The aim is to show how formations of discourse can be seen as the subject matter for the historian of religions, drawing on structuralist and hermeneutic approaches. Although these may differ on important theoretical and methodological issues, I find the way in which they correspond, namely by pointing to the topic of discourse as their field of investigation, even more important. In this article a discourse is understood as a framework of communication, and the focus is laid upon religious discourse as a special kind of authorization. In ancient Greece, for example, "authors" such as Homer and Orpheus were the authorities of two different discursive traditions. The analysis of discourse can present us with a view of how certain frames of communication were interacting by means of contest, and how, eventually, it was the very strategy of authorization that was contested. Hence, what has often been seen as a paradigmatic shift from mythos to logos could more fruitfully be viewed from a discursive angle than from a perspective of different mentalities. Discourse analysis, as presented in this article, is a way of coming to terms with the process of transformation by regarding dynamic properties of communication, that is, as interrelated strategies on connected levels of system and event.<br>

Abstract: Between the sixties and the eighties metaphysics has been in a state of crisis; logic and the human sciences seemed to have taken over. The last few years have, however, witnessed a return of metaphysics. Having first called to mind some of the features of the aforetold crisis and evoked some recent authors, the article proceeds to show how reflexive metaphysics is capable of integrating the demands of the physical sciences and mathematics, and through them of building up the idea of being. A constitutive requirement of this idea is that epistemology and its categories of objectivity be surpassed through the affirmation of the other, whose existence and essence are the fundamental categories of transcendence. The ethical experience is surpassed in its turn, in such a way that through transcendence a fulness may manifest itself; the doctrine of analogy and the transcendentals opens the understanding of that fulness. Reflexive experience enlivens the discourse and ensures its exactness.<br>

Abstract: Today, bioethical themes are no longer the exclusive patrimony of university classrooms. Everyone is talking about them; "secular" and "catholics" alike. Catholics are often accused of imposing a "confessional" point of view. This article wishes to clarify this point given its importance in themes regarding the life and death of man, such as: artificial fecundation, abortion, cloning, brain death, organ transplants, and euthanasia. The article is based on a philosophical reflection starting with anthropological considerations. The extensive number of themes does not allow taking all of them into consideration. Thus the article adheres to the following outline: 1. Establish the epistemological bases for a rational discourse based on universal premises, with particular reference to artificial fecundation and the nature of human sexuality. 2. Analize the "human nature" condition of the embryo, of the physically and mentally disabled, of the terminally ill, and their status as "human persons"; this discourse is founded on the ontological status of the human body. 3. Present the value of the human body as a psycho-biological unity, which constitutes man's substantial unity. 4. We call this psycho-biological unity "person": "corpore et anima unus"; an individual subject with a rational nature, with its own singularity and oneness. The person has an absolute value, therefore cloning, even for "therapeutic reasons", is contrary to its ontological status. 5. From the consideration that a "person is", while a "personality becomes", we can explain how the person develops and matures his biological and spiritual capacities, without incurring changes in his ontological status. 6. The psycho-biological unity of the human person (corpore et anima unus) is at the basis of death in man, a unique reality. In analysing "human death" we should avoid two reductions: a biological reduction which curtails death to physical-biological processes and events (medical diagnosis of brain death)~<br>

Abstract: Il est souvent refusé à la philosophie de tenir un discours d'affirmation de Dieu. Face à des objections d'hier et d'aujourd'hui aussi diverses que contradictoires, on veut montrer ici la légitimité d'un tel discours. Celui-ci suppose une double rupture: rupture avec une conception minimal ou formaliste de la raison qui refuse de se prononcer sur le principe de la vie; rupture avec une métaphysique intemporelle qui manque le nécessaire enracinement anthropologique de la question de Dieu. Philosophy is often denied discourse regarding the affirmation of God. Confronting the diverse and contradictory objections of the past and today, an attempt is made to show the legitimacy of such discourse. It supposes a double rupture: with the minimal or formalist conception of reason that refuses to pronounce on the principle of life; and with an untemporal metaphysic that lacks the necessary anthropological roots in the question of God.<br>

Abstract: History is not neutral. It is rendered ideological by the very act of being conveyed in a narrative form, for language is both the purveyor of meaning and the principle locus of ideology. This paper explores the idea of history as discourse, and its deployment in the cultural-symbolic construction of the Singapore nation. To this end, I have chosen to analyse a key moment for Singapore history, the years 1963-65, when Singapore was first merged with the nation of Malaysia, and then separated from it. The way that these events are described in official histories is used by the government of Singapore to justify its policy of multiracialism, which also serves as a legitimating device confirming the state in its political and ideological hegemony. I have examined the events through analysis of local newspapers, The Straits Times and Berita Harían, to see in what ways their reporting may have helped to mould popular understandings of what was happening.<br>

Abstract: The nineteen-nineties saw the so-called "deliberative turn in democracy", which was taken up by a large number of democracy theorists. This paper sets out: 1) to analyse why this turn took place; 2) to classify the different proposals of deliberative democracy into two models (D1 and D2), in view of their epistemological effectiveness (model D1 assumes the pattern of Rawls' political liberalism, and model D2, Habermas'Theory of Discourse); 3) to display the superiority of D2 over D1; 4) to point out certain shortcomings in Habermas' deliberative-discursive politics and to propose a model of democracy which will enable these to be improved on, to be known as "communicative democracy".<br>

Date: 1 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Dédeyan Daniel<br>
Abstract: Departing from the disconcerting tact that the only passage where Kant mentions court practice is in a chapter on art, the essay undertakes a reconstruction of Kant's esthetics. As to beauty, the judgment of taste appears as a judgment on the ability to judge, and it is universally valid not because it is true, but because it is communicable. Kant's notion of art turns out to be the autonomous discourse of taste as his notion of morality stands for autonomy of man and his notion of law for autonomy of civil society. However, Kant's esthetical experience of the sublime as appearance of what neither mind nor senses grasp breaks up harmony and autonomy and unjudges judgment. At this point, the essay uncovers an intrinsically destabilizing force of Kant's ‚reason‘, traces the consequences for the judicial judgment and gives a perspective to philosophy of law within a differentiated society.<br>

Abstract: The main end of this article is to offer a critical analysis of autonomy conceived as a basic idea in modern educational philosophy. After the tragic experience and dramatic consequences of totalitarianism, is not possible to defend a kantian concept of autonomy as a unique source of moral responsibility and ethical action. After holocaust, we need to defend, on the contrary, the principle of previous value of heteronomy, conceived as the practice of otherness, in its levinasian perspective. So, the authors explore the thesis of the prior value of heteronomy on autonomy, as a source and foundation of moral responsibility in educational relationship, and to reflect the general educational implications of the jewish philosophical tradition of otherness in philosophical educational discourse.<br>

Abstract: Disciplina acuñada en el XIX, la filología surge como historicidad fundamental, identificando la significación de una obra con sus condiciones de producción originarias, un discurso de la ciencia (historia) sobre la lengua y la literatura. La hermenéutica contemporánea supone una ruptura de la razón histórico-filológica y una afirmación de los nuevos significados que a un texto se le añaden al pasar de un contexto cultural u otro nuevo. Para la filología, el criterio pedagógico único de explicación de los textos es la restitución de la intención deliberada y originaria del autor. Hermenéutica y teoría de la literatura afirman que no hay adecuación lógica necesaria entre sentido de la obra e intención de autor. Tras la “muerte del autor” del formalismo semiótico, la posmodernidad niega el texto mismo y afirma que éste tiene tantos sentido como lectores. A discipline minted in the 19th century, philology, emerges as a fundamental historicist approach, identifying the significance of a work with its original conditions of production, a discourse from science (history) about language and literature. Contemporary hermeneutics assumes a break with historical-philological reason, as well as an affirmation of the new meanings added to a text by passing from one cultural context to another new one. For philology, the only pedagogical criterion in explaining texts is the restitution of deliberate and original authorial intent. Hermeneutics and literary theory assert that there is no logical association necessary between the meaning of the work, and authorial intent. Since the “death of the author” of semiotic formalism, postmodernity has denied the text itself, instead asserting that it has as many meanings as it has readers.<br>

Comment comprendre ces récits qui portent sur des épisodes concrets de la guerre qui opposa l'armée régulière aux maoïstes du Sentier lumineux, et dans lesquels le saint patron se présenta aux différents acteurs armés pour les dissuader de malmener les villageois? Il s'agit d'analyser ici le discours politico-religieux de ces narrations ainsi que le singulier « travail de mémoire » de la guerre qu'elles contiennent. Nous voyons de quelle manière ces mémoires sanctifiées participent de l'élaboration d'une mémoire collective héroïque qui réinterprète autrement l'expérience douloureuse vécue par les habitants de Huancapi durant la guerre. In Huancapi, in the Andes of southern Peru, many people have testified to the miraculous apparitions of the village's patron saint during the war that ravaged the region during the last two decades of the twentieth century. How should these narratives be understood as they evoke specific episodes of a recent, violent history in which St. Luis apparently appeared to the conflict's different protagonists to discourage them from victimizing the villagers? We analyze the political and religious discourse embedded in these narratives and the singular “work on memories” of the war that it unveils. We show how the outstanding figure of the Saint participated in the development of an iconic memory: a heroic and victorious memory that offers another reading of the painful experience of the villagers. En Huancapi, en los Andes del sur del Perú, varios testimonios confirman las apariciones milagrosas del santo patrono durante la época de la violencia política de las dos últimas décadas del siglo XX. ¿Cómo entender estos relatos acerca de episodios concretos de la guerra que opuso el ejército peruano con los maoístas de Sendero luminoso, en los cu~<br>

Abstract: This article considers the production of an Islamic utopian or millennial discourse by British South Asian Muslims in the diasporic public sphere and its possible impact on the younger generation of Muslims growing up in the UK. Associated with such a discourse, the article considers the vulnerability of diasporas — the process whereby global events can precipitate radical diasporic estrangement, leading to self-estrangement. Such estrangement is fed by moral panics, expressed in the speeches of politicians, in newspaper columns and global news reports. This exposes the fragility of multicultural discourses in the public sphere in the UK.<br>

Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23918936<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Westerink Herman<br>
Abstract: In this article it is argued that the apparent vagueness and broadness of the concept 'spirituality' and the difficulty in finding an agreeable definition for it are related to the different meanings of the concept within different intellectual and religious contexts and, subsequently, to different valuations of spirituality in relation to religion and lived religiosity. This article also examines the concept spirituality in the context of the psychology of religion's historical entanglement with theology. On the one hand, the psychology of religion has emancipated itself from theological discourse and theological institutions. On the other hand, the psychology of religion is still closely connected to a modernist theological project of founding religiousness in a province of the mind that resists religious critique of traditional contents and institutional structures in a secular era. The author pleas for more differentiation between theistic and non-theistic dimensions of the concept spirituality.<br>

Article Title: DOSTOEVSKY AND THE HERMENEUTICS OF SUSPICION<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917895<br>
Date: 9 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Ward Bruce K.<br>
Abstract: The contemporary philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, has characterized the dominant trend in modern interpretative thought as the 'school of suspicion', whose most significant 'masters' are Freud and Nietzsche. For them, to seek meaning—whether in a text, dream, discourse, or institution—is, first and foremost, to suspect 'truth as lying'. It is my contention that Ricoeur could well have named Dostoevsky as a third master of this modern school of interpretation, for he, too, was preoccupied with exploring the possibility of 'truth as lying', whether to others or to oneself. The general concern of my essay is to clarify Dostoevsky's relation to the modern 'hermeneutics of suspicion' in a manner which is mutually illuminating. The particular focus is on Dostoevsky's hermeneutics of suspicion as employed in The Brothers Karamazov, especially with the object of deciphering the avowed 'love of humanity' which motivates Ivan Karamazov's famous 'rebellion' against God. Ivan's humanism is highly ambiguous, as his words and actions (of omission and commission) throughout the novel demonstrate. I attempt to show that the ambiguity of Ivan Karamazov can be illumined as an exercise of suspicion on Dostoevsky's part which distinguishes between the manifest sources of Ivan's moral stance and what is in reality its hidden basis. And, in order to situate Dostoevsky in relation to the modern 'school of suspicion', his interpretation of the ambiguous text of modern humanism is compared with that of Nietzsche. The dialogue which the essay sets up between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky on the problem embodied by Ivan Karamazov reveals areas of convergence and divergence: the former apparent in a shared suspicion of a secular humanism which affirms the love of humanity apart from religious faith; and the latter apparent in their different understandings of love—whether of humanity or of God. The comparison between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, then, highlights the distinction between a hermeneutics of sus~<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23922199<br>
Date: 12 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Schleicher Marianne<br>
Abstract: Responding to the ethical and performative call of Judith Butler not to propagate the sex- and gender-related violence of the imbedded discourse that we study, this article inquires into the discursive strategies of Jewish scripture by analysing how it orchestrates certain norms of sex and gender and makes them serve the overall aim of securing cultural survival. Following this, it traces reflections on persons of ambiguous or indeterminate sex from rabbinic to modern Judaism so as to inquire into the rabbinic dependency on scripture when non-conforming individuals challenge its bipolar sex and gender system. Finally, the article considers if scripture, as suggested by Butler, can play a subversive role in how we attend to non-conforming others today. To do so, the author's distinction between hermeneutical and artifactual uses of scripture is presented to evaluate the extent to which modern Jews and non-Jews are able to influence their own representations of sex and gender and thus liberate themselves from the normativity implied by scriptural discourse.<br>

Author(s): Hall W. David<br>
Abstract: This essay takes Paul Ricoeur's use of the phrase "economy of the gift" as an opportunity to explore the relationship between theology, ethics, and poetic redescription. A primay focus is Ricoeur's juxtaposition of the golden rule and the love command, the manner in which these two are poetically related by biblical discourse, and what this means for theological ethics. This focus offers the opportunity to explore some of the more radical implications of Ricoeur's claims about the poetic, redescriptive function of religious discourse, implications that were not adequately addressed by Ricoeur himself.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object h~<br>

Abstract: I offer some comments from the perspective of someone familiar with the work of Paul Ricoeur on Allan Bell's proposal that discourse studies take a hermeneutic turn drawing on Ricoeur's idea of an arc of interpretation. I suggest that such a hermeneutic turn would need to be more radical than Bell proposes in that he limits it largely to questions of method, without really addressing how it might affect our understanding of either the object of discourse studies or the goal of such studies. This does raise the question, however, whether discourse studies should be considered a subdiscipline of hermeneutical philosophy.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Scott-Baumann Alison<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Abstract: This article critically assesses Bell's attempt at transforming discourse analysis into discourse interpretation by means of hermeneutics as developed by Paul Ricoeur. If a hermeneutic turn is to take place in a discipline that proceeds according to the principles of empirical research, cognitive hermeneutics is the better option compared to Ricoeur's hermeneutics. Part I presents a short introduction to cognitive hermeneutics as developed by Tepe. Against this background, some central theses of Ricoeur's hermeneutics, on which Bell's approach is based, are discussed in part II.<br>

Author(s): Wodak Ruth<br>
Abstract: This article discusses different theoretical and methodological approaches in the humanities and social sciences which strive to analyse and understand, interpret and explain texts and discourses in systematic, qualitative ways. After reviewing some of the salient theories in the social sciences (such as objective hermeneutics and critical hermeneutics), I argue that critical discourse studies require a 'trichotomy' consisting of explanation, interpretation and critique. Other approaches such as Ricoeur's 'hermeneutic arc' seem to neglect important structural and material dimensions of context as well as critical self-reflection. Moreover, I argue that much intuitive and non-transparent speculation in Hermeneutics might be transcended if more historical, cultural, linguistic and philological knowledges would be systematically and explicitly integrated into the analysis of text and discourse, in a retroductable manner. The latter possibility is illustrated by applying an interdisciplinary framework to some brief examples (e.g. intercultural and historical translation studies; the discourse-historical approach in critical discourse studies).<br>

Abstract: Text interpretation – the main interest of discourse analysts – is a central component of the text understanding process. In this article we introduce the Landscape Model, which describes the cognitive processes underlying reading comprehension in a detailed and precise manner. Moreover, this model captures the interpretative processes in which the human mind engages during reading. Within the context of the Landscape Model, we describe the relation between discourse understanding and discourse interpretation, and explain some of the phenomena that are central to the field of discourse analysis as seen from a cognitive perspective. In the first section we describe the basic cognitive processes that underlie discourse understanding, as captured by the Landscape Model. In the following section we illustrate the way that the Landscape Model can be applied to the work of discourse analysts. We conclude by discussing the usefulness of the cognitive Landscape Model for the field of discourse analysis.<br>

Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: The nine responses to my focus article 'Re-constructing Babel: Discourse analysis, hermeneutics and the Interpretive Arc' are cross-disciplinary, as is the article itself. They come from discourse studies (Van Dijk, Billig, Wodak), cognitive science (Tepe, Yeari and Van den Broek, Van Dijk), Old Testament studies (Billig), hermeneutics (Pellauer, Scott-Baumann), history (Gardner) and literature (Pratt). I identify and address five main issues which I see these responses raising for discourse interpretation: the role of author intent and the original sociocultural context in interpretation; principles of translation, particularly in relation to the Babel story; issues of certainty and subjectivism in interpretation, again including the Babel story; the role and limitations of cognitive approaches, and the potential of images like 'unfolding the matter of the text' to be realized in teaching hands-on discourse work; and finally a call to new listening in the encounter with hermeneutics, as a route to freshening the field I like to call Discourse Interpretation.<br>

Abstract: In this article, Levinas' ethical metaphysics is analyzed and his contribution to present-day philosophy is described. In his philosophy, ethics is not something that originates in the autonomous will, as Kant would have premised. It is, rather, the result of the traumatic rupturing of the I by the Other, a heteronomous event. The I's passivity in being opened by the Other is highlighted by Levinas in the words "substitution," "obsession," and "being elected." The I, in the critical Others' eyes, is guilty. The infinity in the Other's demand, regarding the I, is divine. It would be a fatal misunderstanding of Levinas to think that, with the insertion of the word "God," he becomes a theologian. In this article the relation between ethics and politics is discussed and their relation to God is pointed to. In this way, Levinas' discourse on God is demonstrated as being fitting for our time, after the crisis of humanism during the Holocaust. In the course of the article, the question of whether there "is" a God in the eyes of Levinas, and if man "needs" Him is answered. In other words, the logical status of the word "God" in Levinas' philosophy is defined.<br>

Abstract: The article deals with the problem of revelation in Levinas' writings. The first part of the article analizes Levinas' ideas on the Same and the Other, more particularly the topics of the face and of discourse, as these come to the fore in the first section of Totality and Infinity. Investigating the non-totalising relationship between the Same and the Other presents us with the suitable framework for understanding the relation between the finite and the Infinite. Leaving out any ontotheological speech, Levinas shows how Metaphysics is enacted in the ethical relation. The second part cootinues with a description of Levinas' position on revelation in the Jewish tradition. The active Interpretation of Biblical texts "beyond the verse" represents an opportunity of hearing the divine word today and to enter into a more primordial Order than the Order of the Same. In the course of the article, we point to affinities and striking similarities between E. Levinas' and F. Rosenzweig's view on revelation. We also demonstrate how Levinas Orients his Jewish writings to his philosophy of the Other and vice versa. In writing on revelation, Levinas' main concern seems to be the description of the possibility of a fracture in the immanent order of totality and in the self-sufficiency of reason which is its correlative. This fraction is produced by the command "thou shalt not kill", calling the Same to open itself to the Other.<br>

Abstract: The study of causes and chance events that happened to connect two distant musical traditions may help understand some aspects of both. Certain basic principles, often only implied, become apparent as we look at them from a different standpoint. And it grows clear that sundry meanings are given to the word "influence", so ubiquitous in discourse on cultural exchange. By discussing some specific traits of sub-Saharan music, the Author explores how and why some major 20th-century Western composers came to welcome its influence, thus establishing relationships that reveal (apart from superficial comparison) how such musical concepts as "influence", "tradition", and "innovation" developed in Africa and in Western music, and how they were received in academia. This work is rooted in the Author's personal experience in musical analysis, from Togo to European scholarship.<br>

Author(s): Serra Alice Mara<br>
Abstract: The concept Deckerinnerung (en. screen-memory), which appeared in Freud's work in 1899, points towards the important epistemological question about the possibility of adequation or coincidence (Deckung) between past experience and the current act that is being presentified. This can take the form of remembering as such or be conceived as fantasy. In order to clarify the differences between fantasy and memory, or rather their interconnection in the Deckerinnerung, they need to be looked at phenomenologically, and in doing so various aspects should be analysed, such as: the character of positional and neutralised acts of presentification; the interference of conscious attention and the phenomenon of inhibition in the act of presentification; the state of memories in the unconscious and the possibilities of their association between themselves or modification by other current acts. While Freud introduces the subject without further analysing it, Husserl's theories offer a valuable contribution here. In this context, there is first a need to outline the way in which Husserl's investigations into memory come close to Freud's discourse, in the sense that they lead to a "Phenomenology of the Unconscious" (Hua XI; Mat. VIII).<br>

Abstract: En este artículo se aborda la diversidad de tipos o dimensiones del discurso implícito. En concreto, se plantea una caracterización tipológica del mismo basada en las intenciones del productor del discurso, distinguiéndose cuatro dimensiones básicas: el discurso insinuado, el discurso ocultado, el discurso «fallido» y el discurso subyacente. Después de ofrecer ejemplos de cada uno de ellos, se sostiene la utilidad de la tipología propuesta para el análisis sociológico del discurso implícito, esto es, para su detección y su interpretación. This article discusses the variety of types or dimensions of implicit discourse. Specifically, a typological characterisation is proposed, based on the intentions of the producer of the discourse, including a distinction between four basic dimensions: insinuated discourse, hidden discourse, ‘failed’ discourse and underlying discourse. Some examples are provided of each dimension, and then it is held that the proposed typology is useful for the sociological analysis of implicit discourse, that is, for its detection and interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Encroachments of contemporary social theory on the field of theology are the focal point of this essay. In postmodernity, theology facilitates connections with social theory. In the domain of theology, sociocultural problems are being presented as theological issues. Secularized variants of world theology meet with theologizing postsecular social theory above and beyond sociology. This is facilitated by the constant discourse of ambiguity. In this discourse, "the theological" is a vehicle of indeterminate meanings. Praxis' oriented discourse uses the term "social theory" with its modernist connotative envelope of science and rationality, but with no obligation whatsoever to maintain objectivity of cognition. Sociology doesn't interfere with theological discourse, but may analyze it, leaving the otherworldly outside its perspective on sociocultural phenomena. The sociotheological discourse of ambiguity, however, opposes both religion and the rationality of science.<br>

Abstract: Polish literary theory developed very quickly in the 1960's and 1970's. Its main field of research is structure of literary works, including versology, stylistics, narrative, literary communication, descriptive and historical poetics. It was mostly inspired by phenomenology and Roman Ingarden, a disciple of Husserl and founder of phenomenological theory of literary work, which focused on the intentional structure of literary work and its concretization by readers. The second important source of inspiration for Polish literary theory was structuralism, including Russian Formalism, the Prague Circle and original Polish literary researches before the Second World War. After 1989 the entire field of literary theory in Poland was deeply changed. Formalist perspective was replaced by research concentrated on broad cultural, political, and economical contexts of literature, its ideological determinations as well as forms of symbolic power reflected in a literary work. Literature itself is no more treated as structure or text, but rather as discourse, reflecting and at the same time forming social reality. Analytical tools are mainly provided by French poststructuralist theory, hermeneutics, pragmatism, American cultural studies, feminism and postcolonialism. Inspirée par deux tendances prédominantes : la phénoménologie (dont le représentant le plus important a été Roman Ingarden, disciple de Husserl et fondateur de la théorie phénoménologique de l'œuvre littéraire, centrée sur la structure intentionnelle de l'œuvre et sa concrétisation par le lecteur) et le structuralisme (y compris les influences venues du formalisme russe, de l'École de Prague, ainsi que des recherches polonaises menées avant la Seconde Guerre mondiale), la théorie de la littérature en Pologne s'est développée très rapidement dans les années 60 et 70. Elle s'est intéressée à la structure de l'œuvre littéraire (versologie, stylistique, narration, communication littéraire, poétique descriptive et historiqu~<br>

Abstract: Rapprocher théologie et théâtre permet de comprendre en quoi consiste chez Novarina l'unité d'un drame dont le discours est profondément rhapsodique et l'achèvement à chaque fois mystérieux. En prenant pour fil conducteur ce que Novarina dit de cette cathédrale à ciel ouvert qu'est la théologie et singulièrement de la dernière page du De Trinitate d'Augustin, cette étude fait apparaître le sens eschatologique du théâtre novarinien et le rôle structurel qu'y joue la prière. Bringing together theology and theatre allows us to understand what constitutes, in Novarina's work, the unity of a drama whose discourse is profoundly rhapsodic and whose completion is always mysterious. Taking as a guiding thread Novarina's account of the open-air cathedral of theology, in particular the last page of Augustine's De Trinitate, this study reveals the eschatological meaning of Novarinian theatre and the structural role that prayer plays in this work.<br>

Abstract: This forum gathers together a set of essays composed in response to the 2011 special issue of Religion & Literature 42.1–2, titled "Something Fearful": Medievalist Scholars on the "Religious Turn" in Literary Criticism, edited by Kathryn Kerby-Fulton and Jonathan Juilfs. The forum's ten authors reflect both on essays within the original volume and on the broader questions engaged by it and through its very publication; responsive remarks from Kathryn Kerby-Fulton and two contributors to that initiating volume conclude the conversation. Through conversation, response, and critical engagement, the forum's contributors weigh questions of the language of belief in scholarly discourse, of the continuities of religious practice across history, of the assumptions and beliefs undergirding critical work on religion and literature and culture, and of the acknowledgement of the religious convictions of medievalists' scholarly subjects, scholars, and the communities of both.<br>

Abstract: Cet article analyse les expériences de mobilité interne de femmes atteintes par le VIH résidant au moment des enquêtes ethnographiques dans la ville de Gondar, dans le nord-ouest de l'Éthiopie. Les expériences biographiques de cinq femmes séropositives, vivant dans des conditions de marginalité sociale et originaires de zones rurales, seront étudiées plus largement dans les principales configurations que la mobilité féminine interne prend en fonction de l'âge et de l'origine sociale des sujets migrants. L'article mettra au jour le caractère multiforme et la condition permanente d'instabilité de ces parcours migratoires. Initiés depuis un premier projet de départ, ils se sont poursuivis au fil des opportunités et des contraintes que les femmes migrantes ont rencontrées tout au long de leur parcours de migration dans une tension constante vers un avenir que les expériences biographiques cristallisent comme le temps du changement. Nous démontrerons que l'état de séropositivité au VIH, avec ses manifestations et ses conséquences, apparaît comme un facteur de conditionnement prééminent sans pour autant constituer une « rupture biographique ». Il participe au processus d'« assujettissement » d'individus se situant en marge de la société et des espaces d'action des pouvoirs établis. Plus particulièrement, l'analyse de la relation subjective de ces femmes aux normes et aux catégories du discours dominant présidant à la construction de leur « identité sociale virtuelle », mettra en exergue que le VIH représente à la fois une opportunité et une contrainte dans la détermination de leur relation subjective à l'avenir. This article analyses the experiences of internal mobility of HIV-positive women who at the moment of the ethnographic surveys lived in the city of Gondar, in North Western Ethiopia. The "biographical experiences" of five women who migrated from rural areas and used to live in conditions of social marginality will be placed in the context of a wider analysis of th~<br>

Abstract: Les années 1960 apparaissent comme un moment de profonde remise en question du système scolaire (particulièrement du modèle secondaire), tant du fait des réformes initiées par les premiers gouvernements de la Cinquième République que de la dynamique des débats publics de cette décennie, couronnée par le colloque d'Amiens, en mars 1968. Or l'étude systématique du discours tenu dans la presse sur ce sujet montre que l'affichage zélé d'un consensus apparent masque de profondes incertitudes quant au modèle scolaire qu'il faudrait inventer en remplacement du système présenté comme unanimement condamné. On constate également que ce large accord ignore l'importance des pesanteurs conservatrices, qui, même marginalisées, peuvent facilement alimenter des doutes, qui ne manqueront pas de s'exprimer si une situation conflictuelle vient à se présenter. The 1960's appear as a moment when real doubts concerning the French School system (particularly the traditional Secondary model) came to light, partly because of the reforms initiated by the first governments of the Fifth Republic but also as a result of the state of the discussions arising over that decade, and coming to a head at the colloquium held in Amiens in March 1968. However, the systematic study of the discourse held in the newspapers about this subject reveals that the zealous show of an apparent consensus masked deep uncertainties relating to the school model which needed to be invented to replace the widely condemned system. We also notice that this broad agreement ignored the importance of conservative obstacles which, even when marginalised, could easily fuel doubts, and would certainly be expressed as soon as a conflictual situation arose.<br>

Abstract: Rethinking, 29, n. 120. I use the phrase in debating the views of Tamar
Chana Reich, "A Battlefield of a Text: Inner Textual Interpretation in the Sanskrit
Mahäbhärata," Ph.D. dissertation, Chicago: University of Chicago, 1998:
"Granted we 'know' the Mbh as a text that 'grew, and became what it is by expan-
sion' (with italics), but not that it took eight 'centuries of textual production.'...
Reich [thinks the Mbh develops through] eight-hundred year[s]... of 'contestatory
discourse' governed by an 'aesthetic of expansion' (citing Reich 51, 32, and 31 suc-
cessively). This aesthetic better befits a short period of controlled, consensual 'con-
testation,' and also shared conventions, which do not last forever" - indeed, my
note goes on to show that "Reich sometimes points in this direction." It is in any
case the first thing I say in the book about conventions (353 [Index]).<br>

Abstract: Official collective statements of Catholic bishops construct and promote the imaginary of the Philippines as "Catholic nation." This conflation of the body Catholic and the body politic has served as the church's platform for defending its interests in education against perceived nationalist threats and for engaging social issues. This article traces the genealogy of this discourse and uncovers its distorted account of the Filipino nation's emergence and its deductive pastoral logic. Given the inevitable link between "the religious" and "the secular," the imaginary is challenged today by the call for greater inclusivity and the impact of digital connectivity on community, whether religious or national.<br>

Abstract: Cécile et Étienne sont amants. Elle est âgée de trente-six ans, mariée et mère, vit à Paris; il a dix ans de moins, est célibataire, provincial et sans expérience sexuelle. Leur importante correspondance a été déposée à l'Association pour l'autobiographie et le patrimoine autobiographique (APA) et constitue une source d'une grande richesse. Faisant appel à la microhistoire et attentive à l'analyse des discours, nous proposons de suivre le développement de l'histoire d'amour de Cécile et Étienne entre 1945 et 1960, en s'attardant sur ses prémices entre 1945 et 1949. L'analyse d'une relation adultère vécue de l'intérieur permet de mieux comprendre les métamorphoses de l'intimité au cours de cette période du baby-boom, en particulier les rôles masculin et féminin. Cette histoire singulière permet aussi d'éclairer, par un jeu de contrastes, les représentations de la conjugalité pendant les décennies d'après-guerre — période de doutes au sujet de l'intimité. En quoi ce couple adultère interroge-t-il et contourne-t-il les normes conjugales, tout en cherchant à s'y conformer? Cécile and Étienne were lovers. She was a thirty-six year-old mother, married and living in Paris; he was ten years younger, single, living in the suburbs and lacking in sexual experience. Their vast correspondence, deposited with the Association pour l'autobiographie et le patrimoine autobiographique (APA, Association for Autobiography and Autobiographical Heritage), constitutes a documentary source of great value. Referencing the phenomenon of microhistory and relying upon discourse analysis, we shall attempt to follow the trajectory of Cécile and Étienne's relationship between 1945 and 1960, focusing in particular on its beginnings from 1945 to 1949. Analysing an adulterous relationship from such an inside perspective will shed light on the metamorphosis of intimacy that occurred during the Baby Boom era, in particular with regard to male and female gender roles. By playing with contrasts, this uni~<br>

Abstract: Au Bénin, depuis les débuts des années 1990, le processus institutionnel de connexion mémorielle entre le passé de l'esclavage et les pratiques cultuelles vodun a été scandé par le Festival Ouidah 92 et le lancement, sous l'égide de l'Unesco, de l'itinéraire intercontinental de la Route de l'Esclave. Les notions de l'oubli et du retour mises en exergue sur la Route par les deux Arbres éponymes montrent comment cet itinéraire, à la fois monumental et rituel, devrait permettre aujourd'hui à une histoire tragique de se « racheter » sous forme de discours mythique. Dans les diverses versions de ce mythe, où un lien mémoriel partagé entre oubli et retour est raconté et donné à voir, les récits locaux de l'esclavage font surface en se métamorphosant dans l'actualité patrimoniale et politique de la situation. De tels récits n'adhèrent pas pourtant aux diverses rhétoriques internationales et nationales, officielles et diasporiques, prônant, en quelque sorte, une pacification et une démocratisation de l'histoire. Since the early 1990s in Benin, the institutional process of connecting through memorials the past of slavery and the practices of voodoo has been highlighted by the Ouidah 92 Festival and the launching, under the auspices of Unesco, of the intercontinental itinerary of the Slave Route. Two eponymous trees on this road draw attention to the concepts of oblivion and return, thus showing how, thanks to this monumental and ritual itinerary, a tragic history should be able to « redeem » itself in the form of a mythical discourse. In the various versions of this myth, which tells about and visually presents a shared link between forgetting and remembering, local accounts of slavery rise to the surface while being metamorphosed in the patrimonial and political relevance of the situation. Such accounts do not adhere to international or national forms of rhetoric, whether from officials or from the diaspora, that tend to advocate a pacification and democratization of histor~<br>

Transformation der Philosophie, Band 2, 256. His hésitation concerning whether to call the ideal

Abstract: I cannot go into the question whether substances can be such self-causing causes and
consequently how agency could be conceived in a metaphysics of substances. Moreland and
McRae (2000) argue for such an approach in their important work on anthropology and eth-
ics. I conclu with their spirit (a defense of the notion of soul in a biblical sense), without shar-
ing their mind-bodv dualism and the metaphysics behind it. One could make a case, I think, of
the statement that in their account the substantiveness of the body gradually disappears, in
spite of their body — soul dualism. Another issue is the distinctness between biblical and scien-
tific language. An important argument in almost all dualist accounts is the séparation between
body and 'soul' at death. I am not convinced that this 'séparation' can be used as an argument
for body-soul dualism as a philosophical position. Is what occurs at the moment of death not
just as mysterious as what occurs at the moment of conception (and in God's act of création)?
By introducing the biblical notion of the soul in a scientific discourse on mind-body dualism,
one is coerced to adapt the biblical meaning of the concept to the prevailing ontology of sub-
stances and entities; and this almost always implies not only réduction (loss of meaning), but
also adoption of certain conceptual characteristics inherent in the metaphysics of substances
(such as separateness of substances; or self-sustenance; or being bearer of a bundie of fea-
tures).<br>

Abstract: Auch wenn vielerorts von der Vernachlässigung der Kirchengeschichte im Religionsunterricht gesprochen und ein mangelndes Geschichtsbewusstsein beklagt wird, sind Schülerinnen und Schüler durchaus für Geschichte und auch Kirchengeschichte ansprechbar. Die Herausforderung besteht heute jedoch darin, sie dazu zu befähigen, mit dem Wissen über Geschichte umzugehen, ihr Leben mit Geschichte sinnbringend und verantwortungsvoll zu gestalten. Gerade hierfür stellt die jüdisch-christliche Tradition wertvolle Ressourcen bereit. Ausgehend von der jüdisch-christlichen Tradition und im Diskurs mit der Geschichtsphilosophie möchte ich dazu anregen, mit Schülerinnen und Schülern im Religionsunterricht eine Form des Eingedenkens in der Perspektive der Hoffung zu entwickeln. Hierbei wird eine Gedächtnishaltung intendiert, die nicht in der Idee einer reinen Fortschrittsgeschichte aufgeht, sondern zurückblickt, sich den Tiefen und Ambivalenzen vergangenen Leids stellt und die Toten in die Vision einer besseren Gesellschaft einbezieht. Dabei bleibt das Gedächtnis stets dem Leben und der Zukunft zugewandt und gibt ethische Impulse für die Gegenwart. Gerade im Religionsunterricht können Schülerinnen und Schüler befähigt werden, zu „Redenden und Handelnden“ der Geschichte zu werden, auch indem der Frage Raum gegeben wird, woraus Kraft für Erinnerungsarbeit geschöpft werden kann und welche Hoffnungsperspektiven bestehen. Even if neglect of Church History in Religious Education is widely criticised and complaints are heard about a lack of historical consciousness, pupils -female and male – are often found to be quite open to history and church history. The challenge today consists in helping them to deal with their knowledge of history, to create a relationship, or life, with history in a way that makes sense and is actually responsible. For this purpose the Jewish-Christian tradition offers valuable resources. Based on the Jewish-Christian tradition, and in discourse with the philosophy of~<br>

Abstract: In her interpretation of Freudian psychology Madelon Sprengnether conceives the figure of the spectral
mother as the recurrent metaphor of the presence of the absent, prompted by memory. The mother's body
becomes in his view the locus of desire and endless return; its loss the necessary step for ego formation: "The
mother's body becomes that which is longed for yet cannot be appropriated, a representative of both home
and not home, and hence, in Freud's terms, the site of the uncanny. As both origin and Other, the preoedipal
mother escapes the equally devastating effects of idealization and erasure, allowing for the possibility of maternal
discourse as well as a non-phallocentrically organised view of culture" (Sprengnether 1990, 9).<br>

Article Title: Hayden White: Beyond Irony<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342993<br>
Date: 5 1, 1965<br>
Author(s): White Ewa<br>
Abstract: A crisis of our age that is usually identified with the loss of the sacred was one of the causes of the fall into irony in the nineteenth century. In the case of historians, as Hayden White has shown in Metahistory, this irony was caused by a "bitterness" stemming from the failure of reality to fulfill their expectations. An ironic apprehension of the world arose in an atmosphere of social breakdown or cultural decline. A current stage of irony manifests itself in a doubt as to the capacity of language to grasp reality. Thus we live in a "prison house of language." An intellectual parlor-game produces "second-hand knowledge" that cannot satisfy the needs of post-postmodern men and women still looking for another metanarrative. Therefore, the main purpose of this essay is to answer the question: how can we go beyond irony? This text is a "post-postmodern post mortem to postmodernism." I am grateful to post-modernism for many things, especially for giving me an alternative apprehension of the world in terms of difference and continuity rather than binary oppositions, but I am tired of ontological insecurity and epistemological chaos. I need order. I miss metanarrative. In trying to break with some modern/postmodern "principles" and retain within my discourse the premodernist perspective, I follow the current trend in the humanities. We observe at present the breakdown of methodology and the rise of a more poetic approach in the human sciences. Evidence of this phenomenon is the more autobiographical form of writing in anthropology (James Clifford, Clifford Geertz) and a more literary style in historical writing (Natalie Zemon Davis, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Simon Schama). This trend is associated with a revaluation of the subjective aspects of research. Perhaps, and I would welcome it, it also could be identified with a reappearance of a Collingwoodian idea of history as human self-knowledge, knowledge about human nature, knowledge about "what it is to be a man... wha~<br>

Author(s): Brashier K. E.<br>
Abstract: K. E. Brashier analyzes the symbolic discourse surrounding a prominent image in many Chinese ancestral stone memorials, namely an ornate tree beside a pavilion where a figure is receiving homage. He traces the arboreal image back to the ancient poem "Birchleaf Pear," which exhorts future generations to safeguard the tree because the Duke of Shao had rested there. He then shows that, in Han literary texts justifying the building of ancestral memorials, the tree stands for long-lived physical things that survive into the present. Symbols can conflate allusions. The central figure within the pavilion is the tomb dedicatee as a Duke of Shao, and the shrine is to be preserved just as the Duke's tree was never to be felled. Past hero and present shrine dedicatee merge into a single icon.<br>

Abstract: On September 11, 2001, the passengers and crew members aboard Flight 93 responded to the hijacking of their airplane by organizing a counterattack against the hijackers. The airplane crashed into an unpopulated field, causing no damage to human lives or national landmarks beyond the lives of those aboard the airplane. We draw on this story of courageous collective action to explore the question of what makes this kind of action possible. We propose that to take courageous collective action, people need three narratives-a personal narrative that helps them understand who they are beyond the immediate situation and manage the intense emotions that accompany duress, a narrative that explains the duress that has been imposed upon them sufficiently to make moral and practical judgments about how to act, and a narrative of collective action-and the resources that make the creation of these narratives feasible. We also consider how the creation of these narratives is relevant to courageous collective action in more common organizational circumstances, and identify how this analysis suggests new insights into our understanding of the core framing tasks of social movements, ways in which social movement actors draw on social infrastructure, the role of discourse and morality in social movements, the formation of collective identity, and resource mobilization.<br>

Abstract: Envisagée dans une perspective discursive et énonciative, l'opération historiographique se révèle être une mise en discours du passé et de son espace. En tant que configuration et représentation, elle se fonde sur différents types de mémoire individuelle et collective qu'elle configure par différents moyens discursifs et rhétoriques. Suffisamment compréhensive, elle contribue à l'institution de régimes et de logiques de spatio-temporalité qui, eux-mêmes marqués dans le temps et dans l'espace, correspondent à des régimes de vérité pratique, ayant une efficacité discursive dans le présent. Éloignées dans l'espace et dans le temps comme c'est le cas pour la Grèce antique ou plus proches de nous, ces opérations d'" historiopoiésis " reposent sur des approches anthropologiques. /// From the discursive perspective of speech acts, the writing of history turns out to be the working out of a discourse about the past and its space. As a configuration and representation, it has grounds in various types of individual and collective memories that it configures using diverse discursive and rhetorical means. Sufficiently comprehensive, it helps institute spatiotemporal systems and "logics" that, with markers of time and space, correspond to systems of practical truth with discursive effectiveness in the present. Whether remote in space and time (as in the case of Ancient Greece) or close to us, these "historiopoiesis" operations rely on anthropological approaches.<br>

Abstract: This study, divided in two installments (parts I & II; part III), interprets operatic culture at the Munich court between c. 1680 and c. 1740 (1731). An introduction (part I) relates this theatrical and metaphorical practice to a theory of discourse which identifies a normative classicist aesthetic in courtly art of this period. In Munich, in particular, a 'classicist vision' was put on stage in order to present the House of Wittelsbach as a cultural heir of antiquity. Special characteristics included the recurring theme of the Wittelsbach descendancy from the ancient royal house of Thebes, a focus on ancient heroes who had been statesmen or city founders, and the selection of rare operatic subjects such as Amphion and Niobe, Oedipus and Epaminondas. There was a striving for self-historicization (for example, through a revival performance in 1715 of an emblematic scene from Steffani's opera Niobe, 1688) and an interest in pseudo-ancient ritual scenes and choruses. Part II describes the repertory from c. 1680 to c. 1715, part III the one after 1715, in which, among other things, the Italian libretto reform, the court poets Antonio Salvi and Domenico Lalli, and several Pietro Torri opera scores are discussed.<br>

Author(s): Carr David<br>
Abstract: In this paper I look at narrative as a mode of explanation and at various ways in which the explanatory value of narrative has been criticized. I begin with the roots of narrative explanation in everyday action, experience, and discourse, illustrating it with the help of a simple example. I try to show how narrative explanation is transformed and complicated by circumstances that take us beyond the everyday into such realms as jurisprudence, journalism, and history. I give an account of why narrative explanation normally satisfies us, and how or in what sense it actually explains. Then I consider how narrative is challenged and rejected as a mode of explanation in many scientific and other contexts and why attempts are made to replace it with something else. I try to evaluate the nature and sources of these challenges, and I describe this controversy over narrative against the historical background of its emergence. My paper ends with a pragmatic defense of narrative explanation against these challenges.<br>

Abstract: The last two decades have been fascinating and productive ones for theorists of religion. Recent work has offered a remarkably wide range of theoretical perspectives and possibilities that enrich our field even as they plunge us into vigorous theoretical debates. Amidst this contest-even confusion-some basic principles for guiding future work seem to be asserting themselves. Many think that, after a century of confusion and intermingling between theology and the study of religion, scholars of religion are finally in a position to establish the study of religion on properly academic, theoretical foundations. In this story Eliade's antireductionist discourse of the "sacred" becomes the epitome and, it is hoped, the last gasp of religious studies as a quasi-theological discourse. Yet despite their efforts to guide the study of religion away from Eliade, many remain Eliadan insofar as they accept Eliade's "locative" approach to religion. Yet is it really "theology" that is currently limiting the way we "imagine religion," or might it be instead the refusal to think beyond religion's locative function-a refusal very closely linked to the desire for academic respectability in a historicist age? Mark C. Taylor's After God provocatively disturbs the idea that religion is primarily locative and, in doing so, also disturbs the boundaries between the theological and the theoretical, religion and the study of religion. I consider the significance of this virtual map of religion, by reading After God with and against J. Z. Smith's early reflections or experiments with the ideas of chaos, incongruity, and location. I argue that Taylor's book leads us back to paths from which Smith turned in his early work.<br>

Abstract: The trial of Adolf Eichmann, in 1961, is generally considered a turning point in the history of Holocaust memory because it brought the Holocaust into the public sphere for the first time as a discrete event on an international scale. In the same year, Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin's film Chronicle of a Summer appeared in France. While absent from scholarship on memory of the Nazi genocide for over forty years, Chronicle of a Summer contains a scene of Holocaust testimony that suggests the need to look beyond the Eichmann trial for alternative articulations of public Holocaust remembrance. This essay considers the juxtaposition in Chronicle of a Summer of Holocaust memory and the history of decolonization in order to rethink the "unique" place that the Holocaust has come to hold in discourses on extreme violence. The essay argues that a discourse of truth and testimony arose in French resistance to the Algerian war that shaped and was shaped by memory of the Nazi genocide.<br>

Author(s): Tourage Mahdi<br>
Abstract: This paper is a phenomenological study of one of Simin Behbahani's better known poems, "Raqqaseh," which is about the nightly ritualized dance of a dancing girl in a tavern. It will argue that the tavern in this poem could be viewed as a cultural container for socially dangerous representations and impulses, like the metaphoric sexualized body of the dancing girl. The tavern could also be viewed as a semiotic register for the symbolic representation of the dominant normative social discourse. By viewing the dance as performance, the communicative association of the symbolic significance of the dancing girl's body and the tavern and its audience will also be discussed. This paper will argue that the reader too is implicated in the performative function of the text.<br>

Author(s): Banerjee Sanjoy<br>
Abstract: How does international interaction shape states' patterns of thought, emotion, and action? This paper examines the processes by which motives and practices feed each other in reproducing historical structures. An artificial intelligence model defines state-subjects as cultures combining special meanings that produce causal attribution, state self-identification, emotions, and action motives. These special meanings are built from subjective cultural categories describing social acts and group character of the self and others. Anger, pride, fear, and relief motivate action. A collection of such subject-cultures may produce a pattern of actions that reiterates the cultures. The model discriminates between those combinations of elements in special meanings which reproduce subjects and historical structures, and those which do not. The meanings discovered in such reproduction analysis can be validated by discourse analysis.<br>

Article Title: International Relations and the Search for Thinking Space: Another View of the Third Debate<br>
Publisher: Butterworth Publishers<br>
Issue: i324420<br>
Date: 9 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): George Jim<br>
Abstract: Recent debates in International Relations have seen some of the characteristic dichotomies of the discipline under severe and sophisticated challenge. The proposition, for example, that the study of International Relations, is somehow "independent" of mainstream debates on theory and practice in the social sciences is now widely rejected. The disciplines change in attitude on this issue owes much, in the 1980s, to the influences of an as yet small group of scholars who have infused the "third debate" in International Relations with an appreciation for previously "alien" approaches to knowledge and society, drawn from interdisciplinary sources, which repudiate (meta) theoretical dualism in all its forms. Utilizing the sponge term "postpositivism" Yosef Lapid has concentrated on an important aspect of the "third debate," one which has seen positivist based perspectives repudiated in favor of critical perspectives derived, primarily, from debates on the philosophy of science. This paper takes a broader view of the "third debate" in focusing on some of the broader patterns of dissent in social theory that are now evident in its literature. It argues that for all the differences associated with the new critical social theory approaches, theirs is critique with common purpose. Its purpose: to help us understand more about contemporary global life by opening up for questioning dimensions of inquiry which have been previously closed off and supressed; by listening closely to voices previously unheard; by examining "realities" excluded from consideration under a traditional (realist) regime of unity and singularity. Its purpose, reiterated: the search for "thinking space" within an International Relations discipline produced by and articulated through Western modernist discourse.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to analyse some questions proposed by the debate on the issue of modernity and post-modernity in the context of the philosophy of Leonardo Coimbra, from the reflection on these issues made by Jürgen Habermas in the work
         The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity. Thus, the critique to modern reason, the reflection on the metaphysics, the issues about the relationship between reason and faith, the religious phenomenon, the process of secularization, are our starting point for the questioning and the philosophical understanding that postmodernity makes of these problems The inauguration of this new rationality allows a new questioning about the reason and the world, manifesting the sublime character of its nature, allowing a new reflection, a critique of self-sufficient and self-reflexive reason and recovering another discursive and cooperative form of reason.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur porte un regard critique sur la construction d'un objet historique qui, pour retracer l'histoire des pratiques de lecture sur le long terme (des années trente à nos jours) et cerner les processus d'appropriation des textes lus en milieu ouvrier, a nécessité le recours à une démarche d'investigation en histoire orale. Il aborde donc les grandes questions méthodologiques puis précise quelques résultats de l'analyse des discours en insistant sur leur apport fructueux pour l'histoire socioculturelle. The author takes a critical look at the construction of an historical object which, in order to relate the history of reading practices over the long term (from the 1930s to today) and bring to the fore the appropriation process of texts read in a working class milieu, meant undertaking an investigation involving oral history. It discusses the main methodological questions and then indicates some results of the analysis of the discourse, while insisting on their fruitful contribution to socio-cultural history.<br>

Abstract: The conflict between President John F. Kennedy and the management of the steel industry in April, 1962 has been interpreted in an unsatisfactory manner. Many of Kennedy's reactions appear to be inexplicable and do not conform with the impression of him either as an "idealist without illusions" or the calculating cynic of recent revisionist writing. This paper is an attempt to provide another understanding of Kennedy's behaviour. We argue that Kennedy was neither hero nor villain, but a practising politician aware of the obligations and function of his profession in a liberal democratic polity. We suggest that Kennedy was aware of the sensibilities of his constituency and that he possessed a finely attuned ear to the language and discourse of American politics in the early 1960s. Consequently Kennedy realised the peril, in the steel crisis, to his political standing and thus felt compelled to embark on a dramatic and potentially dangerous course of action. We attempt to sustain this argument by closely examining the political language of the participants, relying heavily for our analysis on the writings of the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, the Italian semiologist, Umberto Eco and the Russian linguist V.N. Volosinov.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo pretende abordar, desde una perspectiva analítica, la posibilidad de fundamentar las posiciones morales de la izquierda. En ese sentido, se analiza, en primer lugar, por qué la izquierda necesita de un discurso moral; una vez establecido que la izquierda es necesariamente moral, se investiga cuál puede ser la fundamentación de esa moral particular; y en tercer y último lugar, se descarta la posibilidad de que, al no encontrar fundamentación, quepa la posibilidad de omitirla. This article will try to address from an analytical position the possibility of portraying the foundations supporting the moral stances of the left. In this sense, the reason why the left needs a moral discourse is analysed in the first place; once the fact that the left is necessarily moral is established, the precise foundations supporting that specific moral is investigated; and thirdly and lastly, the possibility of omitting that supportive foundation given the absence of it, is rejected.<br>

Author(s): Wei Wang<br>
Abstract: Cogito, as the first principle of Descartes' metaphysical system, initiated the modern philosophy of consciousness, becoming both the source and subject of modern Western philosophical discourse. The philosophies of Maine de Biran, Kant, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and others developed by answering the following questions? Is consciousness substantial or not? Does consciousness require the guarantee of a transcendental subject? Is Cogito epistemological or ontological? Am I a being-for-myself or a being-for-others? Outlining the developmental history of the idea of Cogito from Descartes to Sartre is important for totally comprehending the evolution and development of Western philosophy.<br>

Abstract: This essay makes explicit what lay behind the author's earlier casual observation that "Tillich remains the unacknowledged theoretician of our entire enterprise"—whether in the AAR or in North American studies of religion more generally. While the article does not make a narrowly (i.e., archivally verified) causal claim about Tillich's influence on the study of religion in the academy, it does point out three crucial roles Tillich's thought and practice played in the development of North American religious studies. (i) Tillich's understanding of religion as an "ultimate concern" provided a language deemed suitable to the new departments of religious studies in this country's higher education institutions (especially at state-run colleges and universities). (ii) Though not uniquely formative of the academy's longstanding discourse on symbolism, Tillich's interest in the symbol served as a legitimating vote of confidence about the worth of that discourse. Moreover, his understanding of the symbol (as that which "points to") ostensibly struck a balance between Eliade's onto-realistic and Geertz's more minimal fictive views of the symbol. (iii) Through his sustained interest in cultural institutions and products of cultural labor—more than through his theories about the relation between religion and culture (e.g., his method of correlation)—Tillich inspired the "dialogic fields" (e.g., Religion and Literature) and subsequent cultural and anthropological studies of religion. The author's earlier claim, then, was intended as a double critique: first, that the study of religion in secular public institutions should ground itself in a Protestant Christian theological project; second, that this influence should remain largely unacknowledged.<br>

Author(s): Collins Kay<br>
Abstract: This Note reviews shortcomings and claims of discourse analysis (DA). In particular, it focuses on the relationship between DA and reflexivity. It argues that DA could not succeed as its supporters originally thought, because DA has not dealt adequately with the issue of reflexivity. Even now that has turned to such issues, DA has a limited interpretation of reflexivity that is related to the change in sociological focus from scientific beliefs and knowledge to the study of texts for texts' sake.<br>

Author(s): Godin Benoit<br>
Abstract: Literature discussing rhetoric is mainly concerned with rhetoric per se - its structure, and the categorization of arguments by kind. Rarely do rhetorical studies examine the actual effects on audiences, and auditors' reactions. On the other hand, sociological studies of scientific controversies look at rhetoric - or argumentation - in action, but with few references to rhetorical studies. The purpose of this paper is to integrate rhetorical studies into the sociology of technology in order to integrate the concept of action into discourse analysis. I intend to show how the use of discourse to enroll actors in a health technology is intimately linked to action. I deconstruct the promoters' strategy into two discursive components - the utility component and the fear-reduction component - to show how the rhetoric of expectations (utility) and representations (fear) contingently shape the fate of a technology.<br>

Abstract: The article explores somatic metaphors related to explosion, outburst and eruption in diverse media. This inquiry lies in the intersection among philosophy, literary criticism and history of art and its conclusions are relevant to musi-cology. It is argued that there are various basic orientations, persuasions and biases underlying specific uses of metaphors of somatic eruption. The article endeavours to propose an alternative reading of body fluids as metaphoric sites of festive critique in subversively humorous discourse and art, which differs from more prevalent psychoanalytic interpretations. A text by Hélène Cixous, as well as visual material by Jenny Saville, Cindy Sherman, Bruce Nauman and Pieter Brueghel the Elder is scrutinized. The most appropriate musical example in this context is probably (especially the introduction to) the Háry János Suite by Zoltán Kodály.* By grouping male and female artists together, an underlying picaresque or subversively humorous, non-binary and geneticist match is suggested in their work. Yet, at the same time it is argued that female body fluids present women with metaphoric vantage points that facilitate understandings beyond the borders of patriarchal culture. /// Članak se temelji na većem istraživačkom projektu koji pokušava sagledati griješnu i komičnu ili feminističku likovnu umjetnost unutar šire pikareskne tradicije vizualne kulture.

Author(s): Vincent Gilbert<br>
Abstract: Reflections by scientists, philosophers and sociologists upon the role of science as the motor of modern history show that apocalyptics can be interpreted neither as irrationalism nor as rhetorical, emphatic speech. Speaking out of the imagination, apocalyptics takes the form of a discourse that is hypercritical of and the least inexact about science, whenever scientific successes have rendered the habitual distinction between reality and model untenable. The imaginary realm of apocalyptics follows upon utopia and science fiction. However it has to be separated from "catastrophism". The latter still takes science to be a messiah because its idea of scientific develop. ment conceals favorable future effects underneath presentday catastrophic consequences. By refusing to separate intentions and effects and by objectifying science as a "totalizing" power, apocalyptics, on the other hand, leads to an irreversible situation that identifies history and destiny. Not only the semantic contents of the apocalyptic discourse are examined but also its "pragmatic" value is weighed. Its paradoxical declarations assume the form of a discourse whose proclamation has a meaning-an instituting scope-that literally contradicts its content, the proclaimed "non-sense" of science.<br>

Abstract: Most analyses of developments in the religious discourse in Calvinist circles of Languedoc after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) have stressed its basic continuity. The expert comparison of sermons before 1685 with subsequent homilies at the end of the 17th century proves this "continuist" hypothesis to be false. Between the two periods, not only did the speakers change but also the structure of the discourse (transitive/intransitive) was modified as well as its relation to the text of reference (compromise on the meaning/ fundamentalism) and the function of speaking itself (intersocial saturation/intracommunity fragmentation). The pacified public discourse became a private one in a zone of textual violence.<br>

Author(s): Weidler Markus<br>
Abstract: While the Dialectic of Enlightenment (1944; 1947) is often judged to be too limited a cultural critique, it is still widely accepted as pioneering cultural criticism, a mix of critical discourse analysis, hermeneutics, and semiotics. This article contests this reputation by turning to a source that Horkheimer and Adorno are at pains to occlude: Ernst Cassirer's Philosophy of Symbolic Forms (1923-29). Drawing on the tradition of eighteenth-century German Christology revived by the Young Hegelians in general and F.W.J. Schelling in particular, Cassirer evolves a critical strategy broader than that in the Dialectic, yet clearly implied by it. Most particularly, Cassirer's Schelling analysis discriminates philosophy, art, and religion as forms of knowledge and forms of epistemological critique, where Horkheimer and Adorno recast the art of the Bildungsbürger to occlude Cassirer's innovation, a new materialist semiotics that offers cultural critique in the broader terms that the Dialectic's critics would favor.<br>

to use the word narrative for the signifier, statement, discourse or narrative text
itself, and to use the word narrating for the producing narrative action and, by
extension, the whole of the real or fictional situation in which that action takes
place. (27)<br>

Abstract: A Classical Latin text, Ovid's metamorphosis about Echo, is analyzed using Givón's notion of topic continuity. The analysis reveals iconicity on the paradigmatic level of discourse. A problem encountered in applying Givón's iconicity principle is raised, and this leads to an alternative approach to iconicity in discourse, following Becker. This approach uncovers instances of another type of iconicity in the text, this time on the syntagmatic level, and leads to a discussion of the role of iconicity in the aesthetics of the text.<br>

Author(s): Ury Jane M.<br>
Abstract: This paper addresses several problems in experimental ethnographies: the integration of first- and third-person texts, ethnographic authority, and incorporation of dialogue in ethnographies. These problems can be traced to a relationship between discourse and text that hinges on splitting subject/object and process/product. Both splits are antithetical to dialogue in defining relationships between self and social life. A dialogic approach is developed through use of indexing in social distance, and discussed in Japanese usage of register. Implications for intersubjective, reflexive, and pluralistic approaches to social life are traced out.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses several problems in experimental ethnographies: the integration of first and third person texts, ethnographic authority, and incorporation of dialogue into texts. These problems can be traced to a relationship between discourse and text that focuses on reference, and results in "representing" dialogue. This obscures dialogue in the larger sense of constituting social reality. An indexical, rather than a referential approach to dialogue is developed through examination of indexing of social distance, discussed in Japanese usage of register. Implications are traced out for intersubjective, reflexive, and pluralistic approaches to social life.<br>

Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
Issue: i274773<br>
Date: 1 1, 1969<br>
Author(s): Wolf Robert C.<br>
Abstract: Many contemporary sources, including anthropological, define politics as the vying for power that occurs in the public domain, the goverance of the body politic, or strategies for advancing particular interests as general. While not inaccurate in terms of reflecting politics in the modern state, the instrumental notion often excludes a sense of politics that involves a struggle for mutual recognition or consensus through the medium of discourse. Discourse becomes the central concept in grasping the relation between politics and secret societies among the peasantry. It is argued in this essay that politics displayed through discourse goes a long way towards defining the public in peasant societies. In terms of augmented repression, either from a centralized state or local elites, the sense of public submerges itself in the hidden discourse or code of the secret society. This theme is examined with respect to the Mau Mau of Kenya and late nineteenth and twentieth-century Chinese secret societies.<br>

Publisher: University of Alberta<br>
Issue: i275803<br>
Date: 4 1, 1969<br>
Author(s): WittgensteinAbstract: This paper criticizes post-modern and interpretive challenges to positivism by incorporating pragmatism into sociological theory. As an interpretive method, pragmatism is based on the notion that the meaning of ideas is to be found in their consequences for action in definite situations. In contrast to the post-modern "linguistic turn" in which language replaces activity, the pragmatist linkage of meaning to action points to the centrality of experience in realizing the mode of being projected by discourse. By stressing the interrelation of subject and object in definite situations, pragmatism avoids both the subjectivity inherent in the interpretive reliance on actors' perceptions and the false search for universal, abstract theory. The pragmatic emphasis on the consequences of ideas resolves the tension between relativism and objectivism in interpretation by its focus on theory and discourse as guides to action. /// Cet article critique les défis post-moderniste et interprétif au positivisme en incorporant le pragmatisme à la théorie sociologique. Comme méthode interprétative, le pragmatisme est fondé sur le principe que le sens des idées se retrouve dans leurs conséquences pour l'action dans les situations déterminées. Par contraste à la 'tournure linguistique' post-moderniste dans laquelle la langue remplace l'activité, la relation entre le sens et l'action suggérée par le pragmatisme indique la centralité de l'expérience dans la prise de conscience de soi projetée par le discours. En soulignant la relation réciproque entre le sujet et l'objet en situations déterminées, le pragmatisme évite la subjectivité inhérente dans la dépendance de la méthode interprétative sur les perceptions de l'acteur, ainsi que la recherche futile d'une théorie abstraite et universelle. L'importance que le pragmatisme porte sur la conséquence des idées résout la tension entre le relativisme et l'objectivisme de l'interprétation par sa concentration sur la théorie et le discours comme ~<br>

Abstract: Desde hace una década, el concepto tradicional de "cultura" en antropología ha experimentado un nuevo auge tanto en las ciencias sociales como en el público en general. No obstante, en el discurso de la antropología, la teoría holística de la cultura fue abandonada desde hace mucho tiempo debido a problemas de variación entre las culturas, de poder, de cambio cultural y de acción individual. La parte principal del artículo formula un concepto de "cultura" como proceso inestable, abierto, de negociación del significado; si puede establecerse un consenso, dicho proceso conduce a una estabilización de los sistemas simbólicos y observamos los procesos correspondientes de una relación social cerrada al exterior [Weber]. La última parte analiza las repercusiones que dicho concepto de "cultura" (vinculado a una teoría del conflicto y del consenso) acarrea para el papel que tiene la antropología en el ámbito público y en el campo de las disciplinas científicas. /// Since a decade, a revival of the traditional anthropological concept of "culture" can be observed in the social sciences as well as in the larger public. In anthropological discourse, however, the holistic theory of culture has long been abandoned, because of the problems of intra-cultural variation, of power, of cultural change and individual action. The main part of the article develops an understanding of culture as an unstable, open process of negotiating meaning, which leads, if a consensus can be established, to a stabilization of symbolic systems and corresponding processes of social closure [Weber]. The concluding part discusses the implications that such a conflict-compromise oriented concept of "culture" has for the role of anthropology in the public sphere and in the field of scientific disciplines.<br>

Abstract: In Orientalism, Edward Said attempts to show that all European discourse about the Orient is the same, and all European scholars of the Orient complicit in the aims of European imperialism. There may be "manifest" differences in discourse, but the underlying "latent" orientalism is "more or less constant." This does not do justice to the marked differences in approach, attitude, presentation, and conclusions found in the works of various orientalists. I distinguish six different styles of colonial and postcolonial discourse about India (heuristic categories, not essential types), and note the existence of numerous precolonial discourses. I then examine the multiple ways exponents of these styles interact with one another by focusing on the early-twentieth-century nationalist orientalist, Sri Aurobindo. Aurobindo's thought took form in a colonial framework and has been used in various ways by postcolonial writers. An anti-British nationalist, he was by no means complicit in British imperialism. Neither can it be said, as some Saidians do, that the nationalist style of orientalism was just an imitative indigenous reversal of European discourse, using terms like "Hinduism" that had been invented by Europeans. Five problems that Aurobindo dealt with are still of interest to historians: the significance of the Vedas, the date of the vedic texts, the Aryan invasion theory, the Aryan-Dravidian distinction, and the idea that spirituality is the essence of India. His views on these topics have been criticized by Leftist and Saidian orientalists, and appropriated by reactionary "Hindutva" writers. Such critics concentrate on that portion of Aurobindo's work which stands in opposition to or supports their own views. A more balanced approach to the nationalist orientalism of Aurobindo and others would take account of their religious and political assumptions, but view their project as an attempt to create an alternative language of discourse.

Abstract: This article focuses on the discourse of backwardness as an aspect of what has been recognized as the dominant trope in east European historiography until the end of the twentieth century, namely nationalism. Through a survey of east European historiographies, it demonstrates how different notions of temporality are employed. Eastern Europe as a whole and the particular problem of east European nationalism have been constituted as historical objects of study very much on the pattern of anthropological objects, through structural models of "timeless" theory and method and bracketing out time as a dimension of intercultural study. The article proposes a way to circumvent the trap of origins, which carries backwardness as its corollary, by introducing the idea of relative synchronicity within a longue durée framework. This allows the description of a period in terms of linear consecutive developments but also as a dialogical process without overlooking important aspects of short-term historical analysis involving sequential development, transmission, and diffusion.<br>

Abstract: Assessing the limits of evolutionary and cognitive approaches to the study of culture goes to the heart of an issue that tends to divide humanists and scientists. The issue is how far, in dealing with complex cultural texts and the complex transactions we perform as readers, can we advance by scientific reduction? The issue is vexed by the fact that at times the complexity and novelty of humanistic discourse is little more than obfuscation and strained ingenuity. But such failings discredit neither the search for novelty, nor the earned perception of irreducible complexity, nor the immense importance of work that is necessarily, and terminally, speculative.<br>

Publisher: American Educational Research Association<br>

Author(s): Wittig Zeus<br>
Abstract: Critical social theory is a multidisciplinary knowledge base with the implicit goal of advancing the emancipatory function of knowledge. It approaches this goal by promoting the role of criticism in the search for quality education. Through critical social theory in education, quality is proportional to the depth of analysis that students have at their disposal. As a critical form of classroom discourse, critical social theory cultivates students' ability to critique institutional as well as conceptual dilemmas, particularly those that lead to domination or oppression. It also promotes a language of transcendence that complements a language of critique in order to forge alternative and less oppressive social arrangements. A critical social theory-based movement in education highlights the relationship between social systems and people, how they produce each other, and ultimately how critical social theory can contribute to the emancipation of both.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>

Author(s): Krondorfer Björn<br>
Abstract: "Forgetting" plays an important role in the lives of individuals and communities. Although a few Holocaust scholars have begun to take forgetting more seriously in relation to the task of remembering--in popular parlance as well as in academic discourse on the Holocaust--forgetting is usually perceived as a negative force. In the decades following 1945, the terms remembering and forgetting have often been used antithetically, with the communities of victims insisting on the duty to remember and a society of perpetrators desiring to forget. Thus, the discourse on Holocaust memory has become entrenched on this issue. This essay counters the swift rejection of forgetting and its labeling as a reprehensible act. It calls attention to two issues: first, it offers a critical argument for different forms of forgetting; second, it concludes with suggestions of how deliberate performative practices of forgetting might benefit communities affected by a genocidal past. Is it possible to conceive of forgetting not as the ugly twin of remembering but as its necessary companion?<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000937<br>
Date: 4 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Prasad Leela<br>
Abstract: This article presents material from my ethnographic study in Śringēri, south India, the site of a powerful 1200yearold Advaitic monastery that has been historically an interpreter of ancient Hindu moral treatises. A vibrant diverse local culture that provides plural sources of moral authority makes Sringeri a rich site for studying moral discourse. Through a study of two conversational narratives, this essay illustrates how the moral self is not an ossified product of written texts and codes, but is dynamic, gen dered, and emergent, endowed with historical and political agency and an aesthetic capacity that mediates many normative sources to articulate "appropriate" conduct. In so doing, the essay shows the value of including oral narrative in ethical inquiry, especially in narrative ethics, which, for most part, has focused on written sources.<br>

Abstract: This article aims to explore aspects of the construction by scientific practice of historical-cultural differences. It aims as well to suggest ways to approach ethnic phenomena considering the need to place them historically, and to focus the cultural and political dimensions in new terms; in the challenge that ethnicity represents to today's world. The confrontation with humanity as 'the others' that is talked about, is partial. It is not with all 'humanity' but only with a part of it—substantial indeed—, a 'humanity' with specifities placed in a world divided in ethnocentric and unequal modes. This is the world that Geertz embraces what is 'not properly ours.' We can ask ourselves what is exactly 'properly ours' for those who say it. I add some obvious but forgotten dimensions: the place of the observer, the characteristics of the society where the perceptions and construction of otherness originate and are reproduced. Nowadays the idea of the importance of the 'racial factor', is newly again reinforced. Like in the United States and now in Europe. These differences, more than having a physical or cultural referent, have to do with the dimension of power and with social differences. Ethnicity has never been translated in only one discourse. Therefore, ethnicity should be seen as a process whose meanings can only be understood in context, evolving in the course of history in the specific social circumstances of a given people. Even more, the development of ethnic and class processes in the same social formation adds to the complexity of ethnic processual nature. The articulation of these two processes—ethnicity and class— and their contradictions can only be aprehended by observing the historical dimension in which these take place. By underlining the temporal depth of social processes, the 'ethnographic present' is displaced from this centre of analysis to be come 'a moment' in this processual flow. From this perspective ethnic phenomena are not anymore mere 'acci~<br>

Abstract: Este texto procura encontrar um princípio hermenêutico que dê acesso a uma leitura de unidade da obra de Ricoeur. Nesse contexto, experimenta a tese de que a filosofia ricoeuriana se deixa interpretar como um caso no interior do pensamento crítico de herança kantiana, como uma filosofia dos limites da razão, não no sentido originário, de investigação sobre as condições de possibilidade do conhecimento objectivo, mas por poder ser lida como uma pesquisa sistematica para encontrar as condições em que é possível ao pensar, à discursividade, dizer, num saber constituído, a existência. Assim, tratar-se-á do significado "crítico" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire que, sendo a primeira obra do projecto da Filosofia da Vontade. lhe determina as condição de possibilidade, ao propor os princípios teóricos fundantes da constituição de um discurso unitário sobre o humano enquanto expressão de uma existência histórica e livre. /// Ce texte veut trouver un principe herméneutique qui donne accès à une lecture unitaire de l'oeuvre de Ricoeur. C'est dans ce contexte que l'on avance la thèse selon laquelle la philosophie ricoeurienne doit être interprétée comme un cas à l'intérieur de la pensée critique d'héritage kantien, comme une philosophie des limites de la raison, non pas dans le sens d'investigation des conditions de possibilité de la connaissance objective, mais parce que cette philosophie peut être lue comme une recherche systématique en vue de trouver les conditions dans lesquelles le penser, le discours, peut, en un savoir constitué, dire l'existence. On s'occupera donc du sens "critique" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire qui, comme première oeuvre du projet de la Philosophie de la l'olonté, assigne à celle-ci ses conditions de possibilité en proposant les principes théoriques qui fondent la constitution d'un discours unitaire à propos de l'humain en tant qu'expression d'une existence historique et libre. /// This text seeks to find a hermeneutical principle which permit~<br>

Issue: i40014477<br>
Date: 6 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): da Veiga Manuel Alte<br>
Abstract: Na la meditação «em que se pretende não falar de valor», o autor esforça-se por manter um discurso linear sobre o interesse humano de pensar e agir relativamente a um tema tão fundamental, que parece quase impossivel evitar a «petitio principii». Pode-se sintetizar a primeira meditação nestas duas alíneas: (a) O desejo de felicidade é o grande motor da busca de meios para uma vida sempre melhor; (b) O ser humano estrutura a sua ideia de felicidade, vida, meios adequados, objectivos de graus diversos, em função dos conhecimentos de que disōpe. A 2 a meditação reconhece que a neutralidade de discurso da 1a meditação não teve éxito. As palavras são extremamente analógicas e pressupōem um «pensamento e discurso ocultos» , coniventes com o conceito de valor, que se pretendia evitar. O desejo de plenitude da qualidade de vida implica o acto, por vezes inconsciente, de valorização. /// The 1.st meditation aims to maintain a discourse independent of the concept of value. Like in an « Impossible mission», we face a project that easily forces the adventurer to return over his lost pathways in a desert. I. e., falling in a «petitio principii». The result of that l. st meditation could be synthesized as it follows: (a) The desire of hapiness is what forces us to search a better and better quality of life; (b) Human beings structure their idea of hapiness. life, adequate means to various kinds of objectives, according to their available knowledge. The 2. nd meditation recognizes the failure of the searched neutral discourse in the l. st meditation: its words and concepts exemplify a very deep analogy and reveal an occult system of thought and discourse, where the notion of value is unmistakably implicated. The desire of a quality of life in all its richness implies, although some times unconsciously, the act of evaluation.<br>

Author(s): Duque João<br>
Abstract: Objectivo dopresente artigo é estabelecer a relação entre a filosofia hermenêutica de Hans-Georg Gadamer e a teologia, a partir do estudo da referênda mútua que existe entre ambas. Analisa, por um lado, a influência da questão hermenêutica, em tor no a Bultmann, à "Teologia da Palavra" e ao próprio Heidegger, sobre a formulção filosofica de Gadamer; por outro, analisa a influencia exercida pela filosofia hermenêutica de Gadamer sobre a discussão teológica posterior, sobretudo ao nível da Teologia Fundamental, ou seja, de uma reflexão sobre os pressupostos hermenêuticos da própria teologia. Chega-se, desta forma, a uma tematização da metafisica, na confluência entre filosofia e teologia. O artigo salienta também a importância das reflexões de Gadamer sobre a arte e o tempo, pelas possibilidades que, para além da hermenêutica restrita, abrem ao estabelecimento de outrospontos de ligação entre a filosofia e a teologia. /// Ojective of the present article is to establish a relation between Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics and theology on the basis of an overlapping thematics. On the one hand, there is the influence of the hermeneutical question, centered around Bultmann's "Theology of the Word" and Heidegger's work, on Gadamer's philosophical discourse. On the other hand, Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics excercised an influence on fundamental theology, particularly in relation to the hermeneutical presuppositions operative in the theological enterprise. Metaphysical thematics can be thus found at the point where philosophy and theology converge. The article seeks, in addition, to bring out the importance of Gadamer's reflexions on art and time as especially useful in establishing other common concerns shared by philosophy and theology.<br>

Publisher: Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40014503<br>
Date: 12 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Treanor Brian<br>
Abstract: This paper takes up Richard Kearney's work The God Who May Be, specifically in the context of postmodern debates concerning epistemological claims regarding the other. Kearney's hermeneutics of religion attempts to forge a middle path between ontotheological philosophies of religion and various quasi-religious manifestations of postmodernism; however, my main concern is to address certain points of disagreement between Kearney and proponents of a deconstructive "religion without religion" principally Jacques Derrida and John D. Caputo. The main issue at stake is just how other God is, which is itself a specific case of a broader question concerning otherness per se. Caputo et al. claim that religious assertions about God are fundamentally undecidable, which means that they are "infinitely translatable" and "substitutable," that we can never tell what is a translation of what, but the ultimate point is that it "does not matter" The undecidable nature of religious claims includes the very claim that religion is a discourse about God, which is why deconstructive religion without religion is a messianic hope for "the impossible" devoid of any content. Kearney objects that such radical undecidability leaves us lost in the desert ofkhora with no way to distinguish, even imperfectly and provisionally, between God and Satan, good and evil, the widow and the terrorist. In this paper I claim that Kearney succeeds in finding this via tertia between the Scylla of dogmatism and the Charybdis of complete indeterminacy by thinking God in two important ways: as persona-prosopon (which avoids confusing God with khora or monstrosity) and as posse (which keeps us from dogmatism). /// O presente artigo toma em particular consideração a obra de Richard Kearney The God Who May Be, especificamente no contexto dos debates pós-modernos acerca do estatuto epistemológico da alteridade.

Date: 4 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): King Roger J. H.<br>
Abstract: This essay presents a contextualist defense of the role of narrative and metaphor in the articulation of environmental ethical theories. Both the intelligibility and persuasiveness of ecocentric concepts and arguments presuppose that proponents of these ideas can connect with the narratives and metaphors guiding the expectations and interpretations of their audiences. Too often objectivist presuppositions prevent the full contextualization of environmental ethical arguments. The result is a disembodied environmental discourse with diminished influence on citizens and policy makers. This essay is a pragmatist call for more philosophical attention to locating speakers, audiences, and meanings in more intelligible "discursive spaces." © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.<br>

Author(s): ZahaviAbstract: A criticism of all totalizing knowledge, deconstruction rejects all appeals to ontological, epistemological or ethical absolutes as a metaphysics of presence. Like all postmodernist philosophies, it presents serious difficulties for traditional monotheistic theologies and their basic affirmations about the human subject. Some are apprehensive of the atheistic tendencies of deconstruction, but others have enthusiastically argued for the possibility of a theistic appropriation of postmodern themes and their hermeneutics of suspicion and finitude. This article provides an outline of the ethico-theroretical basis of deconstruction, and examines its ethical claims. Derrida's views on Islam as reflected in his discourse on hospitality are examined, and a critical evaluation of the ethical propositions of deconstruction from an Islamic perspective is presented.<br>

Abstract: The critical discourse on U.S. military detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib prison has been dominated by Weberian-style arguments (a bureaucracy gone wrong, insufficient or badly applied administrative rules, or individuals acting as cogs in a machine). We argue that Michel Foucault's "security apparatus" provides a more insightful model for understanding the Abu Ghraib phenomenon. According to this model, the prison becomes a nodal point in an information-gathering nexus confronting unforeseen, emergent, and unclear events, a place where power is less disciplinary than improvisational, exercised through practical judgments about uncertain situations. The performance of such power at Abu Ghraib included the use of photography and acts that, we claim, resemble M. M. Bahktin's negative carnivalesque.<br>

Author(s): Lentz Carola<br>
Abstract: Sowohl Ethnologie wie Soziologie werden durch die Globalisierung herausgefordert. Die vermeintlich abgeschlossenen fremden „Völker“ verschwinden; „Gesellschaft“ nationalstaatlich zu konzipieren, wird immer unplausibler. Eine (Wieder) Annäherung der beiden im neunzehnten Jahrhundert ausdifferenzierten Fächer tut Not. Taugt „Kultur“ dafür als Brückenbegriff? Soziologen wie Andreas Reckwitz werben für eine praxis-oder diskurstheoretische Reformulierung des Kulturkonzepts, tragen dabei aber auch zu einer problematischen, weil zu umfassenden „Kulturalisierung“ des Sozialen bei. Dagegen halten Ethnologen wie Adam Kuper oder Chris Hann den Kulturbegriff für so unrettbar reifiziert, diffus und machtblind, dass sie ihn lieber abschaffen oder doch umfassend „soziologisieren“ und durch eine präzisere Benennung der jeweils gemeinten symbolischen Codes oder sozialen Praktiken ersetzen wollen. Der vorliegende Artikel schließt sich eher den Skeptikern an und zeichnet aus dieser Perspektive die wichtigsten Stationen der „Entsoziologisierung“ des klassischen ethnologischen Kulturbegriffs und die neuere Kritik in der Ethnologie sowie Ansätze nach, Kultur als Arena von machtförmigen Aushandlungsprozessen zu begreifen. Anthropology and sociology are both challenged by globalisation. Supposedly self-sustaining peoples are rapidly disappearing, and attempts to conceptualize "society" within the parameters of the nation-state have proven themselves unfeasible. It is time to (re) consider the two disciplines that both took shape in the nineteenth century. Can 'culture' still serve as a bridge concept? Sociologists like Andreas Reckwitz have argued in favour of a discourse-and practise-oriented conception of culture, one, however, that entails difficulties of its own, as it leads to the complete culturalization of the social. Anthropologists such as Adam Kuper or Chris Hann, on the other hand, believe the concept of culture to be so reified, diffuse and blind to power relations that they wo~<br>

Abstract: Cet article explore les dynamiques de l'échange communicationnel à l'époque de Stalin et son impact sur la formation de l'opinion. Alors que les journaux, qui présentent leurs auteurs dans un état solitaire de monologue intérieur, révèlent souvent des étendues d'ambiguité et de doute, une communication engagée, particulièrement entre personnes se faisant confiance, est beaucoup plus à même de donner naissance à des jugements et des opinions clairs, ce qui est de la plus haute importance sur le plan de la capacité critique. La riche correspondance personnelle de la famille Kravčenko-Spunde, famille de vieux bolcheviks engagés, montre à quel point un échange ouvert peut susciter et renforcer tant le soutien que la critique la plus âpre du système. Ces documents mettent en lumière un changement majeur, le passage d'un soutien quasi inconditionnel au régime stalinien à sa critique de « fossoyeur de la révolution » , condamnation qui émerge du débat politique tenu dans le cercle étroit de la famille. De plus, la défense d'un bien commun à l'encontre du discours public pousse les discutants à transcender leur cercle restreint et à chercher un contre-public indispensable pour lever le soupçon de particularité qui pèse sur les « biens » défendus au sein de ce cercle et pour confirmer ainsi leur caractère de « bien commun ». La tentative d'élargissement du cercle communicationnel mène à une nouvelle activité dans l'écriture mémorielle qui se propose aussi bien de dévoiler les mensonges du système que de révéler un héritage révolutionnaire distinct de la représentation officielle monopolisée par le régime. L'expérience des relations personnelles pendant la révolution joue un rôle essentiel pour cette revendication dissidente d'un héritage révolutionnaire. Camaraderie et confrontation unie face à l'ennemi pendant la guerre civile doivent être distinguées de l'énonciation et de l'élaboration d'opinions lors de débats publics. Seule cette seconde expérience, basée sur la récipro~<br>

Abstract: En étudiant les récits de vie des paysans roumains du Banat et d'Olténie déportés dans les années cinquante dans la plaine de Bǎrǎgan, nous avons essayé de mettre en évidence de quelle façon le récit de vie peut être un révélateur d'une réalité ethno-historique et anthropologique. Nous avons souligné le problème d'ordre méthodologique qu'une telle étude pose au chercheur. Dans un premier temps, nous avons discuté le statut discursif du récit de vie comme discours de témoignage, et les conséquences qui en dérivent pour son analyse comme texte narratif et argumentatif qui développe une rhétorique spécifique. Une description du contexte historique auquel font référence les textes, ainsi que des circonstances dans lesquelles l'enquête orale a été menée, nous a semblé nécessaire pour dégager l'importance du thème de l'identité et de la différence dans les récits de nos interlocuteurs. En analysant ce thème, nous avons tenu compte des constellations idéologiques et symboliques qui dominent ces développements dans le texte des critères que les paysans utilisent pour se différencier de l'Autre sous ses différents visages. L'analyse de ces facteurs suggère des pistes intéressantes pour déceler certaines mentalités et pratiques culturelles, surtout celles liées au foyer et à la famille et aux pratiques culinaires. Studiind povesteǎ vieţii a 70 de ţǎrani deporţati între anii 1951-1956 în Bǎrǎgan am pus în evidenţǎ problemele de ordin metodologic şi teoretic cu care se confruntǎ cercetǎorul dornic sǎ reconstituie o realitate istoricǎ, etnograficǎ şi antropologicǎ pornind de la mǎrturiile celor ce povestesc evenimentul deportǎrii.

Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to show that so-called conventional metaphors play a twofold role in discourse. We distinguish two sub-groups of so-called conventional metaphors (semi-denatured and denatured metaphors) depending on whether or not we still perceive the conceptual contrast generated when the conventional metaphor was a genuine metaphor. On the one hand, the choice of some sample of denatured conventional metaphor reflects the same about our ideology as what the choice of a literally used expression does, the original conceptual contrast is not retrievable. On the other hand, the use of a semi-denatured metaphor exploits the recognition of an ideological change, its use reflects the consolidation of the conceptual restructuring that took place when it was a metaphor. Semi-denatured metaphors show how reality and ideology have been in part constructed by the metaphorical use of language.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40050932<br>
Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Meschkank Julia<br>
Abstract: The paper seeks to contribute to the recent slum tourism-debate. On the basis of an empirical field study conducted in Mumbai in 2009, this article investigates how Indian slums are observed by different actors within the communication context of this (emerging) form of tourism. Taking into consideration that slums are defined in public discourse nearly exclusively by poverty and sordidness, it is interesting to examine how the tour agency's objective of correcting the negative connotations of poverty is achieved. Accordingly, the study aims, by means of a second order observation, to observe how the tourists and the tour agency simultaneously perceive and charge poverty. Following the epistemological premise that reality is an observer-dependent construction, it seeks to outline which different images or realities of the investigated slum, Dharavi, are created by the different observations. The findings will then facilitate a discussion of the extent to which poverty can be defined as the dominant mode of observation of the slum tourism context as a whole.<br>

Abstract: Taking issue with a prevalent tendency in literary criticism that reduces fictional texts to what is construed as an inevitable and constitutive complicity with the discourse of power, this essay investigates the ways in which William Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom! criticizes and affirms slavery and "racial" difference simultaneously by doubling the perspective on discursive structures through narrative and rhetorical strategies. The central argument is that time is one of the crucial factors through which not only the history of slavery, but also representations of relations between Self and Other are constructed. Drawing on hermeneutic thought, the concept of alterity is discussed on two levels, historical and cultural, as well as applied practically to a reading of the encounter between Miss Rosa and Clytie. Temporal distancing is shown to be used as a device through which white characters exclude African Americans, a mechanism, nevertheless, that reaches back to them with a recursive and retroactive effect. Faulkner's novel stages the ways in which white Southerners are affected by the ideology of "racial" difference.<br>

Abstract: Le discours de la recherche sur les enseignants et leurs savoirs est souvent tenté de détacher la connaissance du sujet connaissant, traduisant des préoccupations de fonctionnalité et de transférabilité des savoirs. À cette perspective rationaliste résiste néanmoins une mouvance de recherche qui défend une approche anthropologique du savoir enseignant, moins soucieuse de légiférer l'acte d'enseignement que de mettre au jour les formes complexes et locales de construction de l'enseignant-sujet et de ses savoirs, que ceux-ci soient inscrits dans une forme de vie, incarnés, ou dessinés réflexivement dans l'espace narratif. Ce courant phénoménologique et herméneutique, pluriel et très vivace dans le monde anglo-saxon, promeut le savoir ordinaire des enseignants, se démarquant ainsi des études attentives aux seuls savoirs ' extraordinaires' de l'expert. Traduisant un retour du sujet qui traverse les sciences sociales depuis la dernière décennie, cette tendance dans la recherche éducative à réhabiliter la subjectivité enseignante, sans pour autant la magnifier, adresse des questions importantes à notre champ de recherche sur les choix épistémologiques qui le guident. Research discourse on teachers and their knowledge has a tendency to separate knowledge from the one who knows as it is focusing on knowledge functionality and transfer. Nevertheless, one research movement is resisting to this rationalist perspective, preferring an anthropological approach of teachers' knowledge focusing on sophisticated and local forms of construction of knowledge and knowing subject rather than on teaching laws (these constructions being embodied or reflexively designed in narrative space). This multifaceted phenomenological and hermeneutic trend, observed in anglosaxon world, is promoting teachers' ordinary knowledge, when the majority of investigations focus only on expert knowledge. As it can be observed in all social sciences in this last decade, the importance of the subject - the teac~<br>

Abstract: La tentative de rapprochement entre littérature et éducation est en train de trouver — et pas seulement en France — de nouveaux adhérents. Cela semble signaler l'émergence d'un nouveau logos pédagogique qui essaye, peut-être, de dépasser les frontières de réflexion imposés par les sciences de l'éducation. Quelques-unes de ces tentatives, cependant, non seulement présentent certaines (et compréhensibles) limites, comme l'absence d'une « théorie de la réception » des textes fictionnels, mals elles ont aussi, dans d'autres cas, l'ambition de révolutionner le discours pédagogique à travers la littérature, où la pédagogie elle-même se transforme en projet d' « esthétisation de l'existence » . En prenant Philippe Meirieu et Jorge Larrosa comme illustrations des « limites » et de l' « ambition révolutionnaire » , respectivement, l'article cherche à montrer comment romantisme et nietzscheisme essayent de constituer un nouveau discours qui prétend, encore une fois, nous sauver de la « société administrée » . The attempt to approximate literature and education is beginning to find, not only in France, numerous supporters. This may indicate the emergence of a new pedagogical logos, which tries, little by little, to overcome the limits of thought set up by the Educational Sciences. Some of these attempts, however, not only show some (understandable) insufficiencies (such as the absence of a "reception theory" for fictional texts), but also, in other cases, the ambition of a complete revolution of the pedagogical discourse through literature (where pedagogy itself becomes a "self-stylistics" or aims at the "aesthetization of existence"). Taking Philippe Meirieu and Jorge Larrosa as respective examples of "insufficiencies" and "revolutionary ambition", the article tries to show how romanticism and Nietzscheanism can constitute a new pedagogical discourse that pretends, once again, to save us from "administerea society".<br>

Author(s): Zerubavel Pablo<br>
Abstract: On the U.S.-Mexican border, the label "Mexican" refers simultaneously to both nationality and ethnicity. Playing with the multiple meanings of the word, border actors construct narratives about themselves and Others to deal with a local hegemonic discourse that states that "poverty is Mexican." Thus, while border identities are constructed within a culturally specific system of classification, people also develop a sense of themselves as subjects by imagining themselves as protagonists in stories. To know border narratives is important because people generally act according to how they understand their place in any number of social relations whose meaning is narratively constructed.<br>

Abstract: Dans cet article, nous évoquerons la question des témoignages de la Shoah et des circonstances de leur énonciation. A cet effet, nous décrirons cet objet sociodiscursif particulier qu'est le témoignage, en détaillant ses composantes définitoires (certification autobiographique, pacte de référentialité, portée collective, etc.), en réfléchissant sur les conditions de son accréditation et en le comparant aux autres modalités et stratégies discursives (discours de l'historien, récit littéraire, etc.) utilisées pour transmettre cette réalité extrême et non partagée de la déportation et de l'expérience concentrationnaire. In this paper, I focus on the question of the testimonies of the Shoah and the circumstances of their creation. The testimony, a specific sociodiscursive object, is described by detailling its defining elements (autobiographical certification, referentiality pact, collective thrust, etc.), by reflecting on the conditions of its accreditation and by comparing it to the other discursive modalities and strategies (the discourse of the historian, literary accounts, etc.) used to convey the extreme and unshared reality of deportation and the experience of concentration camps.<br>

Abstract: Even though the European Union has become an "ever closer union" in economic and political terms, the problem of the emotional deficit of the EU identity calls for solutions. Metaphor offers an untypical yet interesting mechanism of overcoming the alien aura of the EU. Taking into consideration the cognitive value of metaphors, Antony Judge, the EU expert, designed the dynamic system of metaphors to articulate the new European identity. At the same time, in the candidate countries the alternative discourses of European identity emerge. Polish press makes use of the emotional potential of metaphors. With the help of metaphors Polish pubic discourse grounds the claim of the rightful and necessary belonging of Poland to the European Union thus engaging in symbolic politics. Moreover, through metaphoric images the relations between Europe and the "Self" are critically or ironically assessed. In an ambiguous period of accession negotiations these metaphors empowered Polish public to create their own conceptions of what the European identity is.<br>

Abstract: This review explores the most significant dimensions and findings of phenomenological approaches in anthropology. We spell out the motives and implications inherent in such approaches, chronicle their historical dimensions and precursors, and address the ways in which they have contributed to analytic perspectives employed in anthropology. This article canvasses phenomenologically oriented research in anthropology on a number of topics, including political relations and violence; language and discourse; neurophenomenology; emotion; embodiment and bodiliness; illness and healing; pain and suffering; aging, dying, and death; sensory perception and experience; subjectivity; intersubjectivity and sociality; empathy; morality; religious experience; art, aesthetics, and creativity; narrative and storytelling; time and temporality; and senses of place. We examine, and propose salient responses to, the main critiques of phenomenological approaches in anthropology, and we also take note of some of the most pressing and generative avenues of research and thought in phenomenologically oriented anthropology.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo explora cuestiones relacionadas con la nueva diversidad y complejidad de la cultura europea, y procura hacerlo con referencia a debates contemporáneos en torno al cosmopolitismo. Un argumento central es que las ciencias sociales "dominantes" permanecen inadecuadas, en tanto que tratan estas cuestiones de forma abstracta y de manera superficial -sin tocar a nadie. El artículo propone una aproximación más concreta y sustantiva a la agenda cosmopolita -incluso poética-, ofreciendo sugerencias en términos de discursos alternativos relevantes -aquellos que han sido marginados a través de la elaboración histórica de lo que ha devenido la versión hegemónica de la cultura y tradición europeas. Se presenta una exploración de términos como "asombro" y "metamorfosis" (aparentemente obsoletos y quizás excéntricos), así como de la importancia comunicativa del pensamiento metafórico. Se argumenta que, al abordar el dilema cultural europeo contemporáneo, la finalidad es desarrollar un evocativo, y por lo tanto significativo y comunicativo, discurso en torno ai cosmopolitismo -en efecto, otra manera de narrarlo. This article explores issues relating to the new diversity and complexity within European culture, and seeks to do so with reference to contemporary debates on cosmopolitanism. A central argument is that the "mainstream" social science remains inadequate, in that it deals with the issues in an abstract and formulaic way -touching no-one. The article argues for a more concrete and substantive (and even poetic) approach to the cosmopolitan agenda, putting forward suggestions as to relevant alternative discourses -discourses that have been marginalised in and through the historical elaboration of what has become the hegemonic version of European culture and tradition. There is an exploration of such (seemingly obsolete, and maybe eccentric) terms as "wonder" and "metamorphosis", and of the communicative significance of metaphorical thinking.

Abstract: Diversos trabajos han señalado còmo en contextos altamente represivos el surgimiento y la continuidad del activismo no se entienden sin la intervención de fuertes elementos subjetivos, afectivos y emocionales.Este artículo participa de este enfoque con un análisis longitudinal del activismo de la primera generación de anarquistas clandestinos bajo la dictadura franquista (1939-1975). Los resultados destacan la combinación de tres factores que ayudan a explicar el sostenimiento del activismo anarquista: i) la mediación de la esperanza en la percepción de oportunidades para la movilización; ii) la movilización estratégica de la indignación en el discurso dirigido a los potenciales apoyos y participantes; y iii) el fortalecimiento de la identificación ideológica con el movimiento gracias, paradójicamente, a la represión. Las fuentes incluyen diversos materiales de archivo y testimonios de activistas. Previous research has shown that in highly repressive contexts, the emergence and continuity of activism cannot be understood without considering the role of strong subjective, affective and emotional elements.Building on this approach, this article offers a longitudinal analysis of the activism of the first generation of clandestine anarchists under Franco's dictatorship (1939-1975). The results point towards a combination of three factors that help explain the maintenance of anarchist activism. These are: i) the role of hope in the perception of opportunities for mobilization; ii) the strategic mobilization of indignation in the discourse directed at potential supporters and participants; and iii) the strengthening of the ideological identification with the movement due, paradoxically, to the effects of repression. The sources used include a range of archival material as well as activists' memoirs.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i40059451<br>
Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Baumgartner Frédérique<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on Gina Pane's performance Escalade non anesthésiée (1971), which consisted of the artist mounting a ladder studded with sharp metallic shards, causing injury to herself in the process. Previous art historians have read Pane's performances through a psychoanalytic lens, emphasizing the place of Lacanian thought in the nascent French feminist movement of the 1970s. This article posits that psychoanalytic accounts of Pane's work have neglected the political context of the work's execution and reception. Pane specifically referenced the Vietnam War when she described her intention with Escalade non anesthésiée. Accordingly, this article links her performance to art sociologique - a term applied to a range of politicized works produced in Paris in the wake of the May 68 events - and thereby to the politics of the Internationale Situationniste. Stressing the importance of the concept of alienation in the discourse of the 1970s and in Pane's writings, this article argues that the masochistic elements of her performance were an attempt to end collective passivity. This collective de-anesthetization was carried out by Pane through the photo-documentation of her performance, in which she staged the image of a non-specific rather than individual body.<br>

Abstract: El autor reflexiona sobre la evolución de la historia del discurso en Francia y su aproximación a la historia semántica, inspirada en la obra de Koselleck, y a la historia del discurso de tradición anglosajona. Tras repasar los antecedentes de la actual historia del discurso francesa desde los años setenta y evaluar la influencia de la obra de Foucault en esta disciplina, el autor aborda, a la luz de los últimos trabajos de Quentin Skinner, la cuestión de la intencionalidad individual y colectiva de los textos históricos, es decir, los mecanismos que constituyen y explican, en palabras de Koselleck, «la conexión empírica entre la realidad y el discurso». The author thinks about the evolution of the history of discourse in France and its approach to semantic history as inspired by the work of Koselleck, and also to the history of discourse in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. After revising the precedents of the current French history of speech from the 70s and evaluating the influence of the work of Foucault in this discipline, the author approaches, in the light of Quentin Skinner's last works, the question of the individual and collective premeditation of historical texts, that is to say, the mechanisms that constitute and explain, in words of Koselleck, «the empirical connection between reality and discourse».<br>

Author(s): Jaume Lucien<br>
Abstract: Lucien Jaume presenta en este trabajo su propio discurso del método en historia intelectual, distinguiendo entre lo que llama «textos de intervención política» o ideopraxies, por un lado, y textos propiamente teóricos, por otro. El autor, que parte de una nítida distinción entre «conceptos filosóficos» y «conceptos políticos», va desgranando diversas consideraciones sobre el lenguaje y la política, y describe el uso de la palabra en el ámbito público como un tipo especial de «acción que incita a la acción». Tras efectuar un examen detenido de diversas propuestas de construir una historicidad del pensamiento, el autor plantea algunas objeciones críticas a la metodología de la llamada escuela de Cambridge, y en particular a ciertos postulados skinnerianos, para manifestarse finalmente en pro de «una pluralidad sin dogmatismos» que haga posible la coexistencia y complementariedad de la filosofía política con una renovada historia de las ideas. Lucien Jaume presents in this text his own «discourse on method» in intellectual history, distinguishing between what it is called «texts of political intervention» or ideopraxies, on the one hand, and properly theoretical texts, on the other hand. The author, who departs from a clear distinction between «philosophical concepts» and «political concepts», exposes various considerations on language and politics, and describes the public use of the word as a special type of «action that incites to action». After carrying out a thorough examination of diverse proposals to construct a historicity of the thought, the author raises some critical objections to the methodology of the so-called «school of Cambridge», in particular to certain skinnerian postulates. Finally he expresses his preference to «a plurality without dogmatisms» that there should make possible the coexistence and complementarity of the political philosophy with a renewed history of the ideas.<br>

Abstract: Taking seriously Linda Martin Alcoff s suggestion that we reevaluate the extent to which poststructuralist artkuhtions of the subject are truly socially constituted, as well as the centrality of Latina identity to her own account of such constitution, I argue that the discussion Alcoff and other Latina feminists offer of the experience of being Latina in North America is illustrative of the extent to which the refotional and globally situated constitution of subjects needs further development in many social-constructionist accounts of selfhood. I argue, however — contra Alcoff — that Michel Foucault I s mode of investigating subjectivation, particularly as it is articulated in his later work, has room for just such an account, especially when it is supplemented by postcohnial theory. With this end in mind, I take as a case study the public discourse surrounding Sonia Sotomayor prior to her confirmation as the first Latina woman to serve on the United States Supreme Court, suggesting that an analysis of this discourse (including its position within and contribution to wider discourses of ethnicity, race, gender, and chss) shows why the accounts of relational subject-constitution offered by both Foucault and Alcoff are indispensable.<br>

Issue: i40063571<br>

Author(s): Casler Kenneth<br>
Abstract: By deliberately placing ethics under the category of communication, Kierkegaard intended to show that it is like no other science. He distinguished between direct communication and indirect communication. Direct communication concerns objectivity and knowledge; indirect communication, on the other hand, has to do with subjectivity ("becoming-subject"). In this paper, the author presents Kierkegaard's philosophy of communication and ethics with special emphasis on his irony and pseudonymous authorship. He also examines the possibility of a discourse in business ethics, focusing on the educational perspective. He discusses Kierkegaard's aspects of communication—the communicator, the receiver, and the object—with particular reference to applied ethics. He argues that the Kierkegaardian notion of indirect communication can contribute to renewing business ethics teaching—which in his view is more art than science—in two important ways: (1) when the ethics teacher changes his position in the teacher/learner relationship; and (2) when the relationship between communicator/receiver is strengthened at the expense of the object.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i387664<br>
Date: 3 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Wilcox John<br>
Abstract: This essay argues for a new religious ethical approach to fatherhood centered on children and their expanding capabilities for participation in society. Under the notion of "childism"-in analogy to feminism, womanism, humanism, and the like-it takes the perspective of the experiences and concerns of childhood as such. In contrast with a soft patriarchal argument for fatherhood that dominates much religious discourse today, it argues for a larger and more hopeful vision of fatherhood as directed toward the human social good. This requires, methodologically, a richer hermeneutical circle between religion and the social sciences. Substantively, it calls for Christian and other religious ethicists to re-imagine fatherhood as an integrated public-private responsibility that aims to cultivate children's fully human social creativity as images of their Creator.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i387657<br>
Date: 12 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Wyschogrod Lawrence M.<br>
Abstract: The study of early Christian asceticism, which formerly focused strictly on ascetic practices, has been transformed in recent years. In addition to ascetic practices, scholars analyze the discourse of asceticism, which emphasizes the decentering of the self, the problematizing of the person's ability to govern the body and be considered righteous before God. Although this approach has pushed back the origins of ascetic discourses in Christianity, the decentering of the self can be observed in Qumran texts. In the present article this ascetic discourse of the decentered self is traced in other pre-Christian Jewish texts and in an unexpected context-novelistic texts. This approach allows for an exploration of literary, ritual, and ascetic aspects of the texts, and some consideration is given to the social context of these important developments.<br>

Author(s): Van der Poel Reinier<br>
Abstract: Erasmus's writings on marriage, such as the Praise of Marriage, the Institution of Christian Marriage, and several of the Colloquies, have long been studied from a social-intellectual perspective that focuses on their role within theological debates of the time. This article proposes a different approach by stressing the literary and rhetorical aspects by which these texts seek to influence a reader in his or her "matrimonial praxis." Through the combination of an effective rhetoric of intimacy with the characteristics of literary dialogue, Erasmus creates a mimetic discourse aimed at conveying models of conjugal life to be imitated by future readers.<br>

Publisher: American Sociological Association<br>
Issue: i387752<br>
Date: 4 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Zukin Fred<br>
Abstract: To understand the rise of market fundamentalism from the margins of influence to mainstream hegemony, we compare the U.S. 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act and the English 1834 New Poor Law-two episodes in which existing welfare regimes were overturned by market-driven ones. Despite dramatic differences across the cases, both outcomes were mobilized by "the perversity thesis "-a public discourse that reassigned blame for the poor's condition from "poverty to perversity." We use the term "ideational embeddedness" to characterize the power of such ideas to shape, structure, and change market regimes. The success of the perversity thesis is based on the foundations of social naturalism, theoretical realism, and the conversion narrative. In the poverty to perversity conversion narrative, structural blame for poverty is discredited as empiricist appearance while the real problem is attributed to the corrosive effects of welfare's perverse incentives on poor people themselves-they become sexually promiscuous, thrust aside personal responsibility, and develop long-term dependency. This claim enables market fundamentalism to delegitimate existing ideational regimes, to survive disconfirming data, and to change the terms of debate from social problems to the timeless forces of nature and biology. Coupling economic sociology with a sociology of ideas, we argue that ideas count; but not all ideas are created equal. Only some have the capacity to fuel radical transformations in the ideational embeddedness of markets.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40072033<br>
Date: 4 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Keller Reiner<br>
Abstract: The article presents the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse (SKAD). SKAD, which has been in the process of development since the middle of the 1990s, is now a widely used framework among social scientists in discourse research in the German-speaking area. It links arguments from the social constructionist tradition, following Berger and Luckmann, with assumptions based in symbolic interactionism, hermeneutic sociology of knowledge, and the concepts of Michel Foucault. It argues thereby for a consistent theoretical and methodological grounding of a genuine social sciences perspective on discourse interested in the social production, circulation and transformation of knowledge, that is in social relations and politics of knowledge in the so-called 'knowledge societies'. Distancing itself from Critical Discourse Analysis, Linguistics, Ethnomethodology inspired discourse analysis and the Analysis of Hegemonies, following Laclau and Mouffe, SKAD's framework has been built up around research questions and concerns located in the social sciences, referring to public discourse and arenas as well as to more specific fields of (scientific, religious, etc.) discursive struggles and controversies around "problematizations" (Foucault).<br>

Abstract: This article is a contribution to an international and interdisciplinary history of text linguistics. It focuses on the works of three authors who have influenced text linguistics in various ways : Bühler, through his theory of four modes of language, his organon model, his theory of anaphora and deixis and his theory of language understanding influenced by Gestalt psychology ; Bartlett, through his theory of schemata or mental models that structure the understanding and memorisation of stories, a theory that had a direct influence on all later models of text comprehension based on schemata, frames, scripts and plans ; and finally Benveniste, through his theory of pronouns and indexicals and his discussion of two broad types of enunciation or genres of text : the story and the discourse.<br>

Abstract: The construction of a meta-discourse in order to describe interior monologues (IM) cuts across narratologic and linguistic approaches. It varies according to whether the purpose is to establish a typology based on their wider representation or to provide a linguistic analysis restricted to reported speech. The paper highlights the persistent under-rating of a phenomenon close to the IM, and related to the "unspeakable sentence", that of "the point of view". The represented "point of view" and the free indirect speech have coexisted since the second half of the 19th. However, unlike as in the IM, these forms are not clearly differentiated as dual forms of the expression of the inner speech. Consequently, inner speech (at least as a theory issued from literary experience) is reduced to the relatively homogeneous form of the "interior speech" or "flow of consciousness". But this representation is under the influence of enormous tensions as literary manifestations of inner speech are more varied than the phrase IM gives to understand.<br>

Abstract: This paper is about the analysis of the written production of argumentative discourse. Thanks to the technique of collective writing it is possible to observe the process of discourse production. Declarative, strategic and procedural abilities of two non native adults are successively analyzed and compared periodically to those of two young native speakers. This study focuses on only two levels : global and interphrasal organisation of discourse. The organisation of debates in class so as to bring students to build argumentative concepts and help them in their approach of texts (reading and writing) shows the limits of a didactic scheme which relies on oral language practice for the elaboration of written texts.<br>

Author(s): ZubinAbstract: In our research, we wish to illuminate different types of discursive intentions which are structured into discourse via the verb inflections and auxiliaries, together with their entailed social effects. In the present report, we examine the use of the simple present by two three-year-olds, and argue that analyses in terms of tense or aspect are not adequate to account for its use. One needs to recognize the way in which the form implicitly refers to norms and thereby entails a type of impersonal motivation -- especially as it is just this feature of the use of this form that structures the ongoing activity into a nondialogic, normative activity.<br>

Author(s): Wittgenstein Yael<br>
Abstract: This study examines the functions of the bilingual discourse strategy of language alternation in the process of marking boundaries of continuous discourse. The focus is on switched discourse markers -- employed, it is argued, to metalanguage the frame of the discourse. The corpus is comprised of audio recordings of over 20 hours of Hebrew-English bilingual conversation. The strategy of language alternation at discourse markers is illustrated, and the switched discourse markers are classified according to Becker's approach to context (1988b) as a source of constraints on text. This classification is then related to the phenomenon of clustering of discourse markers at discourse unit boundaries in both bilingual and monolingual discourse. Finally, cross-linguistic differences in discourse markers are related to a theory of metalanguage.<br>

Abstract: This study examines how deadlines and time limits for conference talks organize the discourse of consensus among collaborating experimental and theoretical physicists in a university laboratory. Six months of videotaped observations, including two cycles of conference talk preparation, indicate that, as the date of an upcoming conference nears, several things happen. (a) Co-authoring physicists usually have not achieved agreement on all aspects of the findings. (b) They nevertheless direct their energies to constructing a hybrid presentation rhetoric that satisfies the co-authors and fits the talk to the official conference talk time limit. (c) In the process of working through matters of rhetoric -- what to say, what to display visually, what to leave out, and in what order the information should be presented -- the physicists construct a working consensus on matters of physics: theory and experimental data explaining the properties and dynamics of the physical universe.<br>

Abstract: La tentative autobiographique de Jacques Derrida, portée par plusieurs de ses livres, paraît contredire toute une part de son élaboration philosophique qui, quant à elle, s'efforce de démontrer l'impossibilité de tenir un discours sur la vie et sur l'identité. D'où la nécessité, pour Derrida, de déplacer les coordonnées traditionnelles de la forme autobiographique. Nous proposons dans cet article de désigner comme hétérofiction la modification derridienne de la pratique du récit de soi. L'hétérofiction suppose une multiplicité de versions (il y a plusieurs récits de vie), une multiplicité de dictions (dans ces récits, le dire précède toujours le dit), une multiplicité d'énonciations (plusieurs voix sont requises pour porter ces récits), et enfin une multiplicité de confessions (chaque récit réserve la ressource d'un secret supplémentaire). Jacques Derrida's ventures into autobiography, as seen in a number of his books, seem to contradict a large body of his philosophical work, which, for its part, tries to demonstrate the impossibility of holding a discourse on life and identity. Thus the necessity for Derrida of displacing the usual parameters of the autobiographical genre. We will here use the term hétérofiction to designate Derrida's modification of the practice of self-narrative. Hétérofiction supposes a multiplicity of versions (there are a number of lifenarratives), a multiplicity of dictions (in the narratives, speech supplants content), a multiplicity of modes of enunciation (several voices are necessary to carry the narratives), and finally a multiplicity of confessions (each narrative keeps a supplementary secret back from the telling, as a resource).<br>

Abstract: Postmodern is both a concept and a period in time. Dating from May 1968 in France, postmodernism rejects legitimizing discourse and both formalist and marxist rationalism, undermining them through deconstruction. With the gradual discrediting of structuralist linguistics and a new interest in history, philosophy and biology, the postmodernist adopts a stance that is neither archaic nor modern but which exists in an historic context. Through « renarrativisation », subjects are « reinvented » using techniques such as ironic rewriting (Echenoz, Toussaint, « historical » novels, Ransmayr, Härtling) or dissimulation (Manganelli, Perec, Pavic, Temesi).<br>

Abstract: Figures of movement are th hinges in Mrs, Dalloway between the different spatial and temporal modalities of utterance, thus signalling the fundamental mobility of discourses while demonstrating its nature as event grounded in contingency. At the same time, these figures connect to the charcterisation of life as perpetual mobility, while discourse's task is to seize the articulations where differences originate or merge.<br>

Abstract: Este trabajo busca analizar la irrupción de paper como un modo de escritura que en el último tiempo está siendo impuesto en el ámbito de las Humanidades con el apoyo de una serie de instituciones que lo ha hecho posible. El objetivo de este escrito será, por un lado, estudiar sus características principales a partir de la información contenida en los manuales e instructivos para escribir papers y, por otro lado, poner en evidencia sus implicancias para el trabajo intelectual en general y el latinoamericano en particular. This paper analyzes the emergence of the paper as a kind of writing in the area of the Humanities that, in recent times, and with institutional support, has been imposed as the nearly unique and acceptable kind of academic discourse. The aim of this paper is, first, to study the main characteristics of this kind of writing, based on information in the manuals and instructions for paper writing and, secondly, to signal its implications for the intellectual work in general and for the work in Latin America in particular.<br>

Abstract: Cette réflexion s'inscrit dans l'héritage de Paul Ricœur, à la recherche d'une philosophie de la traduction. Langage, langues, traduction entrant dans le jeu du processus de la constitution du sens, la traduction devient le moment privilégié d'une reconstruction de l'unité plurielle du discours humain et ouvre la voie à une éthique de l'hospitalité langagière et de la convivialité. Le don de la langue et des langues introduit un élément de gratuité qui corrige l'obsession contemporaine pour la marchandisation généralisée des mondes vitaux et laisse entrevoir un possible fondement non violent du lien social dans une perspective de solidarité et de sollicitude pour les personnes concrètes. Je propose d'établir une relation entre le don des langues en tant qu'élément constitutif de la communauté des parlants et la dette de l'hospitalité langagière impliquant une forme de responsabilité envers les autres à la fois spécifique et exemplaire. Au don gratuit de la langue et des langues qui nous permet d'accéder au monde et de nous rencontrer avec autrui, en réalisant entièrement nous-mêmes, correspond la dette d'exercer et de développer notre humanité dans le langage et à travers le langage. This study reflects on the philosophy of translation in light of the heritage of Paul Ricœur. Language, languages and translation all belong to the process of constitution of sense and here translation is of particular importance for the reconstitution of the plurality of human discourse in its unity and opens the way to an ethics of linguistic hospitality and sociability. The gift of language and of languages introduces an element of gratuity to correct the contemporary obsession with the general commercialization of the life world and suggests a possible non-violent foundation for the social bond in the perspective of solidarity and sollicitude for concrete persons. I propose to establish a relation between the gift of languages as a constitutive element of the community of speakers a~<br>

Author(s): Ron Amit<br>
Abstract: The article develops an understanding of public deliberations during a peace process, focusing on the interaction between the elite level negotiations and the "public peace process." It does so by examining the dialogical mechanisms that are set to work in the public sphere once the elite consider the possibility of identifying the former enemies as allies or friends. These dialogical mechanisms, the author argues, add up to a shift in the manner the public interprets the discourse that regulates its relationship with the elite toward what the author calls, following Paul Ricoeur, 'hermeneutics of suspicion.' Thus, the peace process generates a need for the public to re-examine the terms of understanding that defined its relationship with the former enemy. However this same process might also lead the public to re-examine the terms by which it understands its relationship with the elite.<br>

Abstract: Pour tous les jacobins, la souveraineté du peuple définit la citoyenneté. Le groupe girondin tient à son propos un discours minimaliste (la formation de l'opinion publique est la première étape de l'exercice de la souveraineté). Les cordeliers et les jacobins radicaux tiennent un discours maximaliste (le peuple fait la loi et juge la conformité de la loi avec le droit naturel). On note une inflexion marseillaise de ces discours. Les patriotes modérés y évoquent « la souveraineté relative et pour ainsi dire locale ». Les patriotes radicaux évoquent à partir du printemps 1793 une insurrection marseillaise prenant le relais de Paris comme moteur de la Révolution, et après le succès de cette insurrection, une organisation du pouvoir exécutif caractérisée par la multiplication des instances intermédiaires. Maignet, représentant en mission dans les Bouches-du-Rhône, tente une synthèse : le partage des fonctions (la Convention fait la loi, les départements s'occupent des problèmes locaux, les districts surveillent l'application des lois, les municipalités et les comités révolutionnaires s'occupent de tout ce qui est relatif aux personnes). For all Jacobins, citizenship was defined by the sovereignty of the people. The Girondin faction stuck to a minimalist discourse whereby the formation of public opinion is the first step in the exercise of sovereignty. The maximalist discourse of the Corde liers and the radical Jacobins held that the people make the law and judge the conformity between the law and natural right. One notes a marseillaise inflexion in this discourse. At Marseille, the moderate patriots evoked "the relative and local sovereignty, so to speak". From spring 1793 the radical patriots evoked a marseillaise insurrection taking its lead from Paris as motor of the Revolution and, after the success of the insurrection, and organization of the executive power characterized by the multiplication of intermediary governmental bodies.

Abstract: President Obama's commencement address on the University of Notre Dame campus evoked substantial controversy, providing public demonstration of rhetorical differences and demands generated by differing provincial and cosmopolitan positions. Icontend that public civic rhetoric, in an era of narrative and virtue contention, must address the creative interplay of both provincial and cosmopolitan perspectives. In this essay I examine reactions to the Obama address from news sources connected with the local Catholic diocese, as well as the South Bend and University of Notre Dame newspapers. I argue that Obamas address is an example of a public civic speech that openly engaged the interplay of provincial and cosmopolitan understandings of a controversial communal common center. Obamas Notre Dame speech framed discourse that walks within a world of tension and difference on the public stage, highlighting the communal rhetorical constitution of a speech moment shaped through the interplay of provincial and cosmopolitan commitments.<br>

Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
Issue: i40090341<br>
Date: 12 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Hatch John B.<br>
Abstract: The book Letters Across the Divide: Two Friends Explore Racism, Friendship, and Faith embodies a dialogic rhetoric with significant potential to influence its intended audience to accept the need for racial atonement and reconciliation. It exemplifies what Aaron Gresson calls a "dance of agency" in both its interpersonal exchanges and constructed relationship with readers. Bringing white and black voices, individual and collective concerns, and (interpersonal and public discourse into dialogue, Letters demonstrates the transformative power of "voice," which mediates the "authenticity" of Buberian dialogic rhetoric and the cultural performances of Bakhtinian dialogism. The fact that the white coauthor boldly affirms commonplaces of white resistance increases the likelihood that white readers would identify with and be influenced by his profound attitudinal change in dialogue with his black friend. The coherence and credibility ofthat transformation depend upon the prefigurai power of the authors' shared religious narrative—both enabling and constraining Letters' influence on public racial reconciliation.<br>

Author(s): Cyr Rachel E.<br>
Abstract: Commenting on the significance of his work at a mass grave in Vukovar, Croatia, 1993—1995, anthropologist Clyde Snow predicted that the application of forensic scientific methods in the documentation of mass atrocity would help prevent the future denial of atrocities. A couple of years later in nearby Kosovo, others would follow forensic scientific investigators only to report what they never saw or never found leading many commentators and tertiary witnesses to doubt that atrocities had occurred. As absence and lack arise against the backdrop of forensic discourse, we are called upon to weigh the stakes of negative evidence witnessing and its implications for cultural memory. This article contends that the semiotic and positional peculiarity of negative evidence in an era of forensic testimony has its analogue in the paschal figure of Jesus' empty tomb. Analyzing the rhetoric of denial that accompanied the forensic investigations of Kosovo in the late 1990s, the author suggests that the empty tomb is a paradigm that renders intelligible the interdiction implicitly placed on the forensic presencing of the body as well as the problematic with which memory is met in a world where forensic scientific testimony grows in importance.<br>

Abstract: The public/private debate has not been a major feature in recent sociological theory. However; Bailey (2000) has argued for a renewed sociological research programme to focus on the sociological private. He outlines three dimensions of this: intimate relationships, the self and the unconscious. This article seeks to address two of these dimensions, the production of self-theories and unconscious disavowal. We extend this theorizing to account for the experience of sexual engagement present a discourse analysis of the diaries of the comedian and actor Kenneth Williams (1928-1988). Drawing principally on the thought of Merleau-Ponty (1962) we argue that our analysis demonstrates the importance of a prereflective engagement with the social world that is then reflected on in internal dialogue. We show how discourse analysis may be used to demonstrate the discursive production of a self-theory and the role of such a self-theory in the disavowal of the principal's pre-reflective engagement with others.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i40108742<br>
Date: 5 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Newton Tim<br>
Abstract: This paper links the ideas of Norbert Elias to the conceptualisation of power and subjectivity that has developed in British industrial and organisational (I/O) sociology. It examines the relevance of power and subjectivity to British I/O sociology and reviews theoretical positions that have influenced this field. Elias's work is examined in some detail, exploring his approach to power, agency, the self, individualisation and discourse. His work is then applied to a re-examination of the perspectives on power and subjectivity contained within labour process, Foucauldian and actor network theory. The paper attempts to show how Elias's work re-frames our understanding of power and subjectivity through a stress on interdependencies and their asymmetry, the 'networked' nature of agency, and the interwoven form of human and socio-political development. It argues that Eliasian analysis maintains the critical concern with power asymmetries witnessed in labour process theory, yet avoids some of the difficulties in conceptualisation of power and subjectivity that are apparent in labour process, Foucauldian work and actor network theory. Elias's work also illustrates the need for a lengthier historical perspective than is typically observed in industrial and organisational sociology, and points to the value of studies which look beyond the context of the workplace. Finally, attention is paid to some of the limitations of Elias's work.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines reasoning and rhetoric about economic recession in selected newspapers. This is an interesting topic for discourse analysis because it is a site of argumentation. We begin by asking: (1) epistemological questions (e.g. What evidential basis is drawn on in rhetoric about recession?) and then (2) ontological questions (e.g. How is recession pictured? and How is recession coordinated with the social world?). We examine the management of evidence and definitions concerning whether or not there is a recession. We then examine the entities invoked, showing how (a) a range of metaphors depict the recession as either an uncontrollable agent or as a controllable thing; and (b) rhetorical strategies used by both critics and supporters of the government collude in picturing the economy as a realm abstracted from social life.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i40110325<br>
Date: 1 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Gavey Nicola<br>
Abstract: Academic interest in applications of rhetoric to social issues is undergoing a revival. This paper develops a rhetorical analysis of discourse generated by men who have been recently violent towards women. The texts have been drawn from transcribed interviews with 14 men who had recently begun or were about to attend stopping violence programmes. Each 90-minute interview prompted the men on their views towards women, violence and relationships. A range of rhetorical devices within the texts were identified and their effect was analysed. This paper focuses on five devices: reference ambiguity, axiom markers, metaphor, synecdoche and metonymy. The strategic effects of each device are discussed with close reference to sample passages from the transcripts. The paper explores how these rhetorical devices resource discourses of male dominance and entitlement to power, and how these in turn resource men in their violence towards women. Increased sensitivity to the nuanced effects of the rhetoric is seen to improve understanding of how men justify, camouflage and maintain positions of dominance within relationships with women.<br>

Author(s): WODAK RUTH<br>
Abstract: The concept of the nation as an imagined community has gained importance in the relevant literature during the last decade. How do we construct national identities in discourse? Which topics, which discursive strategies and which linguistic devices are employed to construct national sameness and uniqueness on the one hand, and differences to other national collectives on the other hand? These questions were investigated in our study on the Austrian nation and identity. Taking several current social scientific approaches as our point of departure, we have developed a method of description and analysis of these phenomena which has applications beyond the discursive production of national identity in the specific Austrian example studied. By focusing particularly on the discursive construction of (national) sameness, this study has broken new ground in discourse-historical analysis, which until now has mainly been concerned with the analysis of the discursive construction of difference.<br>

Abstract: The narratological category "person" needs to be replaced by a different conceptual framework. The traditional distinctions between narrative levels and between story and discourse are inadequate to an explanation of much postmodernist writing. Classic narratological categories correlate with a realist understanding of story and with a realist conceptualization of story telling with some postmodernist techniques of writing, such as second-person fiction, refusing to play by such conceptualizations. Gabriel Josipovici's Contre-jour is an instance of a radical deconstruction of realist parameters. Realist recuperations or naturalizations of intractable writing have to be evaluated as readings against the anti-mimetic grain of such texts, and the possibility of such narrative recuperation does not provide evidence for the reinstatement of traditional narratological distinctions. The failing of current narratology to account for second-person narrative is due to the inapplicability of traditional narratological categories, a break-down that is motivated by the ideological commitments of much postmodernist, and especially second-person, fiction since these deliberately question realistic frames of cognition and story understanding.<br>

Abstract: Au début des années 70 P. Ricœur travaillait à un rapprochement entre sémantique et herméneutique, projet qu'il n'a pas, semble-t-il, repris ultérieurement. Dans sa défense de la référence au monde contre les attaques des sémioticiens français, il était conduit à généraliser le rapport de référence à tout discours, y compris la poésie. Refusant autant le relativisme que le positivisme, il tentait d'unifier en une conception tensionnelle les termes des distinctions tranchées de la théorie classique. Dans cette perspective la logique du jugement accueille la créatitivé de la métaphore ; l'épistémologie des sciences reconnaît la valeur des modèles heuristiques ; et l'ontologie du discours s'adapte au pluralisme de notre rapport au monde à travers les œuvres littéraires. Tous ces déplacements d'accent devaient assurer une transition continue de la sémantique à l'herméneutique sans quitter le terrain du monde pour les abîmes de l'interprétation infinie. At the beginning of the seventies P. Ricœur was working upon the possibility of bringing together semantics and hermeneutics, although he did not, apparently, follow this line of concern thereafter. In his defense of the reference to the world against the French semiotician's attacks, he was driven to generalize the relation of reference to all kinds of discourse, poetry included. Rejecting relativism as much as positivism, he tried to unify in a tensional view the terms of the clear-cut distinctions of classical theory. From this point of view, the logic of judgement turns out to welcome the creativity of metaphor ; the epistemology of the sciences recognizes the worth of heuristic models ; and the ontology of discourse fits the pluralism of the relation to the world opened up to us by the literary works. All these shifts of emphasis were intended as securing a smooth transition from semantics to hermeneutics, without leaving the firm ground of the world for the depths of infinite interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Comment le discours philosophique est-il possible ? Cette question met en difficulté, pour des raisons symétriques et inverses, la phénoménologie de conscience et la conception herméneutique du langage. Elle révèle la nécessité où se trouve le philosophe méditant d'assigner conjointement la possibilité de la signification et celle de sa propre réflexion sur celle-ci. Cette conjonction évoque formellement la doctrine flchtéenne de la Liberté. Mais elle ne peut être matériellement déterminée que dans les termes d'une Impression intérieurement et impérativement ouverte sur son autre. What makes the philosophical discourse possible ? This query calls into question, for symmetrical and inverse reasons, both the phenomenology of consciousness and the hermeneutic conception of speech. It reveals the necessity, for the meditating philosopher, to assign conjunctively the possibility of signification and that of his own reflection on it. This conjoncture formally calls to mind the Fichtean doctrine of Liberty. But it can be materially determined only in terms of an Impression inwardly and imperatively geared to its contrary.<br>

Author(s): GREISCH JEAN<br>
Abstract: L'article dessine une ellipse à deux foyers que toute tentative dépenser la religion avec les moyens de la philosophie devra parcourir. Le premier pôle est occupé par le concept de « religion », le second par la pluralité irréductible des religions historiques. Selon qu'on se place dans l'optique de la « religion naturelle », ou dans celle de la « philosophie de la religion », cette ellipse revêtira une allure différente. Publiés il y a deux siècles, les Discours sur la religion de Friedrich Schleiermacher sont une des premières tentatives d'aborder cette ellipse dans l'optique d'une philosophie de la religion. L'originalité de cette approche prend encore plus de relief si on la compare avec la tentative kantienne de déployer les représentations, les croyances et les institutions religieuses sous l'égide de la question : « Que m'est-il permis d'espérer ? ». Autant les thèses que Schleiermacher défend dans le deuxième et le cinquième Discours gardent une grande actualité, autant son analyse du judaïsme atteste la difficulté de conjuguer un éloge de la pluralité avec une pensée de l'altérité. The article sketches a bifocal model which any attempt to give a philosophical meaning to the difference of religions must keep in mind. The first focus expresses the necessity of a concept of religion as such, the second deals with the irreducible difference and plurality of positive religions. This tension has a different shape if it is analysed through the pattern of « natural religion » or the pattern of philosophy of religion. Two centuries ago, Friedrich Schleiermacher's Reden über die Religion give us an excellent example of the second approach. Its originality can be higlightened, if we compare Schleiermacher's thesis in the second and the fith discourse, with Kant's attempt to develop a philosophical understanding of religious representations, beliefs and institutions in the light of the question : « What may hope ? ». Even if Schleiermacher's « breviary of romantic reli~<br>

Abstract: Le discours philosophique, même lorsqu'il se propose comme chez Hegel de « sauver » intégralement les phénomènes, ne parvient pas vraiment à saisir (et en même temps dédaigne) le ceci en son individualité la plus contingente. La parole poétique est plus apte à le recueillir, comme on tente de le montrer à partir de l'exemple de l'incipit d'un roman de Claude Simon. Elle fait ainsi affleurer la vérité d'une obscure dimension de l'être que Heidegger désigne sous le nom de Terre. Seule une ontologie de la différence est susceptible de fournir une structure d'accueil adéquate à cette valorisation poétique de l'infra-conceptuel. Au niveau de l'herméneutique littéraire, il en résulte l'exigence d'une démarche particulièrement attentive aux détails les plus factuels à travers lesquels se configure cette dimension voilée de l'être. Even when it proposes, as in the works of Hegel, to « save » the phenomena in full, the philosophical discourse does not really succeed in seizing (and at once disdains) the this in its most contingent individuality. The poetic speech is more capable of catching it, as this article will attempt to show it from an incipit of a novel by Claude Simon. The poetic speech makes thus the truth of an unknown dimension of the being which Heidegger calls Earth emerge. Alone an ontology of the difference is liable to provide this poetic valorisation of the infra-conceptual with an adequate « home ». Asfar as literary hermeneutics are concerned, it results in the necessity of a method which must be particularly heedful of the most factual details through which this veiled dimension of the being forms itself.<br>

Abstract: An investigation into poets' creative use of the Christian Bible reveals that receptions of the Bible as an imaginative text play an important role in what is achieved in such poems. The article will deal with a coherent group of poems by Antjie Krog, Die Jerusalemgangers, in a volume titled Jerusalemgangers (1985). It consists of eight different poems grouped into three sections. Voices from many centuries echo in these poems. The central theme is developed through four main perspectives, namely a male leader, a 'black consciousness' voice, a woman visionary and the all-embracing and composing perspective of the poet as visionary which incorporates the perspectives of other South African literary voices. This central theme concerns the universal quest for a Utopia, in these poems with their religiously conscious speakers, Utopia is presented in the Biblical imagery of a new Jerusalem. The creative process is activated as each voice, in its pursuit of an imaginary ideal context, uses the same text as a guiding principle on its 'journey' towards 'liberation'. The poet juxtaposes ideological readings of the Christian Bible, directed by different experiences of the South African context. The poet's vision clearly becomes a voice among others and yet it functions as a composing factor. This leads to commenting secular texts entering into the discourse. In the poetic text structuring and linguistic principles can lead to aesthetic insights into ostensibly unreconciled elements. The reading of the poems presented in this article will be directed by such poetic conventions. An attempt will be made to identify the signifying role of the poet's response to the Biblical imagery. The reader's response to these poems is likewise influenced by an acquaintance with the Bible.<br>

Abstract: This contribution looks at the issue of how to present history by taking a look at one of the most cited countries for exemplifying a multicultural society. The author adopts a careful, even critical, stance when it comes to the pluralistic discourse and illustrates how, in the case of Canada, the problem of deciding whether to opt for a blanket discourse (a one-sided view of a country, stretching from one ocean to the next) or an atomising approach (allowing for as many historical interpretations as there are views) does not arise. The focus is more on establishing a factual as well as narrative discourse which allows for a representation of Canada in all its dissonances, changing equilibria, and stormy interdependence.The term "canadianité" would seem fitting, since it refers to the essence of how Canada has formed an historical identity. It could promote a way of relating history which offers an escape from the ostensibly dead-end situations found in the great narratives of Canada which are currently dominating our collective imaginations. Der Autor dieses Aufsatzes geht auf die Frage der Geschichtsschreibung in einem der als Beispiel für eine multikulturelle Gesellschaft meist zitierten Staaten ein. Er nimmt eine behutsame, ja kritische Position gegenüber dem pluralistischen Diskurs ein und zeigt auf, dass im Falle Kanadas das Dilemma nicht in der Entscheidung für einen unitaristischen Diskurs (einheitliche Sicht des Landes von einem Ozean zum anderen) oder einen atomisierenden (so viele Geschichten des Landes wie Sichtweisen) besteht. Vielmehr geht es darum, eine histori(ographi) sche Artikulationsebene faktischer und narrativer Art zu finden, die die Konzeptualisierung und Repräsentation Kanadas in all seinen Dissonanzen, wechselnden Gleichgewichten, stürmischen Interdependenzen ermöglicht. Hierzu könnte der Begriff der „ canadianité" beitragen, der auf den Kern der historischen Identitätsbildung Kanadas verweist. Er könnte Träger einer Geschichtserzählung sei~<br>

Abstract: The study of the wider context of the rhetorical structure (as distinct from discrete rhetorical features) is proposed to apply to two areas: (1) the story and discourse, or signified and signifier, which concerns all matters in, and of, the text; and (2) the materiality of reading which concerns all matters presumably outside the text The polarity between text and textuality is explored at length in the five most important relations in which rhetorical features figure importantly.<br>

Abstract: The use of metaphor, transposed from small to large units of speech is analogical to the structuralist transfer of the laws of language organisation from units of levels below the sentence to units of an order above or equal to the sentence. The metaphor can be defined as a word in counterdetermining context. The unconventional contextual use of the metaphoric term creates a tension which can be explained in terms of the interaction view of metaphor. The metaphor functions as a contextual filter which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the principal subject by implying statements about it that normally apply to the subsidiary subject. The contextualisation of a text can be defined as a text in counter-determining context. The tension between text and contemporary context or discourse is reminiscent of the tension between vehicle and frame in the metaphor. The contextualisation functions as contextual filter of the text which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the context or discourse by implying statements about it that normally apply to the text in its conventional or original context or discourse. As an activity, the metaphor, as well as the contextualisation has socio-political significance since it is determined by the discourse of the reader or contextualiser.<br>

Abstract: The explication of contextualisation in terms of metaphor theory facilitates the utilisation of procedures of literary analysis, the idea of the model reader of a text, as well as the social analysis of discourses for the explication of the contextualisation of a text. The explication of the interaction between text and reader, or contextualiser in terms of metaphor theory explains some of the complexities involved in reading or contextualising texts. In the metaphoric interaction between text and reader the activity of contextualisation functions as a contextual or situational filter which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the discourse of the reader, implying statements about it that normally apply to the text. As a text in counter-determining context, the text is retroactively determined by the discourse which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the text, implying statements about it that normally apply to the discourse or context.<br>

Abstract: The growth of knowledge in any discipline depends on discursive practice for the assertion of claims and the assessment of claims. At times, however, that discursive practice may be ideological in nature. Ideology is here defined as being grounded in efforts at domination--the ascendance of some ideas over others. Examination of the incidence of ideology in discourse is necessarily interpretive; part of this article explores the application of hermeneutics to the analysis of discourse. A set of examples of discursive practice in library and information science (LIS), purposely selected, is examined for ideological intent. Ultimately, the aim is to demonstrate that some discourse is ideological in nature and purpose, and to point out the implications of such discursive practice for knowledge growth in LIS.<br>

Abstract: The present methodological debate about the need for a particular theological perspective when researching on the subject of contemporary church history raises central issues about the question of the validity of theology as a subject for scientific investigations. On the one hand, we should seek to avoid any dualtrack approach which would question the whole notion claimed by theologians to be advancing the cause of truth in a scientific manner. On the other hand, theology is a "thorn in the flesh" for the world of scholarship, since it seeks to guarantee openness as a central maxim in scholarly research, and to oppose any reductionist tendency which would pervert the secular methods of scholarly work by advancing the monopolistic claim of a systematic, ideological atheism. The right of theologians to propose their own special approach to theological questions should not be based on abstract principle, but is better defended-drawing on the researches of Itopper, Ricoeur and Marrou-as being in accordance with man's sinful nature and pragmatically meaningful. Drawing a distinction between the discovery of knowledge and assessment of its meaning can lead to a positive evaluation of experiences and their various connections. Any examination of experience, from a theological or ecclesiastical point of view, should not therefore be dismissed as illegitimate. Rather, it can add a valuable dimension in producing new horizons and perspectives. Of course, any such theological endeavour will still be subject to the rigorous disciplines of interdisciplinary discourse. Church history, as well as contemporary church history, is therefore in some ways competing with other historical disciplines. They are all attempting to make sense out of the welter of events by means of a theoretical ordering of experience. As such they provide a desirable, but by no means an exclusive, method of guiding men and women in their on-going search for insights into the nature of the world, man and Go~<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the complicated workings of Japan's mnemonic praxis in its establishment of moral authority. The atomic bombing of Hiroshima was a decisive moment inaugurating Japan as the torch-bearer of pacifism. Given Japan's ideational multiplicity as the victim and the victimizer, its pacifist ideology needs further examinations in conceptual and empirical manifestations. This research situates the ambivalent amnesia and political compromises demonstrated during the renovation project of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum from 1985 until 1994. As for a nation yet to achieve meaningful reconciliation over the past with Asian neighbors, the political divide opens room for utilitarian considerations in its pacifist discourse. The Hiroshima experience suggests that Japan's pacifism can be a problematic representation given its selective mnemonic praxis and situational ethics. This paper argues that Japanese pacifism should be redefined as 'pacifist movement.' Pacifism is foundational ethics, whereas pacifist movement accommodates political contextualization.<br>

Abstract: Les conceptions épistémologiques de Rousseau affectent ses perceptions et son discours sur la politique. L'accord de Rousseau avec la critique moderne des idées innées et son désaccord avec le monisme matérialiste dans la psychologie empirique ne rendent pas seulement compte de la manière (ou méthode) par laquelle Rousseau perçoit la politique, mais aussi du remplacement de l'idée classique de la raison pratique par les principes formels d'égalité et de liberté comme principes du jugement politique. La reconnaissance par Rousseau des limites du formalisme, comme étant le motif d'une pratique individuelle, explique son emploi d'artifices à la fois rhétoriques et poétiques, servant à donner une substance dynamique aux « formes » que son enseignement préconise. Sa vision politique devient ainsi une synthèse ingénieuse du formalisme mathématique et de l'aisthesis poétique. Rousseau's epistemological conceptions affect his perceptions and discourse on politics. Rousseau's agreement with the modern criticism of inate ideas and his disagreement with materialist monism in empirical psychology do not only account for the manner (or method) in which Rousseau perceives of politics, but also the replacement of the classical idea of practical reason by formal principles of equality and liberty as principles of political judgement. Rousseau's recognition of the limits of formalism as the grounds for individual practice explains his use of both rhetorical and poetic devices which give dynamic substance to the " forms " envisaged by his teaching. His political vision thus becomes an ingenious synthesis of mathematical formalism and poetical aisthesis.<br>

Abstract: L'analyse lexicométrique des réponses à une question ouverte posée le lendemain de la mort de Fr. Mitterrand permet de mettre en évidence le champ des représentations sociales, qui forment à ce moment particulier l'image de l'ancien président. Au-delà du discours consensuel imposé par les circonstances, il est possible de mettre à jour des différences dans l'usage des stéréotypes. Les variables classiques de la sociologie politique déterminent des représentations différentes du porte-parole: l'abolition de la peine de mort, les 39 heures, la 5e semaine de congés payés, le Grand Louvre sont diversement associés au défunt président. De la même manière, les citations sélectives de caractéristiques psychologiques comme l'intelligence, la culture ou la simplicité sont le produit de logiques sociales. On peut aussi montrer que les représentations, en tant que lieux communs, constituent des « lieux de mémoire » et sont structurées par des logiques symboliques. L'image ainsi comprise « stocke », organise et condense cognitions et affects liés aux dimensions individuelles et collectives, privées et publiques, d'un porte-parole. A lexicometric analysis of answers to an open question asked the day after François Mitterrand's death clarifies the field of the social representations which then made up the former president's image. Beyond the consensual discourse imposed by circumstances, there were differences in the use of stereotypes. The classic variables of political sociology determine different representations of the leader : the abolition of capital punishment, the 39-hour work week, the fifth week of paid vacations, and the Grand Louvre are variously associated with the late former president. Similarly, references to psychological characteristics such as intelligence, culture or simplicity are the results of social logics. It can also be shown that representations as common places make up « sites » and are structured by symbolic logics. The image thus understood « stocks ~<br>

Abstract: O presente texto surge do desejo de pensar a relação entre direito e ética. O diálogo entre estas duas áreas, sentido como um desafio premente para os dias de hoje, coloca em cena a relação da própria ciência jurídica com a sociedade onde se insere. A teoria da argumentação apresentada por autores como Jürgen Habermas, Chaïm Perelman e Paul Ricoeur permite iluminar de modo renovado esta temática clássica, superando a actual dificuldade em estabelecer uma ligação entre os domínios da ética e do direito. A reflexão parte de um primeiro enquadramento teórico, analisando o confronto histórico entre ética e direito e apontando caminhos de conciliação para a actualidade. Em seguida, apresentam-se algumas concretizações do papel da ética na prática jurídica, pelo seu contributo para a elaboração e aplicação do direito. Por último, o texto aborda possíveis contribuições do direito para a uma construção ética. This paper aims to discuss the relationship between law and ethics. The dialogue between both areas is a pressing and current challenge, which puts into play the relationship of legal science with the society. The theory of argumentation presented by authors such as Jürgen Habermas, Chaim Perelman and Paul Ricoeur, illuminates in a new way this classic issue, overcoming the present difficulties in establishing a link between the fields of ethics and law. The reflection starts with a theoretical framework, which analyzes the historical clash between the two approaches and points out a possible path of reconciliation. Then, it presents some embodiments of the role of ethics in legal practice, for its contribution to the elaboration and application of law. Finally, it discusses some possible contributions of law for the moral discourse.<br>

Abstract: In Britain, as in France, 'mainstream' anthropologists were hesitant to acknowledge studies within their own country as proper subjects for anthropological enquiry. British social anthropology defined itself as the study of 'other cultures' and became entrenched in a tradition in which Otherness was confused with manifest difference. This naivete, elevated into a scientific principle, precluded the recognition of 'self as anything other than a scientific instrument; but also led to the invention of a generalisable Other, and thereby ignored the complexity of variation within the cultures it studied. By the same token, it blinded anthropologists to heterogeneity within their 'own' local cultures as well, and was finally changed only by a series of related paradigm leaps. Our understanding of culture changed from a set of prescriptive influences which integrated society, to a ragged and non-systemic array of interpretive tools which aggregated society. Consequent upon this change, symbols were acknowledged as vehicles of expression and of negotiable meaning rather than as having stipulated and invariant referents. The demise of modernist theories liberated anthropology from its scientific illusions and positivistic pretensions, enabling it to acknowledge the personal and speculative nature of the enterprise. This admission of the subjective, of the anthropologist's self, was necessary in order to see Otherness as inhering in 'person' rather than in an abstraction such as 'culture' and, therefore, to be enabled to recognise diversity within cultures rather than merely between them. This enhanced perception of internal heterogeneity clearly places the Self of the anthropologist at the centre of the stage and has led to the contemporary debates about the nature of ethnographic writing and the status of ethnographic 'authority'. It has also had obvious consequences for anthropological research, including the raising anew of the relationship of individual to society; and t~<br>

Abstract: The paper describes the settings for an official dialogue between religious communities, including the Catholic Church, and the institutions of the European Union. It goes on to describe some important and necessary contributions that a Christian vision can make to the European project. Finally it considers how far certain styles (rather than content) of Catholic discourse can impede the reception of this vision, and so render effective dialogue more difficult.<br>

Author(s): Heradstveit G. Matthew<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on the Axis of Evil metaphor that was used by President George W. Bush in his State of the Union Address in 2002 to represent Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. After describing "axis" as a metonym for fascism and Nazism, and "evil" as a metonym for Satanic forces that implies an alliance of Iran, Iraq, and North Korea that is collectively responsible for evil deeds, the authors analyze the impact of this metaphor on Iranian self-image and politics. The data for this analysis are drawn from in-depth interviews conducted with 18 members of the Iranian oppositional elite. The interview results suggest that the Axis of Evil metaphor had an impact on political discourse in Iran and strengthened the rhetorical position of conservatives vis-à-vis reformers by reviving militant revolutionary language with the Great Satan (the United States) as the main target of the theocratic and conservative forces. The article concludes with some observations about the implications of using cultural and historical experiences for explaining differences between the ways in which Americans (and other people in the West) and Iranians have understood the metaphor.<br>

Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138275<br>
Date: 1 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): de Marco Alessandra<br>
Abstract: The present paper investigates Don DeLillo's 1972 End Zone, arguing that football is a metaphor for war and that DeLillo's analysis of football and its culture effectively constitutes a critique of the war mentality undergirding American society. In this novel DeLillo meditates on the historical process that historian Michael S. Sherry calls the "militarization" (xi) of the USA and that, since the 1930s, turned the country into a military and economic superpower allowing a war mentality to enter deep into the grain of American culture. The essay will read DeLillo's focus on language against Nicholas Abraham and Maria Torok's psychoanalytical theories on demetaphorization as the linguistic counterpart of melancholia and against Herbert Marcuse's notion of functional language as a linguistic behavior that facilitates the annihilation of critical thinking. Both functional language and demetaphorization allow militarization to enforce its own discourse. Suffering from melancholia, the novel's protagonists fall prey to incorporation, a process whereby they disavow death as the product of war and, with it, pain, suffering, and destruction. As a result, the novel offers a cautionary tale about the consequences arising from an excessive exaltation of war as a means through which a nation seeks to affirm its "apotheosis" (End Zone 162).<br>

Author(s): Kølvraa Christoffer<br>
Abstract: The 1990s and 2000s saw a memory and remembrance boom at both the national and supra-/transnational level. Crucially, many of these emerging memory frames were not simply about a glorious and heroic past, as in, for example, traditional nationalist narratives. Rather, groups started to narrate their symbolic boundaries in a more inclusive way by admitting past wrongdoings. In this article, we look at a corpus of so-called 'speculative speeches' by leading politicians in the European Union and, against the aforementioned historical background, analyse their representations of Europe's past, present and future. By utilising the discourse-historical approach in critical discourse analysis, narrative theory and elements of Reinhart Koselleck's conceptual history (Begriffsgeschichte), we illustrate how, first, a 'new Europe', based on admitting failure, is narrated. However, second, we also show that such a self-critical narration of a 'bitter past' is, paradoxically, transformed into a self-righteous attitude towards Europe's 'others'.<br>

Abstract: La 'démonstration' présentée dans Rhet. Her. 4,68 est le point de départ pour une étude qui vise à souligner comme traits qui lui sont propres la complémentarité de ενάργεια et de ενέργεια. À ce propos on prend en considération l'une après l'autre ces deux notions et les textes des auteurs anciens où l'on peut mieux comprendre leur nature et leur fonction à l'intérieur d'un discours. Après avoir mentionné les définitions de Γένάργεια données par l'Anonyme de Seguière et par Denys d'Halicarnasse et après avoir souligné la différence entre ενάργεια et σαφήνεια on s'attache à examiner quelles sont les conditions qui permettent au locuteur de 'mettre sous les yeux' des auditeurs ce qu'il dit. À l'importance des détails mentionnée par les différents auteurs s'ajoute en fait l'effet suggestif de ce que les Grecs appelaient φαντασίαι et les Latins visiones. On se penche donc sur les textes de Quintilien et de l'auteur du Sublime qui en traitent longuement et on met en relief le rôle joué à ce propos par Γένέργεία des faits, c'est-à-dire par leur façon d'être 'en acte'. Une fois cette notion éclaircie à l'aide de la Métaphysique et de la Rhétorique d'Aristote on conclut cette brève recherche par la mention du niveau le plus haut que l'évidence rhétorique peut atteindre : l'effet émotionnel du couple ενέργεια - ενάργεια qui pousse les auditeurs à se voir, eux-mêmes, sur la scène. The "demonstration" presented in Rhet. Her. 4,68, is the starting point of a study which aims at underscoring as specific features of the demonstration the complementarity of enargeia and energeia. In order to suit our purpose, we have examined one after the other those two notions and the texts of ancient writers in which we can better apprehend their nature and function within a discourse. After mentioning the definitions of enargeia given by the Anonym of Seguière and Denys of Helicarnassus, and after having underscored the difference between enargeia and energeia. we go on to examine the conditi~<br>

Author(s): Cohn Lata<br>
Abstract: Several debates arose in the nineteenth century on the status of women in India in the context of determining an appropriate colonial policy on such matters as "sati" which were seen to mark the depressed position of women in society. The reform of these practices was held to be part of the regenerating mission of colonisation. The most sensational and the first of these debates concerned the outlawing of "sati". The literature on "sati" (and on social reform) of the period has largely adopted the framework of modernisation theory. The paper argues that the characterisation of the official debate as one between 'preservationists' and impatient westerners obscures a number of important issues. For instance, rather than argue for the outlawing of "sati" as a cruel and barbarous act, officials in favour of abolition were at pains to illustrate that the abolition would be consonant with the principle of upholding tradition. By treating the debates on "sati" as a discourse and examining its production the article contests the conclusions on "sati" drawn by colonial officials.<br>

Abstract: Since much of modern discourse, extending from cognitivism to connectionism, has been greatly inclined to look at human behavior in relation to processes where the subjective factor plays little if any causal role, it would not be inaccurate to say that the person has been left with but a trivial part to play in the overall script. The intent of this paper is to address this theoretical disproportionality by offering a more symmetrical account of creativity — one that reconsiders the reconstructive nature and generative capabilities of the person while not ignoring the contributions of technical and scientific thought.<br>

Author(s): WittgensteinAbstract: At the beginning of this decade, newspapers the world over reported the UN general assembly's declaration of the last segment of the 20th century as the International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR), beginning January 1, 1990. There are, broadly speaking, two categories of disaster - the natural (floods, fires, earthquakes) and the manmade (riots, wars, industrial accidents). Both types result in considerable violence against 'the people', especially in an environment that is impoverished, post-colonial, and served by an entrenched bureaucracy. This paper, which partly addresses the subalternist historiographer's problematic of how 'the moment' of people's suffering is to be captured in the writing of history, explores connections between these seemingly independent classes of calamity - the natural and the denatured. It does so by examining three sorts of disaster narrative - the official, the popular and the academic - each of which interprets an underlying nominal/natural kind divide differently. More specifically, the paper uses the philosophical concepts 'nominal and natural kind' to analyse narrative strategies in women's accounts of disaster so that the beginnings of a 'feminist critique of bureaucracy' might emerge, not merely out of academic theorising, but from within the discourse of those who have survived incredible assaults and yet lived to 'tell the tale'.<br>

Abstract: If nations are "imagined communities" as many theorists like to define them, then they need an ideology to create a cohesive imagination. In modern times, the project of writing "history" has been an important instrument in the service of this ideological purpose of justifying and reproducing the modern nation-state as the predestined and legitimate container of collective consciousness. School textbooks, at least in South Asia, have long been among the most exploited media for the presentation of the history of the national collective. This essay is a study of school textbooks in Bangladesh. It looks at narrative representations of selected episodes from the past, both pre- and postindependence, in order to reflect on how they construct "history". Through this work I endeavor to relate textual images to issues of community relations and identity by identifying and sharing the ways in which the audience for nationalist discourse is created, nurtured, and secured through symbolic means.<br>

Abstract: Les diagnostics pessimistes sur l'époque contemporaine peuvent alimenter un discours prônant la réactivation du religieux, voire le programme d'un «réenchantement du monde», soit que l'on regarde les textes sacrés comme un archivage crypté des intuitions éthiques les plus profondes de l'humanité, soit que l'on recherche quelque chose de sacré dans les expériences profanes les plus intimes, au cœur de la vie privée. Cependant, l'élément religieux peut aussi être décelé comme une perspective sous-jacente aux différents registres que le discours met à disposition d'une éthique reconstructive dont les idéalisations s'inscrivent contre les réductionnismes caractéristiques de la raison cynique. Quelles en sont les «promesses»? The pessimistic diagnosis of contemporary times may feed a discourse commending religious reactivation, indeed, a programme of "re-enchantment with the world", whether one looks at sacred texts as the cryptic archiving of the deepest human ethical intuitions or seeks something of the sacred in the most intimate profane experiences, at the heart of private life. The religious element can also be detected, however, as an adjacent perspective of the different levels discourse gives to re-constructive ethics, in which idealisations rise up against the reductionism characteristic of cynical reasoning. What "promises" are there?<br>

Abstract: En se servant de la métaphore comme fil conducteur, le présent article ambitionne d'explorer l'un ou l'autre rapport que l'on peut déceler entre le discours de la science et celui du philosophe. Mais au lieu d'opérer empiriquement, l'analyse s'efforce de se situer sur un plan méta-conceptuel. Pour cela, elle se fonde sur une présentation des deux perspectives théoriques essentielles suivant lesquelles est conçue la métaphore : la perspective extensionnelle et la perspective intensionnelle. Alors que l'usage conventionnel et référentiel de la métaphore s'accorde avec la première perspective, l'usage innovant s'accorde plutôt avec la seconde. Envisagée comme une connaissance sans objet, la philosophie s'accommode parfaitement du modèle intensionnel de la métaphore. Celui-ci rend compte, en effet, non seulement des métaphores avérées mais aussi des concepts philosophiques eux-mêmes. En revanche, le modèle extensionnel convient apparemment mieux au discours scientifique qui porte en principe sur un objet. Il soulève néanmoins des difficultés importantes qui conduisent à réviser une approche par trop rationnelle de la science. Taking the metaphor as a vital lead, this article explores the various links between scientific and philosophical discourse. But rather than be empirical, this analysis is situated on a meta-conceptual level. As such, it offers two essential theoretical perspectives of the metaphor : the extensional and the intensional. While the usual and referential convention of the metaphor agrees with the first perspective, innovative use agrees rather with the second. As non-objective knowledge, philosophy perfectly accommodates the intensional model of metaphor, which, in effect, takes into account not only proven metaphors but also philosophcial concepts themselves. On the other hand, the extensional model is better suited to scientific discourse, which, in principle, is objective. The article nevertheless points out important difficulties that call for a r~<br>

Abstract: L'herméneutique du soi proposée par Paul Ricoeur dans les années quatre vingt-dix fait une large place au récit autobiographique. Elle place ainsi au cœur de la constitution de l'identité personnelle la capacité défaire retour sur soi en termes narratifs. Abordée sous l'angle non seulement de la permanence d'un noyau substantiel – la mêmeté – mais également de celle impliquée dans l'acte de tenir parole – l'ipséité – l'identité est ici conçue comme étant narrative. Seul un sujet capable de se raconter serait ainsi capable du maintien de soi dans la parole donnée. Or, confrontée à l'hypothèse de l'inconscient, cette conception narrative de l'identité fait problème: que ce soit au niveau anthropologique et métapsychologique d'une part, ou au niveau de la méthode et de la clinique psychanalytique d'autre part, le récit autobiographique ne saurait rendre compte de la dimension inconsciente de l'expérience. Elle ne peut en ce sens constituer un concept directeur dans le champ théorico-clinique ouvert par Freud. The hermeneutics of the self proposed by Paul Ricoeur in the 1990's gives a large place to autobiographical narrative. At the heart of what constitutes personal identity, then, is the capacity to reflect on oneself in narrative terms. Seen not only from the angle of the permanence of a substantial core – selfsameness – but also from that implied in the act of discourse – ipseity – identity is conceived of as being narrative. Only a subject capable of telling about itself can maintain the self in what is told. However, when confronted with the hypothesis of the subconscious, this narrative conception of identity is problematic: whether at an anthropological or a meta-psychological level on the one hand, or on the level of method and of clinical psychoanalysis on the other, autobiographical narrative cannot render an account of the unconscious dimension of experience. It cannot in this sense be a directive concept in the clinical theory field opened by Freud.<br>

Abstract: À Santiago deux femmes s'affrontent. La procédure du délit d'injures nécessite, dans cette société orale de la première moitié du XVIIIe siècle, l'exposé de questions sensibles qui concernent, dans ce cas particulier, les identités féminines. Croisées par de multiples variables, dont l'ethnie est l'une des plus importantes, ces identités de femmes s'expriment dans des lieux sociaux plus ou moins contestés: la fragilité de ces identités s'observe dans l'expression de la violence privée et dans les discours juridiques. Réfléchir sur la manière d'appréhender et de vivre les possibilités d'être femme dans une des villes de l'Amérique hispanique est un des objectifs de cette analyse. L'autre, montre comment les discours sur le métissage et les valeurs qu'ils portent s'incarnent dans les sujets au niveau des conflits mineurs, quotidiens, jusqu'à faire basculer, à travers la parole et l'opinion sur autrui, des parcours individuels. Verbal confrontations between women in early 18th century Santiago brought women into the courtroom where juridical procedures concerning slander raised issues about feminine identity. A variety of factors shaped these identities, including most notably ethnicity. In contested social locations, women were often the object of interpersonal violence and juridical discourse. This article considers the varieties of women's experiences and how these shaped their identities in a Spanish American city of the period. It also examines the discourses about miscegenation and how they became embodied on the subjects engaged in acts of minor daily conflicts; the words and judgments of others at times had dramatic consequences on individual lives.<br>

Abstract: La question de la métaphore se pose à trois niveaux: celui de l'analyse sémantique (philosophie analytique du langage), celui de sa fonction herméneutique (Paul Ricœur), enfin la question proprement « ontologique » de sa portée pour l'ensemble du discours philosophique comme tel. L'étude présente est une contribution à cette dernière problématique, envisagée à partir du discours de Martin Heidegger. L'étude se fait en trois étapes : liquidation de la représentation métaphysique de la métaphore; la métaphore dans le discours philosophique de Heidegger; retour d'une nouvelle problématique de la métaphore, autour du couple métaphore morte/métaphore vivante. The question of metaphor in philosophy may be asked in three different ways: analysis of its function (anglo-saxon philosophy of language); link with the problem of interpretation (hermeneutics); finally the « ontological » question of its meaning for philosophical discourse as such. The present study is a contribution to the latter question, focused on the philosophy of Martin Heidegger. The question is developped in threee steps: elimination of the metaphysical conception of metaphor; the metaphor inside the philosophical discourse of Heidegger; come-back of a new conception of metaphor, which has not yet been completely shaped out, but which must be related to the opposition of dead and living metaphor.<br>

Abstract: Appliquée au monothéisme trinitaire, cette étude de théologie spéculative se donne un double fondement Elle reçoit la relation de réciprocité entre Jésus-Christ et l'Esprii Saint, telle qu'elle est élaborée par diverses théologies contemporaines de la Révélation et du Salut Elle confirme une autre relation de réciprocité, entre une vérité de manifestation et une vérité de communication, telle qu'elle a pu être éprouvée à travers une réflexion conduite précédemment sur le langage. De cet entrecroisement suit la détermination de l'Esprii comme le Don incréé-indicible, et du Christ comme l'Icône-Parole incréée. Recueillant le Discours du Calvaire et la Parole de Pâques le dédoublement du nom christologique contribue à distinguer la médiation divine du milieu divin. Si la réciprocité du Christ et de l'Esprit rapporte ainsi le Mystère de Dieu à l'unité du Père et de la Révélation, il conviendra de revenir sur les anciens concepts de relation et d'origine, l'un et l'autre étant désormais respectivement accordés à la communication et à la manifestation. Applied to trinitarian monotheism, this study of speculative theology is based on a double foundation. It takes the relationship of reciprocity between Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit as elaborated by various contemporary theologies of revelation and salvation. It confirms another reciprocal relationship, that which exists between a truth of manifestation and a truth of communication as it has been previously established through a reflection on language. From this it follows that the Holy Spirit is the inexpressible, uncreated Gift while Christ is the uncreated Word-Image. Combining the discourse of Calvary and the Message of Easter, the double christological name helps to distinguish the divine mediation from the divine milieu. If the reciprocity of Christ and the Spirit thus relate the mystery of God to the unity of the Father and revelation, then it would be fitting to go back to the ancient concepts of relation and ori~<br>

Abstract: Cette étude propose une approche « textologique » du texte scripturaire, à l'interface de la philosophie de la religion et de la philosophie du texte. Elle repose sur deux hypothèses : 1. penser, c'est interroger; la pensée religieuse est une interrogation sur le salut. 2. le sens se textualise en achevant de saturer les trois dimensions de la signifiance (référence, communicabililé, symbolisme). Trois raisons sont données, après le textual turn en philosophie, pour distinguer « texte » et « discours » : structurelle, « érotétique », clause de clôture du Canon des Écritures. Du même coup, le rôle de l'expérience religieuse est dérivé. La méthode est celle de l'analyse conceptuelle des problématiques. This study proposes a "textological" approach to scriptural text, at the interface of the philosophy of religion with the philosophy of the text. It avances two hypothesis: 1. to think is to question; religious thought raises the question of salvation. 2. the meaning textualizes itself by completely saturating the three dimensions of signification (reference, communicabiliiy, symbolism). Three reasons are given, following the textual turn in philosophy, for distinguishing between "text" and "discourse": structure, "erotetics", and the closing clause of the scriptural Canon. At the same time the role of religious experience is explained. The method used is that of the conceptual analysis of problematics.<br>

Abstract: L'expérience et l'empathie définissent deux grandes quêtes de la phénoménologie contemporaine, l'une chez Edmond Husserl et l'autre chez Max Scheler. Dans un tout autre ordre et selon une tout autre perspective, Bernard de Clairvaux fait néanmoins ici figure de pionnier : dans sa conceptualisation de l'experientia d'une part et sa réflexion autour de la compassio d'autre part. Loin de toujours dénoncer négativement la métaphysique, on s'attachera ici à montrer en quoi, positivement cette fois, la mystique ouvre vers un autre « type de discours » et déploie des « possibles » à réinterroger pour aujourd'hui. Appuyés sur une relecture des Sermons sur le Cantique et du Traité de l'amour de Dieu, la mise en œuvre du « champ de l'expérience », la nouveauté du « langage de l'affect », et « l'empathie amoureuse » de l'homme à Dieu, constituent ainsi les différents temps d'une possible redécouverte philosophique de la mystique cistercienne pour notre temps. Experience and empathy define two great quests of contemporary phenomenology, one in the thought of Edmond Husserl the other in the thought of Max Scheler. In an altogether different order and according to an altogether different perspective, Bernard of Clairvaux appears here as the pioneer: in his conceptualization of experientia on the one hand and his reflection upon compassio on the other. Far from pursuing a negative denunciation of metaphysics, we will attempt to show here how, positively in this instance, metaphysics opens upon another « type of discourse » and displays the « possibles » to be reexamined today. Supported by a rereading of the Sermons on the Canticle and the Treatise on the Love of God, the application of the « field of experience », the novelty of « language of affect », and man's amorous empathy » with God, thus constitute the different moments of a possible philosophical rediscovery of Cistercian mysticism for our time.<br>

Abstract: Cet article passe en revue les ouvrages suivants du neurobiologiste Jean-Pierre Changeux : L'homme neuronal, 1983, Raison et plaisir, 1982, Ce qui nous fait penser (un dialogue avec Paul Ricœur), 1998, L'homme de vérité, 2002. L'auteur y montre les changements dans les thèses de Changeux en les accompagnant de ses commentaires philosophiques et théologiques aussi bien critiques que constructifs. L'homme, ses origines et sa structure, le cerveau humain, la conscience de soi, la matière et sa complexité évolutive, la sensibilité artistique, la morale, la religion, la question d'une lecture intégrale de Darwin et de Spinoza, la signification du discours sur « l'homme de vérité » sont les principaux sujets traités. Le but de l'article est un dialogue interdisciplinaire entre neurosciences et théologie sur la compréhension de l'être humain. This article passes in revue the following works of the neurobiologist J.-P. Changeux : L'homme neuronal, 1983, Raison et plaisir, 1982, Ce qui nous fait penser (a dialogue with Paul Ricœur), 1998, and L'homme de vérité, 2002. The author shows the changes in Changeux's theses, accompanying them with his philosophical and theological commentaries, critical as well as constructive. Man, his origins and structure, the human brain, self consciousness, matter and its progressive complexity, artistic sensibility, morality, religion, the question of an integral reading of Darwin and Spinoza, and the significance of discourse upon « L'homme de vérité » are the principal subjects treated. The goal of the article is an interdisciplinary dialogue between the neurosciences and theology about the understanding of the human being.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219804<br>

Author(s): Williams Donald L.<br>
Abstract: Reason as the medium of truth and freedom-though suppressed, the idea returns; it is presumed by our very participation in discourse. Its opponents say that only practices are real. But, as Milton and Habermas know, reason is itself a practice. Milton's "free and lawful debate at all times... of what opinion soever" recognizes interestedness, perspectivity, and struggle; Habermas's unconstrained communication is a neverachieved goal (an "ideal") regulating discursive practices here and now. Both writers recognize that meanings are cultural, social, and existential, that knowledge cannot be separated from interests; but they do not therefore stand outside praxis rhapsodizing about struggle and contingency. Instead, they seek to move toward social freedom and individual autonomy through reason-able communication-that ongoing search for unforced agreement which is our usual and best alternative to violence, our usual and best way to find meaning in the world, in our selves, and in one another.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219800<br>
Date: 1 1, 1963<br>
Author(s): Williams David K.<br>
Abstract: Historiography in Francoist Spain (1939-75) sought to affirm the morally and historically correct role of the regime within the flow of Spanish history. As an important vehicle of dissidence, the novel of memory stands in sharp contrast to Francoist history: it explores the past largely eschewed or appropriated by the regime and contests the so-called truths that Franco shaped through the discourse of myth. This essay examines the role of subjective memory as a challenge to historiography and discloses the narrative strategies novelists used to counter the government's myths. Unlike Francoist historiography, the novel of memory lays out history as a series of disruptions and undermines the referential illusion of truth and wholeness in our understanding of the past.<br>

Article Title: Epiphany and Browning: Character Made Manifest<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219810<br>
Date: 10 1, 1969<br>
Author(s): Wordsworth Herbert F.<br>
Abstract: The fortunes of epiphany indicate both recent historical disparities within literary criticism and current cultural disparities between academic and popular discourse. The contextualist practice of Wordsworth and Joyce, in contrast to the purist theory that arose with the New Criticism, suggests that epiphany is a narrative device underscoring the historical and cultural construction of character. This conception is borne out by the original Epiphany, in Matthew, which manifests divine personality to human eyes through an episode of cultural difference and accommodation. Robert Browning's historicist poetry uses comparable but secular means of manifesting personality. In his dramatic monologues "Karshish," "My Star," and " 'Transcendentalism,' " epiphanic themes serve as measures of their speakers' cultural construction. In discerning the relative differentiae that characterize such speakers, Browning's readers encounter their own relativity to interpretive conditions. As these examples imply, the modern literary epiphany ultimately effects the hermeneutic manifestation of the reader.<br>

Abstract: This paper challenges the common assumption that the attention which modern literary theory pays to the textual aspects of literature is achieved at the expense of humanistic and moral concerns. It starts by outlining how modern literary theory differs epistemologically from the traditional critical approaches to literature. Traditional critical theory was developed in the defense of poetry against Plato's accusations, real or imagined, and this informed both its critical practice and its concept of man. It established its epistemology on an aesthetic, moral, social, philosophical or scientific basis in a manner that encumbered literature with the concepts of man inherent in them. In contrast, modern literary theory started from a different premise: instead of seeking to justify literature and its moral relevance, it strove to identify its literariness and the dynamics of its structure by using the disciplines of semiotics and linguistics. It posited the text as an autonomous entity and a complete structure aware of its existence in a society of texts with which it conducts a profoundly intertextual dialogue. As an autonomous structure, the literary work is independent of other social or philosophical constructs and thus capable of conducting a meaningful dialogue with them. The paper elaborates the various conceptual frameworks of Russian formalism, intertextuality, structuralism and deconstruction in order to examine their implicit assumptions about man. It shows how the autonomous and dialogical nature of the literary work in its Bakhtinian sense are relevant to the concept of man inherent in modern literary theory. In its elaboration of this concept, the paper shows how it was developed in conflict with the hierarchical nature of traditional, ethical and philosophical values. It illustrates also the relevance of autonomy, self-regulation, free-play and fair representation inherent in many concepts of modern literary theory to the question of human rights. The qu~<br>

Abstract: «At the basis of the literary act is a consciousness of language. Whether or not the writer is given to abstract reflexion, there is in literature itself a metaliterary dimension.» In his article on the Evolution of Literary Theory, Tzvetan Todorov examines the relation between the «discourse on Literature» and the object of that discourse: literature. Whereas exegesis concerns itself with the Elucidation and explanation of an historically given object, theory itself constitutes its object. Theory then is in turn seen to be historically informed. From the Poetics of Aristotle, through the medieval hermeneuts, the Renaissance concern with genres, Todorov traces the development of the theoretical discourse which proposes literature as its object. Only in the romantic period is a theory of literature, in the strict sense, elaborated. In the 20th century this theory is further influenced by other emergent disciplines :Marxism, psychoanalysis etc. The final pages of Todorov's paper consider in detail the impact of structuralism, particularly in France, on the literary theoretical discourse. He concludes with reference to the changes taking place currently. According to Todorov, it is in the «idea of genre» that the «transformation will take place.»<br>

Author(s): Wisan Jean K.<br>
Abstract: A properly sociological definition of the concept of discourse does not exist because the notion has never been detached from the linguistic sphere. Not only linguists and semiologists, but also sociologists, use the word primarily as a linguistic category. This article attempts to define the concept of discourse sociologically. It is argued that a sociologically defined notion should be dissociated from the linguistic realm. As a linguistic category, 'discourse' is either used as a synonym for language or text, or is closely associated with one of these notions. 'Discourse' in a sociological sense should refer to a class of texts. This definition confers upon the concept of discourse an intertextual dimension. Defined in this way, the category can not only become an operative sociological concept, but it also becomes autonomous and is no longer reducible to linguistic or paralinguistic conceptual entities, such as text or language. No longer confined to the linguistic realm, the concept can designate a particular entity which possesses its own existence. Discourse can become a thing in itself. The argument is presented in three parts. The first is a critique of the current definitions of the concept 'discourse'. The second proposes, as an alternative, a sociological definition of discourse. Finally the third part applies this new definition in a sociological analysis of journalism.<br>

Date: 11 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Thompson Paul<br>
Abstract: In any field of experience anthropologists are confronted by spates of signs, many of which they fail to perceive. By way of an analysis of the mundane activities associated with riding a Songhay bush taxi in the Republic of Niger, this article probes the reflexive process through which anthropologist and ethnographic other learn to interpret the signs that comprise the discourse of social action. Having been confronted repeatedly with the signs of the other's universe, anthropologists may not only gain a new awareness of the sociocultural systems they seek to uncover but may also realize the limitations of their knowledge. Through what Dilthey called the hermeneutic, anthropologists will be more able to proceed profoundly and accurately toward an understanding of those signs that give substance and order to the complexities of social universes.

Author(s): Whitten Janet Wall<br>
Abstract: Language is constitutive of social reality through the constant articulation and reinforcement of significant linguistic concepts, which give meaning to social relations. Among the Shuar of southeastern Ecuador, discourses on power and knowledge validate the traditional ideological structure and create a new ideological structure through the mobilization of meaning in political speech that legitimates relations of domination. Ideological transformation is assisted by a cultural predisposition to seek non-Shuar sources of technical and symbolic knowledge in the acquisition of power.

Author(s): Yates Ellen<br>
Abstract: Adopting a reflexive approach, this article interprets a recently created healing ritual in Brittany that integrates local 19th-century notions about the curative powers of prehistoric monuments with diverse elements from non-Breton sources. Parallels are noted between this New Age therapy and witchcraft, an older explanatory framework for illness and misfortune in Brittany. The therapeutic discourse associated with the ritual draws on the past and on exotic cultures to construct a meaningful cosmology. Therefore, this discourse--like the New Age movement as a whole--has much in common with anthropology, which, it is suggested, provides Western society with an ordered vision of the world.

Author(s): Woolard Webb<br>
Abstract: Sumbanese descriptions of the "traditional house" as a microcosm and emblem of local identity are neither unproblematic expressions of a cultural totality nor simply objectifications imposed by ethnography or modernity. One way the house is able to serve as a discursive object reflects, in part, specifically Sumbanese models of action and beliefs about language as refracted in changing historical circumstances. In ritual, speakers seek to engage and elicit responses from powerful others, whereas current religious and political developments reframe ritual words as means of describing a cultural world. Both sets of practices draw on the authority of "entextualized" language but interpret it in different ways. Emerging representations of cultural meaning are shaped by long-standing speech genres and by recent social and cultural transformations, mediated by shifting language ideologies.

Author(s): White Cheryl<br>
Abstract: Based on ethnographic work among North American occupational therapists, I compare two forms of everyday clinical talk. One, "chart talk," conforms to normative conceptions of clinical rationality. The second, storytelling, permeates clinical discussions but has no formal status as a vehicle for clinical reasoning. I argue that both modes of discourse provide avenues for reasoning about clinical problems. However, these discourses construct very different clinical objects and different phenomena to reason about. Further, the clinical problems created through storytelling point toward a more radically distinct conception of rationality than the one underlying biomedicine as it is formally conceived. Clinical storytelling is more usefully understood as a mode of Aristotle's "practical rationality" than the technical rationality of modern (enlightenment) conceptions of reasoning.<br>

Author(s): Verhaar Gary<br>
Abstract: This study describes the symbolic process by which individuals attempted to realize, in organizational form, their variant interpretations of an extended metaphor - community mental health. Their metaphoric construals were embedded in everyday discourse and were initially unrecognized by participants at a community mental health center. The metaphoric process, that is, the movement involving the emergence, interpretation, and realization of these metaphors, was mediated by the self-images of the participants. They had embarked upon an innovative project to realize, in part, an ideal sense of self. The latter was a key factor in the development of new construals of community mental health and the implementation of these construals.<br>

Author(s): Williams Anne M.<br>
Abstract: Recent narrative analysis in medical anthropology provides keys to both the personal meaning of illness and the historical, cultural, and institutional shaping of that experience. Yet Western psychiatric thinking and practice continue to view schizophrenic discourse as closed to interpretation. Caught in this "closed text," the self would seem obliterated. But using narratives of schizophrenia and homelessness, this essay proposes a different understanding of schizophrenic alterity. The openness of the text-as-experience is re-created collectively, from outside the subject's narration: the subject's "self" is construction through the added perspectives of his or her interlocutors in the role of storymakers.<br>

Abstract: The anthropological taboo against "going native" is examined in the context of the ethnographer's own dreams during fieldwork among Sufi saints in Pakistan. The essay demonstrates that accounts of these dreams shaped social relations in the field and argues that relativist neutrality is a cover for a refusal to believe that is impossible to hide. This refusal constitutes an implicit insistence that the relationship between ethnographer and subject be shaped by the parameters of a hegemonic Western discourse of rationality.<br>

Abstract: Arthur C. Clarke once wrote that "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." The language of magic is evident in much of popular discourse about computers. A content analysis of Time magazine reporting on computers and related technologies over a ten-year period revealed that 36 percent of all these stories used explicitly magical or religious language. Together with a qualitative analysis of implicitly magical themes, the patterns in Time's reporting reveal how magic language was used as one strategy to stabilize and close the technological frame of personal computers in the mid-1980s.<br>

Issue: i240081<br>
Date: 2 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Wolf Larry D.<br>
Abstract: Since the founding of this nation, the theater metaphor has had an influence on political discourse. Politicians often invoke the metaphor when they enact political dramas to construct themselves in the image of leader. An argument is presented that former President Ronald Reagan and his political strategists made extensive use of this strategy and were effective in portraying public administrators as evil villains. It is also argued that supporters of the administrative state relied on the theater metaphor as well. In an effort to counter Reagan's negative image of villain, supporters responded by portraying public administrators as heroes and innocent victims. This article suggests that the theater metaphor is problematic when viewed from the perspective of public administration theory and practice. The images of villain, hero and innocent victims emanating from the theater metaphor are troublesome and deserve scrutiny.<br>

Abstract: In this article, I explore the question, “What is the relationship between appropriation of Indigenous thought and what might be called ‘deep learning’ based in years of education in Indigenous contexts.” Beginning with an examination of meanings ascribed to cultural appropriation, I bring texts from Gee on secondary discourses, Foucault on the production of discourse, and Wertsch on the deep structures underpinning discourse into conversation with critical fieldwork experiences extracted from years of research and teaching. Ultimately hopeful, I conclude the article with direction from Indigenous scholars on appropriate cultural protocol in the use of Indigenous knowledges by non-Aboriginal people in educational contexts.<br>

Abstract: Evaluative terms are a crucial part of the environmental discourse. These terms, and the evaluative frameworks in which they are imbedded, serve as important guides to action. “Natural,” a term commonly used as a positive evaluation, is problematic because it can both justify unfair social relations and obscure the connections between humans and the rest of nature. “Sustainable,” another popular term, is extremely malleable, and is too often elaborated in frameworks that are neither socially nor ecologically responsible. The term “sustainable” is sometimes used in the framework of ecosystem health, but even this approach can fail to highlight the interconnectedness of social and ecological systems. The framework of ecosocial flourishing, introduced in this article, is better suited for highlighting the interconnected nature of the world and for drawing attention to questions of environmental justice. Evaluative terms (like “natural”) and frameworks (like “ecosocial flourishing”) are part of larger narratives that help people make sense of their interactions with, and emotional responses to, the non-human world.<br>

Author(s): Magid Shaul<br>
Abstract: The academic study of Kabbalah has largely been limited to myth and symbol as the two viable forms of kabbalistic discourse. In this essay, I resist those limitations and explore two other possible literary forms: history and fiction. I do not mean history in any positivistic sense but closer to Steven Greenblatt's description of new historicism as cultural poetics. This suggests that literature not only reflects a historical setting but also creates that setting, constructing reality in its own image and directing it toward its desired ends. In looking at Lurianic Kabbalah as fiction, I raise the issue of the “real” and the “true” as it relates to fictive narratives more generally. This essay does not claim that the kabbalists in question did or did not intend to write cultural poetics or fiction. Rather, I use cultural poetics and fiction as possible lenses through which a nontraditional interested reader (i.e., one not invested in the literature as authoritative) can read these texts in a way that can speak to the contemporary world in which we live and think.<br>

Abstract: Violent appropriation of sovereignty and the articulation of the experience of oppression are also at issue in M. NourbeSe Philip's
         She Tries Her Tongue, Her Silence Softly Breaks. Philip, a Canadian poet born in Moriah, Trinidad and Tobago, addresses the silencing and sexual assault of women in conjunction with colonial history in the Americas. The Ovidian figure of Philomela, who was raped and had her tongue torn out so that she could not relate what had happened to her, is central toShe Tries Her Tongue. Persephone's search for Ceres is another major theme. Philip foregrounds the problem of “the mother tongue” as she reworks Ovidian myths with excerpts from invented didactic texts (such as language tests, which are akin to those of Theresa Hak Kyung Cha'sDicteeor Myung-Mi Kim'sCommons, both of which also problematize language acquisition as an engine of hegemony). Some invented texts offer recommendations for the treatment of slaves: “Edict II: Every slave caught speaking his native language shall be severely punished. Where necessary, removal of the tongue is recommended. The offending organ, when removed, should be hung on high in a central place, so that all may see and tremble” (“Discourse on the Logic of Language”).
               Philip destabilizes the notion of a linguistically unified Caribbean history by mixing genres and weaving the demotic with Latin citations, as McMorris notes: “It's difficult to tell at first glance whether or not the poet has invented her ‘quoted’ texts, and this keeps things unsettled, shadowy, and undecided. In the later poems of the book, where the imitation of other genres takes place, we hover between belief and doubt, unable without a quantity of research to separate the fabrication from the real. It's as if Philip wants to contaminate the library of Western disciplines—founded in the Latin language—by destroying our confidence in the truth of its texts.”125

Abstract: Another change is that the second part of the novel is more inclined to use close-ups rather than the inclusive seductive tracking, or “zooming” shots of the first part, thus entering into a more psychological tensional discourse. When Nick finds Gatsby in the pool, the camera eye does not change focal lengths from long shot to close-up in order to create a sense of awe, but instead moves closely between certain symbols:
         
               The emotional response to this stylistic close-up technique differs radically from the one of motion that worked so inclusively in the first part. Since Gatsby lies dead in the pool, there is no mystery anymore. The movement of the camera eye from one image to another slows down the duration of the scene drastically. Fitzgerald's literary technique “resembles filmmakers’ metaphorical use of the moving camera as a consumer of time,” Kundu suggests. This implies that Gatsby “is a victim not only of his impossible dream, but also of time's cruel prodigality, indeed, of the tragic flux and mutability of life itself” (Kundu 42). It also contradicts the novel's relation to movement in general; Berman describes the motion of the leaves as “moving, but going nowhere” (44).There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other. With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red circle in the water. (162)<br>

Abstract: Although Jabbeh Wesley has addressed the conflict between the Americo-Liberians and the indigenous populations, it is not her intention to revive old identity-based encounters or conflicts; the major goal in her poetry is to bring to discourse the Liberian people's human condition. She understands that literature involves the experiences of people. “It doesn't exist in isolation of the experiences of a specific group of people” (Beattie-Moss). More specifically, “poetry is an outlet for my grief and a way to immortalize some of the suffering that we've endured, my family, my people, Liberia” (Herring). To immortalize people's suffering in narratives is to bear testimony to people's struggles, to give voice to the voiceless. Her specific intention is to bring about healing by demonstrating that the pain of one is the pain of all.<br>

Issue: jafrireli.1.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 2013<br>
Abstract: The 1971 article focused on three major points: (1) Africa as historical reality and religious image; (2) the involuntary presence of the African American community in the United States; and (3) the experience and symbol of God in the experience of blacks; these points overlap. I pointed out how Africa for African Americans was obviously a reference to the continent of Africa but that it was that and more. It became an image and symbol for the possibility for another and alternative beginning and way of being in the world. Africa was indeed a continent with a very large landmass and simultaneously the basis for a powerful orienting discourse about the nature and being of peoples of African descent in the world. The involuntary stance and presence of African people in their diasporic existence in the New World is paralleled by the destruction of aboriginal peoples and acquisition of their lands. These events have prevented any ultimate trust in the rhetorics of egalitarianism and freedom that accompanied the ascendancy of Europe. The manifestation and naming of gods and divine beings as centering symbols of the orientational process express themselves in a precise manner within this situation and become the resource for the maintenance of one's humanity within the context.<br>

Abstract: From the outset, all of us could see that nonscientific concerns, felt human sense, and pretheoretical understanding are not, as the patronizing label had it, “merely subjective” and thus philosophically unworthy. We all knew, for example, that no real human beings—except possibly Merleau-Ponty's Schneider—open their eyes in the morning and face the problem of whether percepts can be synthesized with concepts to make sure there is an external world. And whatever the good life is, it seemed pretty obvious that one gets no closer to it by defining ethical discourse as noncognitive or by obsessing over individuals and their moral rules while ignoring class interests, culture, and social structure. For me, the matter came to a head when I studied Dilthey on the difference between explaining nature and understanding people. On any fair reading of his beautiful accounts of how
      Verstehenworks and how a whole group of genuine sciences could be founded on it, Dilthey seemed obviously right. And yet, I was reading a fifty-year-old book by someone who had in the meantime clearly lost the argument.

Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: To understand the effects of killing machines on both the victims and the perpetrators, we need a psychoanalytic supplement, to work through the double bind of ethics and politics. In order to begin to think about our own investments in state-sanctioned violence, we need to consider the ways in which death penalties of all kinds find their place not only in economic and political power struggles but also in revenge fantasies that fuel them, whichever side they are on. To this end, we need to consider the psyche as between reason and unreason, between plight as Kantian duty and responsilbity as Levinasian hostage, in order to bind and rebind ethics and politics, by virtue of our sociality that makes us subjects capable of both love and hate, desire and fear. Once you add the postulations of the unconscious to critical philosophy, it becomes necessary to analyze and avow our own psychic investments in state-sanctioned violence, killing, and war. Psychoanalytic avowal is another form of plight or pledge in the sense of vowing an oath to admit and explore our own economic and psychic investments in the violence we say that we abhor. This is particularly relevant when we feel outraged or wronged and want payback. Recall the “with us or against us” reactions to September 11, 2001, and the continued political discourse on “hunting down” terrorists and “making them pay.” Think, too, of all of the revenge fantasies—too many to begin to list—that populate our cultural imaginary evidenced by popular media, including a new TV soap opera aplty called

            Facts and Norms. I reviewed it as Habermas's most brilliant attempt, and I still stand by that judgment. Allow me to quote from the first and last sentences of my review of that work:
                  We have been debating the book since the day it came out. And it is not insignificant that the famous debate between Rawls and Habermas was anticipated in that book. Beyond that, not only does the book serve as a reconstruction of the path of critical theory, it also provides a revision of Habermas's earlier work. In this sense the discourse on law at the end ofFrom the introduction: “German culture has produced two great theoretical discourses on law represented in the work of Hegel and Weber respectively; now, with the publication of Habermas's
                  Faktizität und Geltung, it may lay claim to a third.”And from the conclusion: “The book promises to play a central role in the future debate on the role of law, not merely because of its theoretical contribution, which is monumental, but because its author has generated a new framework, a new architectonic, from which the phenomenon of law in a democratic society can be perceived. In that sense, this book which was written in the shadow of the great German discourses on law authored by Hegel and Weber will cast its own light.”

Abstract: In the context of this essay on SPEP and postmodern thought (as it is called in popular discourse) I note that our beginning was strictly academic and professional with a primary emphasis on Husserlian phenomenology—Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger, and Sartre were strong secondary interests. The emphasis also fell on a transcendental orientation with additional recognition of the importance of the history of philosophy, a recognition that is not always apparent in Husserl's works. Typical of those academic times, there was minimal expressed alertness to issues of race, color, gender, or colonial domination. Some of the phenomenological and existential works did indeed hold the inception of the revolutionary turn of postmodern thought that would take place in SPEP, but that inception was largely imperceptible in the United States in 1961. It was contained in some of Sartre's work, especially in his way of developing an overt atheism and in his political writings; in Merleau-Ponty's work; and in Heidegger's early work and in the few pieces people read from his post–
         Being and Timewritings, such asVom Wesen der Wahrheit. Confrontations of various phenomenological and existential authors with William James, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and writings in structuralism also had effects that would grow in significance during the society's first fifteen years. As far as I can determine on the basis of available information, the first woman—Marjorie Grene—gave a paper (in a “paper session”) at SPEP in 1972 (although a few women gave “presentations” in sessions called workshops), ten years after its first meeting.<br>

Abstract: I think that what Meillassoux calls “correlationism” is a red herring and, since this is his root complaint, the new realism is the fruit of a poisoned tree. Even in the case of Husserl—there are statements in Husserl that have left us all wondering—the best scholarship today has made it plain that Husserl is not serving up metaphysical idealism but, rather, a theory of what sorts of acts are necessary on the part of the subject in order that objects may appear to the subject.
            
                  Objects do not drop from the sky—and that goes for scientific objects.28
               
                  But the history of phenomenology after Husserl, especially nervous about pure transcendental phenomenology, mounted a sustained insistence on the reality of our being-in-the-world, to adopt the formulation of a young sometime Catholic Aristotelian realist named Heidegger, to which Merleau-Ponty added later on that being-in-the-world is a radically incarnational phenomenon. Levinas made an argument for the radical alterity—read irreducible “reality”—of the other person. Interestingly enough the new realists will sometimes cite Levinas's “reversal” of intentionality and his plea for radical “exteriority” as a residual trace of a quickly evaporating realism among the phenomenologists.29
               
                  When faced with the charge that deconstruction has locked us all within the prison house of language, Derrida replied, a bit nonplussed, that everything he has to say concerns the “other” of language and hence represents a discourse on the real.30

Abstract: For, if phenomenology renounces its search for the absolute and for foundations, then it must give up seeing itself as a single and self-contained discourse. The minimal phenomenologist renounces monolinguism and is no longer the master of only one discourse. Instead, he or she must practice a mixed discourse. To do this is to practice diglossia, to become a code-switcher. In its ordinary sense, the practice of code-switching refers to the passage from one language or dialect to another one in the course of a single conversation, for instance, when the conversation moves from an informal to a formal setting or when it moves from one topic to another. But in the phenomenological context, this would involve the ability to shift from a phenomenological discourse to its “others,” whether they might be Freudian energetics, Deleuzian aspects, Badiouan events, and so on. This practice of translation or code-switching has perhaps always been the role of the phenomenologist, if it is accepted that phenomenological reflection does not begin from itself but is nourished by a life that precedes it and gives rise to it.<br>

Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Adopting a hyperbolic perspective is also certainly a way to argue as well as a way to examine other “texts” because it is a trope and figure of thought that reveals those moments within discourse when one is attempting to transcend the bounds of reality because the extraordinary nature of a given situation or subject matter requires the use of an excessive prophetic voice or an ardent polemical exaggeration. As Mileur posits, “The work is a hyperbole, the intersection of other hyperboles, and the subject is, insofar as he can be written about at all, another hyperbole” (1990, 86). Rather than circumventing it, understanding hyperbole as the focus of thought and action can create significant moments of
      inventioas well aselocutiofor the hyperbolist and critic alike. By approaching a particular text, a critical term, and even a piece of criticism itself from a hyperbolic perspective, one might (re)consider and (re)interpret these “texts” as a stretching of discursive limits that leads one toward a re-presentation of the extraordinary—an attempt to communicate the ineffable or transgress the expressible.<br>

Abstract: For the purposes of this article, I view rhetoric and hermeneutics as two complementary phases in the circulation of discourse, the former being an art emphasizing production and the latter being one emphasizing understanding. I also find H. P. Rickman's characterization illuminating: “Rhetoric is about the process of communication from the point of view of the speaker, hermeneutics about the problems of the listener” (1981, 110). Whereas Rickman describes these fields from the perspective of the human being, both Hans-Georg Gadamer and Ricoeur describe them according to basic function. Gadamer distinguishes between them according to their central practice—speaking for rhetoric, understanding for hermeneutics (1997, 49). Ricoeur defines each one more narrowly, saying that rhetoric is concerned with “arguing,” whereas hermeneutics is concerned with “redescribing” (1997, 71; Ritivoi
         2006, 6). Although each philosopher offers a slightly different definition, they agree that rhetoric and hermeneutics are complementary discursive practices. Ricoeur's hermeneutic sensibility can help us understand how those practices can function almost simultaneously, within one pivotal moment.<br>

Abstract: Alice McEwan, in “The ‘Plumber-Philosopher’: Shaw's Discourse on Domestic Sanitation,” synthesizes Shaw's chronic difficulties with the plumbing at Shaw's Corner, the Shaws' country home in the village of Ayot St. Lawrence, with his reformist views on public health and the “wider implications of how sanitation might link civilization and hygiene to aesthetics.” While connections can be drawn between the playwright and the avant-garde theories of modernist architects, Shaw (as usual) emerges in McEwan's essay with a distinctive vision in which “modern sanitary arrangements … have the power to operate as a cultural trope, revealing truths about how we attempt to organize ‘health’ and manage our bodies in modern society.”<br>

Abstract: Fully primed, faith thrusts hope into the world with a corresponding mission, a motivating moral imperative, whose fulfillment becomes the object of intense human pursuit. The envisioned end state may be mundane or sublime, its scale may be limited or universal, and its dynamism may comprise the catalyzed aspirations of an individual, a group, a nation, or the race as a whole. For Shaw and Ricoeur, the mission is ecumenical in scope, simple in theory, and incontrovertible in substance—humbly: to give more than you take, to treat others as you would wish to be treated, to care for the defenseless, to act justly, to love mercy, to be peacemakers, and to make the world a better place than you find it. Needless to say, the task has proven extraordinarily difficult to complete even locally, let alone globally. If ever there were a “mission impossible,” implementing Jesus's social gospel seems to be it. History itself testifies to the arduousness of the enterprise. Yet, as receptive auditors of the Bible's metaphorical discourse, it is precisely to this singular calling that Shaw and Ricoeur conscientiously harken. In this connection, two things are especially noteworthy about the momentous parallel choices they make. First, they are accompanied by a commensurate hopefulness maintained over lengthy faith-driven lives. Second, they reflect shared philosophical perspectives on the nature of hope and faith, perspectives that are sometimes unreflected in scholarly explorations of these saving graces. In fact, invoking Ricoeur in this context throws a penetrating light not only on hope and faith as phenomena but also on Shaw the tragic-optimist, the Shaw who never allows the tragic dimensions of existence to overwhelm his qualified positivism about the constructive role humans can play in the promotion of life.<br>

Date: September 1, 1983<br>
Author(s): Peters Joan Douglas<br>
Abstract: It has been over ten years since anything significant has been published on D. H. Lawrence's critical prose, and nothing of note has ever been written on the subject of the short essays—“The Novel,” “Surgery for the novel—Or a Bomb,” “Morality and the Novel,” and “Why the novel Matters”—containing his theory of the novel. The rhetorical style Lawrence adopts is so informal, so comical, and often so bizarre that the impulse of critics, when they do refer to these essays, is to ignore the rhetoric and somehow extract a system of logocentric doctrine, a doctrine that does not bear scrutiny. To appreciate Lawrence's genre theory, one cannot ignore the style in which it is written but must instead focus on the dynamics of discourse comprising the rhetorical text. Grounding my reading in Bakhtin's
         carnival, I argue that Lawrence celebrates the novel in terms of its “joyful relativity” (Bakhtin's term), a theory that articulates itself performatively in different ways through its own deconstruction. Read deconstructively, Lawrence's genre theory offers an important contribution to modernist concepts of language, an area from which Lawrence has traditionally been entirely excluded.<br>

Abstract: In the current rhetoric and epistemology of historiography, the issue is no longer to know whether narrative provides a legitimate mode of knowledge. It is to determine whether historians use narrative, and—if they do not—what alternative modes of discourse they may be employing. The examination of a specific corpus: studies published about the period of the German occupation in France, shows that historians now rely on different types of textual organization. While they still use at times a straight, linear type of narrative, they increasingly turn to genres that are low in narrativity or even devoid of it. Eschewing narrative, however, seems reserved for academic historians; story-telling still prevails in “popular” history. Furthermore, the classification offered here depends on a narrow definition of “narrative”; a more inclusive definition would admit more texts under the category “narrative,” thus producing a different taxonomy.<br>

Abstract: The concept of fabula, or its many near equivalents, has always been a staple of narrative theory, yet it is vulnerable to many theoretical objections. It is possible to justify a rhetorical view of the concept's pragmatic value, and so its particular relevance to fiction, but only once various flawed notions of fabula have been eliminated. Some of these relate back quite directly to its Russian Formalist roots, but others have arisen through Structuralist mediations of the concept (in the guise of such pairs as “story” and “discourse”). The inadequacies of these models are manifest in fabula's relationship to event, chronology, temporality, causality, perspective, medium, and the genesis of narrative. The concept remains valuable, however, in respect of its role in interpretation, especially in the case of fictional narrative. The rhetorical basis of this view of fabula and its relation to sujet effectively overturns the logical hierarchy of previous representational models.<br>

Abstract: This paper presents the background, findings, and implications of a new line of research on the technical identification of linguistic metaphor. Inspired by the cognitive-linguistic approach to metaphor launched by Lakoff and Johnson, a new theoretical framework and operational definition has been developed for the identification of metaphorical expressions in authentic discourse. The paper presents a brief report of two reliability studies of the first stage of the approach, and spells out how it may be applied in linguistic, stylistic and rhetorical text analysis with reference to a poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson.<br>

Author(s): Addison Catherine<br>
Abstract: This article deals with the effects of stanza form on the discourse of narrative poetry. It starts by exploring the antagonistic relationship between stanzas and epic. Milton, writing in an age of rhyme, eschews stanzas in
         Paradise Lost. Dante invents a stanza,terza rima, that is not self-contained, but allows forward extension. Tasso remains dissatisfied with hisottava rima Gerusalemme liberataand eventually writes an unrhyming epic,Il mondo creato. The article goes on to examine the more harmonious relationship between stanzas and comic or romance narrative and also investigates how different stanzas develop different types of narrative.Ottava rimalends itself to medley poems such asOrlando furiosoandDon Juan, which delight in antithesis. Both rhyme-royal and the Spenserian stanza avoid the blatant contrasts inherent inottava rimaand are hence suited to less directly ironic types of narrative voice.<br>

Author(s): Green Susan<br>
Abstract: Drawing upon recent ideas from the cognitive sciences, this paper is an interdisciplinary exploration of the representation of consciousness in McEwan's novel
         Enduring Love, focussing on overlapping manifestations of Theory of Mind ranging from altruism to violent pathology. Through techniques such as intertextuality, the use of paratexts, and the juxtaposition of scientific and literary discourses, McEwan constructs this novel as a Theory of Mind creating a demanding and appealing reading experience that mirrors the doubt and uncertainty of the characters as they strive to understand each others' minds. McEwan's deep interest in science and what it can and cannot tell us about human nature is a potent theme inEnduring Love. This article argues thatEnduring Loveexposes and exploits the unique potential of literary narrative to represent our intense desire to engage with other minds, both highlighting the fact that we are designed by nature to read and to misread minds, as well as the capacity of the novel to communicate the raw feel of human experience in a way that eludes scientific discourse.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: This unceasing flow is precisely what, according to Julia Kristeva, articulates the semiotic function of writing in what she calls a “pulsating
         chora”
               —an idea glossed by Brivic as “the level of maternal pulsation in language.”158
            
               Kristeva identifies this159
            choraas a “totality formed by the [semiotic] drives … in a motility that is as full of movement as it is regulated.”
               She cites Joyce's work as representative of that rare set of literary texts that “cover the infinity of the [signifying] process, that is, reach the semiotic160
            chora.”
               In that Joyce's writing confronts patriarchal regulation with this deconstructive, progressive, and chaotic flow, its attraction to feminist theorists is clear: as Brivic notes, “Joyce's experiments directly inspired two of the leading thinkers of the161
            écriture fémininemovement, Hélène Cixous and Julia Kristeva.”
               Like poststructuralist feminism, Joyce's work advances a mode of Utopianism that necessarily resists categorization. In discussing her notion of162
            écriture féminine(a literary form in which she includes Joyce's work—indeed she wrote her doctoral thesis on Joyce),
               Hélène Cixous has suggested that it is impossible to define such modes of writing and that “this is an impossibility that will remain, for this practice can never be theorized, enclosed, coded—which doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.”163
            
               While Herbert Marcuse may have suggested that the Utopian is validated by its categorization as such (and thereby by its exclusion from normative, hegemonic discourse), the mode of Utopianism expressed by Kristeva's164
            choraor Cixous'sécriture féminineis validated by virtue of the fact that it cannot be so categorized. Like Joyce's “word known to all men,”
               Utopia is too fluid for such reductive definition.165<br>

Abstract: In consideration of the conception of Utopia introduced above, the first task confronting any attempt to gain a more precise definition of Utopia for architecture is to untangle the terms
         visionaryandUtopiafrom one another. The necessity of doing so derives from the frequency with which they are confused as synonyms in architectural discourse. For example, Neil Spiller's recentVisionary Architecture: Blueprints of the Modern Imagination(2006) and Jane Alison and Marie-Ange Brayer'sFuture City: Experiment and Utopia in Architecture(2007) are revealing for the degree to whichvisionaryandUtopiaappear to be interchangeable when considered across both volumes. Other recent books that encourage such confusion include Ruth Eaton'sIdeal Cities: Utopianism and the (Un)Built Environment(2002) and Franco Borsi'sArchitecture and Utopia(1997).<br>

Abstract: Familial
         memoryis indispensable to individual memory. By recounting memories, the individual gains greater control over them, integrating them within self-identity. These functions are undermined by theRepublicanfamily's fear of reprisals for articulating a counter-discourse in theFrancoist New State, and the personal history of Sunta, the narrator inAlfons Cervera's
               
                  , is bereft of supportive socio-cultural frameworks. Sunta resolves this situation through the medium of narrative memory, which effects a retrospective uncovering of memory traces through images of the past, allowing her to revisit an inadequately assimilated childhood from an empowered position.El color del crepúsculo<br>
