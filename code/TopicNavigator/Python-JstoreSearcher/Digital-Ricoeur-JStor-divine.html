  Book Title: A Problem of Presence-Beyond Scripture in an African Church<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Engelke Matthew<br>
  Abstract: The Friday Masowe apostolics of Zimbabwe refer to themselves as “the Christians who don’t read the Bible.” They claim they do not need the Bible because they receive the Word of God “live and direct” from the Holy Spirit. In this insightful and sensitive historical ethnography, Matthew Engelke documents how this rejection of scripture speaks to longstanding concerns within Christianity over mediation and authority. The Bible, of course, has been a key medium through which Christians have recognized God’s presence. But the apostolics perceive scripture as an unnecessary, even dangerous, mediator. For them, the materiality of the Bible marks a distance from the divine and prohibits the realization of a live and direct faith. Situating the Masowe case within a broad comparative framework, Engelke shows how their rejection of textual authority poses a problem of presence—which is to say, how the religious subject defines, and claims to construct, a relationship with the spiritual world through the semiotic potentials of language, actions, and objects. Written in a lively and accessible style, A Problem of Presence makes important contributions to the anthropology of Christianity, the history of religions in Africa, semiotics, and material culture studies.<br>

  Book Title: Tales of the Neighborhood-Jewish Narrative Dialogues in Late Antiquity<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Hasan-Rokem Galit<br>
  Abstract: In this lively and intellectually engaging book, Galit Hasan-Rokem shows that religion is shaped not only in the halls of theological disputation and institutions of divine study, but also in ordinary events of everyday life. Common aspects of human relations offer a major source for the symbols of religious texts and rituals of late antique Judaism as well as its partner in narrative dialogues, early Christianity, Hasan-Rokem argues. Focusing on the "neighborhood" of the Galilee that is the birthplace of many major religious and cultural developments, this book brings to life the riddles, parables, and folktales passed down in Rabbinic stories from the first half of the first millennium of the Common Era.<br>

  Abstract: Leibniz displayed a special alertness to the metaphor of
                  organism—its dynamical aspects, its animating force, its inherent vitalism. Far from being something merely mechanistic, the organic body of the monad—which we have seen to be intimately tied to place—is a “living being” or “divine machine.”¹ Since every monad is in effect a world filled with monads at increasingly minuscule levels, organicity extends to everything in the end: “There is a world of creatures, living beings, animals, entelechies, souls, in the smallest particle of matter.”² Hence every bit of matter can be compared to a pond filled with<br>

Beneath the surface of bewitchment and half-sick amusement, however, lies the realization that evil is real and that people must find a way to face and overcome it. What we require, Carl Jung suggested, is a morality of evil—a carefully thought out plan by which to manage the evil in ourselves, in others, and in whatever deities we posit.¹ This book is not written from a Jungian perspective, but it is nonetheless an attempt to describe a morality of<br>

  Author(s) Putman Rhyne<br>
  Abstract: While the Lord tarries, doctrine develops. The progress and growth of ideas is an inevitable historical reality, even in religious traditions purportedly rooted in divine revelation. In post-critical Christian theology, attitudes toward this phenomenon are undergoing considerable change. Once met with contempt and anxiety from Protestants and Roman Catholics alike, the idea of postcanonical doctrinal development nowadays meets with a far more favorable, even enthusiastic consent in both circles. Evangelicals, however, meet with the prospect of doctrinal development in the tension between two poles: an unwavering commitment to the supreme authority of God’s unchanging word (

  Book Title: Sin Boldly!-Justifying Faith for Fragile and Broken Souls<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): MARTY MARTIN E.<br>
  Abstract: Can faith as trusting God make a difference? Absolutely—by relieving our anxiety over self-justification and the need to scapegoat others. When we discover we don't justify ourselves because God has justified us, we become free. What Sin Boldly! points to is the presence of the crucified and living Christ in the human soul, placed there by the Holy Spirit. And this becomes transformative. Sin Boldly! provides an experiential analysis of the contrast between self-justification and justification by God. Those among us with fragile souls are anxious, and we shore up our anxiety with walls of self-justification that victimize those whom we scapegoat. Those among us with broken souls have lost the very moral universe that makes any kind of justification possible, and this usually leads to anomie and suicide. We must pose the question: how can the gospel of grace provide transformation for both fragile and broken souls? After an exposition of the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, this book proposes the following answer: trusting in the God of grace relieves anxiety and provides a divine vocation that transcends our moral universe with the promise of forgiveness, renewal, and resurrection.<br>

         The Unfolding God of Jung and Miltonillumines Jung's heterodox notion of Godhead as a quarternity rather than a trinity, his revolutionary concept of a divine individuation process, his radical solution to the problem of evil, and his wrestling with the feminine in Godhead.

  Book Title: Tastes of the Divine: Hindu and Christian Theologies of Emotion-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS MICHELLE VOSS<br>
  Abstract: The intensity and meaningfulness of aesthetic experience have often been described in theological terms. By designating basic human emotions as rasa, a word that connotes taste, flavor, or essence, Indian aesthetic theory conceptualizes emotional states as something to be savored. At their core, emotions can be tastes of the divine. In this book, the methods of the emerging discipline of comparative theology enable the author's appreciation of Hindu texts and practices to illuminate her Christian reflections on aesthetics and emotion. Three emotions vie for prominence in the religious sphere: peace, love, and fury. Whereas Indian theorists following Abhinavagupta claim that the aesthetic emotion of peace best approximates the goal of religious experience, devotees of Krishna and medieval Christian readings of the Song of Songs argue that love communicates most powerfully with divinity. In response to the transcendence emphasized in both approaches, the book turns to fury at injustice to attend to emotion's foundations in the material realm. The implications of this constructive theology of emotion for Christian liturgy, pastoral care, and social engagement are manifold.<br>

On the one hand, it has the imaginative warmth of a poetic sensibility that mines the silence in order to overhear the inner echoes of the transcendent and pierces the visual for tracings on the invisible.

It takes up the meaning of prayer from within a uniquely phenomenological point of view, demonstrating that the phenomenology of prayer is as much about the character and boundaries of phenomenological analysis as it is about the heart of religious life.The contributors: Michael F.

Is prayer, then, essentially “begging,” and is “begging” the surest avenue to the divine? Or is begging simply the final resort left to us when all other presumed resources have revealed their finitude and exhaustibility, exposing the naked truth of crucifixion?

  Author(s) Kirchhoffer David G.<br>
  Abstract: One of the most heavily discussed topics in theological anthropology focuses on different interpretations of the meaning of imago Dei, humanity made in the image of God. A deeper knowledge of the common evolutionary heritage of human beings and other creatures has prompted some discussion about whether such a position of seemingly absolute human distinctiveness can still be maintained. Furthermore, mounting ecological awareness, and sensitivity to the shameless exploitation of other animals, points to the potential ethical ambiguity in maintaining a strong sense of human superiority.

  Book Title: Toward a Theology of Eros: Transfiguring Passion at the Limits of Discipline-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLER CATHERINE<br>
  Abstract: What does theology have to say about the place of eroticism in the salvific transformation of men and women, even of the cosmos itself? How, in turn, does eros infuse theological practice and transfigure doctrinal tropes? Avoiding the well-worn path of sexual moralizing while also departing decisively from Anders Nygren's influential insistence that Christian agape must have nothing to do with worldly eros, this book explores what is still largely uncharted territory in the realm of theological erotics. The ascetic, the mystical, the seductive, the ecstatic-these are the places where the divine and the erotic may be seen to converge and love and desire to commingle.Inviting and performing a mutual seduction of disciplines, the volume brings philosophers, historians, biblical scholars, and theologians into a spirited conversation that traverses the limits of conventional orthodoxies, whether doctrinal or disciplinary. It seeks new openings for the emergence of desire, love, and pleasure, while challenging common understandings of these terms. It engages risk at the point where the hope for salvation paradoxically endangers the safety of subjects-in particular, of theological subjects-by opening them to those transgressions of eros in which boundaries, once exceeded, become places of emerging possibility.The eighteen chapters, arranged in thematic clusters, move fluidly among and between premodern and postmodern textual traditions-from Plato to Emerson, Augustine to Kristeva, Mechthild to Mattoso, the Shulammite to Molly Bloom, the Zohar to the Da Vinci Code. In so doing, they link the sublime reaches of theory with the gritty realities of politics, the boundless transcendence of God with the poignant transience of materiality.<br>

It need not traffic in super-earthly hopes.

  Book Title: Divine Enticement: Theological Seductions-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): MACKENDRICK KARMEN<br>
  Abstract: Theology usually appears to us to be dogmatic, judgmental, condescending, maybe therapeutic, or perhaps downright fantastical-but seldom enticing. Divine Enticement takes as its starting point that the meanings of theological concepts are not so much logical, truth-valued propositions-affirmative or negative-as they are provocations and evocations. Thus it argues for the seductiveness of both theology and its subject-for, in fact, infinite seduction and enticement as the very sense of theological query. The divine name is one by which we are drawn toward the limits of thought, language, and flesh. The use of language in such conceptualization calls more than it designates. This is not a flaw or a result of vagueness or imprecision in theological language but rather marks the correspondence of such language to its subject: that which, outside of or at the limit of our thought, draws us as an enticement to desire, not least to intellectual desire. Central to the text is the strange semiotics of divine naming, as a call on that for which there cannot be a standard referent. The entanglement of sign and body, not least in interpretations of the Christian incarnation, both grounds and complicates the theological abstractions. A number of traditional notions in Christian theology are reconceived here as enticements, modes of drawing the desires of both body and mind: faith as "thinking with assent"; sacraments as "visible words" read in community; ethics as responsiveness to beauty; prayer as the language of address; scripture as the story of meaning-making. All of these culminate in a sense of a call to and from the purely possible, the open space into which we can be enticed, within which we can be divinely enticing.<br>

  Abstract: Ethical speaking is a strange, intercut mode of address and listening. As some of the peculiarities of the sign are made vivid in thinking of sacraments as divine signs, so too the strangeness of speaking is especially evident when it calls upon an infinite addressee. In considering the peculiarity of prayer as an address from finite to infinite, I have followed Nancy, for whom “The singular address to a singular God—my god!—is prayer in general.”¹ The singular address links prayer to love, with an echo of Augustine’s “what then do I love when I love my God?”² But<br>

  Abstract: I wish here to explore the relation between our desire to exist meaningfully through action and the question that this poses for philosophy. My thesis is simple: We are erotic beings. Our Eros, however, is neither divine nor animal. It is distinctively human: We are beings who seek meaning imaginatively through each other, and the locus of this transformative encounter is the community. This model of human nature contrasts with the dominant view in analytic philosophy of humans as “minds” consisting of “states,” as purely “epistemic subjects” whose primary function is thought to lie in generating propositional claims about the<br>

Proponents of supralapsarian Christology do not deny that God deals with the sin problem through the incarnate Christ, but they hold that there are deeper and more important reasons for the incarnation than reconciliation and redemption. In this christological model the goal of creation is a love relationship with human beings, and in this relationship God comes as close to God’s creatures as God can—in becoming human.

  Book Title: The subject of love-Hélène Cixous and the feminine divine<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Renshaw Sal<br>
  Abstract: *The Subject of Love: Hélène Cixous and the Feminine Divine* is about abundant, generous, other-regarding love. In the history of Western ideas of love, such a configuration has been inseparable from our ideas about divinity and the sacred; often reserved only for God; and rarely thought of as a human achievement. This book is a substantial engagement with her philosophies of love, inviting the reader to reflect on the conditions of subjectivity that just might open us to something like a divine love of the other. Renshaw follows this thread in this genealogy of abundant love: the thread that connects the subject of love from 5th century B.C.E. Greece and Plato, to the 20th century protestant theology of agapic love of Anders Nygren, to the late 20th century poetico-philosophy of Hélène Cixous. This study will be of particular interest to academics and students of the history of gender, cultural studies, criticism and gender studies<br>

  Book Title: Restoring the Right Relationship-  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Brien Mark A<br>
  Abstract: A leading biblical scholar, Hans Heinrich Schmid, believes that righteousness, or the right order of the world, is 'the fundamental problem of our human existence'. It is a key theme in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament's theology of creation and salvation, along with associated themes such as justice, steadfast love/loyalty, truth/ fidelity, compassion/mercy, sin and disorder/chaos. A number of studies of righteousness have been undertaken but most have tended to focus on Israel's call to be righteous, as voiced in particular in the Prophetic Books and the Psalter. In contrast, this book focuses on divine righteousness as the basis for all other notions of righteousness, as this is outlined in the foundational teaching or revelation of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament— namely, the Torah or Pentateuch. It then undertakes a study of how righteousness in the Prophetic Books, the Psalter and the Book of Job relates to this foundational teaching.<br>

The different genres of Genesis 12 (speech, journey, anecdote) are not present. The sustained divine monologue of Genesis 17 does not recur. Instead, the text is in the form of a report of what happened when the fleeing Israelites were delivered from the pursuing Egyptian force. The paradox has not escaped later rabbis: deliverance for the Israelites means destruction for the Egyptians. In the midst of disturbance, deliverance brings joy; in times of tranquillity, destruction brings pain.<br>

While honouring the tradition, it also marked a quite dramatic development in the Church’s attitude to modern critical analysis of the Bible and encouraged study and reflection on it by all members of the Church. The golden jubilee of its publication is a timely moment for a book such as this. It contains essays on various aspects of Dei Verbum by authors from around the world. They write from the perspective of their respective disciplines of biblical studies, patristics, theology, liturgy, philosophy, and communications media. They situate the document within the Jewish-Christian tradition, assess its reception since Vatican II, and its implications for the future.<br>

  Abstract: Scripture has been the indispensable, authorizing source of Christian sermons since Christianity’s beginnings. The sermons of Peter, Stephen, and Paul in Acts all draw on Old Testament texts. The book of Hebrews, thought by some to be a collection of early Christian sermons, draws on material across the Old Testament, especially the Psalms. This chapter provides you with a disciplined, prayerful, and scholarly process for engaging Scripture. Exegetical work (close grammatical, historical, and theological study of a text) is supported in this method by meditative Scripture reading using the centuriesold process called
                     lectio divina(“divine reading”).<br>

  Book Title: Horror and Its Aftermath-Reconsidering Theology and Human Experience<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Stamper Sally<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology often brings psychology to bear on the contingent nature of human existence in relationship to God. In this volume, Sally Stamper articulates one modern trajectory of theological recourse to psychology (comprising Schleiermacher, Nietzsche, and Tillich) as the ground on which she brings clinical psychoanalytic theory and early childhood studies into conversation with fundamental questions about the relationship of God to human suffering and its remediation. She develops her argument from the assertions that human experience evolves within an awareness of human vulnerability to profound suffering and that insight into consequent human anxiety is a powerful resource for soteriology, eschatology, and theological anthropology. Stamper narrates this “normative anxiety" by integrating object relations theories of early childhood development and critical readings of literary texts for young children. She gestures toward a new eschatological vision that poses the radical otherness of a transcendent God as key to divine remediation of human suffering, in the process building on Marilyn McCord Adams’s soteriological response to human horror-participation and on Jonathan Lear’s assertion of radical hope in response to catastrophic collapse of cultural resources for making meaning.<br>

Moreover, his influential contribution to the revival of Trinitarian theology is implicitly reliant on a dynamic account of Jesus’ relation to the God of Israel.<br>

  Book Title: Returning to Reality-Christian Platonism for our Times<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Tyson Paul<br>
  Abstract: Could it be that we have lost touch with some basic human realities in our day of high-tech efficiency, frenetic competition, and ceaseless consumption? Have we turned from the moral, the spiritual, and even the physical realities that make our lives meaningful? These are metaphysical questions -questions about the nature of reality- but they are not abstract questions. These are very down to earth questions that concern power and the collective frameworks of belief and action governing our daily lives. This book is an introduction to the history, theory, and application of Christian metaphysics. Yet this book is not just an introduction, it is also a passionately argued call for a profound change in the contemporary Christian mind. Paul Tyson argues that as Western culture’s Christian Platonist understanding of reality was replaced by modern pragmatic realism, we turned not just from one outlook on reality to another, but away from reality itself. This book seeks to show that if we can recover this ancient Christian outlook on reality, reframed for our day, then we will be able to recover a way of life that is in harmony with human and divine truth.<br>

In this new work, Howell shows that instances of divine action should not automatically be reduced simply to theological categories such as omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, immutability, etc., nor to criteria such as personhood, life, and approachability. Rather, he introduced readers to two unique approaches to “anthropomorphic expressions".<br>

  Book Title: The Fate of Saul's Progeny in the Reign of David-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Longman Tremper<br>
  Abstract: Cephas Tushima provides a thorough analysis of the fate of Saul's heirs, focussing on whether their tragedies were due to continuing divine retribution, coincidence, or Davidic orchestration. He concludes that David was unjust and calculating in his dealings with the Saulides and, like other Near Eastern usurpers, perpetrated heinous injustices against the vanquished house of Saul. Traditionally readers saw Saul as evil and David as a hero; but more recently scholars have written about Saul as a tragic character and David as a villain, turning the book of Samuel into deeply contested interpretive territory. Tushima provides analysis of the critical literature surrounding this contentious issue and contributes his own study that will prove important to the continuing debate. He assesses David's character by analysing how he treats the surviving children of his predecessor, drawing upon the provisions for justice in the covenant community in the book of Deuteronomy. He demonstrates a connection between Samuel and the Torah through themes and motifs, and develops theological conclusions from them on such issues as the impact of human conduct on the environment, marriage, monarchy and Zion theology.<br>

  Abstract: While in Genesis 2-11 the Yahwist confronts the issue of evil through a sequence of stories on the progressive deterioration of the divine-human relationship, in Genesis 4 he describes the initial slaughter of one human being by another as fratricidal. This book provides a close reading of J's story by using literary criticism and psychological criticism, and shows that the biblical author has more than an "archaeological" design. His characters - including God, Adam, Eve, Cain, and Abel, plus minor character - are paradigmatic, as they allow J to proceed with a fine analytical feel for the nature of evil as performed by "homo" as "homini lupus." No imaginative "mimesis" of evil has ever been recounted with such an economy of means and such depth of psychological insight.<br>

The larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, then to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. This second volume of studies proceeds on the basis of the presuppositions of this symbol, those implicit attestations that provide the conditions of possibility for divine suffering-that which constitutes divine vulnerability with respect to creation-as identified and examined in the first volume of this project: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life-the imago Dei as love. The second volume then investigates the first two divine wounds or modes of divine suffering to which the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally attest: (1) divine grief, suffering because of betrayal by the beloved human or human sin; and (2) divine self-sacrifice, suffering for the beloved human in its bondage to sin or misery, to establish the possibility of redemption and reconciliation. Each divine wound, thus, constitutes a response to a creaturely occasion. The suffering in each divine wound also occurs in two stages: a passive stage and an active stage. In divine grief, God suffers because of human sin, betrayal of the divine lover by the beloved human: divine sorrow as the passive stage of divine grief; and divine angui~<br>

Specifically, I would have preferred to develop more extensively my exposition of the features of God’s active resistance in the second divine wound, features that already provide the basis for diverse communities of genuine solidarity with those who suffer oppression, suppression, repression, abuse, marginalization, and victimization.

  Abstract: In the last chapter, we saw how Barth, in his early writings, responded theologically and practically to the events around him during 1910s and 1920s. Reversing the dominant structure of modern ethics, which attempts to secure human freedom by separating humanity from God, Barth saw clearly that human freedom depends upon God’s freedom to act
                  in relatio. Thus, his task, in these early writings, was not to simply contrast God’s action and our action as the way to preserve human autonomy, but instead attempts to demonstrate how divine agency establishes, rather than negates, human agency.

  Book Title: God's Wounds-Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Volume 1. Divine Vulnerability and Creation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the first volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Divine Vulnerability and Creation. This study first develops an approach to interpreting the contested claims about the suffering of God. Thus, the larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. Through this approach, this volume of studies into the Christian symbol of divine suffering then investigates the two major presuppositions that the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally hold: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life - the imago Dei as love. When fully elaborated, these presuppositions reveal the conditions of possibility for divine suffering and divine vulnerability with respect to creation.<br>

  Book Title: Analogies of Transcendence-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): FIELDS STEPHEN M.<br>
  Abstract: The problem of nature and grace lies at the heart of Christian theology. No dimension of divine revelation can be addressed without implicitly drawing reference to this issue.Analogies of Transcendence focuses on the central role that the analogies of being and faith play in developing a solution to the problem. These link God, as self-manifesting transcendence, to the human person as both fallen and justified, and to the material cosmos. Although the proposed solution draws on the work of Maréchal, de Lubac, Balthasar, and Rahner, it criticizes their approach for its underdeveloped analogies that diminish nature in grace's engagement with it. In redressing this weakness, Fr. Fields adapts its solution to the intellectual struggle of our time. This volume examines the origins and structure of modernity, which, it asserts, has not been superseded and is therefore critical of'‘postmodernism,' as well as of some ambiguous legacies of Thomism.<br>

Building on the letter as the intrinsic symbol of the spirit, it understands divine revelation as a system of continuous symbols that join together Christ, his words and works, the apostolic tradition of the church, and the written scriptures and their interpretation. Whenever a synthesis is grounded in symbolism, its aesthetic dimension cannot help but be invoked. Heidegger reminds us, for instance, that symbolism constitutes the essence of art.¹ In the creative fashioning of an artifact, truth itself is preserved as beauty.

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

  Abstract: Love and Christian Ethicsaddresses significant authors, texts, and topics dealing with the interlaced meanings of divine love, love for God, neighbor love, and love for oneself. A recurring question is whether and how the Christian moral life amounts to a kind of eudaimonism. The book also offers insights and arguments that develop alternative accounts of the normative content of the command to love the neighbor as oneself. Beyond these concerns, the collection practically reframes an ethic of agape regarding (and this is a partial list) love’s motivational effectiveness, sexual life, the moral repair of communities, and interreligious exchange.<br>

  Abstract: In an epic constructive investigation, The Crucifixion of the Warrior God addresses the tension between Scripture’s violent depictions of God and the non-violent, self-sacrificial God that was supremely revealed on the cross. Over two volumes, author Gregory A. Boyd develops a theological interpretation of Scripture that he labels a “cruciform hermeneutic," and he argues that this cruciform way of reading Scripture reframes its violent divine portraits in a way that subverts their violence and that discloses how they bear witness to the revelation of God’s non-violent love in the crucified Christ.<br>

  Abstract: There is one final category of violent divine portraits in the OT that yet need to be assessed through the lens of the cross. How are we to interpret biblical depictions of certain OT heroes that display God’s power in violent ways? What are we to make of Elisha pronouncing a supernatural curse on forty-two boys that caused them to be mauled by two bears (2 Kgs 2:23–24), or of Elijah using his supernatural power to have fire from heaven annihilate one hundred men, even though these men meant him no harm (2 Kgs 1:10–12)?

  Abstract: During the Enlightenment the concept of power that had dominated ancient and medieval physics underwent a profound transformation. Previously thought to derive from a source beyond the physical world, it came to be viewed as immanent in that world and eventually as coinciding with the very nature of bodiliness. Aristotle’s theory that all motion originated from an unmoved mover had continued to influence Scholastic theories throughout the Middle Ages. For Jewish, Muslim, and Christian thinkers, the impact of divine power went beyond motion and extended to the very existence of finite beings.

  Abstract: The biblical and the rabbinic literatures are devoid of substantial symbolic propensities, if by symbolism we understand a way of reflecting the divine attributes or worlds by means of a sustained exegesis of the sacred scriptures. The emergence of forms of Kabbalah that display a vigorous symbolic mode of interpretation, and the composition of a book that is informed by a symbolic code and becomes canonical, are therefore sharp departures from the royal road of expression and interpretation dominant, previously, in those forms of religious literature.¹ Interestingly, even after the ascent of this figurative mode in some Kabbalistic writings, symbolic<br>

  Abstract: Divination and Human Naturecasts a new perspective on the rich tradition of ancient divination-the reading of divine signs in oracles, omens, and dreams. Popular attitudes during classical antiquity saw these readings as signs from the gods while modern scholars have treated such beliefs as primitive superstitions. In this book, Peter Struck reveals instead that such phenomena provoked an entirely different accounting from the ancient philosophers. These philosophers produced subtle studies into what was an odd but observable fact-that humans could sometimes have uncanny insights-and their work signifies an early chapter in the cognitive history of intuition.<br>

  Author(s): BARRETT JORDAN P.<br>
  Abstract: Divine Simplicityengages recent critics and address one of their major concerns: that the doctrine of divine simplicity is not a biblical teaching. By analyzing the use of Scripture by key theologians from the early church to Karl Barth, Barrett finds that divine simplicity developed in order to respond to theological errors (e.g., Eunomianism) and to avoid misreading Scripture. The volume then explains how divine simplicity can be rearticulated by following a formal analogy from the doctrine of the Trinity in which the divine attributes are identical to the divine essence but are not identical to each other.<br>

  Abstract: A record of the 2015 Building Bridges Seminar for leading Christian and Muslim scholars, this collection of essays explores the nature of divine and human agency through themes of creation's goal, humankind's dignity and task, and notions of sovereignty. Part I sets the context for the book with "Human Action within Divine Creation: A Muslim Perspective" by Mohsen Kadivar of Duke University and "On the Possibility of Holy Living: A Christian Perspective" by Lucy Gardner of Oxford University. The rest of the book includes paired essays-one from a Muslim perspective, one from a Christian perspective-that introduce scriptural material with commentary to aid readers in conducting dialogical study. In her conclusion, coeditor Lucinda Mosher digests the illuminating small-group conversations that lie at the heart of the Building Bridges initiative, conversations that convey a vivid sense of the lively, penetrating but respectful dialogue for which the project is known.

  Abstract: Recognizing the essential heteronomy of postmodern philosophy of religion, Merold Westphal argues against the assumption that human reason is universal, neutral, and devoid of presupposition. Instead, Westphal contends that any philosophy is a matter of faith and the philosophical encounter with theology arises from the very act of thinking. Relying on the work of Spinoza, Kant, and Hegel, Westphal discovers that their theologies render them mutually incompatible and their claims to be the voice of autonomous and universal reason look dubious. Westphal grapples with this plural nature of human thought in the philosophy of religion and he forwards the idea that any appeal to the divine must rest on a historical and phenomenological analysis.<br>

First, a crucial premise of the enterprise has shown itself to be unsustainable. It is the assumption that human reason is universal, part of the standard equipment of human nature. As such, it is presumed to be objective, neutral, presuppositionless, the only source of reliable knowledge. As such, it is “nonsectarian” by contrast with the plurality of “religions of the book,” those that appeal to the authority of some particular divine revelation and are in this way heteronomous.<br>

  Abstract: It is well known that late medieval literary theory owes much to Aquinas’s reconciliation of human rhetoric with the divine revelation of truth in the text of Scripture. Aquinas and those theorists who followed his method accomplished this rapprochement by redrawing the boundaries between the literal and the spiritual senses of Scripture and assimilating rhetorical language to the literal sense.

  Abstract: In this chapter I will review three major attempts to overcome the theological dualism modern culture inherited from late medieval thought, namely, those of humanist religion, the early Reformation, and Jansenist theology. According to such Christian humanists as Valla, Erasmus, and Ficino, a universal divine attraction sanctifies the natural order and draws it back to its source. Archaic religion, ancient philosophy, Hebrew and Christian revelation—in an order of increasing intensity—all responded to the same divine impulse. Generally speaking, humanism offered more an alternative than an answer to the questions raised by fifteenth-century School theology. Humanists, even when acquainted<br>

  Abstract: The words “religious language” (henceforth RL) do not occur in the Hebrew Bible. In philosophy of religion, the concept refers to statements or claims made about divine beings. In that sense the RL of the Hebrew Bible denotes the god-talk of ancient Israelite religion. Most approaches to biblical god-talk in contemporary philosophy of religion have tended to be evaluative, either trying to make biblical god-talk seem philosophically credible or attempting to prove it nonsensical. Few philosophical inquiries are actually interested in the provisioning of a purely descriptive analysis of the RL of the Hebrew Bible for its own sake. This<br>

  Abstract: Deep in the

The issue, very extensively discussed in medieval Trinitarian theology from the twelfth century on, is whether the divine essence generates, or is generated—whether the essence itself, and not merely one or another of the divine Persons, can rightly be said to generate or beget anything, or to be generated or begotten by anything. The answer is an emphatic no: “The essence does not generate the essence.”¹ Generating and being generated are each characteristics which are proper or<br>

In a dialogical theological conversation, it instills a “tragic vision” that contributes to a “fullness of insight into the human condition” (1992, 9).

  Book Title: Making Transcendents-Ascetics and Social Memory in Early Medieval China<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Campany Robert Ford<br>
  Abstract: By the middle of the third century B.C.E. in China there were individuals who sought to become transcendents (xian)—deathless, godlike beings endowed with supernormal powers. This quest for transcendence became a major form of religious expression and helped lay the foundation on which the first Daoist religion was built. Both xian and those who aspired to this exalted status in the centuries leading up to 350 C.E. have traditionally been portrayed as secretive and hermit-like figures. This groundbreaking study offers a very different view of xian-seekers in late classical and early medieval China. It suggests that transcendence did not involve a withdrawal from society but rather should be seen as a religious role situated among other social roles and conceived in contrast to them. Robert Campany argues that the much-discussed secrecy surrounding ascetic disciplines was actually one important way in which practitioners presented themselves to others. He contends, moreover, that many adepts were not socially isolated at all but were much sought after for their power to heal the sick, divine the future, and narrate their exotic experiences.

  Book Title: The Undivine Comedy-Detheologizing Dante<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): BAROLINI TEODOLINDA<br>
  Abstract: Accepting Dante's prophetic truth claims on their own terms, Teodolinda Barolini proposes a "detheologized" reading as a global new approach to the
      Divine Comedy. Not aimed at excising theological concerns from Dante, this approach instead attempts to break out of the hermeneutic guidelines that Dante structured into his poem and that have resulted in theologized readings whose outcomes have been overdetermined by the poet. By detheologizing, the reader can emerge from this poet's hall of mirrors and discover the narrative techniques that enabled Dante to forge a true fiction. Foregrounding the formal exigencies that Dante masked as ideology, Barolini moves from the problems of beginning to those of closure, focusing always on the narrative journey. Her investigation--which treats such topics as the visionary and the poet, the One and the many, narrative and time--reveals some of the transgressive paths trodden by a master of mimesis, some of the ways in which Dante's poetic adventuring is indeed, according to his own lights, Ulyssean.<br>

The reasons the victors had for depositing these trophies are probably very complicated; the desire to thank a divine patron and commemorate a signal success may have played an important role, but also perhaps the desire<br>

  Book Title: Gender and Narrativity-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): RUTLAND BARRY<br>
  Abstract: It is impossible to imagine a community that is not divided into at least two gender groups. It is equally impossible to imagine a community that does not tell or enact stories. The relationship between these universal aspects of human culture is the mainspring of Gender and Narrativity. From Genesis to Freud, the Western narrative tradition tells the same old story of masculine dominance/feminine subservience as a matter of divine will or natural truth. Here, nine Canadian scholars challenge and interpret this tradition, in effect "re-telling" the story of gender, and themselves intervening in the narrative process. Critical readings from a wide range of literary texts - medieval and modern, European and Canadian - replace abstract theory in these studies, while sociology, anthropology, psychoanalysis, deconstruction and new history are the axes of discussion. This book exemplifies the current range and diversity of Canadian critical writing.<br>

  Book Title: Christian Doctrine and the Grammar of Difference-A Contribution to Feminist Systematic Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): McRandal Janice<br>
  Abstract: Christian Doctrine and the Grammar of Difference argues that the most potent and resourceful theological response to the challenging questions of gender and difference is to be found in a retrieval of a doctrinal framework for feminist theology. In particular, it is suggested that a doctrinal narrative of creation, fall, and redemption—underpinned by the doctrinal grammar of the Trinity—provides resources to resolve the theological impasse of difference in contemporary feminist theology. The divine economy reveals a God who enters into history and destabilizes fixed binaries and oppressive categories. The biblical narrative discloses a subtle yet potent fluidity to the Triune relationships. As created subjects—precisely in our difference—we are sustained, affirmed, and drawn back into the Triune life. The subtleties of divine transgression are already recognized in the patterns of the liturgy, in prayer, and in practices of contemplation. Here, bodies not only encounter the transgressive love of God but are enabled to inhabit their differentiated humanity with distinctiveness and grace. The grammar of Christian faith cannot ultimately be uncovered except in prayer, opened beyond itself to a source of life and giving.<br>

Understandably, feminist theologians have sought to destabilize the gender rigidity of language about God. And yet feminist rearticulations often bring with them the same discursive rules that are criticized in the use of masculine language. When women’s experience becomes the basis of language for God, feminists risk ascribing a fixed symbol upon the divine name. However, in practices of prayer and contemplation the sheer otherness of God draws us to the limits of language, and causes a blurring of all fixed<br>

  Book Title: The Science of the Soul in Colonial New England-  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): RIVETT SARAH<br>
  Abstract: The Science of the Soulchallenges long-standing notions of Puritan provincialism as antithetical to the Enlightenment. Sarah Rivett demonstrates that, instead, empiricism and natural philosophy combined with Puritanism to transform the scope of religious activity in colonial New England from the 1630s to the Great Awakening of the 1740s.In an unprecedented move, Puritan ministers from Thomas Shepard and John Eliot to Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards studied the human soul using the same systematic methods that philosophers applied to the study of nature. In particular, they considered the testimonies of tortured adolescent girls at the center of the Salem witch trials, Native American converts, and dying women as a source of material insight into the divine. Conversions and deathbed speeches were thus scrutinized for evidence of grace in a way that bridged the material and the spiritual, the visible and the invisible, the worldly and the divine.In this way, the "science of the soul" was as much a part of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century natural philosophy as it was part of post-Reformation theology. Rivett's account restores the unity of religion and science in the early modern world and highlights the role and importance of both to transatlantic circuits of knowledge formation.<br>

These views evade many of the epistemological, theological, and political problems raised by ambiguity of gender, problems currently discussed in modern gender theory but already known to Renaissance audiences well versed in skepticism.

  Book Title: A Companion to Julian of Norwich-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): McAvoy Liz Herbert<br>
  Abstract: Julian of Norwich, the fourteenth/early fifteenth-century anchoress and mystic, is one of the most important and best-known figures of the Middle Ages. Her Revelations, intense visions of the divine, have been widely studied and read; the first known writings of an English woman, their influence extends over theology and literature. However, many aspects of both her life and thought remain enigmatic. This exciting new collection offers a comprehensive, accessible coverage of the key aspects of debate surrounding Julian. It places the author within a wide range of contemporary literary, social, historical and religious contexts, and also provides a wealth of new insights into manuscript traditions, perspectives on her writing and ways of interpreting it, building on the work of many of the most active and influential researchers within Julian studies, and including the fruits of the most recent, ground-breaking findings. It will therefore be a vital companion for all of Julian's readers in the twenty-first century.

  Book Title: God and the Gawain-Poet-Theology and Genre in Pearl, Cleanness, Patience and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Hatt Cecilia A.<br>
  Abstract: Pearl, Cleanness, Patience and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight are accomplished examples of four different literary genres and represent some of the finest poetry in Middle English. They are, by turns, fast and funny, powerfully dramatic, gentle and ironic, telling of painful bereavement and the terror of victims of disaster and violence, as well as the comic bewilderment of people entangled in alarmingly mysterious situations. The anonymous poet's evident delight in the pleasures and artistry of courtly life has led some readers to suggest that he was a gifted but complacent frequenter of courts, his attention dedicated to the wealthy and his sympathies to the powerful, and moreover, that his poems pay the merest lipservice to religious observance. God and the Gawain-poet argues that, on the contrary, the poet's wide-ranging engagement with all human life explicitly acknowledges all material creation as God's gift, revelling in its physicality, in bodily senses and movement and the ways a community celebrates itself. Dr Hatt shows how, in exhorting readers to recognize and respond to the narrative of divine gift, he appears as an energetic Christian poet and a humane and compassionate observer. Cecilia Hatt gained her D.Phil from Oxford University.<br>

Abstract: The popularity of the germinal theory does not mean it went unquestioned. Thomas Broughton, an English divine, pointed out that, because stamina are made up of matter, they are as liable to dissolution and corruption as any other matter.
            102As an alternative, he suggested that a body formed out of a corpse’s residue, “without the Admixture of any foreign Matter,” would be “thesame Body” and that, out of any quantity of matter, God may form a complete body “for the Reception of the returningSoul. ” Indeed, Broughton observed, “it is in the Power ofGod,out of a very small Remainder of the dead Body, to form, byDilatation, Expansion,orRarefaction,a Body of equalSizeandDimension,though not of equalDensity,with That, which was laid in the Grave.”103Like Burnet almost a century earlier, Broughton emphasized the ethereal nature of the resurrected body. But, even at that point of spiritization, some material vestige of the original was deemed necessary.<br>

Abstract: Examining culture in interaction helps us understand religious groups, too. For example, observers puzzle over the question of how Christianity and Islam (and other religions) can be used by terrorists and pacifists, fanatics and contemplative scholars, and casual observers alike. Previous explanations hinge on differences in interpretations of sacred texts—that is, different doctrinal standpoints, different beliefs about divine and earthly reality. Clearly, that is correct; certain branches of a religion highlight different chapters and verses of their sacred texts, and that explains many differences between members of the same religion. But we add another dimension to the question: an inspection of “culture in interaction” would ask if some of the differences between adherents of the same beliefs stem from different group styles.

Abstract: A Dissenting minister in London, Calamy was the son and grandson of ejected ministers. His grandfather, Dr. Edmund Calamy (1600–1666), had been a prominent Puritan divine, a leading figure in the Westminster Assembly, and one of the authors of
      Smectymnuus. A member of the Savoy conference of 1661 and briefly a chaplain in the court of Charles II, he refused a bishopric, was ejected from his living of St. Mary’s, Aldermanbury, in 1662, and was briefly imprisoned in 1663. His son Edmund (1635?–85) was ejected from his Essex living in 1662 and was subsequently a Dissenting preacher in London until his death. Born in 1671, Edmund Calamy, the third, experienced as a child the oppressive environment of the 1670s and 1680s. He was frequently sent to Newgate Prison with small presents of money for imprisoned Dissenting ministers. His own father escaped imprisonment, but he had several warrants out against him and, Calamy recalled, “was forced to disguise himself, and skulk in private holes and corners, and frequently change his lodgings.”9On two occasions the young Calamy was present at private meetings for worship that were violently disrupted by magistrates with constables and soldiers—“in both places they were fierce and noisy, and made great havoc.”10<br>

Abstract: According to Aristotle, only the divine can reach the point of thinking its own thinking and knowing itself absolutely. And man has neither a definition of nor access to this knowledge. The theology of revelation, through other paths, confirms this impossibility. And yet, it no longer understands this impossibility as something forbidden, but rather as a grace and a privilege: man remains incomprehensible, but in the image and likeness of the incomprehensible par excellence; he thus holds a derived and gracious excellence: that of knowing himself as incomprehensible.<br>

Abstract: In order to recognize another's worth bona fide, one has to make an assessment in light of some standard of evaluation, and, in the absence of a genuinely global culture with a horizon or perspective more comprehensive than and inclusive of the perspectives of the individual communities, one cannot help having recourse to one’s parochial point of view and treating it as somehow universally relevant and applicable. The inevitability of a particular perspective in recognition of worth is all the more the case for religious communities that make universalistic and ultimate truth claims, such as the Christian assertion of the centrality and universality of the salvation achieved by God in and through Jesus Christ. For Christian communities their recognition of other ways of life cannot avoid being given—or not given—in reference to the divine will and practice which they believe have been disclosed for all people in Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection.<br>

Abstract: Ibid., 83. For Tesauro, the metaphor of the saint as shield is of great relevance. If in
            SympathyMaurice and the shroud are the shields of the Catholic Savoy family, inEdipo(Oedipus, 1661), Tesauro’s interpretation of Seneca’s tragedy, Oedipus is the shield that prevents the divinity from exerting his power of purification. In Tesauro’s tragedy, Oedipus holds a long monologue on the “voracious plague” that afflicts the city of Thebes. A praetor replies to the Oedipus that the heavens are merciful because “they oppose your [Oedipus’s] virtue like a shield against their own furor.” See Emanuele Tesauro,Edipo, ed. Carlo Ossola (Venice: Marsilio, 1987), 1.1, verse 4, 79, and verses 47–48, 80. We could thus say that, for Tesauro, Maurice is a sort of anti‐Oedipus who has made himself into a lucid mirror of the shroud (the shield reflecting divine will). The saint’s body is a transparent surface reflecting and “actualizing” the “symbol” of the shroud. By contrast, Oedipus’s ignorance of his sins is a darkened, blind shield that prevents the divinity from shining through.<br>

Abstract: To this end I reintroduce the distinction made earlier in this article between the participant and observer perspectives. I recall that the exclusivist and inclusivist models are approaches from a Christian participant perspective. This means that those who identify with Christianity view their tradition from their insider perspective and then examine and evaluate other religions from that same perspective. Pluralism proceeds differently. It examines all religions, including the one that the person identifies with (e.g., Christianity), from an observer perspective. One adopts the position of an outsider, also toward Christianity, and describes how individuals and groups in the various religions are inspired by divine manifestation with a veridical force that stimulates them to follow the way of (active and/or passive) salvation, individually and/or collectively, spiritually and/or materially.
            39That is what distinguishes pluralism from the other two models: one distances oneself and takes a sort of helicopter view of the diverse ways followed by people in different religions in their search for truth, oneness, and wholeness. In this they appear to be inspired by myths and rituals, which function as cognitive, affective, and enacted models of reality, and to be motivated by these myths and rituals as models for reality to attain reconciliation and peace in their own microcosm and macrocosm.40<br>

Abstract: This human experience [embalming] has been passed on from remote antiquity. The unique Egyptian art erected the famous Egyptian pyramids. … These monuments were erected in order to aggrandize the pharaoh and his relatives, to emphasize his divine nature, and to perpetuate his power. … This amazing cult existed more than 5,000 years ago. In an unprecedented way, it was revived in the new twentieth century. The idea is not so much the significance or genius of a given person but the revival of a monument dedicated to a cult, which is supposed to impart immortality. In such a way, the pharaohs' ghosts emerge through the millennial dusk and enter the mausoleums of Lenin, Ho Chi Minh, Augustino Neto, and Mao. … Today we don't know who begot the idea to embalm Lenin's body, to erect a mausoleum, to make a sarcophagus for the tiny body, so that millions of people would believe in his immortality. Whoever these initiators, it is an indubitable fact that they were atheists, partaking in the construction of a symbol that would remind one of immortality, greatness, everlasting power.

Article Title: Childhood Studies, Hermeneutics, and Theological Ethics<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: jr.2006.86.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2006<br>
Author(s): Wall John<br>
Abstract: In order to develop a revised hermeneutical circle that can respond to the unique challenges of studying childhood, it is worth recalling that hermeneutics itself has a complex developmental history. Not coincidentally, Schleiermacher is the father of both the modern theology of childhood and modern hermeneutics. He it is, in the early nineteenth century, who moves hermeneutics beyond mere techniques for the exegesis of classic texts (especially scripture) into a general method of human social understanding. Schleiermacher adapts Kant’s critique of reason to argue for a new hermeneutics as the practice of “divining” behind human linguistic expressions the mysterious “genius” or “subjectivity” of the individual author.
         28Although the connection is not stated directly, childhood, for Schleiermacher, is a divine gift from God to the world that epitomizes this subjective hermeneutical mystery. Hermes as the messenger of the gods takes his purest and most complete form in each new baby that enters the world. Hermeneutics divines the kind of inner natural wisdom or intuition that each of us still in some way retains from childhood despite the inevitable corruptions and distortions of language and society. Likewise, childhood becomes a vital hermeneutical concern (no other major theologian has written as much on childhood as Schleiermacher) in part because it embodies the kind of sacred human inwardness that hermeneutics seeks to approach. It may not be going too far (though I cannot defend it here) to make the childist argument that Schleiermacher’s early writings on childhood deeply influence his later theology and hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: The Gen. 1:27 myth can be said in part to represent, from this angle, a narrative of the human narrative capability: a narrative of a capability that lies at the very origins or limits of human narration as such. This capability is here represented by humankind being affirmed as an image of a Creator who creates, precisely, by narrating. That is, the Creator is affirmed to have made the world by speech (“And God said, ‘Let there be light’; and there was light”; “Then God said, ‘Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness'”) and over a period of time (seven days). Genesis 1 is a story of the world as created by story. As the image of such a Creator, humankind is placed in touch with narration’s ultimate mystery: the impossibility, finally, of narrating our capacity for narration itself. Such can only be mythologized as an image of something invisible and divine: a peculiar form of narration that resists reduction to anything that could ever be understood from actual history. From this angle, human ethical narration is affirmed as an imitation of divine narration. It consists in a primordial capability for simultaneously ahistorical (or free) and historical intentionality over time.<br>

Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: Yet, since the Christian model of responsibility rests on a deepened interiority and is the gift of a self‐less other who remains inscrutable, this new model has a definite place for secrecy, for the
      mysterium, for the mystical, unlike the Greco‐Roman version, which is superseded so radically as to break entirely with its memory. Christian responsibility has its origin in a gift, in a “gift that is not a present,” and it is from the outset tied with secrecy for essential reasons. Indeed, as Derrida points out, “a gift that could be recognized as such in the light of day, a gift destined for recognition, would immediately annul itself. The gift is the secret itself.… Secrecy is the last word of the gift which is the last word of the secret” (GD,pp. 29–30). Originating in the elusive event of such a gift, even the transition from Platonism and neo‐Platonism to Christianity remains obscure; it cannot be simply accounted for in positive terms. But since the gift of responsibility is a gift from a self‐effacing Goodness (who holds the human being in its hands from within) to the individual in all his or her creatural singularity, it is “the gift of something that remains inaccessible, unpresentable, and as a consequence secret” (GD,p. 29). The donee is exclusively responsible to the donator, and hence, as Derrida’s discussion of the Abrahamic story of the sacrifice of Isaac in the second half ofThe Gift of Deathdemonstrates, he or she is relieved of the necessity of explaining his or her deeds to others. Indeed, being the unique addressee of the gift, the responsible individual must, at the limit, relate to others in an irresponsible fashion. How he responds to the divine Law remains secret—that is, unaccounted for—and ultimately secret to him‐ or herself as well, for such responsible decision making must, in principle, be unaccountable.<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: The building of Zion remains the “future project” of the LDS Church and is “intimately related to the ways in which it remembers itself.”
         93The promise of Zion still orders the experience of Smith’s faithful readers, providing them a beginning and an end between which they, as his readers—by means of their own heuristic powers of imagination—get their bearings to act. Their local ecclesiastical units are called “stakes,” symbolic of the stakes that anchor the tent of Zion, and are collectively referred to as “the stakes of Zion.” Thus, as with other myths that have founded a sense of peoplehood, Smith’s narrative history of human and divine interaction was ultimately oriented to a future time that served as a basis for acting in the present. It provided a world of meaning by which his believing readers understood themselves existentially, including their future and not merely their past. Most fundamentally, Smith’s writings give his believing readers a different sense of what was and what will be and, as a consequence, give significance to and a sense of what is real in the present. Just as the story of a realized messiah and the coming kingdom profoundly reoriented the Jews called “Christian,” Smith’s writings of the “fulness of times” provided a unique means by which the Latter‐day Saints’ alterity has been maintained, even as they integrated with contemporary society.<br>

Note that Hegel’s critique of the concept ofmāyāeasily accommodates an acknowledgment of the substantial identity between the world and the absolute. The presence of the divine being in all finite things still “does not secure them in their finite individuality, nor is the finite a real factor in or for the infinite. On the contrary, the abstract self‐identity of the finite existences, which identifies them with the abstract absolute, is incompatible with their concrete individual identity” (Halbfass,India and Europe, 90).<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: In both Augustine’s and Marcel’s experience, it turns out that the loss of a dear person may entail a loss of self, a sense of personal diminution—the subtraction of a crucial element in one’s purposeful self‐instantiation in the world. In the context of a different discussion, Ricoeur remarks aptly that the death of a loved one “constitutes a genuine amputation of oneself to the extent that the relation with the one who has disappeared forms an integral part of one’s identity.” We saw that Augustine copes with such a loss of identity by way of a detour into the desire of divine love and seeks his own better self through a self‐abnegating identification with this divine love. Marcel reacts instead to such a loss of identity by way of a detour into the materiality of his own mortality and seeks his own better self through a self‐denying identification with the love that the dear one’s death has left imprinted in his organism. In both cases, death’s “radical heterogeneity in relation to … desire” is exorcised by desire itself. The relevant difference between Augustine’s and Marcel’s respective forms of mourning is that the former reflects the metaphysical transcendence intrinsic to a more ancient notion of soul, while the latter’s reflects the soft transcendence of an embodied notion of soul that, however organismic in nature, bridges the gap separating merely genetic and epigenetic responses to mourning from the autonomy of one’s self‐instantiation.

Abstract: The reconstruction of theological ethics in the face of its critics requires, in terms of knowledge, replacing making with a multidimensional network of lateral connections. In terms of power, it replaces concern for unbridled forces with the relation between power and responsibility in world creation and orienting human life. What then about the most basic claim of value; that is, what ought to form the normative conviction of a theological and ethical vision? If we jettison here as well monocentric approaches, if we insist that we cannot define the good just around human flourishing or just around the divine, if we try to tread a path in and through but finally beyond anthropocentrism, theocentrism, or the current neohumanist focus on the finality of other human beings or even an ad hoc postmodernism, what do we have? This returns us, I think, to the elusive and tenacious ambiguity of human life that comes to expression in both religious and humanistic outlooks. It requires us to shift to a more existential level of reflection on responsibility and also the good we can and ought to serve.<br>

Abstract: Despite these oppositions, secularization and resacralization should be regarded as complementary phenomena that arose in response to the problem of a radically transcendent, hidden God. The studies under review, then, are of crucial importance, but their full significance requires a supplementary analysis. Novel conceptions of society, the nation, Scripture, and personhood followed from an intensification of divine transcendence, and, at the same time, necessitated a reworking of the immanent relations between worldly persons, institutions, and things. It was not merely that secularization, now understood by Bell and others as the translation of divine authority into a worldly register, entailed that the latter incorporate the properties and prerogatives once reserved for God alone. Enlightenment-era efforts to resacralize the self as an object of a totalizing force—situated either in the mystic divine or in a purely immanent, materialist conception of nature—suggest another dynamic at work: the closing of the chasm between the divine and terrestrial spheres and the identification of one with the other. Even if human effort was increasingly regarded as the source of one's understanding of the world, the humans undertaking this work had become newly alien to themselves, and in a manner that recalled the radical distance of the divine.<br>

Abstract: Attributed to the earliest days of Islam, the apparent tradition here is to recite verses of the Quran, and then to spit or blow onto whatever is to be blessed by those verses.12. The expectoration (from the soul, into a siphon; and the clothes, the knife, your personal belongings, your ID, your passport and all of your papers).
               74The practice of blowing inspiration from the Quranic verses into clothing, knife, passport, and papers would seem to saturate the possessions of the ritual actor with sanctity, as if to shower the actor himself with a sacred vapor and drive divine grace into his person. In old school anthropology, this might have been called “contagious magic,”75but within the schemes of Tambiah, Fernandez, and Ricoeur, it is probably better understood as a thickening of the metaphorical domain the ritual actor enters by contact with the verses. The thickening of the metaphorical domain helps to transform him into a pious persona on a holy mission. Spitting Quranic verses onto tokens might also be seen as another form of supplicating/praying.<br>

Abstract: More, of course, remains to be said about the character of the prophetic and promissory in this scene, the tableau of a table host giving to those who desert him in the moments before his betrayal and eventual execution. Much remains to be developed in conversation with Tillich’s work to continue the work of political reasoning in and with the prophetic, searching for other ways and rationale to take the form or locus of divine promise and the character of the interaction between God’s gift as participation in the divine being, the breath of the Spirit that gives life and the promise that renews all things—all important subjects to which Tillich and others contribute. Nevertheless, the concept of possibility and promised being that we have found can develop and expand a concept of the political that does not include what it excludes, indeed, does not embrace only the abandoned. By finding the sign of the promise, we have discovered that being otherwise than sovereign does not move beyond ordinary sovereignty. It does not seek to dispel the realm of political autonomy with an ecclesial life beyond the realm of nonecclesial humanity. Yet, it recognizes the embrace of the marginal and barbarian that ordinary sovereignty includes by excluding. Finally, owing to the indeterminate character of a promissory note, the pledge, it does not trump, overwhelm, or absorb the world. It rather opens and transforms it from within with its unlooked‐for gift of possibility.<br>

Issue: 656725<br>

Author(s): Pranger Burcht<br>
Abstract: Here, we come a bit closer to the seductive nature of Augustinian rhetoric. Deprived of clock time, the “since the day I learnt of you” turns into the magic of memory and oblivion. A-causally and counterintuitively it is a world turned upside down. Memory and time (
      ex quo) function asle marteau sans maître, the “hammer of existence,”esse solum, that is ordered as well as given and is incapable of not being confessed and lived, the song that cannot be silenced and cannot disappear from memory and expectation. Oblivion is the silent performance of precisely that: the loss of sound, as a means of survival—in sinful forgetfulness—vis-à-vis that “beauty so old and so new” contained in the ultimate expression of time as present: the temporality of thesero te amavi. But what exactly is being expressed in thesero te amavi? Moreover, if this simultaneity of memory and oblivion is expressed, that is still not the same as the divine voice sounding on its own account. Here, we touch upon the ultimate enigma ofConfessions: the hammer of existence, “Da quod iube, iube quod vis”/“Grant what you command and command what you will.”
            Who is able to withstand the lure—and violence—of that song that, as far as sonority is concerned, cannot be distinguished from the “beauty so old and so new”? One is reminded of Kafka here—the hammer of existence—and his story of the Sirens' song:22
         
            It would be little respectful to Kafka and Augustine to make one-to-one comparisons between this passage and the AugustinianProof that inadequate, even childish measures may come to the rescue.
            To protect himself from the Sirens, Ulysses put wax in his ears and had himself chained to the mast of his ship. Of course, all travelers before him could have done the same, except those whom the Sirens had already allured from afar, but it was known to all the world that such things were of no help whatever. The song of the Sirens could penetrate everything, and th~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: But even if Faustus performs the affects of repentance, he cannot repent and be saved in the strict theological sense because until the very end he exhibits the inward disposition of the faithless magician who must choose to be duped by Satan. But why does he have such an inward disposition in the first place? Is it indeed that God has predestined Faustus to hell, subjected him to the most miserable necessity? For Paul Ricoeur, the question of “the scandalous theology of predestination to evil” is the tragic question par excellence, which is why the tragic is always, in Ricoeur's formulation, “a temptation to despair” in its display of the “hostile transcendence to which the hero is prey.”
      36But Marlowe's play, as much as it also invites the audience to despair, stages something more subtle and finally more wrenching than blank divine vengeance, for in fact it employs the more charitable theology represented by Holland rather than that of Perkins: Faustus may indeed repent, and God may indeed change his mind. The possibility of repentance provides the suspense that makes the play dramatic rather than merely iconographical, and that gives force and fear to those apparently trivial spectacles that repeatedly persuade Faustus not to perform his inward penance. Yet at the same time, there does seem to be something fated in the way that Faustus is introduced to the audience with a habit of mind that makes it impossible for him to take his given opportunities to repent.Doctor Faustusthus brings the audience right up against the nondialectical, and therefore tragic, contradiction of the theology of grace: the fact an omnipotent and supposedly loving God permits creaturely suffering, or, in terms more specific to the play, that God rejects a man who cries out to him simply because that man thinks like a dramatist rather than an allegorist.37Milton, on his part, tries to solve this problem at the heart of Christianity with a theodicy of human insufficiency—the archange~<br>

Abstract: The Captivity of Innocencesuccessfully concludes an innovative study of primeval myth in J’s Genesis. Its argument about exilic authorship serves as a springboard for a free and erudite exploration of biblical concerns with name, exile, and the paradoxes of divine-human relations. Very few biblical scholars today can compass this range of biblical, literary, and philosophical literature with such finesse. At a time when biblical studies incorporate a wider range of methods than ever, LaCocque, like Roland Barthes (whom he cites), powerfully combines traditional and more contemporary intellectual paradigms. Advanced students and scholars will find inThe Captivity of Innocencea far-reaching and engaging reading of Genesis 11 by a virtuoso of biblical studies.<br>

Author(s): Regan Ethna<br>
Abstract: Not content to engage the discourses of theology and human rights by way of definition and description, Regan constructively engages both discourses, building on the work of Karl Rahner, Johann Baptist Metz, and Paul Ricoeur. The heart of the text is this constructive mode. Regan develops a theological anthropology that sees human flourishing, the aim of human being, in a “generosity of existence” (15), which is grounded in and flows from a capacity for God (76). Generosity of existence is the idea that life consists in both giving and receiving toward greater flourishing of oneself, others, and a community of being (112). The notion of generosity of existence includes a capacity for self-determination and is therefore protected by a human rights discourse that seeks to defend a zone of individual human autonomy. But this theological anthropology is not exhausted by individual autonomy. Rather, it links an individual capacity for self-determination to a responsibility for “making oneself” in response both to God and to the embeddedness of human life (82). In this sense, human rights ought to be taken seriously by any theologian who believes human beings ought to orient their lives to God, because violations of human rights severely impair this capacity and impede the possibility of responding to a divine call. She attributes the revelation of a mystical dimension to human rights activism to the insights of liberation theology, which highlights a divine element embedded in the struggle for human rights. But Regan also sees liberation theology as contributing several insights to secular liberal human rights discourse, including an awareness and acknowledgment of the systematic and structural constraints that limit the capacities of the poor of the world to flourish, and highlighting the importance of basic sociocultural rights.<br>

Abstract: Some of the earliest forms of the generic notion of evil demarcate
            abominations—acts that, like incest, cannibalism, patricide—elicit horror and disgust. Abominations are violations, disorders of nature that issue in natural sanctions: plagues or expulsions. The world in whichevilis construed as a form ofsinful disobedienceis a world defined by a divinity who gives commands, exacts obedience, punishes, or rewards (Genesis and Exodus). A world focused on virtue andviceis a naturalistic, social world (Theophrastus, Butler, Mandeville). Virtues are those traits that—like courage and justice—preserve and enhance a community. The vices—greed, disloyalty, envy, self-indulgence, disrespect—threaten the social order. The origins and sanctions for vices are social: an unfortunate upbringing in a malformed polity can issue in the kind of corruption whose sanction is the loss of trust and cooperation. Withmalevolence(Pope Innocent III, Calvin), we enter a new world, a world of individual will and responsibility. While malevolence is normally marked by a defective will,sinfuses disobedience with a defiant will (Aquinas, Jonathan Edwards). But while the earliest forms of disobedience can be relatively innocent, sin presupposes that Everyman, in the full knowledge of the difference between good and evil, right and wrong, willfully violates the divine order by presumptuous pride (Milton’s Satan, Goethe’s Faust). When the disposition or proclivity to sin—construed as pride or egoism—becomes an inherently dominant and psychologically structuring motive, only divine grace can set aside divine punishment. Evil becomes less fraught when morality returns to the secular, social order during the Renaissance and Enlightenment. Setting aside the theology and metaphysics of sin, the new psychology turned to characterizing character traits that—like wanton cruelty—generate “man’s inhumanity to man” (Montaigne, Voltaire).Partiality, egoism—the desire for glory or selfinterest—remai~<br>

Author(s): Fisher Cass<br>
Abstract: Despite these caveats,
   Contemplative Nationis highly recommended for scholars of Jewish studies, religious studies, philosophy, and theology. The book is an excellent example of how to apply hermeneutical theories to the study of Judaism, how to bridge the gap between continental philosophy and analytic philosophy, and how to expand the scope of Jewish studies by appreciating the nature of theological discourse. While Judaica scholars could use the book in university-level courses, and rabbis could apply its approach to synagogue life, the claim that “Israel” is a “contemplative nation” will hardly resonate with most Jews today. It is very doubtful that the book could “guide the way for [the] future” of the Jewish people’s survival (226), precisely because Jews today are overwhelmingly secular, and the culture in which Jews live, both in Israel and in the Diaspora, is anti-intellectual and antitheological. Furthermore, if Fisher is so keen on Philo, he should have also reminded his readers of the fate of Philo’s enterprise: it was no coincidence that Philo became one of the Church Fathers and that his exegetical/hermeneutical project was not adopted by the tradition that became normative Judaism. When “Israel” denotes a nation of divine contemplators, “carnal Israel” (namely “Israel” as a historical, cultural, and ethnic entity) is marginalized, denigrated, and persecuted. It is true that Jewish religious life is theological, but being Jewish cannot be reduced to contemplating God.<br>

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Badiou’s attempt to “extract a formal, wholly secularized conception of grace”
         
               from the Pauline texts and to exploit their political potential while disregarding Paul’s theological commitments stems, basically, from his rejection of transcendence as such. Bonhoeffer’s nonreligious interpretation aimed to redefine God’s transcendence understood in a sense of other-worldliness so that it could be found in immanence (“God is beyond even in the middle of our lives”187
            
               ), that is to say, in the “neighbor who is within reach in any given situation.”188
            
               The God of Bonhoeffer is, in a sense, an absent God, a God who in the midst of the world remains invisible and silent until Christians make God present and visible by their participation in Jesus’s being for others. While Bonhoeffer radically reinterprets the traditional Christian notion of transcendence, Badiou simply does away with it. In this regard, he represents “a shared new determination to grapple with the legacy of the death of God in a deeper way than ever before, re-making philosophy from the ground up as a thinking ‘without God.’”189
            
               When Badiou speaks of the “death of God,” what he means by “God” is not only the metaphysical God with whose death Nietzsche and Heidegger were concerned (the end of onto-theology) and whose death enables the return of a “more divine” God. In light of his ontology, all three meanings of the word “God” that he distinguishes, that is, the living God of religion, the conceptual God of metaphysics, and the God of the poets, become superfluous.190
            
               As a consequence, even a theological understanding of religion—as, for instance, “a personal communion between God and human beings”191
            
               —that could be accepted by Bonhoeffer cannot stand in the face of Badiou’s radical dismissal of transcendence. However, when we look at the reality~<br>

Author(s): Huth Kimberly<br>
Abstract: Bosola’s figure is only one of the play’s many attempts to make sense out of seemingly senseless cruelty. The same world of suffering that leads to his image of the stars’ tennis match inspires a very different response from Antonio. In conversation with the Duchess, Antonio delivers one of the most notable of the play’s many “wise” statements: “Man (like to
      Cassia) is prov’d best, being bruiz’d” (3.5.71). In a precursor to Bradley’s meditations on the fragrance of a crushed flower, Antonio also responds to tragic events with an argument that our best selves are revealed through suffering, making pain a valuable experience and tragedy a process of identity formation. Antonio’s perspective, like Bradley’s, grows out of confrontation with a tragic world that appears destined to crush its inhabitants and through associations that find value in that process. But just as the play casts doubt on the ability of the senses to perceive reality, it also questions the capacity of metaphor to make sense of suffering. Webster’s strongest character, the Duchess, rejects Antonio’s philosophy—although even she cannot escape the metaphorical thinking ingrained in the world of the play. In response to Antonio, she produces two images of her own:
            Though she initially rejects Antonio’s philosophy outright, the Duchess reveals her own uncertainty about the nature and meaning of her suffering by introducing a second figurative interpretation. Her images inject the play with what could be seen as an optimistic view of divine involvement in human life, and she asserts her own ability to make “sense” of her pain through concepts developed out of her personal experience, not generalized

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: Peperzak in this book also offers continental thinkers an appealing alternative to the theological turn of phenomenology as practiced by Jean-Luc Marion and others. While Peperzak takes seriously the idea that “God cannot be investigated or explained … because God is not given as a describable phenomenon,” this realization does not turn his phenomenology away from the investigation of rational thinking because for Peperzak reason itself has to be rethought in terms of the intersubjective encounters between nonthematizable—human and divine—sayers (121). Consequently, much more than some of the thinkers of the theological turn, Peperzak’s work maintains a broadly humanist sensibility and a conviction that theological thinking and philosophy can be integrated quite well, provided the latter does not close itself off in autarky. In his humanism, Peperzak echoes the best elements in the philosophical style both of his teacher Paul Ricoeur and the philosophical tradition of his own Catholic faith, although he implicitly critiques the former for insisting too vehemently on the autonomy of philosophy (128) and calls out the latter for separating “natural reason” from faith (182–86). For his own part, Peperzak hopes to maintain an open space between faith and reason: “I do not see any valid argument against the integration of philosophical insights into a faith-inspired theology … neither would I protest if an integrated reflection of the Christian community about its faith would call itself
   philosophia” (160). For the many who share similar sentiments today,Thinking about Thinkingwill make a valuable guide to the conversation of philosophy.<br>

Abstract: This debate eventually focused on the nature of revelation (letters 35–39), with Strauss having written that “there is an essential distinction between the thinking of the Middle ages, based on revelation, and the thinking of classical antiquity, not based on revelation” (78). Voegelin responded that both revelation and reason are part of a universal human knowledge that is understood concretely and experientially. This prompted Strauss to write back that claims of a universal human knowledge must reside in the realm of philosophy and not in Christianity. To understand Plato properly, one should not impose “biblical concepts,” since they are separate from Greek philosophy. Although Strauss and Voegelin did not resolve this debate, it does clarify and present challenges to both thinkers' philosophies: for Voegelin, the claim that the experience of the divine is the foundation of a universal, human knowledge requires some sort of demonstration in order for him to escape what Strauss referred to as “the desert of Kierkegaard's subjectivism” (88); for Strauss, the tension between reason and revelation suggests a permanent condition of human incompleteness that is unable to point to a right way of life, leading one into nihilism.<br>

Abstract: In volume six of
         Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d’ornithologie, Olivier Messiaen uses the phrase “the pebble in the water” to identify a class of especially stark rhythmic contrasts in Debussy’s music that feature long durations interrupted by rapid rhythms. He invests these contrasts with an expressive logic built around the concept of shock—that is, the sudden stimulation of a static context by an outside presence. Messiaen unites various images—both natural and psychological—around this expressive pattern via analogy, suggesting that its essence is transferrable within a network of associated metaphors. Although for the most part in volume six Messiaen refrains from linking interpretations of Debussy with his own music, many of his rhythmic contrasts manifest the same expressive logic that he ascribes to Debussy’s music, particularly durational events that signify the interjection of birdsong within serene environments and that signal the striking appearance of divine power on earth. In addition to stylistic and semiotic correlations, the logic of shock theorized for the pebble in the water recurs more abstractly in Messiaen’s idiomatic views on musical experience and spiritual encounter. His interpretation of rhythmic contrast bears the marks of his more general aesthetics of shock, which in turn can be read as a reorientation of a broader modernist hermeneutic.<br>

Abstract: At a time when immanent abandonment of plural marriage was sorely testing the faithful's confidence, rituals commemorating Joseph Smith's birth established three aspects of his legacy as the core of L.D.S self-conception: restored church order, divine authority, and continuing revelation. These three claims, inscribed on the Vermont monument, were given particular force by the church's new Progressive-Era uses of the autobiographical narrative of Joseph Smith's early life. Specifically, during this period the narrative of Smith's original theophany achieved the primacy once accorded plural marriage, allowing the Latter-day Saints to forget as a practical matter, the once-definitive marriage practice. This essay uses theories of narrative and myths of origin to show how uses of Smith's theophany allowed the Latter-day Saints to jettison plural marriage without destroying their identity, much less their confidence in Joseph Smith as church founder.<br>

Author(s): Woollcott W. Paul<br>
Abstract: Psychodynamically, Augustine's conversion responds to and reconstitutes tensions and relational ambivalences generated by his experiences with the "betraying embrace," principally as he has encountered its symbolic representation in his mother Monica's retentive and rejective tears, in one of her controlling dreams, and in his association with and loss of an unnamed friend. Those experiences crucially affect his own betrayals of secular covenants in his passage to conversion -- covenants with language and rhetoric, with order, and with "lower instincts," among others -- and are themselves transformatively replicated in divine and divinely sanctioned alliances scrupulously structured by his emotional requirements to prevent betrayal: in particular, Augustine's "Romantic" relationship with deific embrace perpetuates in an altered mode the discontent that brought him to seek it.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263722<br>
Date: 12 1, 1960<br>
Author(s): Edwards William J.<br>
Abstract: Part 1 shows that while Edwards and Berkeley both regard nature as God's discourse and speak of this discourse in similar ways, Edwards differs from Berkeley in believing that the signs of this discourse signify spiritual and divine realities. Part 2 explains why Edwards thought it reasonable to believe that our world is a world of types and images. Because our world is a world of resemblances and imitations, because spiritual things are its "alpha and omega," and because its beauty is a reflection of God's beauty, our world can be expected to contain images or shadows of divine things. Scripture provides evidence that this expectation is realized. Part 3 shows that these images are not symbols but emblems, and that because emblems are consciously invented, their occurrence implies theism. Part 4 attempts to show that, given the assumptions of classical Christian theism, it is in principle no more difficult to decipher the meaning of the book of nature than to decipher the meaning of an allegorical poem or tale. Part 5 criticizes Perry Miller. Edwards's reflections on types were not influenced by the new science. He did not anticipate Coleridge on the imagination, nor did he "elevate nature to a level of authority coequal with revelation."<br>

Article Title: The First Evil Will Must Be Incomprehensible: A Critique of Augustine<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263713<br>
Date: 9 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Teselle Robert F.<br>
Abstract: The thesis of this paper is that an absolute origin of evil, arising from the free will of a creature, must be incomprehensible. Although Augustine occasionally acknowledges this point, nevertheless in a number of better-known passages (chiefly in The City of God) he attempts to give a causal account of the fall of Adam and/or Satan. Much of the subsequent Christian tradition has unfortunately followed his lead, and major recent commentators routinely ignore or passively approve of his conceptual error. Augustine offers three unacceptable explanations of the fall, which conflict variously with his own doctrines of divine omnipotence, the goodness of creation, and creaturely free will and responsibility, as well as violating the canons of sound argumentation and explanation. First, his contention that free creatures made "out of nothing" inevitably fall makes the fall seem ontologically necessary (unfree) and thereby lays the ultimate responsibility for it on the Creator. Second, the appeal to pride as an explanation is a spurious causal account, for "pride" is only a synonym for "fallenness" itself and not a possible antecedent condition in a being created good and not yet fallen. Finally, his assertion that the first sin is intrinsically comprehensible, but not comprehensible to us because we are fallen, is an obfuscation masquerading as an explanation, for we have no warrant for supposing that this assertion is true or even meaningful. Instead of seeking causal explanation Augustine should have stayed with his own wiser observation that an evil will has no efficient cause. Theology of the Augustinian sort (which comprises much of the Christian tradition) ought to concede that the fall as a work of genuine freedom is an absurd "fact," an incomprehensible given which steadfastly and in principle resists causal explanation. The concluding section of the paper draws upon Ricoeur's insights to tell why the narrative structure of the "Adamic myth" (which has important p~<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i263808<br>
Date: 6 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Williamson Tod<br>
Abstract: Using George Bataille's reflections on desire, death, and God as the basis for considering the love poetry of the Song of Songs as a manifestation of the commingling of separate realms and separate bodies in the service of a longed-for continuity helps us to see that such a commingling is never far from the domain of violence and that such continuity of being is never far from death. But the biblical book itself helps us to see something that is missing from Bataille's analysis-that is, a more complex understanding of the implications of desire for the divine. What if, contra Bataille, God were not "by definition" immune to risk? What if the divine were not understood to be perfection but, rather, bound as well to the vicissitudes of desire, with all the anguish and ecstasy that it implies? The Song of Song's lyrical presentation of Eros, carried over as it is into the tradition of allegorical interpretation, may, in fact, have rather profound implications for how we talk about God.<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i20849827<br>

Author(s): Cormier Philippe<br>
Abstract: Le dépassement phénoménologique du substantialisme métaphysique devrait permettre aujourd'hui d'envisager une refondation de la notion de personne, laquelle s'était quelque peu immobilisée depuis Boèce. Sur ce nouvel horizon, le retour à la fondation première, celle d'Augustin, s'impose. Celui-ci est le premier en effet, pour l'essentiel dans son traité de la Trinité, à avoir clairement pensé la personne (divine) comme relation et non comme substance. La réduction augustinienne de la personne (humaine) à l'ego ou à « l'homme intérieur » ouvre la possibilité d' « analogies subjectives » avec la Trinité: pensée, amour, connaissance; mémoire, intelligence, volonté. Cependant, la spéculation augustinienne trouve sa limite en échouant à penser une personne de chair — et, qui plus est, une telle personne comme « en relation ». Ce qui était relation en Dieu reste, en l'homme, substance pensante, seule face à son Dieu. Phenomenology has overcome the old substance of metaphysics and then should permit us today to refound the idea of the person which was in a way, since Boethius, brought to a standstill. Therefore we must to go back to St. Augustine who was actually the first, in his De Trinitate, to conceive, the (divine) person as a relation and not as a substance. The (human) person so confined to the ego or to the « inner man » allows some possible « subjective analogies » with the Trinity: thought, love, knowledge, memory, intelligence and will. However the Augustinian theory fails to conceive first the person in her own flesh and blood — a bodily person — and secondly such a person as being « in relation »: man is a thinking substance, alone facing her God.<br>

Author(s): Lawrence Frederick G.<br>
Abstract: Dès ses premiers écrits, Lonergan a été attentif à la dimension d'amitié qui caractérise les ordres trinitaire et créé. L'homme est par essence ouvert au delà de lui-même; ne pouvant pas coïncider à soi, il est appelé à quelque conversion. La pensée moderne, qui par contre l'a prétendu capable de présence à soi; soutint l'individualisme où le rapport à l'autre devenait instrumental. La réaction postmoderne, qui accentue l'idée d''autre', réveille la conscience à ses traits plus humains, en favorisant en même temps un retour à la tradition philosophique et théologique sur l'amitié, où d'ailleurs son idée d''autre' se voit elle-même enrichie. La réflexion thomiste sur la charité comme amitié divine est ici décisive. Lonergan la reprend en explicitant l'essence du corps mystique. L'attention à l'expérience concrète invite enfin à conduire la réflexion jusqu'au plan de l'éducation, d'où on ne peut pas abstraire l'exigence du don de soi, à l'exemple du Christ qu'y s'est abaissé jusqu'à nous. From his earliest writings Lonergan was attentive to the friendship dimension that marks the trinitarian and created orders. Humanity remains essentially open to what is beyond itself: unable to coincide with itself, it is called to some conversion. Modern thought by contrast has focussed on self-presence, thus giving rise to individualism where relationship to others becomes instrumental. The reaction of the post-modern is to underline the idea of the 'other', awaking conscience to more human traits, thus promoting a retrieval of a philosophical and theological tradition on friendship. In this way the idea of the 'other' finds itself enriched and Thomist reflection on charity as divine friendship becomes crucial. Lonergan adapts this tradition to explain the essence of the mystical body. Attention to concrete experience pushes us to extend our reflection to the level of education, where one cannot ignore the requirement for self-giving, on the example of Christ who lowered himself t~<br>

Abstract: Au Japon où se côtoient et s'imbriquent deux religions, le bouddhisme dont on connaît la richesse iconographique et le shintô, aniconique, l'identification très systématique des dieux et des bouddhas atteste de la porosité des catégories d'existants visibles ou invisibles. Si, pour certains, les bouddhas sont les formes originelles des dieux locaux, pour d'autres, ils n'en sont que les émanations. Cette incertitude théologique rend sujette à débats la présence des entités vénérées aussi bien que la nature de leur figuration, à la fois corps, représentation et substitut. Les spectacles populaires de marionnettes, des objets animés bons à brouiller les catégories du vivant et de l'inerte, laissent accroire qu'une forme de ruse rituelle, le simulacre, permet d'animer une statue inauthentique ou de transformer un corps d'homme vulgaire en un dieu vivant. La croyance en l'existence d'êtres surhumains se forge dans le rituel où substitué et substituant sont soigneusement confondus grâce à des mises en scène humaines ou divines qui dévoilent un monde où les possibilités de transformations seraient autres qu'ici-bas. In Japan, where two religions coexist and overlap, Buddhism known for its iconographic wealth and Shinto, aniconic, the very systematic identification of gods and Buddhas attests to the porosity of the categories of visible or invisible existing entities. If for some Buddhas are the original forms of local gods, for others they are just manifestations. This theological uncertainty allows us to debate the presence of worshiped entities as well as the nature of their representation, both body, representation and substitute. Popular puppet shows, animated objects blurring the categories of living and inert entities, let people believe that some form of ritual ruse, the simulacrum, can animate an inauthentic statue or transform a common man's body into a living god. Belief in the existence of supernatural beings is forged in the ritual in which the substituted and ~<br>

Abstract: O filme Diamante de Sangue [Blood Diamond] de Edward Zwick oferece a possibilidade de uma reflexão à volta de três aspetos da noção de testemunho no âmbito da Filosofia da Religião: 1) a ideia de que o testemunho (absoluto), enquanto matriz das culturas humanas, sustenta a atividade jornalística e a sociedade da informação possibilitando não apenas a sua desconstrução como também a (re-)atualização de uma dimensão testemunhal do jornalismo; 2) as condições de possibilidade da conversão da consciência, isto é, da rutura com o estado de má-fé (auto-engano) necessária à consciência testemunhal e religiosa; 3) a indissociabilidade da experiência testemunhal e da doação, correlativas da experiência religiosa entendida como "fundação mútua" do divino e da testemunha (constituinte), experiência religiosa da qual surge o testemunho. Acrescentaremos ainda a ideia de que a experiência testemunhal ganha sentido à luz da metafísica do tempo do projeto. The film Blood Diamond from Edward Zwick offers the possibility of a reflection concerning three aspects of the concept of testimony within the Philosophy of Religion: 1) the idea that the testimony (absolute), while source of human cultures, supports the journalistic activity and gives information to the society; not only in its deconstruction but also in (re-)updating the testimonial dimension of journalism, 2) the conditions of possibility of the consciousness conversion, meaning, the rupture with the state of bad faith (self-deception) will required to the testimonial and religious consciousness, 3) the inseparability of the testimonial experience and donation, correlates in the religious experience, understood as “mutual foundation” of the divine and the witness (constituent), religious experience from which comes the testimony. We add further the idea that the testimonial experience makes sense in light of the metaphysics of time of project.<br>

Abstract: Michael Frayn's play, Copenhagen, dramatises as a ghost story the conversation concerning the moral implications of atomic fission among Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, and his wife, Margrethe Bohr, in September 1941. This paper argues that the play generalises from the famous uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics to present the necessary appearance of uncertainty at the historical, moral, and theological levels of reflection. The paper traces the meaning of uncertainty back to the 'being of the self' as a cipher for divine transcendence, and it interprets the meaning of uncertainty for the theory and method of theological humanism.<br>

Abstract: Miroslav Volf has provocatively argued that redemption necessitates forgetting (1996, 2006). Yet, Volf's claims insufficiently consider the narratival configuration of memory. This essay utilises Paul Ricoeur's work on mimesis in order to challenge Volf's case for forgetting. The author advances Ricoeur's philosophical description of forgiveness toward a theological account of divine forgiveness as re-narration, gift-giving funded by trinitarian abundance.<br>

Abstract: prima délia monacazione il cammino verso l'orazione mentale si rivela dolorosamente
impervio: " Io gli chiedei [al confessore] una breve intrazione [introduzione] per imparare a far
bene l'orazione mentale, elli me la scrisse; ma, per esser molto alta, per quanto ora conosca, non
la potei mai capire. La leggevo e straleggevo, ma non la potevo intendere... e mi sentivo che nel
cuore non è ancor il tempo, si' che pensai mi fusse riservata a darmela quando fossi nella
religione" (cc. 86 v. 87 r.). Una volta cappuccina, Domitilla scopre gradualmente l'efficacia degli
"esercizii" (c. 156 r.) assegnatile dal confessore: "Gli esercizii che vostra reverenza mi ha dato in
tanto tempo e che n'era molto abbondante atteso che sempre mi confessavo, che pur era due volte
la settimana, conforme al solito délia religione, me li mutava e me li addossava cosi bene e per
l'aggiutto [aiuto] di qualche virtu, o per resistere alle tentazioni, o per vincere qualche passione, o
per corrisponder a qualche grazia che pareva gli nascesse dal cuore conforme al mio bisogno; e
ho sempre conosciuto che non solo m'erano utili, ma necessari per camminare alla santa
perfezione...." "... e sebbene alcune volte al senso parevano amari e contrarii, li trovai sempre
in effetto propriissimi, onde come vostra reverenza sa, non ne récusai mai alcuno, ma gli
abbracciai con tutta la volontà e li faceva con tanta dolcezza, che il Signore mi comunicava tanta
fecondità, che in farle [sic] le consumavo le ore; e conosco che me li mutava conforme all'ascesa
dell'anima, tirandola sempre a qualche altezza di piü, per lasciarla spronata all'acquisto di quello
che conosceva li mancava. Un'altra utilità conosco, che riceve l'anima mia dalli suoi esercizii: ed
è quando il Signore cominciö ad illuminare la mia mente con li suoi celesti raggi. Vostra reverenza
mi diede anco esercizii atti a questo; e, sospendendo il Signore la mia mente fuori dalle immagini,

Abstract: Rav H̱isday Crescas (1340-1410/11), Rabbi of Aragonese Jewry in Christian Spain and a major figure in medieval Jewish philosophy, is unique in positing an all-embracing thesis of Love. This thesis permeates his theories of cosmogony, metaphysics and theology and generates far-reaching didactic implications. This article examines Crescas' rather bold description of Love as a positive Divine attribute, an anthropopathism meant to convey ontological meaning about the Divine Nature via an analogous construct. Themes such as Infinite Goodness, Joy and Kindness enable Rav H̱isday to structure a new conception of the Creator and Providence. After postulating Divine Love as the Cosmic Force sustaining creation, Crescas explains the purpose of Torah and mitzvot in terms of evoking love for God thus drawing the soul to link up to the Divine Overflow of Love. Even spiritual existence after death is explicated in terms of the soul's love for its Divine Source. To understand Crescas' unique theory of Love, we compare it with the views of his predecessors and analyze his use of philosophic sources such as the 5th century BCE pre-Socratic scientist-mystic Empedocles. We examine educational aspects of Crescas' teachings on love and view them in context of the mass conversions to Christianity resulting from the 1391 riots. Finally, Crescas' ideas are read as pedagogical messages relevant to both Jews and conversos in the twenty traumatic years after 1391 when he served as chief rabbi and political leader in Saragossa.<br>

Abstract: The problem that Petrarch's Canzoniere poses for the modern reader is the same as that posed by all collections of poems assembled by their author: it is a matter of understanding the connection between each of the poems and the collection, the relation between the whole and the parts. On the one hand, the collection presents a discontinuous series of poems composed separately that can be read as discrete works; on the other hand, the same poems come together as part of a love and/or existential story. Our task is to study the Canzoniere as a macrotext and to clarify the relation of each of the compositions to the collection of lyric verse to which it belongs. Petrarch's desperate attempt to complete his work is the same hopeless challenge that the mythical Arachne dared to make to Minerva. At the deepest level Petrarch reveals an awareness of the fact that every human endeavor is a spider's web that is woven in the course of a lifetime, and thus is never completed. The destiny of human beings therefore is to weave a tapestry that is never finished, just as the fate of the poet is to write an in-finite work; namely, a work that in the end can never reach the perfection and integrity of the divine work.<br>

Abstract: In this article, Levinas' ethical metaphysics is analyzed and his contribution to present-day philosophy is described. In his philosophy, ethics is not something that originates in the autonomous will, as Kant would have premised. It is, rather, the result of the traumatic rupturing of the I by the Other, a heteronomous event. The I's passivity in being opened by the Other is highlighted by Levinas in the words "substitution," "obsession," and "being elected." The I, in the critical Others' eyes, is guilty. The infinity in the Other's demand, regarding the I, is divine. It would be a fatal misunderstanding of Levinas to think that, with the insertion of the word "God," he becomes a theologian. In this article the relation between ethics and politics is discussed and their relation to God is pointed to. In this way, Levinas' discourse on God is demonstrated as being fitting for our time, after the crisis of humanism during the Holocaust. In the course of the article, the question of whether there "is" a God in the eyes of Levinas, and if man "needs" Him is answered. In other words, the logical status of the word "God" in Levinas' philosophy is defined.<br>

Abstract: The article deals with the problem of revelation in Levinas' writings. The first part of the article analizes Levinas' ideas on the Same and the Other, more particularly the topics of the face and of discourse, as these come to the fore in the first section of Totality and Infinity. Investigating the non-totalising relationship between the Same and the Other presents us with the suitable framework for understanding the relation between the finite and the Infinite. Leaving out any ontotheological speech, Levinas shows how Metaphysics is enacted in the ethical relation. The second part cootinues with a description of Levinas' position on revelation in the Jewish tradition. The active Interpretation of Biblical texts "beyond the verse" represents an opportunity of hearing the divine word today and to enter into a more primordial Order than the Order of the Same. In the course of the article, we point to affinities and striking similarities between E. Levinas' and F. Rosenzweig's view on revelation. We also demonstrate how Levinas Orients his Jewish writings to his philosophy of the Other and vice versa. In writing on revelation, Levinas' main concern seems to be the description of the possibility of a fracture in the immanent order of totality and in the self-sufficiency of reason which is its correlative. This fraction is produced by the command "thou shalt not kill", calling the Same to open itself to the Other.<br>

Abstract: On a désigné par « École du droit naturel » tout ce courant de penseurs attachés à
défendre, comme 1'Antigone de Sophocle, la « loi non-écrite » présente au plus profond de nos
cœurs (par opposition aux lois écrites de la Cité). Ainsi Cicéron, dans l'esprit de l'universalisme
religieux stoïcien, écrit dans le De legibus (I, 5-6) que la nature du droit doit être recherchée
dans la nature même de l'homme comme la « règle suprême immanente » à celle-ci (De répub.
III, 22. Le Pro Milone évoque une « loi non-écrite, mais innée » : non scripta sed nata lex). Mais
il faut attendre la réflexion des théologiens du Moyen Âge pour tirer toutes les conséquences de
l'idée d'une liberté avec sa « destinée » affranchie par le christianisme de la loi du Destin
antique. Ainsi, comme rappelé déjà plus haut, un saint Thomas d'Aquin fait de la lex naturalis
ce que les hommes peuvent comprendre par leur seule raison de la loi divine révélée (lex
aeterno), notamment le Décalogue, et en la distinguant de la lex humana (créée par l'homme).
Au XVIe siècle qui voit « l'essor de la philosophie politique », cette tradition scolastique va trou-
ver un développement tout à fait remarquable à travers un double courant catholique et protes-
tant. Bellarmin, Molina, Suarez, Vitoria, Théodore de Bèze (successeur de Calvin à Genève) font
référence explicite au « droit naturel » pour fonder et limiter la souveraineté politique, pour
reconnaître un droit de résistance au tyran, pour affirmer enfin l'existence d'un droit internatio-
nal et défendre en particulier, comme le fit Bartolomi Las Casas, les Indiens contre les colonisa-
teurs espagnols. Assurément, c'est sur le terreau de cette riche et noble tradition où a soufflé
l'esprit du parfait humanisme chrétien illustré par un Érasme et un Thomas More que germèrent
les idées généreuses qui devaient éclore au grand jour avec une portée universelle en 1789.
Au XVIIe siècle, avec des juristes comme Grotius et Pufendorf, on assiste à la sécularisation

Abstract: Ce commentaire du chapitre 5 de l'Épître aux Romains de saint Paul met en évidence l'opposition entre une logique humaine de l'équivalence et une logique divine, d'un autre ordre que la première, qui est celle de la surabondance. La surabondance apparaît inhumaine mais elle prend pourtant figure humaine à travers Jésus. L'extravagance, l'extrême, l'exception peuvent-ils nourrir notre imaginaire éthique ?<br>

Abstract: Il faut cependant ajouter que ces considérations relèvent de la réflexion savante de
l'élite monastique. Dans certaines formes du bouddhisme populaire comme le courant de la
Terre pure (ou « amidisme »), le croyant sait ne pas pouvoir compter exclusivement sur sa
« propre force » (zili) : il doit faire appel à une puissance extérieure (tali), celle de la compas-
sion d'Amitabha, dont il invoque le nom dans l'espoir de trouver le repos dans le Paradis de
l'ouest. Les convergences formelles entre la « confiance entière » (xin) envers Amitabha et la
« foi » dans les effets de la grâce divine ont parfois retenu l'attention des penseurs chrétiens.
Voir le beau livre du P. Henri de Lubac sur Amida (1955). Cette attitude différente ne relève pas
pour autant de la problématique du pardon.<br>

se fera à partir d'une double réception : celle du mythe d'Er, à partir duquel il
s'agit d'articuler les rôles respectifs de l'action humaine (le choix), de l'inter-
vention divine ou du destin (exécution de ce choix) et du tirage au sort
(hasard); et celle de la conception aristotélicienne du έφ' ήμίν, pensé à partir
de DI13 comme non-nécessaire et identifié à l'action humaine, dont la réalisa-
tion et les conséquences sont pour leur part assimilées au destin. Le destin, dès
lors, inclut tout, mais certaines choses à titre d'hypothèses (nos choix et actions
identifiées au έφ' ήμίν) et d'autres à titre de conséquences (leurs effets). Le
έφ ήμίν est donc inclus dans le destin, mais non soumis au destin, ce qui per-
met, comme le note E. Eliasson, d'éviter les « conséquences déterministes de
la théorie stoïcienne ». Sur ce point, voir également S. Bobzien (art. cit.), qui
montre la façon dont, à travers cette reprise, la notion de έφ ήμίν se trouvera
subordonnée au contingent et, plus précisément, à ce qui arrive non pas la plu-
part du temps ou rarement, mais à ce qui arrive « en part égale », que Némésius
(De la nature de l'homme, 104. 6.7; 114.21.2), comme Plutarque (Du destin,
571 c-d), identifient à ce que nous sommes capables de faire et son opposé.
Dans cette tradition, elle montre donc que le concept de έφ' ήμίν se trouve
pensé à partir de trois sources aristotéliciennes : la question du délibérable
(EN III 4); le concept de possibilité double en sa relation à la puissance
rationnelle (DI 13; Mét. Θ); et le problème des futurs contingents (DI 9).<br>

Abstract: The appropriation of transnational cultural flows that occurs as a result of globalization is studied here through adaptations of Western narratives in manga and anime. This "Other" is integrated by exacerbating some of its features: The West is presented in Japanese works as conveyor of an excessive, unjust and potentially dangerous world, as the manifestation of Cartesianism taken to the extreme. Japaneseness, which is then defined by opposition to this incorporated otherness, brings out a supposedly specifically Japanese sensitivity, thus perpetuating a long intellectual tradition that sees in the feeling of things the very essence of Japaneseness by contrast to the rational Chinese and Western mind. Episodes from the life of Joan of Arc and Athena's divine interventions for instance then take on new meaning, which serves to promote Japaneseness and the essential values it conveys, such as the importance of social harmony and the close interdependence among members of the community.<br>

Abstract: Le 21 août 2004, dans la Békaa (Liban), un jeune touriste musulman sunnite est le témoin d'un miracle : une statue de la Vierge s'anime devant lui et lui adresse un message. L'événement transforme en quelques jours Béchouate, un village isolé, en vaste centre de pèlerinage interreligieux réunissant des dévots de différentes confessions, chrétiens et musulmans. Cet article portera sur le basculement qui voit une statue, « Notre-Dame de Béchouate », brusquement passer du régime de l'objet à celui d'une personne qui s'anime, sourit, bouge et parle. Elle sera donc l'héroïne de l'ethnographie ici proposée, une héroïne au centre de pressantes attentions humaines. Partant de l'observation des liens complexes qui se créent et se recréent entre cet « objet-personne » et des dévots de différentes religions, il s'agira de s'interroger sur les économies locatives du divin et de faire « heuristiquement crédit » aux acteurs rencontrés sur le terrain lorsque pour de « bonnes raisons », ils affirment être en présence d'êtres divins et/ou surnaturels. On 21 August 2004, in the Bekaa Valley (Lebanon), a young Sunni Muslim tourist witnessed a miracle : a statue of the Virgin Mary came to life and gave him a message. Within a few days, Beshuat, once a quiet and remote village, became a major interdenominational pilgrimage center drawing thousands of Christian and Muslim worshippers. The statue of Our Lady of Beshuat is the main « actor » of the following ethnographic essay that details its/her sudden transformation from « object » into « persona » capable of moving, smiling and speaking. Based on observation of the complex ties between this object-person and worshippers of different religions, the aim of this essay is to highlight how the divine is made present and, by so doing, to give « heuristic credit » to the people encountered in the field who declare, for « good reasons », that they are in the presence of divine or supernatural beings.<br>

Abstract: For Dooyeweerd's Western oriented, sometimes even nationalistically tinted and yet, in
its intention, normative view of culture, see A New Critique, vol. 2, pp. 266-68, etc. In his
Roots in particular, the Occident' is very central (ch. 1, §§ 3,17-25), as the following passage
illustrates: Ά truly scriptural view of history... knows that the great antithesis between the
ground motive of the divine revelation of the Word and the ground motive of the apostate
spirit operates [in history] in the power struggle for the future of western civilization' (p.
108). Yes, Dooyeweerd at one point even calls the Dutch national character, in view of its
calvinistic bent, its humaneness, its sober life-style, and the like, a 'normative type' of histor-
ical disclosure and differentiation (p. 82). See also the striking analysis by C. T. Mclntire in
'Dooyeweerd's Philosophy of History', especially pp. 104-5, together with the nuanced criti-
cism of S. Griffioen in 'De betekenis van Dooyeweerd's ontwikkelingsidee', pp. 105-7.<br>

Abstract: David Bohm, op.cit. Bohm's insistence on an "implicate order" basically calls into question
the modern idea in quantum mechanics that the universe is fundamentally and ultimately

that creation possesses an ultimate ground of all order in the Word of the Creator God. See

Abstract: Dooyeweerd remained faithful to Abraham Kuyper (1898/1943, 20) here, specifically to
the well-known, almost infamous passage from the Lectures on Calvinism·.
"Hence the first claim demands that such a life system shall find its starting-point in a
special interpretation of our relation to God. This is not accidental, but imperative. If such
an action is to put its stamp upon our entire life, it must start from that point in our
consciousness in which our life is still undivided and lies comprehended in its unity, — not
in the spreading vines but in the root from which the vines spring. This point, of course, lies
in the antithesis between all that is finite in our human life and the infinite that lies beyond
it. Here alone we find the common source from which the different streams of our human
life spring and separate themselves. Personally it is our repeated experience that in the
depths of our hearts, at the point where we disclose ourselves to the Eternal One, all the
rays of our life converge as in one focus, and there alone regain that harmony which we so
often and so painfully lose in the stress of daily duty."
Wiskerke (1978, 75ff.) called this semi-mystical view 'the heart condition' of the philosophy of
the cosmonomic idea (see also the interesting notes on pp. 259ff). Kuyper's statement in the
Stone Lectures is in part based on his interpretation of Ecclesiastes 3:11 ('[God] has put
eternity into man's mind'):
"That age is the world of the Eternal, from which time, and with time all the finite, was
born.... The age that lets you leap over the boundaries of the finite and envelops you in the
ocean of the heavenly and Divine... that awakens your faith as a wholly other, wholly
independent faculty of thought and reveals you to yourself as a wholly other, far richer and
brilliant being than the world ever allowed you to see in its mirror." (De Héraut 1781, 18-2-
1912; cited in Dutch by Wiskerke 1978, 79).
Wiskerke suggests that this semi-mysticism evinces some~<br>

'But, for all of our focus on doing, we have always also insisted that our active lives of
obedience to divine directives must be characterized by a coherence that can only be found by
understanding our obligations in the context of a "world-and-life-view". — This is, in turn, the
embodiment of a way of life that nurtures in us (...) a "steady, habitual determination" to be
certain kinds of persons.' (Mouw 2006, 6)<br>

Abstract: Dieser Aufsatz greift auf die Forschungen des Altgermanisten Friedrich Ohly zurück, der die Geisteswissenschaften durch eine metaphern-orientierte Forschung neu stimulieren wollte: Metaphern, so Friedrich Ohly, seien nicht Restbestände, sondern Grundbestände menschlichen Lebens. Besonders die religiöse Sprache komme nicht ohne Metaphern aus. So sei die Beziehung zwischen Gott und den Menschen allein metaphorisch zu versprachlichen. Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird der metaphern-orientierte Zugang von Friedrich Ohly auf die Metapher „Gotteskind“ bzw. „Gotteskindschaft“ angewendet. Näherhin analysiert der Beitrag die Prägekraft der Metapher „Gotteskind“ bzw. „Gotteskindschaft“ mit Blick auf die Taufliturgie und die Tauftheologie der Alten Kirche. Unabhängig von seinem biologischen Alter – so geben sich die Jesus-Anhänger von Anfang an überzeugt – wird der Christ jung in der Taufe und bleibt jung, wenn er seine Taufberufung in Treue bewahrt. So seien als Schlüsselgedanken des vorliegenden Aufsatzes hervorgehoben: erstens die Taufe als geistliche Geburt und Anfang der Kindwerdung; zweitens die metaphorische Rede von der Taufeucharistie als Milch, welche als lebenslängliche geistliche Speise für die Gotteskinder gilt (1 Petr 2,2). This article examines the research of Friedrich Ohly, a medievalist who sought to stimulate spiritual understanding through thought which explored the significance of metaphor. For him, metaphors were not merely the remains, but parts of the active inventory of human life. Religious language, in particular, could not do without them. The relationship between God and man could be articulated only by metaphoric means. In this article Ohly's approach is applied to the metaphor of 'God's Child', or 'Divine Filiation'. The article seeks to analyse the power of the impression of the metaphor itself with a view to the baptismal liturgy and baptismal theology of the ancient Church. From the very beginning Christians had been convinced that new believers be~<br>

Abstract: Se revendiquant d'E. Betti dans le débat qu'il eut avec H.-G. Gadamer, Fazlur Rahman défend la possibilité de connaître avec certitude le sens objectif du Coran, qu'il dissocie du sens littéral. Ce sens objectif, qui correspond à l'intention divine, est pour ce réformiste indo-pakistanais en accord avec les valeurs universelles de la modernité. Or plusieurs intellectuels, dont le sud-africain Farid Esack, reprennent l'argument gadamérien de l'historicité de toute interprétation pour critiquer l'idée qu'une lecture puisse être objective. Ainsi, classique ou moderne, aucune interprétation ne serait dénuée de préjugés, et prétendre le contraire reviendrait à enfermer le Coran dans l'historicité du lecteur. Même si Rahman relativise son propos en rappelant la difficulté de la recherche de l'objectivité, le problème que pose son modernisme est qu'il risque de céder à l'illusion d'un islam véritable, authentique, qui arrêterait alors le mouvement de réinterprétation du texte. Taking a stand for E. Betti in the debate he had with H.G. Gadamer, Fazlur Rahman defends the possibility of knowing with certainty the objective meaning of the Quran, which differs from the literal sense. For the Indo-Pakistani reformist, this objective meaning, which corresponds to the divine intention, is in accordance with the universal values of modernity. Yet, many intellectuals, including South African Farid Esack, takes up the Gadamerian argument and plead for the historicity of any interpretation, criticizing the idea that an interpretation can be objective. In that view, be it classical or modern, no interpretation would be without prejudice, and pretending otherwise would confine the Quran to the historicity of the reader. Even if Rahman restates the difficulty of the search for objectivity, the problem of his modernism is that it may give the illusion of a real, authentic Islam, which then forecloses the dynamics of textual reinterpretation.

Abstract: Some sixty times in the Iliad and Odyssey, the narrator describes a sequence of events with the climactic phrase, "And now X would have happened, had not Y intervened." Though some recent studies have begun to focus on this narrative technique, a fuller accounting of its properties remains desirable, as many of the passages where it is employed are quite significant to the overall construction of the plots. I have termed the phenomenon pivotal contrafactuals. The present study argues that the composer achieves three general narrative benefits by employing this device. First, it is a method for emphatically changing the direction of the plot (hence the adjective "pivotal"). Second, it allows the narrator to confer added emphases of various kinds upon the events he describes. Third, the narrator often uses the construction to make an editorial comment upon the character on whose behalf the intervention occurs. Intriguingly, Homer appears to link some pivotal contrafactuals together through various means. Some occur as equivalent elements in different multiforms of a common type scene. Some occur in different narratives describing the same event. These latter raise the possibility that divine intervention of which he is unaware occurs in Odysseus's narrative of his wanderings. Finally, I suggest that a passage at the beginning of the Catalogue of Ships, which has attracted various interpretations, is a modified pivotal contrafactual.<br>

Abstract: Hilkert, and for Karl Rahner, whom she follows closely in this regard, "Human
words have the potential to become sacraments of divine love. Human words spoken from the center of our-
selves . . . function as symbols that allow a deeper mystery, the offer of grace, to become more concretely
present and available in human life" (33).<br>

“unwarranted" zuriickgewiesen. Diesem Urteil vermag ich nicht zu widersprechen,
wenn Clines die Rolle der Frau darin sieht, “only to fulfil a divine command", namlich

Abstract: Déjà, le Roman de la Rose disait que nul n'est gentilhomme s'il n'est pas soucieux
de vertu et que nul n'est vilain sinon en raison de ses vices. Dante, dans le Convivio,
affirme que la noblesse est individuelle et non pas transmissible: «Que personne pouvant
dire 'j'appartiens à telle lignée', n'aille croire que la noblesse est avec lui, si ces fruits ne
sont pas en lui. (...) Ainsi donc, que l'héritier des Uberti de Florence et des Visconti de
Milan n'aille pas dire: 'Parce que j'appartiens à cette lignée, je suis noble». Car la semence
divine ne tombe pas en une lignée, c'est-à-dire une descendance, mais en des individus;
et (...) la descendance ne rend pas nobles les individus, mais les individus rendent noble
la descendance», Convivio, IV, xx, 5, p. 352-353, dans la traduction de Ch. Bec; cf. D.
CONSOLI, «Nobiltà et nobile», in: Enciclopedia Dantesca, IV, Rome 1973, pp. 58-62. Au
XVe siècle, Gerson reprend le débat en officialisant doctrinalement la définition de la
noblesse comme vertu: «Chascun peut acquérir en soy propre noblesse par vertueuse ope-
racion et estre le commencement que ses successeurs soient réputés nobles, comme par le
contraire un de noble lignie peut finer la noblesse en sa personne par vil péché et mau-
vaitié», cf. «Considérations sur saint Joseph», in Œuvres complètes, P. Glorieux éd., t. 7,
Paris, 1968, p. 70-71, cité par Philippe Contamine, La noblesse au royaume de France de
Philippe le Bel à Louis XII. Essai de synthèse, Paris, 1997, p. 299. À la page 302, les exem-
ples que donne Philippe Contamine du débat au XVe siècle sont nombreux: Antoine de
la Sale écrit dans Jean de Saintré: «La noblesse des bonnes meurs vaut trop mieulx que la
noblesse des parens»; Anne de France aurait dit: «Gentilesse de lignage sans noblesse de
courage» doit être comparée à l'arbre sec qui n'a ni verdure ni fruit et qui n'est bon qu'à
brûler cf. Les enseignements d'Anne de France, duchesse de Bourbonnais et d'Auvergne à sa
fille Anne de Bourbon, A.-M. Cha~<br>

Article Title: The Divine Essence, that Inaccessible <italic>Kabod</italic> Enthroned in Heaven: Nazianzen's <italic>Oratio</italic> 28,3 and the Tradition of Apophatic Theology from Symbols to Philosophical Concepts<br>
Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i27793826<br>
Date: 1 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Giulea Dragoş A.<br>
Abstract: In his second theological oration (Oratio 28,3), Gregory Nazianzen equates the divine glory (kabod) of the Holy of Holies with the divine essence and asserts their inaccessible character. An investigation into the meaning of these two terms unveils their origins in two distinct traditions, the former tracing its roots back to the ancient Semitic symbolisms of the forbidden divine glory and throne, the latter to the Hellenistic philosophical conception of an immaterial and incomprehensible divinity. The thesis advanced in this study is that these two different languages represent two semiotic forms of apophaticism, one expressed through the mysterium tremendum inspiring symbols and images of fire, dazzling glory and enigmatic heavenly creatures, guardians of the enthroned kabod, the other through negative philosophical terminologies. The identity of the two semiotic forms is established at the end of an investigation that concludes with the observation that Hellenistic theologians developed their apophatic discourses mostly in the context of interpreting biblical reports on the theophanies of the divine and unapproachable enthroned kabod. It was in this hermeneutical context that they "translated" the symbols of interdiction into philosophical negative concepts.<br>

Abstract: Tout au long de son uvre remarquable, Georges Poulet observe fort
bien ces différences. A titre d'exemple, voici l'extrait suivant : « Le moment
Janséniste est un moment d'amour, mais d'amour angoissé qui Jette au-delà
de ses bords, sur le passé et sur l'avenir des regards chargés de crainte et
d'espérance, tel est le moment pascalien. Le moment quiétlste, au contraire,
est un moment sans passé ni avenir, où l'être en se désappropriant de sol se
désapproprle même de son espérance, tel est le moment fénelonien, [...].
Néanmoins, en dépit de ces profondes différences, la religion de Fénelon
comme celle de Pascal sont des religions faites pour des êtres conçus comme
n'ayant « ni état fixe ni conscience », des êtres toujours instantanés, n en va

              de même de la religion de Boseuet. [...] Les religions du xvii
              
              siècle sont
            
toutes des religions de la grâce continue, dans le sens exac où la pensée d'un
Descartes ou d'un Malebranche sont des philosophies de la création continuée.

              Le xvii
              
              siècle est l'époque où rien ne s'interpose entre l'éternité divine et
            
chaque moment humain » (Etudes sur le temps humain, vol. I, Paris, Pion,
1963, Introduction, pp. xxi-xxii).<br>

Abstract: God is once again afoot in the public sphere. Politics has become a religious obligation. For a new breed of religious nationalist the nation-state is a vehicle of the divine. This essay seeks to accomplish four things. The first is to argue for an institutional approach to religious nationalism in order both to interpret and explain it. Second, I argue that religion and nationalism partake of a common symbolic order and that religious nationalism is therefore not an oxymoron. Third, the essay seeks to explain why religion has become such a potent political force in our time. And fourth-the task that will take up the bulk of the text-it seeks a principle of intelligibility in the semiotic order of religious nationalism that can comprehend its preoccupation with both women's erotic bodies and monies out of national control.<br>

Abstract: A la veille de la commémoration religieuse, civile et savante de la révocation de l'Edit de Nantes, quelle est la situation du protestantisme français? Inquiétante ou prometteuse, c'est selon, nous dit Jean Baubérot. Ce groupe carrefour, qui a tant fait pour imposer le pluralisme culturel et démocratique en France, semble n'avoir plus d'autre stratégie qu'un œcuménisme déçu, d'autre logique que la déstructuration de ses communautés. Et pourtant, d'évangélismes en ferveurs tziganes, l'Esprit souffle encore. Timides et provocants, voici, trois siècles après, les fils du Désert et du Refuge. /// The Fall of 1985 will see the commemoration of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. The author takes this occasion to describe the situation of French Protestantism. In the 19th century, the Protestants had accepted as inevitable the secularization of post-1789 society, and they were instrumental in making it come about. In the 20th century, they adopted an oecumenical strategy, with the Vatican Council II coming as a "divine surprise". Today, they are hesitating between a timid withdrawal and a new evangelical offensive, particularly important in these times of religious disaffection. Three centuries have gone by since the Revocation, but the memory of it is still a help for innovation and a test of vitality for this minority to which the cultural and democratic pluralism of France is so beholden.<br>

Issue: i40000336<br>
Date: 3 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Dhand Arti<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on one key episode of the great Hindu epic, the Mahābhārata: the scene in the first book in which the Bhārata widows Ambikā and Ambālikā are impregnated by their brother-in-law, Vyāsa. The article is composed of two parts. The first examines narratives surrounding the practice of niyoga, or levirate, and reflects on its significance to the construction of the epic plot. The second reflects on the personality and motives of Vyāsa, uncompromising brother-in-law, formidable sage, and near-divine author of the text. The link between the two parts is important for unpacking a key religious orientation of the Mahābhārata. The article argues that Vyāsa's curse of the Bhārata widows is not idiosyncratic but, rather, is a stern example of the author's specific interpretation of virtue, which in turn bespeaks the overarching religious worldview of the text--the karmayogic ideal of equanimity.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000789<br>
Date: 7 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Wall John<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's understanding of the relations of faith, love, and hope suggests a unique approach to theological ethics, one that holds fresh promise for bringing together considerations of the good (teleology) and the right (deontology) around the notion of an "economy of the gift." The economy of the gift articulates Ricoeur's distinctively dialectical understanding of the relation of the human and the divine, and the resulting dialectical moral relation of the self and the other. Despite our fallen condition, Ricoeur suggests, we are called by the divine to embrace the radical possibility of the reconciliation of human goods under the requirement of accountability to human diversity and otherness.<br>

Author(s): Joyce Richard<br>
Abstract: It is widely believed that the Divine Command Theory is untenable due to the Euthyphro Dilemma. This article first examines the Platonic dialogue of that name, and shows that Socrates's reasoning is faulty. Second, the dilemma in the form in which many contemporary philosophers accept it is examined in detail, and this reasoning is also shown to be deficient. This is not to say, however, that the Divine Command Theory is true--merely that one popular argument for rejecting it is unsound. Finally some brief thoughts are presented concerning where the real problems lie for the theory.<br>

Author(s): Moretto Giovanni<br>
Abstract: Par Undo do princípio de que a crítica feita em Wahrheit und Methode à Aufklärung tern sobretudo a ver com a hostilidade do iluminismo nos seus confrontos com o preconceito religioso enquanto fundado na revelação cristã, o presente artigo pretende demonstrar de que modo Gadamer, por exemplo já num ensaio de 1941 acerca da critica kantiana da religião, alcançou a partir da sua familiaridade de longa data com os Gregos e os seus deuses uma concepção do religioso que, ao fundar--se sobre a experiência "humanística" do Divino, aspira a manter uma solidariedade intima com a "Religion nach der Aufklärung" ("Religiao segundo a Auflärung"), cujo Deus, apcsar de ser o Deus dos filósofos, nem por isso é menos versado em revelaqçõs e em formas extra-potentes de realidade ". O artigo mostra ainda como no contexto de uma concepção como esta o Divino acabapor assumir sobretudo a figura da "amizade" e da "transcendencia do belo." /// It can be said that Gadamer's critique of the Aufklärung in Wahrheit und Methode has to do with the hostility of the Enlightenment towards religious prejudice derived from Christian revelation. This article aims to demonstrate that, already in an essay dating from 1941 about the Kantian critique of religion, Gadamer possessed a conception of God, largely due to his familiarity with the Greek notions of divinity, that sought nevertheless to maintain close ties with "Religion nach der Aufklärung". Whilst this God is the God of philosophers, it is a God inclined towards revelations and extra-ordinary expressions of power. In addition, the article shows that in this philosophical context the Divine acquires a figure suggesting "friendship" and a transcendent sense of the beautiful.<br>

Issue: i40014491<br>

Abstract: O artigo parte de uma constatação fundamental: a cultura secular mudou radicalmente o problema do mal, libertando-o do imediatismo religioso, exigindo uma resposta nova para um problema novo. Procede segundo dois momentos fundamentais. Primeiro, a ponerología, prévia a toda a adscrição religiosa ou ateia, mostra como a finitude torna o mal algo inevitável: omnis determinatio est negatio (Spinoza, Leibniz, Hegel); mostra também até que ponto a ideia de um mundo-finito-sem-mal é algo contraditório, um verdadeiro "círculo-qua-drado". Quebra-se assim o "dilema de Epicuro", pois a alternativa já não é: mundo bom / mundo mau, mas sim: mundo / mundo finito-com-mal (não mundo mau); e instaura-se uma "lógica do apesar de", sem contaminação teleológica. A pisteodicea - o segundo passo - estuda as respostas ("fés" em sentido filosófico ou teológico, crente ou ateu). A teodiceia clássica converte-se, desta forma, em "pisteodiceia cristã", filosoficamente coerente (graças à ponerologia, Deus aparece, apesar do mal, como omnipotente e bom) e teologicamente responsável: a cruz, inevitável, preserva a bondade divina; a ressurreição, transcendente, preserva a omnipotência, respeitando a legalidade mundana. Filosofia e teologia mantêm assim a união na diferença. /// At the outset of this paper is the fundamental realization that the secular culture has radically changed the problem of evil, exempting it from the religious elementariness but rather demanding a new answer to a new problem. It sets two steps. First, the ponerology, previous to any religious or atheistic addition, shows that finitude makes evil inevitable: omnis determinatio est negatio (Spinoza, Leibniz, Hegel); a finite-world-without-evil is contradictory, a "square-circle". It breaks, thus, the "Epicurean dilemma", since the alternative is not: good world vs. evil world, but rather world vs. finite-world-with-evil (not evil world): and it establishes a "logic of the in spite of, without the teleological contamination.~<br>

Issue: i40014503<br>

Abstract: For over twenty years, Richard Kearney has insisted that theology must not follow traditional metaphysical itineraries along paths that offer perspectives on God as Being Itself, or as Pure Act, or as causa sui. Instead, it should chart avenues that lead through the poetics of imagination, past the synthesizing dynamics of narrative, and toward the destination of God as a God that privileges potentiality over actuality. In constant dialogue with deconstructive and postmodern theories, Kearney has developed an "onto-eschatological hermeneutics" of the "God Who May Be" that presents a post--metaphysical, perhaps even more biblical, interpretation of God as divine possibility. This paper investigates Kearney's "onto-eschatological" poetics of God as it relates to his imaginative theological method and to the Pauline notion of kenosis as the risk of divine love. It concludes by associating Kearney's theopoetics with Kierkegaard's idea of repetition as a cipher for understanding the kinetics of the God Who May be as an alternative to the traditional metaphysical structures of God as a static "I Am Who I Am." /// Desde há mais de vinte anos que Richard Kearney vem insistindo em que a teologia deveria deixar de seguir os itinerdrios metafísicos tradicionais, ou seja, deveria deixar para trás os caminhos metafísicos que oferecem perspectivas sobre Deus enquanto Ser-mesmo, Acto Puro, ou causa sui. Em vez disso, a teologia deveria antes seguir caminhos orientados por uma poética da imaginação, para além da dinâmica sintetizadora da narrativa e em direcção a uma noção de Deus que privilegia a potencialidade sobre a actualidade. Num diálogo constante com as teorias desconstructoras e pós-modernas, Richard Kearney desenvolveu uma "hermenêutica ôntico-escatológica" do "Deus que pode ser", hermenêutica essa que nos oferece uma interpretação pós-metafísica, talvez mesmo mais bíblica, de Deus como divina possibilidade. O presente artigo investiga a poética "ontico-escatológica" de D~<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i40048296<br>
Date: 3 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Soual Philippe<br>
Abstract: Hegel, refusant le déisme et son Dieu d'entendement et repensant la theologia crucis luthérienne, considère l'événement de la mort de Jésus-Christ sur la croix comme la manifestation dans l'histoire mondiale de l'amour divin trinitaire. La vie éternelle de Dieu est celle de l'amour des trois personnes divines, comme don, dessaisissement de soi et commune extase. Or la Croix révèle cet amour par la kénose du Fils, comprise comme don et mort de la mort. Par là Hegel s'efforce de penser non pas la seule mort de Dieu, mais bien la vie infinie de Dieu qui est conquête de sa vérité dans l'épreuve de l'absolu déchirement, de l'abîme de la croix. Cette vie est, par la croix, gloire de l'amour trinitaire dans le règne de l'Esprit. Hegel, refusing deism and its God of understanding, and pondering anew over the Lutheran theologia crucis, believes that Jésus Christ's death on the Cross is the manifestation of the Trinity's divine love within the history ofthe world. God's eternal life is that ofthe three divine persons embodying gift, the unravelling of one's self and common ecstasy. Now the Cross reveals such a love through the kenosis ofthe Son understood both as gift and death of death. Hence, Hegel strives at thinking not only God's death but, rather, the infinité life of God which is a conquest of its own truth through the trial of the absolute wrench of the abyss of the Cross. Such a life becomes, through the expérience of the Cross, the glory of the love of the Trinity within the realm ofthe Spirit.<br>

Abstract: L'univers médiatique du surf contemporain est peuplé de créatures de rêve. Sur les pages des magazines spécialisés, elles accompagnent de leurs courbes voluptueuses les prouesses des surfeurs et les produits du surfwear, donnant à la lecture sportive une touche d'érotisme. Ces jeunes femmes à la divine plastique, qui font aussi partie de la réalité des plages, sont appelées beachgirls. La plus sexy d'entre elles est la « Reef Girl » , pin-up « exotique » sans visage qui a contribué au succès de la marque de tongs Reef. Cet article se propose d'esquisser le portrait de cette figure féminine de la surf culture, et de retracer son parcours médiatique -narratif-avant sa récente disparition suite à l'essor de la mixité au sein d'une pratique physique à dominante masculine. The media world of contemporary surfis full of bombshells. On the pages of magazines, their voluptous curves escort the beautiful performances of surfers together with surfwear products, adding an erotic touch to the sports reading. These young women with wonderful bodies, — a part of the beach's scene-, are called "beachgirls". The sexiest of them is the "Reef Girl", an "exotic" pinup without any face who has contributed to the success of the flip-flop brand Reef. This article outlines the portrait of this feminine figure of surf culture ; it describes its presence in media and narrative discourses before it faded away, when the formerly made dominated sport opened to women. Die Welt des Surfens ist bevölkert von Traumkörpern. Den Fachzeitschriften verleihen ihre heldenhaften Körper und die Surfwear, die sie präsentieren, einen Hauch von Erotik. Die jungen Frauen und ihre göttlichen Körper, die ebenfalls zum Inventar der Strände gehören, heißen „ Beachgirls". Die sexieste unter ihnen ist das sogenannte Reef Girl, eine „exotisches" Pin-up Mädchen, das zum Erfolg der Badeschuh-Marke Reef beigetragen hat.

Abstract: Le recit de la theophanie en Ex 19-24 est traditionnellement considéré comme un ensemble de sources et de traditions assembliés de manière lâche dans une unique narration. Le présent article suggère de reconnaître dans la péricope du Sinaï un récit complexe et cohérent de la théophanie, divisé en trois séquences narratives, chacune d'elles étant délimitee par la récurrence d'un modele rhetorique (i.e. 19,3-8b; 19,8c-20b et 20,18-21; 19,20c-25 et 24,1-8). Alors que la structure de la première séquence se présente de manière assez simple, les deux dernières séquences sont interrompues et font ensuite l'objet de deux reprises narratives (i.e. 20,18-21 et 24,1-8). Ainsi que le manifeste cette structure, la théophanie est racontée de manière synoptique au chapitre 19 selon le point de vue de Dieu: l'accent est mis alors sur l'offre d'alliance et la sainteté divine. Le récit est ensuite raconté à nouveau et développé dans les deux reprises narratives selon le point de vue du peuple: la crainte de Dieu (20,18-21) et la ratification de l'offre d'alliance (24,1-8) sont alors soulignées.<br>

Abstract: Le revival, qui se développa parmi les premiers disciples de Husserl, est un fait saisissant. Des documents, dont quelques uns sont encore inédits, servent à l'illustrer. Ce qui le fonde, c'est une étrange correspondance entre le projet de la première phénoménologie et les démarches subjectives de la conscience religieuse. La vraie philosophie, sainteté de la raison, n'est-elle pas aussi rectitude de la conscience jusqu'aux racines d'une expérience du sacré ou du divin ? The revival, which appeared among the first disciples of Ed. Husserl, is a well known fact. New documents are dedicated to illustrate such an event. They make clearer the existence of some mysterious bond linking the first phenomenological method and the basic disposition of natural religion. Genuine philosophy is indeed rightness of thought but also practical truth down to the very sources of a renovating feeling of the holy or the divine.<br>

Publisher: Centre Sèvres - Facultés jésuites de Paris<br>
Issue: i40117711<br>

Abstract: On associe généralement la figure de Satan à une signification indigente ou mesquine. Dans la Philosophie de la révélation, Schelling tente au contraire d'en donner une interprétation différente, selon laquelle la « mauvaiseté positive » de Satan n'est pas seulement assumée, mais également revalorisée. Cependant, le rôle de Satan demeure ambigu, incarnant à la fois le tentateur universel et le maillon nécessaire à la révélation de Dieu lui-même. Dans cette étude, il s'agit donc de montrer à la fois la nature amphibolique du Diable, et de rendre compte des multiples endossements qu'il recouvre. Une tâche qui implique précisément la mise en évidence du rôle incontournable de Satan dans la victoire finale du bien, et qui se manifeste, en termes schellingiens, par l'incompatibilité de l'homme avec le feu dévorant du principe de lumière, laquelle nécessite un principe obscur qui hâte la séparation, pressent le mal et le provoque. One usually associates the figure of Satan with an impoverished, insufficient signification. On the contrary, in the Philosophy of Revelation Schelling tries to give a different interpretation, according to which Satan's potential for evil is not only accepted but embraced and given a positive valence, postulating a sort of "positivity of evil". However, Satan's role remains ambiguous, since he represents both the universal tempter and a necessary link in the process that reveals God's presence in the world. In this paper, I want to emphasize the Devil's twofold nature and to explore his multiple forms. This highlights Satan's necessary role in the final triumph of good, and how this role appears, in Schellingian terms, through the human inability to sound the depths of the consuming fire of divine light, which necessitates the existence of a dark principle that entails a separation, foreknows evil and thereby creates it.<br>

Abstract: Dans L'Étoile de la rédemption de Franz Rosenzweig, une topologie articule la question du pardon en tant que non-originaire. La distribution qui scande, organise et tisse toute une série de reliaisons faisant « système » dans L'Étoile, c'est : Création /révélation /rédemption comme modes relationnels et temporels déterminant des façons pour l'homme de se trouver pris dans des liaisons spécifiques avec Dieu, avec le monde, avec les autres hommes. Dans ces réseaux tissés par L'Étoile, la question est de savoir si le pardon est chose humaine ou grâce divine, « propre de l'homme » ou « propre de dieu » et de quoi il pourrait bien être, du coup, l'« impropre ». In the Star of Redemption of Franz Rosenzweig the forgiveness ist not really originary. The dispatching or distribution model who rules a multiplicity of « systematic » relations in the Star is the triplicity Creation/Revelation/Redemption. Thus the question is: is forgiveness a human affair or a divine favor ? Is it practicable in the community or is it a matter of inter subjectivity ? The themes of time, love, forgiveness and otherness are central in this reflexion.<br>

Author(s): Daniels John<br>
Abstract: Desire is examined here with a view to informing a theological response to capitalism. The notion of mimetic desire offered by René Girard is used as a starting point, Girard's ideas being brought into critical engagement with, first, other intersubjective accounts, namely those offered by Alexandre Kojève and by psychoanalysis in its Freudian and Lacanian variants; and then the account of desire as productive becoming offered by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, in which the link to capitalism is explicit. It is suggested that both mimetic desire and its productive counterpart can be understood as asserting the priority of desire itself over both subject and object. The possibilities for framing a coherent theological account of desire which is both mimetic and productive are then assessed with reference to Bernard of Clairvaux, Aquinas and Augustine, noting that accepting a metaphysics of participation makes plausible a productive desire which is nonetheless coded as a mimesis of the divine precedent. Such a conclusion brings into relief the inevitable difficulty of reconciling Christian and capitalist economies of desire.<br>

Abstract: Le dernier chapitre du livre de Ben Sira est une énigme. En son milieu, Si 51,12a-o a la particularité d'être transmis seulement en hébreu, dans le ms. B retrouvé dans la genizah du Caire à partir de 1896. Les versions l'ignorent – et, dès lors, la plupart de nos Bibles en traduction. La recherche est restée étonnamment muette sur ce Psaume : il est temps de reprendre le dossier. La première livraison de l'article s'attache au texte même et à la facture littéraire de cet hymne aux Noms divins, et explore les liens intertextuels noués avec la Bible hébraïque, les textes de Qumrân et la liturgie juive ancienne. The last chapter of Ben Sira is an enigma. In its middle, Si 51 : 12a-o has the peculiarity of coming down to us only in Hebrew, in ms. B found in the Cairo Genizah from 1896 on. The Versions ignore it — and so, most of our translated Bibles. Research has been strangely silent on this Psalm ; it is time to re-open the file. The first part of this article is devoted to the text itself, and to the literary construction of this hymn to the Divine Names. It explores the intertextual links with the Hebrew Bible, Qumran texts and early Jewish liturgy.<br>

Abstract: A la fin du XIVe siècle, le Dialogue de Catherine de Sienne expose, par sa construction littéraire extrêmement élaborée, la conversion du mouvement raisonnable de recherche du divin en mouvement intelligent de contemplation, la conversion du langage théologique en langage de l'intelligence de l'âme, la conversion du langage difficile de la raison en langage métaphorique audible par tous et susceptible de ramener tous les hommes dans l'obéissance à l'Eglise. La méthode de connaissance recommandée par Catherine est celle des larmes. At the end of the 14th century, the Dialogo of Catherine of Sienna expounds in a very elaborate literary construction the conversion of the reasonable search for the divine into intelligent contemplation, the conversion of theological language into that of the comprehending soul, the conversion of the difficult language of the reason into a metaphorical one, understandable to everyone and fit to bring all men back to obedience to the Church. The method of knowledge which Catherine advises is that of the tears. En el final del siglo XIV, el Dialogo de Caterina de Sena por su construcción literaria muy elaborada expone la conversión del movimiento racional de búsqueda de Dios en el movimiento inteligente de contemplación, la conversión del lenguaje teológico en el lenguaje de la inteligencia del alma, la conversión del lenguaje difícil de la razón en el lenguaje metafórico que todos entienden y que puede reducir a todos en la obediencia a la Iglesia. El método de conocimiento preconizado por Caterina es el de las lágrimas.<br>

Abstract: Appliquée au monothéisme trinitaire, cette étude de théologie spéculative se donne un double fondement Elle reçoit la relation de réciprocité entre Jésus-Christ et l'Esprii Saint, telle qu'elle est élaborée par diverses théologies contemporaines de la Révélation et du Salut Elle confirme une autre relation de réciprocité, entre une vérité de manifestation et une vérité de communication, telle qu'elle a pu être éprouvée à travers une réflexion conduite précédemment sur le langage. De cet entrecroisement suit la détermination de l'Esprii comme le Don incréé-indicible, et du Christ comme l'Icône-Parole incréée. Recueillant le Discours du Calvaire et la Parole de Pâques le dédoublement du nom christologique contribue à distinguer la médiation divine du milieu divin. Si la réciprocité du Christ et de l'Esprit rapporte ainsi le Mystère de Dieu à l'unité du Père et de la Révélation, il conviendra de revenir sur les anciens concepts de relation et d'origine, l'un et l'autre étant désormais respectivement accordés à la communication et à la manifestation. Applied to trinitarian monotheism, this study of speculative theology is based on a double foundation. It takes the relationship of reciprocity between Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit as elaborated by various contemporary theologies of revelation and salvation. It confirms another reciprocal relationship, that which exists between a truth of manifestation and a truth of communication as it has been previously established through a reflection on language. From this it follows that the Holy Spirit is the inexpressible, uncreated Gift while Christ is the uncreated Word-Image. Combining the discourse of Calvary and the Message of Easter, the double christological name helps to distinguish the divine mediation from the divine milieu. If the reciprocity of Christ and the Spirit thus relate the mystery of God to the unity of the Father and revelation, then it would be fitting to go back to the ancient concepts of relation and ori~<br>

Abstract: La sociobiologie, née au cours des années 1970 dans le cadre des théories darwiniennes, a été déclarée persona non grata en France pour des raisons essentiellement idéologiques. Elle a pourtant suscité outre-Atlantique de fructueux débats entre diverses disciplines ; la théologie comprise. Celle-ci ne peut rester indifférente aux propos des scientifiques sur la place occupée par le sentiment religieux dans l'évolution humaine ou encore par les comportements de survie et d'altruisme que l'espèce humaine partage avec le reste du vivant. Elle est ainsi invitée à poursuivre sa propre découverte de la personne humaine, comme sujet éthique et créature divine. Sociobiology, born during the 1970's in the context of Darwinism, was declared persona non grata in France for reasons basically ideological. It has however given rise to fruitful discussion in the United States between various disciplins including Theology. This latter cannot go on ignoring scientists' declarations on the place of religious sense in human evolution, or that of survival behaviour and altruism that the human species shares with the rest of the living world. Thus is Theology called to pursue its own discovery of the human person as ethical subject and divine creature.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur se propose de vérifier l'affirmation de Lavelle selon laquelle l'ouvrage de 1937, De l'Acte, se serait progressivement développé comme une synthèse complète de sa philosophie. Or il existe, à l'état dactylographié, une version antérieure de ce livre, qui permet de comprendre combien l'aisance presque trop grande des analyses de 1937 cache en fait une élaboration lente et un effort continu. La version inédite insiste sur l'intemporalité transcendantale de l'acte, et sur l'impersonnalité de l'acte fondateur de toutes les existences personnelles. Ces thèses seront abandonnées en 1937. On analyse ensuite l'article « Être et Acte » et la conférence de la société française de philosophie sur « Acte créateur et acte réflexif », où est discutée la position de Jean Nabert. Les thèses de De l'Acte montrent une progression de l'identité de l'être et de l'acte (dans l'acte d'être) jusqu'à l'acte en sa forme la plus haute, l'acte d'amour. Situer cette œuvre capitale implique qu'on ait bien compris l'interprétation du sensible comme de la donnée matérielle qui doit être spiritualisée. L'expérience extérieure du sensible s'oppose à l'expérience intérieure de l'esprit. Et l'acte est l'œuvre de l'être spirituel. L'ontologie dynamique de Lavelle est une affirmation de la liberté humaine comme participation à l'acte créateur divin. Divin ou humain, l'être est subjectif parce que libre. Ainsi Lavelle s'inscrit dans la tradition platonicienne moderne, celle d'Avicenne d'abord, celle de Hegel ensuite. The author proposes to verify Lavelle's assertion that the 1937 work, De l'Acte, would be progressively developed as a complete synthesis of his philosophy. Now there exists in typewritten state an earlier version of this book, which allows us to see the extent to which the almost excessive facility of analyses of 1937 in fact conceals a slow development and a continuous effort. The unedited version insists upon the transcendental atemporality of act, and upon the impersonality of ~<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219810<br>
Date: 10 1, 1969<br>
Author(s): Wordsworth Herbert F.<br>
Abstract: The fortunes of epiphany indicate both recent historical disparities within literary criticism and current cultural disparities between academic and popular discourse. The contextualist practice of Wordsworth and Joyce, in contrast to the purist theory that arose with the New Criticism, suggests that epiphany is a narrative device underscoring the historical and cultural construction of character. This conception is borne out by the original Epiphany, in Matthew, which manifests divine personality to human eyes through an episode of cultural difference and accommodation. Robert Browning's historicist poetry uses comparable but secular means of manifesting personality. In his dramatic monologues "Karshish," "My Star," and " 'Transcendentalism,' " epiphanic themes serve as measures of their speakers' cultural construction. In discerning the relative differentiae that characterize such speakers, Browning's readers encounter their own relativity to interpretive conditions. As these examples imply, the modern literary epiphany ultimately effects the hermeneutic manifestation of the reader.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the
         sugyain the Babylonian Talmud that includes the story of the Oven of Akhnai, in BTBaba metzi‘‘a58b––59b, expanding earlier studies by Jeffrey Rubenstein and Charlotte Fonrobert. It shows that two scriptural quotations involving, respectively, David and Tamar, situated in the first part of thesugya, anticipate the subsequent story and clarify how it functions as a ““foundation myth”” of the Beit Midrash (Fonrobert), and, therefore, of male identity (Boyarin). I suggest that the entiresugyaconstructs male identity by way of contrast with two ““others,”” the divine and the female realms, which are excluded from the Law-making process. The danger of verbal wrong, however, reveals the necessity of reintroducing the excluded ““others.”” The text achieves this by recognizing the existence of a transcendent justice, and by making Tamar, a foreign and female character with no access to the Law, a model of delicacy in verbal communication.<br>

Abstract: Throughout this discussion I have attempted to pay attention to geographical, spatial meanings as the material basis in our discussion. This is especially true in any study of diasporas since they involve movement through space over land and seascapes. Diasporas define orientations within situations of transculturation. They emphasize the religious meaning evoked from the transhumance capability of the human mode of being. Sacrality is often understood through vertical metaphors, with the gods and divine beings above, the human below, and the earth below. Along with this vertical metaphor, diasporic orientations bring to the fore the horizontal dimension of sacrality and the role of distance and movement in the revelation of sacrality and knowledge.<br>

Abstract: Of all the philosophers Catholics read, Heidegger enjoyed pride of place, aided by a wave of English translations and by the landmark study
            Heidegger: Through Phenomenology to Thought, by William Richardson, a Jesuit then at Fordham University.
                     When Catholic philosophers read7
                  Being and Timeit sounded just like what they who were wary of modernity had been looking for. When Heidegger criticized Descartes's idea of a worldless subject and his reduction of the world tores extensa, when Heidegger said that the question of the existence of the world when it is raised by a being whose being is being-in-the-world makes no sense, when Heidegger said that as soon as Dasein comes to be it finds that it is already there, that made instant sense to Catholic realists.
                     They had been critical of modern Cartesian epistemology for decades,8
                  
                     and here was Heidegger putting that argument on the map of contemporary philosophy in an original and magisterial way. When the “later” Heidegger offered a critique of what he called “onto-theo-logic,” when he said that an atheism about the God of metaphysics, about the9
                  causa sui, was closer to the truly divine God, Catholics knew from firsthand experience what he was talking about.
                     They had enough of the neo-Scholastic manuals, and they wanted to “overcome” them.10

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>
Date: 7 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: Janicaud's most thought-provoking suggestions arise out of his attempt to challenge hermeneutic phenomenology from the outside and to show that it imposes an illegitimate narrowing of the scope of phenomenological appearing. Here, Janicaud calls on the assistance of Gilles Deleuze, who famously denounces phenomenology and hermeneutics as “the two diseases of the earth, the pair of the despot and priest.”
         
               Deleuze links phenomenology, on the one hand, to the figure of the despot, in light of its effort to establish the transcendental ego as the source and master of all meaning. Hermeneutics, on the other hand, is linked to the figure of the priest, inasmuch as its search for hidden meanings is suspected to carry the residue of its biblical lineage, with its pursuit of the divine. These two discourses, though separate, suffer in fact from the same underlying disease: the choice for meaning. This choice, for Deleuze, imposes a restriction on their scope, which implies that they are only able to address the aftereffects or residues of a pre-subjective and pre-objective life that they ignore.18<br>

Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Approaching Mark C. Taylor's
         copiaof a/theological discourse from a hyperbolic perspective, for example, reveals this movement of hyperbole well. Taylor, especially in his earlier work, reads the radical theology of Thomas J. J. Althizer through a postmodern lens, constructing his own hyperbolic and paradoxical a/theological arguments. Through the practice of excess as a mode of thought, he radically (de)constructs a hybridity of theology and un-theology while tracing excessive, exaggerated concepts, for instance, the “not,” “erring,” the “Divine Milieu,” or “altar-ity,” along the disorienting margins of (un)thought that “mark” the openings within discourse, where an astonishing (re)apprehension may be gleaned. Taylor's most effective option in his attempt to write “beyond the end of theology,” which reveals the lack of language that is “inscribed in and as the failure of words” (1990, 223), is to write with/in this lack through the language of excess. Responding to the exigence of the current theological struggle with representation, methodology, and what he identifies as the end of theology, he argues through excess in order to communicate the magnitude of his subject matter.<br>

Author(s): Einsohn Howard Ira<br>
Abstract: Yes, regrettably, the species is fallen and the will is impaired. Nevertheless, these deficiencies are remediable for Shaw and Ricoeur. The two place unwavering faith in the ineradicable goodness of creation and lodge unflagging hope in the inextirpable capacity of humans to repair the damage they have done to themselves and the planet that houses them. Things can be different. Lives need not be beggared. Tomorrow can be better than today. This is the inspiriting wager Shaw and Ricoeur make, with eyes fully open to the countless maladies that mar existence. Through the maelstroms that swirled around them, they stayed the course, undaunted: they remained faithful, hopeful, spiritual, creative, and humane; they lived long, active, and productive lives of notable achievement; they made uplifting the least advantaged the locus of their ameliorative efforts; they sought justice, equality, and reconciliation for everyone; and the world is a much better place because of them. By such benchmarks, Shaw and Ricoeur epitomize wellness. For these kindred spirits, ever the intrepid circumnavigators of the entropic regions, one touch of the divine that permeates the universe makes us all brothers and sisters under the skin. Accordingly, as harried members of a single global family under siege, it follows in their thinking that we are responsible for one another's welfare, and that we cannot save our individual selves apart from saving humankind at large. Hence, we cannot injure someone unjustly, or allow another to suffer unnecessarily, without diminishing ourselves. In the inclusive society they envision, our shared humanity elicits shared responses to life's exigencies wherever they occur.<br>

Article Title: “Time and History in Blake's<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.22.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: William Blake's poem
         Jerusalem(1804–20), like all Perennial utopias, achieves a dialectical synthesis of the ideal and the actual through the narrative focalization of a religious experience at the level of character, one that is at once transhistorical and universal. By reading the poem through the lens of the Perennial paradigm, we discover that the temporal aspects ofJerusalemare intimately tied to the religious dimensions of Blake's utopian vision. In addition to giving us a new way to understand the well-documented distinctiveness of Blake's religious message, the Perennial paradigm shows Blake's soteriology inJerusalemto be utopian rather than salvationist (that is to say, individual-religious as opposed to collective-political). Because of the ultimately subjective nature of apprehension of the Divine Vision, Blake's utopian thought is not “clearly a forward-directed anticipatory and visionary concept,” as Magnus Ankarsjö has recently argued (15). Blake does not rally the reader towards some “ensuing peaceful millennium” (15) but rather to find enlightenment in the eternal moment. In light of Blake's suspicion of ratiocination, combined with his deliberate use of narrative focalization of Albion's religious vision, readingJerusalemas a Rational utopia grounded in Judeo-Christian of notions of Apocalypse is to miss Blake's core religious message.<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Perhaps the resemblance between rhetorical invention and utopia is best illustrated in Plato's dialogue
         Phaedrus. Plato disparaged rhetoric in his earlier philosophical writings, particularly in theGorgias, where he claims that rhetoric is nothing but flattery; it panders to the public and works only to have power for the moment, by showing off with glamour and stirring up desire. For Plato, rhetoric, like the concept of utopia to most twentieth-century Marxists, was an unrealistic waste of time and a useless dream of escape. But in his later works, Plato changed his mind about rhetoric, just as Marcuse changed his about the usefulness of utopia as a concept in history. In thePhaedrus, Socrates is in love with the interlocutor in his dialogue, a young man who is intelligent but easily swayed by shows of verbal/symbolic skill and emotional power—the very propagandistic techniques that Marcuse would scrutinize in the need for a reeducation of desire. Socrates, voicing Plato's mature understanding of the function of rhetoric when it is used for the betterment of society, tells the young Phaedrus that “the function of oratory is to influence men's souls.”
               For the wisest of orators, who would be the best of political and cultural leaders, the art of rhetoric is one that is informed by long study of human nature but also by a divine inspiration. The inventor in this type of rhetorical work is possessed with a kind of love, a divine Eros, by which he or she leads the multitudes to the good, tempered by self-control. In effect, he conceives of rhetoric as a kind of erotic love that seeks to persuade the beloved (that is, the audience, whether an individual or the social collective in a state). The function of Plato's rhetoric in the30
            Phaedrus, like Marcuse's and Bloch's function of utopia, is to use imagination and emotion to lead constituents toward belief in a fuller humanity, a true expression of the good in human nature.<br>

Abstract: If the Utopian breaks down upon its contact with material history, then perhaps by inscribing—and, more importantly, integrating—its antithesis and its own absurdity within itself (as indeed More's
         Utopialiterally—by the argument of its first part—does), it might achieve a balance and a self-awareness sufficient to sustain it beyond the moment of its conception, the revolutionary or revelatory moment, and to translate its abstraction into the very materiality, the physical placedness, that had originally threatened to extinguish it.Finnegans Wakemay be a dream—but it is a cyclic one: one from which the reader can never awake, yet within which its ownwaking-fromis already inscribed and therefore preempted. Yet does this Viconian cyclicity refute the possibility of Utopia? Utopian historicity is necessarily progressive and teleological, rather than endlessly cyclic. But it seems that these two positions might be reconciled if we view the cycle itself as dynamically Utopian, rather than any single point in that cycle—the divine, heroic, democratic, or chaotic—as a necessary end point, a stereotypically static Utopia.<br>
