  Author(s) CARPENTER EDMUND<br>
  Abstract: ʺExistence is elsewhere,ʺ wrote André Breton and pointed to the reintroduction of dream into everyday life, toward ʺthe future resolution of these two states, dream and reality, which are seemingly so contradictory, into a kind of absolute reality, a surrealityʺ (The First Surrealist Manifesto, 1924). A projection of Surrealist yearning, the idea of a process, an ʺact of dreamingʺ by which ʺthe mind makes contact with whatever mystery it is that connects the Dreaming [the Eternal Dream Time] and the Here and Now,ʺ is fundamental to mythic thought throughout the world and is at its most developed in the traditions<br>

  Book Title: A Dream Denied-Incarceration, Recidivism, and Young Minority Men in America<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Soyer Michaela<br>
  Abstract: Young minority men are often portrayed in popular media as victims of poverty and discrimination.
      A Dream Denieddelves deeper, investigating the social and cultural implications of the "American dream" narrative for young minority men in the juvenile justice systems in Boston and Chicago. This book connects young male offenders' cycles of desistance and recidivism with normative assumptions about success and failure in American society, exposing a tragic disconnect between structural reality and juvenile justice policy. This book challenges us to reconsider how American society relates to its most vulnerable members, how it responds to their personal failures, and how it promises them a better future.<br>

  Abstract: While they were held in detention facilities or treatment centers, most teenagers expressed an inflated sense of agency. Relying on the cultural narrative of the “American Dream,” they believed in their ability to desist from crime, even if the odds were stacked against them. Criminologists often overlook the role agency plays in the desistance process. Structural conditions can be measured and quantified reliably. Operationalizing agency is more difficult. Direct observations of criminal acts are ethically dubious. Even if researchers were able to witness a crime in the making, it would be impossible to generalize from isolated instances. Although agency manifests<br>

  Abstract: Canto XIX of the

A survey of its critical history reveals, moreover, that readers have been attracted largely by one element, that of the dream of the siren with which the canto begins. The account of the pilgrim’s dream, however, occupies only nine tercets, or twenty-seven verses out of a total of 145. Even if we include in the episode the two introductory tercets that afford a temporal orientation, as well as the dreamer’s awakening to Virgil’s call and the latter’s explanation of the dream experience,<br>

  Abstract: The most effective way to appreciate the importance of place again is not to approach it as a total phenomenon, to compare its virtues en bloc to those of space in a single systematic treatment. Such a totalizing treatment would lead to nothing but vacant generalities. What is needed is a new and quite particular

  Abstract: Late at night on November 23–24, 1654, in his chambers on the rue des Francs-Bourgeois Saint-Michel, Blaise Pascal experienced something momentous. A spiritual ecstasy, a dream-vision, a psychotic episode, a premonition of his own mortality: one or all these things, Pascal’s

  Abstract: In response to a question put to Jacques Derrida by Elizabeth Clark, one of America’s leading historians of early Christianity, about the relevance of deconstruction for history, Derrida said what we would expect him to say, that historians must constantly question their assumptions about history and stay open to other concepts of history and of historiography, and that is where deconstruction can help. But the first thing he said was unexpected: “I dream of being a historian.” He expressed his feeling that, in a way, ever since

  Book Title: The Tears of Sovereignty: Perspectives of Power in Renaissance Drama-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): LORENZ PHILIP<br>
  Abstract: A comparative study of the representation of sovereignty in paradigmatic plays of early modernity, The Tears of Sovereignty argues that the great playwrights of the period--William Shakespeare, Lope de Vega, and Calderon de la Barca--reconstitute the metaphors through which contemporary theorists continue to conceive the problems of sovereignty. The book focuses in particular on the ways the logics of these metaphors inform sovereignty's conceptualization as a "body of power." Each chapter is organized around a key tropological operation performed on that "body," from the analogical relations invoked in Richard II, through the metaphorical transfers staged in Measure for Measure to the autoimmune resistances they produce in Lope's Fuenteovejuna, and, finally, the allegorical returns of Calderon's Life is a Dream and Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale. The "tears" of sovereignty are the exegetical tropes produced and performed on the English stages and Spanish corrales of the seventeenth century through which we continue to view sovereignty today.<br>

  Abstract: The representational shift, into the allegorical figures of the cipher and the image (
                  cifras y estampas) staged inLife Is a Dream, appears to provide us with one form of an ending. By the time we arrive at Calderón’s dream play, the effects of sovereignty’s rupture from the King’s body, staged in Shakespeare’sRichard II, could be said to be complete. Sovereignty, inLife Is a Dream, no longer speaks through—at least the human—body at all. Nor does it even seem to require the law, or that the bodies subject to its force signify its presence, as in<br>

It begins with patterns and unities, with change and possibility, with transgression and impertinence. Metaphor makes us what we are. It is how we got here.

  Book Title: The Executed God-The Way of the Cross in Lockdown America<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Taylor Mark Lewis<br>
  Abstract: The new edition of Mark Lewis Taylor’s award-winning The Executed God is both a searing indictment of the structures of “Lockdown America" and a visionary statement of hope. It is also a call for action to Jesus followers to resist US imperial projects and power. Outlining a “theatrics of state terror," Taylor identifies and analyzes its instruments—mass incarceration, militarized police tactics, surveillance, torture, immigrant repression, and capital punishment—through which a racist and corporatized Lockdown America enforces in the US a global neoliberal economic and political imperialism. Against this, The Executed God proposes a “counter-theatrics to state terror," a declamation of the way of the cross for Jesus followers that unmasks the powers of US state domination and enacts an adversarial politics of resistance, artful dramatic actions, and the building of peoples’ movements. These are all intrinsic to a Christian politics of remembrance of the Jesus executed by empire. Heralded in its first edition, this new edition is thoroughly revised, updated, and expanded, offering a demanding rethinking and recreating of what being a Christian is and of how Christianity should dream, hope, mobilize, and act to bring about what Taylor terms “a liberating material spirituality" to unseat the state that kills.<br>

  Book Title: Nowhere in the Middle Ages-  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): LOCHRIE KARMA<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on a range of contemporary scholarship on utopianism and a broad premodern archive, Lochrie charts variant utopian strains in medieval literature and philosophy that diverge from More's work and at the same time plot uncanny connections with it. Examining works such as Macrobius's fifth-century
      Commentary on the Dream of Scipio,Mandeville's Travels, and William Langland'sPiers Plowman, she finds evidence of a number of utopian drives, including the rejection of European centrality, a desire for more egalitarian politics, and a rethinking of the division between animals and humans.Nowhere in the Middle Agesinsists on the relevance and transformative potential of medieval utopias for More's work and positions the sixteenth-century text as one alternative in a broader historical phenomenon of utopian thinking. Tracing medieval utopianisms forward in literary history to reveal their influences on early modern and modern literature and philosophy, Lochrie demonstrates that looking backward, we might extend future horizons of utopian thinking.<br>

  Abstract: Psychoanalysis may be viewed (following suggestions by Paul Ricoeur [1970] in

This hermeneutics is, however, never simple since desire is constitutionally conflicted, divided, deflected, and disguised. Thus desire is never only or primarily what it seems. it is constitutionally enigmatic. it is this that necessitates something like a science of desire, an analytics of desire.<br>

  Abstract: People’s relations with signs in Java, the degree to which they are master of or subject to them, at once indicate and determine their potency. This assumption about the relationship between self and Signs has important consequences for Javanese epistemology. Exegesis of wayang exemplifies these consequences, and I will take it as a starting point for a more general discussion of Javanese interpretation. My point is that, like speech, the signs that are an art form, a tract of ngèlmu, or a dream, all pose a challenge to a person’s autonomy, a challenge to which modes of interpretation are the<br>

Moving slowly toward their conceptualizations of love and heroism, Esposito unravels the West's illusory metaphysical dream of peace, obliging us to reevaluate ceaselessly what it means to be responsible in the wake of past and contemporary forms of war.<br>

  Abstract: In beginning an overview of dreaming we could do worse than return to the nineteenth-century dream phenomenologists—who at least knew what later laboratory researchers and clinicians I I have forgotten, that description and classification are primary in science. DuPrel, Schemer, and Saint-Denys anticipated recent rating systems of dream bizarreness by calling attention to the positive and negative sides of dreaming. Dreaming tends always toward a delirium syndrome, but the corresponding impairment of verbal-reflective thinking allows a positive release of visual-spatial metaphor and intuition, the frames or modules of mind that are based on a relative simultaneity of expression.

We can think of Cardinal Newman’s eloquent essay on the “Idea of a University” (1852) in which he drew the line between a purely professional education and a “universitary” one, that is, a “gentlemanly” and gratuitous formation of the mind by the synthesis of values and fundamental knowledge, a mind that could in turn be used everywhere and anyhow.¹ Three quarters of a century later Friedrich Gundolf explained wittily how Shakespeare’s

  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nylund Anastasia<br>
  Abstract: Narratives are fundamental to our lives: we dream, plan, complain, endorse, entertain, teach, learn, and reminisce through telling stories. They provide hopes, enhance or mitigate disappointments, challenge or support moral order and test out theories of the world at both personal and communal levels. It is because of this deep embedding of narrative in everyday life that its study has become a wide research field including disciplines as diverse as linguistics, literary theory, folklore, clinical psychology, cognitive and developmental psychology, anthropology, sociology, and history. In
      Telling Storiesleading scholars illustrate how narratives build bridges among language, identity, interaction, society, and culture; and they investigate various settings such as therapeutic and medical encounters, educational environments, politics, media, marketing, and public relations. They analyze a variety of topics from the narrative construction of self and identity to the telling of stories in different media and the roles that small and big life stories play in everyday social interactions and institutions. These new reflections on the theory and analysis of narrative offer the latest tools to researchers in the fields of discourse analysis and sociolinguistics.<br>

  Book Title: Translating Life-Studies in Transpositional Aesthetics<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): STEAD ALISTAIR<br>
  Abstract: This volume brings together eighteen substantial essays by distinguished scholars, critics and translators, and two interviews with eminent figures of British theatre, to explore the idea and practice of translation. The individual, but conceptually related, contributions examine topics from the Renaissance to the present in the context of apt exploration of the translation process, invoking both restricted and extended senses of translation. The endeavour is to study in detail the theory, workings and implications of what might be called the art of creative transposition, effective at the level of interlingual transcoding, dynamic rewriting, theatrical and cinematic adaptation, intersemiotic or intermedial translation, and cultural exchange. Many of the essays focus on aspects of intertextuality, the dialogue with text, past and present, as they bear on the issue of translation, attending to the historical, political or cultural dimensions of the practice, whether it illuminates a gendered reading of a text or a staging of cultural difference. The historic and generic range of the discussions is wide, encompassing the Elizabethan epyllion, Sensibility fiction, Victorian poetry and prose, modern and postmodern novels, but the book is dominated by dramatic or performance-related applications, with major representation of fresh investigations into Shakespeare (from A Midsummer Night’s Dream to The Tempest) and foregrounding of acts of self-translation on stage, in the dramatic monologue and in fiction. Contributions from theatre practitioners such as Sir Peter Hall, John Barton and Peter Lichtenfels underscore the immense practical importance of the translator on the stage and the business of both acting and directing as a species of translation.<br>

  Abstract: Shakespeare’s response to the Tudor separation of styles is deeply ambivalent. On one hand, as his career ripened, he perfected what Marlowe had begun, producing a supple and evocative blank verse after a remarkably short time and creating a decorous stratification of style that mirrors the social standing of its speakers, with particularly brilliant effect in
                  Midsummer Night’s Dream. The only play Shakespeare wrote that contains no audibly distinguishable low-life characters at all isTroilus and Cressida, which is his purest expression of satire in the innovative humanist manner.

  Abstract: In the mid-1960s, while writing what would be the first full-length study of Bishop’s poetry, Anne Stevenson sent Bishop a rough outline of the book’s chapters. In it, Stevenson likens Bishop to “the surrealists and the symbolists too,” proposing that, like “Klee and Ernst,” she uses a great deal of “hallucinatory and dream material” in the belief that “there is no split personality, but rather a sensitivity that extends equally into the sub-conscious and the conscious world” (Stevenson, “Letter”).

  Abstract: SURREALISM IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE to twentieth-century culture because of its fruitful efforts both to restore poetic wholeness to a daily reality which had been fragmented and impoverished by nineteenth century positivistic and instrumental attitudes and to reinstate the imagination as the distinctive attribute of human existence.³ The surrealists’ quest to reconcile the seemingly contradictory states of “reality” and “dream” in a poetic state of
                  surreality⁴is powerfully embodied by their urban texts, epitomized by André Breton’sNadjaandL’amour fou, and Louis Aragon’sLe paysan de Paris.⁵These writings are of great interest to anyone thinking about the nature<br>

  Abstract: The Joseph of the book of Genesis is both a dreamer and dream-reader, and even the briefest page-through of his tale suggests that the latter is more useful—certainly more lucrative—than the former. In his early life, Joseph dreams two big dreams, the grasping subconscious desire of which is obvious—and offensive—to all those around him: one night, he dreams that his brothers’ sheaves of wheat bow down to his sheaf, and another night, he dreams that the sun, moon, and eleven stars bow down to him.

  Book Title: Soul-Black Power, Politics, and Pleasure<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Green Richard C.<br>
  Abstract: No other word in the English language is more endemic to contemporary Black American culture and identity than "Soul". Since the 1960s Soul has been frequently used to market and sell music, food, and fashion. However, Soul also refers to a pervasive belief in the capacity of the Black body/spirit to endure the most trying of times in an ongoing struggle for freedom and equality. While some attention has been given to various genre manifestations of Soul-as in Soul music and food-no book has yet fully explored the discursive terrain signified by the term. In this broad-ranging, free-spirited book, a diverse group of writers, artists, and scholars reflect on the ubiquitous but elusive concept of Soul. Topics include: politics and fashion, Blaxploitation films, language, literature, dance, James Brown, and Schoolhouse Rock. Among the contributors are Angela Davis, Manning Marable, Paul Gilroy, Lyle Ashton Harris, Michelle Wallace, Ishmael Reed, Greg Tate, Manthia Diawara, and dream hampton.<br>

  Abstract: Europe did not discover America, but America was quite a discovery for Europe. For roughly three centuries before the American Revolution, the ideas that made the American Revolution possible were being discovered, nurtured and embellished in the growing English and French colonies of North America. America provided a counterpoint for European convention and assumption. It became, for Europeans in America, at once a dream and a reality, a fact and a fantasy, the real and the ideal. To appreciate the way in which European eyes opened on the ‘new world’, we must take the phrase literally, with the excitement<br>

It might be problematised thus: if the psychic mechanism is compelled to repeat, can any of its intellections be considered as thought or cogitation, as opposed to Pavlovian reaction? The compulsion to repeat is one – perhaps the arch – element making the psychic mechanism mechanical, hence the structural role it plays, and consequently its tolerance of<br>

That “noble dream,” as Peter Novick described this quest in an important volume some fifteen years ago, reflects for many historians a quaint legacy of romantic positivism, the failure to recognize how facts and historical truths are accessible only through creative acts of imagination.¹ The issues here are complicated. They range from whether the kinds of presuppositions historians bring to their research necessarily affect their determination of what is “factual,”<br>

In dreamtime, an embodied image can be experienced on a somatic level with a wide variety of possible manifestations. These physical responses of<br>

It was the dream of a world where there is no territory without sovereignty, in other words, no one distanced from the rules of the state (Thompson 1994; Anderson 1997).

  Book Title: The Awakened Ones-Phenomenology of Visionary Experience<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Obeyesekere Gananath<br>
  Abstract: Throughout his career, Obeyesekere has combined psychoanalysis and anthropology to illuminate the relationship between personal symbolism and religious experience. In this book, he begins with Buddha's visionary trances wherein, over the course of four hours, he witnesses hundreds of thousands of his past births and eons of world evolution, renewal, and disappearance. He then connects this fracturing of empirical and visionary time to the realm of space, considering the experience of a female Christian penitent, who stares devotedly at a tiny crucifix only to see the space around it expand to mirror Christ's suffering. Obeyesekere follows the unconscious motivations underlying rapture, the fantastical consumption of Christ's body and blood, and body mutilation and levitation, bridging medieval Catholicism and the movements of early modern thought as reflected in William Blake's artistic visions and poetic dreams. He develops the term "dream-ego" through a discussion of visionary journeys, Carl Jung's and Sigmund Freud's scientific dreaming, and the cosmic and erotic dream-visions of New Age virtuosos, and he defines the parameters of a visionary mode of knowledge that provides a more elastic understanding of truth. A career-culminating work, this volume translates the epistemology of Hindu and Buddhist thinkers for western audiences while revitalizing western philosophical and scientific inquiry.<br>

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Duke Michael S.<br>
  Abstract: From Ying-shih Yü's perspective, the
      Dao, or the Way, constitutes the inner core of Chinese civilization. His work explores the unique dynamics between Chinese intellectuals' discourse on theDao, or moral principles for a symbolized ideal world order, and their criticism of contemporary reality throughout Chinese history. Volume 2 ofChinese History and Culturecompletes Ying-shih Yü's systematic reconstruction and exploration of Chinese thought over two millennia and its impact on Chinese identity. Essays address the rise of Qing Confucianism, the development of the Dai Zhen and Zhu Xi traditions, and the response of the historian Zhang Xuecheng to the Dai Zhen approach. They take stock of the thematic importance of Cao Xueqin's eighteenth-century masterpieceHonglou meng(Dream of the Red Chamber) and the influence of Sun Yat-sen'sThree Principles of the People, as well as the radicalization of China in the twentieth century and the fundamental upheavals of modernization and revolution. Ying-shih Yü also discusses the decline of elite culture in modern China, the relationships among democracy, human rights, and Confucianism, and changing conceptions of national history. He reflects on the Chinese approach to history in general and the larger political and cultural function of chronological biographies. By situating China's modern encounter with the West in a wider historical frame, this second volume ofChinese History and Cultureclarifies its more curious turns and contemplates the importance of a renewed interest in the traditional Chinese values recognizing common humanity and human dignity.<br>

  Abstract: Germania Death in Berlin (1956/1971), together with The Battle (1951/1974), Life of Gundling Lessing’s Sleep Dream Cry (1977), and Germania 3 Ghosts at the Dead Man (1995), testifies to Heiner Müller’s intense occupation with German history, particularly the history of violence. The play, which consists of thirteen miscellaneously interrelated scenes, generates a certain politics of enmity—a politics whose poetic itinerary has neither an evident beginning nor an end. We thus may well begin in the middle of the play, in a scene titled “Hommage à Stalin 1,” and we shall, for the time being, “imagine” (vorstellen) “Snow. Battle noise.<br>

  Book Title: The Total Work of Art in European Modernism-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Roberts David<br>
  Abstract: In this groundbreaking book, David Roberts sets out to demonstrate the centrality of the total work of art to European modernism since the French Revolution. The total work of art is usually understood as the intention to reunite the arts into the one integrated whole, but it is also tied from the beginning to the desire to recover and renew the public function of art. The synthesis of the arts in the service of social and cultural regeneration was a particularly German dream, which made Wagner and Nietzsche the other center of aesthetic modernism alongside Baudelaire and Mallarmé.<br>

  Abstract: In chapter 1 the concept of the sublime in politics or the political sublime was introduced in relation to the founding moment of political modernity: the dissolution of institutions and the return of the social to its origins in the French Revolution. This is the abyss of political foundation, as theorized by Marc Richir: the liminal experience of the passage from the old world of absolutism to a new world, in which the utopian image of community emerged as in a dream from the anarchy of liberty, equality, and fraternity. This dream experience, this popular enthusiasm, constitutes for Richir the<br>

  Abstract: A small detour is necessary to mark the developments Schmidt underwent before

The remark hints at Schmidt’s increasing interest in the dream as a literary means of representation and as a subjective demonstration of personal experiences. The small essay “Traumkunstwerke,” also written in 1956, documents Schmidt’s fascination with the interrelation of literary texts and dreams.¹ In his discussion of Fouqué, the English critic, poet, and philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834), and E.

Abstract: I point to the similarities between Haraway’s cyborg theory and theories of several other poststructuralists in order to suggest that there is nothing inherently subversive for feminism about such theorizing unless the theory can be shown to have specific, material, and located ramifications (a fact Haraway seems to have partially recognized in
         Modest_Witness[1997a], which I will briefly discuss at the end of this essay). Indeed, as Susan Bordo suggests, the epistemologicaljouissancesuggested by the image of the cyborg denies locatedness and fantasizes itself as a postmodern “dream of everywhere” (1990, 136, 144–45).10Here it is important to distinguish betweenlocatednessand a simple celebration of thelocalas endless possibility. I am not advocating what Manuel Castells (1997) describes as a defensive and retrenched localism (manifested most disturbingly in the “not in my backyard” ideal) in the face of globalization as a basis for feminist identity but rather a relationship to materiality and sociopolitical specificity as a basis for theorizing, much in the manner of Castells’s own analyses (1997, 61–62). In arguing for a relationship to locatedness, I am taking a stance about critical responsibility in a postcolonial world. As third‐world environmentalists such as Vandana Shiva (1997) and subaltern studies historians have demonstrated, policies and political concepts of postcolonial nations cannot be understood through universal (read: Western) concepts alone, even though local concepts need to be related to the global. Witness Shiva’s call for international legal ecological policies based on an understanding of indigenous knowledges and Partha Chatterjee’s (1986) critique of the Western idea of nation as inapplicable to postcolonial countries. In the United States, critical race theorists have argued for what legal theorist Richard Delgado (1995) terms thecall to context, which challenges the traditional juridical preference for universalism over particu~<br>

Abstract: Here, the implied moral “tension” may be compared, by way of illustration, to Sigmund Freud’s rather narrower interpretive hermeneutical “tension” between the active ego and the passivity of the id and the superego. Just as psychological health arises from a productive “working through” of conflicts and repressions at the dynamic intersection of consciousness and the unconscious (in such ongoing practices as dream interpretation, psychoanalytic catharsis, and superego sublimation), so also in moral life may intersubjective and historical tensions move the self toward previously unformed and even cathartic meaning in relation to others. Social, relational, historical, and cultural “tension”—a term that comes from the Latin
         tensioor “stretching”—is a condition for the possibility of moral identity and meaning in the first place. The human moral “desire to be” is realized through an original, unavoidable, restless, and indeed apparently infinite innovation and working through of new social relations.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: So if those letters Boz bought so cheap aren't up to his standards, why doesn't the great writer rewrite them himself, compress my ramblings, make 'em tell—isn't that the phrase? They'd tell, that's for sure, tell too much. Why am I brought back as a curse and a scourge—and then given no words to curse with? And even what leaks is lies. There's Flintwinch talking about me to his mistress, how “she had been always writing, incessantly writing—mainly letters of confession to you, and Prayers for forgiveness.” Never, never a one. No repentance. Just pent-up hate. And after all this, will that trunk of my letters never be produced? Will my secret be trapped away in the asylum of Affery's mind, where it will all seem like a dream anyway?<br>

Abstract: One such case of self‐betrayal occurs in the often‐cited episode of the trees of Hudimesnil. Riding on the carriage of Mme de Villeparisis, Marcel feels an unexplainable happiness at the sight of three trees; yet, try hard as he may, he cannot find a reason to his happiness. These trees, so strangely familiar, are perhaps a memory from childhood or from a dream, or a cryptic epiphany, or just an optical impression owing to eye fatigue. They seem to be asking of Marcel that he “return them to life”; he recognizes in their “naïve and passionate gesticulations the impotent regret of a dear person who, having lost the usage of words, feels he cannot tell us what we are unable to guess.” Having failed repeatedly to identify the source of his emotion, Marcel gives up puzzling over it, and at that precise moment he feels “as if he had just lost a friend,
            died to himself, denied a dead person, or misidentified a god.” Proust,À l’ombre des jeunes filles en fleursII, 568–69; my emphasis.<br>

Abstract: The tensions between remembrance and love that are etched into our mortality and our vitality and that structure social worlds are the hermeneutical key for the thoughts that follow. They enable us to ponder the double entendre of my title because these tensions link humanism and reflection on the religions. The following pages seek to unfold these tensions on the way to showing the importance responsibility and also the integrity of life have for current theological ethics. Yet at this juncture please note that we have also isolated a possible danger buried in our university’s motto. Is the quest for and pretense of ever‐increasing knowledge actually aimed at overcoming finite limits, the triumph of the will to power, under the dream of absolute knowledge? Is this motto, ironically, a slogan of bondage to illusion and futility? Can it be seen otherwise within a vision and hope of renewed life and responsible freedom? I shall take up those questions at the conclusion of this lecture since they open constructive reflection on the purpose of humanistic inquiry and religious studies.<br>

Author(s): Andrew Dudley<br>
Abstract: The first two contributions to
         The Oxford Handbook of Film and Media Studiesestablish the potential rivalry of film and media in the entertainment world and, by implication, its academic study. Jay Bolter, coauthor of the seminalRemediation(1999), opens the volume by clearly drawing, then intertwining, two lines that might distinguish film among the media.62Film was the first in a series of technological media aiming for transparency, whereby the spectator would feel copresent with what is displayed. An inevitable delay in its projection may thwart this dream of perceptual immediacy, but narrative integration restores it on a different plane. By the time of D. W. Griffith, spectators could feel themselves englobed by the fictional world on the screen, participating in it. Today, video games make good on cinema's promise, on both levels. Player interaction with the screen functionally instantiates the present tense of the game's display, while quasicinematic plots extend what is onscreen across an entire fictional world (Grand Theft Autois Bolter's example). He concludes on a generous note, celebrating the diversity of available entertainment, from auratic and authored narrative films to interactive internet games, while indicating the many crossovers between these (such as interactive features on the DVDs of some feature films).63To study cinema today, he implies, one must become a media studies scholar.<br>

Abstract: I would like to conclude by noting that, of course, Coleridge’s poetry offers a particularly concrete representation of the struggles—linguistic, volitional, and existential—that surround the experience of prayer.
         70The verbal paralysis that seizes the Ancient Mariner would be the most obvious and illustrious example:
               While the Mariner does, of course, pass beyond this crisis of language, one must note that release occurs only after he is able to render a strange wordless and volitionless blessing, a kind of secret arche‐prayer that allows further ones to be made: “I blessed them unaware” (line 285). While I would hesitate to map the theory of later decades onto much earlier poems, this is nonetheless a fine representation of Coleridge’s enduring faith that even where “no tongue … may declare” (lines 282–83), something may also be happening, perhaps working wordlessly against language, to bring about being‐for‐God. Moreover, the same juxtaposition of a struggle to enunciate prayer with a corresponding imaginative turn to the wordless also features in many of Coleridge’s private lyrics. For instance, the sonnet “When they did greet me Father” expresses an inability to pray predicated on a lack of receptivity and response to the divine, evoking speech that cannot become speech and words that will not come: “Th’ unquiet silence of confused thought” (line 7). It is signifiers that mark the limits of language—tears and groans—that stand in for what cannot be uttered here and that conclude the poem. “The Pains of Sleep” also expresses a preference for wordless prayer—“No wish conceived, no thought exprest” (line 8)—but, in its latter stanzas, depicts a spiritual desolation that demands a more concrete form of utterance and appeal. Yet the speaker’s attempts to pray aloud are marked by “anguish and … agony” (line 14), and the precant’s voice, like his corrupted will, is alienated from itself: “My own loud scream / Had waked me from the fiendish drea~<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: Gauchet's is a decidedly “political history of religion” that attaches paramount importance to the state. The rise of this “sacral transforming agent” imposed the otherness that once characterized the gods of the first religions on and in society. As a result, the divine appeared ever more remote as an “organizing principle,” and humans were left in a position to “reappropriate” the world. This theologico-political transformation ushered in a long procession of events culminating in the emergence of Christianity, the religion that functioned as a theological conduit for departing from religion. The final act of Gauchet's passion play of the sacred unfolds during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with the Protestant and Catholic Reformations and the rise of political absolutism; the former enshrined the freedom of the conscience, while the latter completed the process of cleaving the terrestrial from the divine sphere. Ultimately, individuals came to assert themselves in the void left by a transcendent divinity: “God's greatness, taken to the highest level, puts humans on an equal footing with the mystery of creation and validates their independence as cognitive subjects.” The appearance of the modern individual and the modern state signaled the completion of what Gauchet calls a “revolution in transcendence,” predicated on human reoccupation of the space once entirely controlled by the divine. Nevertheless, the self's past alienation from its origins was not simply overcome but instead transferred to psychological, social, and political dualities that persist both within and among individual selves. As Gauchet observes, “Leaving religion is not like waking from a dream. We originated in religion, we continue to explain ourselves through it, and always will.”

Abstract: In general, Western thought privileges actuality over possibility in its conception of being. In order to avoid leaving this as an empty and general observation, it is important to note that what is granted actuality by this privilege depends upon the elaborations of what such priority indicates, of course, but the priority of actuality seems to leave possibility as a derivative concept, a shadow or dream of what might be. The significance of Agamben’s examination of the political and sovereignty rests on this privilege granted to actuality over possibility.<br>

Abstract: That is the question the film raises explicitly, through its main character. But Charlie's question drags behind it another question,
         Kaufman'squestion, no longer explicit but equally inescapable. Why would anyonewantto make a movie simply about flowers? Why on earth would Columbia Studios so much as dream that the right thing to do with a (nonfiction) book about orchids is to turn it into a major motion picture? Why does Charlie (or Kaufman, for that matter) accept the challenge, rather than laughing at its patent absurdity? The answer is, I think, what I mentioned a little earlier: our culture is obsessed with narrative. No one today would look at paintings of orchids, let alone read sonnets about them, and not many would even watch a documentary about orchids and their hunters. (It is a measure of just how deeply the obsession runs that many viewers sit through the entirety ofAdaptationwithout the question ever occurring to them; they focus on Charlie's failure, as though the idea of transformingThe Orchid Thiefinto a feature-length Hollywood film were a perfectly reasonable one.) Charlie is forced to make a movie because movies are what we are willing to pay attention to—movies, not poems, let alone flowers themselves. The cost, however, is the introduction of narrative into a domain where none belongs.5<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: In contrast to the riddling texts that use Faustus's body and that demand interpretation, “this show,” although allegorical in the morality tradition, here means “nothing.” It demands no interpretation, no deferral of significance, no acknowledgment of transcendence. It is all surface. The “crowns” and the “rich apparel” that the devils give Faustus emblematize the attention to materials and to outsides that characterizes both life in hell and a certain kind of disinterested aestheticism which in this context functions only to deceive. Over and over, Mephistopheles tricks Faustus into believing that the shows conjured up in the theater of hell's delights find their ends in the enjoyment of their own performance. Perhaps his most telling trick is to seem to make “music” (2.3.30) with Amphion simply to provide “sweet pleasure” (2.3.25) to Faustus. Amphion along with Orpheus usually exemplifies the dream of an instrumental aesthetics, a beauty that can pacify beasts and even compel rocks and stones to organize themselves into cities with its moving sweetness of song. But Mephistopheles makes this sweet pleasure seem inconsequential, as he makes all magic seem inconsequential, as if magic were a production that celebrated only itself, showed only “what magic can perform,” or as if the delight inspired by the spirits personated on stage had no effect. But, of course, there will be an effect, no end of effect, just not yet.<br>

Abstract: The article starts with a metaphoric and rhetorical use of the dream concept and then deals with collective dreams. Borrowing ideas from Freud, Durkheim, and Levi-Strauss, concepts are developed to describe collective dreams, for example, the American Dream. I demonstrate that binary oppositions, such as Durkheim's “sacred versus profane” distinction, structure collective dreams. Different forms of symbolic operation are described.<br>

Author(s): Miller Keith D.<br>
Abstract: Even though Martin Luther King, Jr. constantly cited the Bible, no one has seriously examined his rhetoric as biblical hermeneutic. Here I argue that in "I Have a Dream," King explodes closed memories of the Exodus by reconceptualizing a hermeneutic of (Second) Isaiah as he interprets African-Americans' experience of oppression and exile in Babylon/America and their hope for a new Exodus. Drawing on African-American political rhetoric, King spotlights biblical writers' dialogue with each other and extends the arc of biblical narrative into the present. He also anticipates certain forms of liberation theology of the 1970s and beyond.<br>

Publisher: The University of Nebraska Press<br>
Issue: i23535689<br>
Date: 7 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Gordon Rae Beth<br>
Abstract: "La dérive d'une vie," that of the hero in En rade, is metaphorized by the dérive of narrative, composed of a complex network of metaphors. In 1893, Paul Souriau proposed that metaphor makes a fleeting representation pass into the unconscious. Dreams and hysteria, states in which the unconscious holds sway, are of considerable importance in this text. An analysis of the way that metaphor works will shed light on the relationships between dream and reality, and between consciousness and the unconscious in general. The double fil of extended metaphor is also metaphorized as a bifurcating road, the road of narrative and the labyrinthine path the hero's thoughts take. In fact, route or chemin is not only a metaphor for the text and for extended metaphor itself, but also for the complex pathways of the nerves and brain. If the road or path of narrative is also a representation of nerves/brain, then retracing these pathways of metaphors would be a way of following the text's attempt to dissect the brain and uncover the links between dream and reality, the double sphere of activity that characterizes this novel.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917895<br>
Date: 9 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Ward Bruce K.<br>
Abstract: The contemporary philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, has characterized the dominant trend in modern interpretative thought as the 'school of suspicion', whose most significant 'masters' are Freud and Nietzsche. For them, to seek meaning—whether in a text, dream, discourse, or institution—is, first and foremost, to suspect 'truth as lying'. It is my contention that Ricoeur could well have named Dostoevsky as a third master of this modern school of interpretation, for he, too, was preoccupied with exploring the possibility of 'truth as lying', whether to others or to oneself. The general concern of my essay is to clarify Dostoevsky's relation to the modern 'hermeneutics of suspicion' in a manner which is mutually illuminating. The particular focus is on Dostoevsky's hermeneutics of suspicion as employed in The Brothers Karamazov, especially with the object of deciphering the avowed 'love of humanity' which motivates Ivan Karamazov's famous 'rebellion' against God. Ivan's humanism is highly ambiguous, as his words and actions (of omission and commission) throughout the novel demonstrate. I attempt to show that the ambiguity of Ivan Karamazov can be illumined as an exercise of suspicion on Dostoevsky's part which distinguishes between the manifest sources of Ivan's moral stance and what is in reality its hidden basis. And, in order to situate Dostoevsky in relation to the modern 'school of suspicion', his interpretation of the ambiguous text of modern humanism is compared with that of Nietzsche. The dialogue which the essay sets up between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky on the problem embodied by Ivan Karamazov reveals areas of convergence and divergence: the former apparent in a shared suspicion of a secular humanism which affirms the love of humanity apart from religious faith; and the latter apparent in their different understandings of love—whether of humanity or of God. The comparison between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, then, highlights the distinction between a hermeneutics of sus~<br>

Issue: i23917928<br>

Author(s): Bouchard Larry D.<br>
Abstract: Tragedy depicts harm to integrity—personal, moral, bodily, even the integrity of nature—and so offers occasions for rethinking the idea of integrity. These occasions may prompt us to set aside notions of pristine wholeness, moral perfection, and solitary authenticity for a more relational integrity, informed by the paradigms of performance and kenosis. This essay first juxtaposes King Lear with a film by Kristian Levring, The King Is Alive, and then moves to Shakespeare's earlier A Midsummer Night's Dream. All three works are metatheatrical, and depict people playing-as-others in solicitude for others. Each in its way broaches the ethical and theological possibility of 'kenotic integrity'.<br>

Abstract: The author argues that Casanova's journey to Venice constitutes not only a physical journey, but also an inner quest that brings significant insights. A close analysis of the dream sequence as a condensed version of the novella's plot reveals the protagonist's disillusionment with the obsolete public persona in which he is trapped, a reluctant recognition of an inner void, and a paralysis in his futile pursuit of a new identity, qualities which capture the fin-desiècle Viennese Weltanschauung.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo reflecte sobre o significado critico dos conceitos de tradição e preconceito, noções fundamentias da filosofia hermeneutica de Hans-Georg Gadamer. Visa de forma particular a contestação que o autor faz da moderna redução do sentido da filosofia. Filosofia ou teoria da ciência, eis os termos de uma questão que atravessa o pensamento de Gadamer, desde Verdade e Método, até aos últimos textos. Para o filosofo, na raiz originária do sentido está um modo ôntico de ser, caracterizado pela memória, pelo efeito histórico da tradição e pela necessidade de formação. A razão, que se sabe hoje historica e finita, parte sempre de pressupostos, que marcam a sua basilar inserção na comunidade da palavra já sempre partilhada e nos lembram como é ilusório o sonho iluminista de uma transparência total. /// This article is a reflexion about the critical meaning of the concept of tradition and prejudice in the hermeneutical philosopphy of H.-G. Gadamer. It focuses on Gadamer's protest against the modern reduction of the meaning of philosophy. Philosophy or theory of science are the terms of the question that crosses all of Gadamer's thought, from Wahrheit und Methode until the later works. At the root of meaning is for Gadamer an ontological way of being characterized by memory, the historic effect of tradition and the need of formation. Reason, which we now know as historical and finite, is grounded on presuposed ideas which mark its fundamental insertion in the comunity of the world, already shared, and remind us of how deceptive the iluminist dream of a total transparency actually is.<br>

Abstract: This article constitutes an exploration of Mahmud Darwish's poem, "The Hoopoe," as part of a study on the relationship of myths to culture, in general, and to literature and poetry, in particular. It starts from the hoopoe as a mythical symbol pulling the text in two directions. First, a direction that relates the poem, through time, to the realms of the universe, dream, and poetry, using the language of insinuations and allusions; second, a fictional direction that makes of the the poem-through evocation of previous quest journeys, including texts by Al-Jahiz, Avicenna, Al-Suhrawardi, Al-Hallaj, Aristophanes, and Farid Al-Din Attar-a quest into the depths of the individual and the collective self. Memory, history, and language, culminate in the discovery of the mother-land. Thus, Darwish's poem may be classified as poetry, prose, drama, and epic. It is, in fact, a mixture of all these genres, as well as a literary myth narrating the story of the search for a sacred time-the time of beginnings, and of childhood. /تمثل المقالة حفراﹰ استبطانياﹰ في قصيدة "الهدهد" لمحمود درويش - ضمن بحث في علاقة الأساطير بالثقافة عامة وبالأدب والشعر خاصة - انطلاقاﹰ من الهدهد كرمز أسطوري يتجاذب النص في اتجاهين اثنين: أ- اتجاه جدولي، يصل القصيدة - عبر الزمن - بعالم الكون وعالم المنام وعالم الشعر في لغة اللمح والإشارة٠ ب- اتجاه أفقي قصصي، يجعل من القصيدة - عبر رحلات نموذجية سابقة ومن خلال نصوص حاضرة غائبة للجاحظ، وابن سينا، والسهروردي، والحلاج، وأرسطوفان، وفريد الدين العطار، وغيرهم - رحلة في أعماق الذات الفردية، وفي أعماق الذات الجماعية ذاكرة وتاريخاﹰ٠ تجمع قصيدة درويش بين "الشعر" و"النثر" والمسرحية والملحمة، كما أنها أسطورة أدبية تقص علينا قصة بحث عن زمن مقدس هو زمن البدايات والطفولة٠‬<br>

Abstract: Can one speak of Israelitism in the case of Poland? By asking this question, one runs into the classic difficulty of the universalisation of concepts and to what extent they can be transposed. As a specific method of individualistic integration, French Israelitism pre-supposes a particular organisation of citizenship and society, a dissociation of political and religious categories, as well as a specific articulation of the universal and the particular. This article shows that Israelitism as an idea and a theoretical model entered Judeo-Polish society in the 19th century. Nevertheless, the sociological and political context was radically different from the institutions and public space of the Third Republic and thus limits to the importation of the model were soon reached. All the while drawing its political references from western cultures, the troubled history of Eastern Europe was not structured by the same variables nor by the same historical ruptures. The same words (nation, State, religion) do not have the same meaning; the modes of national and political constructions, particularly between religion and politics, has very little in common with what made French Israelitism possible in the 19th century. In Poland, the paradigm of the Israelite was merely an impossible dream.<br>

Article Title: Dreams and Death<br>
Publisher: Indian Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i40089162<br>
Date: 6 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Visvanathan Susan<br>
Abstract: This paper attempts to compare two lives, that of Ramana Maharshi, the beloved cereberal sage of South India, and Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis. Much has been written on both these individuals, so what this paper does is to focus on affliction as a source of insight about life, detachment, pain, existentialism and coping. By taking narratives which delineate a historical plane on which illness can be coded, I try to understand the anthromorphic nature of suffering and its consequences in these two great lives. Individuals reflect the culture of which they are a part, so what we receive through the narratives which tell us about them is significant in terms of their similarities and their differences. Who authors narratives which we analyse is of utmost significance, and both feminism and narrative analyses looks at social anthropology as benefiting from the question of the writing subject. The Nirvana principle works in Ramana Maharshi's case to create a comfort zone for helping us to think of death as dream, in Freud it works as a comfort zone to cope with existence. Human beings work with ideas in order to evaluate the nature of life and survival, or with death as an attribute which too is natural and part of the order of reality. Paul Ricoeur's work helps me to build a bridge between the two thinkers, Ramana Maharshi and Freud, in terms of the application of the concepts of Eros, Thanatos and Ananke.<br>

Publisher: Beauchesne<br>
Issue: i40117543<br>
Date: 6 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): CRAMPE-CASNABET Michèle<br>
Abstract: Ce double souci s'illustre, semble-t-il, dans la préoccupation constante de Kant de conjuguer les méthodes apagogique et ostensive, d'articuler les textes des Critiques et les écrits sur l'histoire. L'unification d'une genèse idéale et d'une genèse empirique estelle possible ? N'est-elle que le signe d'une exigence théorique impossible à remplir, d'un des derniers rêves de la métaphysique ou d'une conception autre qui s'annoncerait d'une systématique en philosophie ? Even before the « Copernician Revolution » Kant's philosophy aimed at building a system, an architechtonic which would both provide a structural analysis of mental powers and describe their genesis. Is such unification of an ideal genesis and an empirical one possible ? If not, are we faced with the last dream of metaphysics or with a new systematical era in philosophy ?<br>

Abstract: Dans le hiatus entre le langage et la pluralité des langues s'insère le problème de la traduction. D'un autre côté traduire a aussi une signification plus ample, qui couvre la communication entre les hommes et aussi la communication avec soi-même (voir Jakobson, Steiner). Le problème de la traduction est ici abordé du point de vue d'une herméneutique qui dialogue avec les sciences du langage et qui est engagée dans une réflexion sur la condition humaine, finie et charnelle. Si nous savons renoncer au rêve d'une langue unique et d'une traduction parfaite, en partant d'une relecture en termes positifs du récit de Babel, nous pourrons accueillir l'étranger dans la lignée d'une théorie et une pratique de l'hospitalité langagière (Ricœur). D'autre part, même notre quête personnelle d'identité passe par un travail énorme et jamais définitif de traduction, qui coïncide avec l'histoire de nos vies, avec son réseau infini d'actions et de passions et avec le travail du deuil et de la mémoire que cette œuvre exige. In the gap between language and the multiplicity of languages comes the problem of translation. To translate, moreover, also has a wider meaning, which covers both communication between people and communication with oneself (see Jakobson, Steiner). The problem of translation is examined here from the point of view of a hermeneutic that is both in dialogue with the disciplines of language and engaged in reflection on the human condition, which is both finite and corporeal. If we can put aside the dream of a single language and a perfect translation, starting from a re-reading in positive terms of the story of Babel, we can welcome the stranger in accordance with a theory and practice of linguistic hospitality (Ricœur). On the other hand, even our personal search for identity takes place through an enormous and never definitive work of translation, which coincides with our life history, with its infinite network of actions and passions and with the work both of grief ~<br>

Abstract: The frames that Lewis Carroll provided for the two Alice books have largely been ignored, when not simply dismissed, in recent Carroll criticism. Their conventional form and diction may account for this negative response, but examination of their provenance, their function within the structure of the two books, and the artistry evident in the individual frame components indicate how and why the frames are important to our understanding of Carroll's vision and purpose. The frame poems are designed to lead the reader into and away from the central dream tales through a process of lyric transformation and estrangement.<br>

Abstract: Pamela M. Yee is a doctoral candidate and Provost's Fellow in the English department at the University of Rochester. Her research interests include late-medieval romance and dream-visions, confessional narratives, medieval medicine, cognition, psychology, affect theory, trauma studies, and the medical humanities; a secondary strand of her scholarship includes all things Arthurian and a nascent interest in medievalism within pop culture. Her dissertation explores confessional tropes as narrative, dialogic, and patient-centered healing in late Middle English secular literature. She has recently published articles in
            ArthurianaandThe Once and Future Classroom, and has a forthcoming review inMedievally Speaking. In summer 2013, she curated an exhibit titled “Eugène Vinaver's MagnificentMalory” for the Rossell Hope Robbins Library. Her budding interest in Gower studies has resulted in a recent flurry of activity: her co-organizing of the 3rdInternational Congress of the John Gower Society in summer 2014 and her selection by JGS as the graduate student representative for the 2016 John Hurt Fisher Prize Committee. At her home institution, she serves as Assistant Editor of the TEAMS Middle English Texts Series, works as a library assistant for the Robbins Library, contributes to theCamelot Project, and teaches in the Writing, Speaking, and Argument Program.

Abstract: In his essay “The Style of Autobiography”, Jean Starobinski remarks, “One would hardly have sufficient motive to write an autobiography had not some radical change occurred […] conversion, entry into a new life, the operations of Grace”. From the beginning, the traumatic events of Keller's childhood — her loss of sight and hearing around age two — marked her not only as “outsider” and “other” but also as “autobiographer” even before she acquired language. “I can show so little visible proof of living”, Keller confessed. Perhaps for this reason she filled the “white darkness” she lived in with writing — first with finger spelling traced in the hand, then with Braille, and finally with type. While each medium seemed to bring her closer to the dream — her own and her century's — of transparent communication, so each text she produced threatened to turn into a “black box”, an instrument designed to collect and preserve data for analysis following a catastrophic event, but one that inevitably fails to illumine the inner world of Keller's deaf-blindness. This essay explores Keller's dreaming within the black box of writing, following her impossible desire for an “instrument which will show what takes place in the mind when we think”.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: complitstudies.51.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Other poets use endnotes to make visible the constraints that structure their poems, in a mode reminiscent of the Oulipian penchant for texts that thematize or otherwise lay bear their constraints. In four of the poems in
         Lighthead, African American poet Terrance Hayes borrows the form of thepecha kucha, a Japanese business presentation in which “a presenter narrates or riffs on twenty images connected to a single theme for twenty seconds at a time.”
               Hayes directs the reader out of his book and across media to a website (88
            http://www.pechakucha.org/) for more information on the form; and he suggests Googling images of works by African American sculptor Martin Puryear that correspond to “Arbor for Butch.” “Coffin for Head of State” is written “after” the songs of Nigerian musician and composer Fela Kuti; and “Twenty Measures of Chitchat” draws on “conversational fragments.” In one section of “Twenty Measures,” titled “Landscape with Riot,” looting and cannibalism are described as modes of appropriation: “When the house windows were broken, I was one of the people / stepping in, then out again, with boxes and whole registers / of what belonged to me, with dream-swollen jewelry leashed / about my neck, with blood on my shirt and blood on my teeth.”
               The image of the speaker with bloodied teeth, appropriating commodities, appears amended in the following section (“The Imminent Till”) by the statement “Time is the real cannibal.” It is the violence of American racism that is cannibalistic in this portrayal. The title refers to Emmett Till, the fourteen-year-old African American boy from Chicago who was brutally murdered in Mississippi in 1955 for whistling at a white woman:89
            
               Till's body was found in the Tallahatchie River, with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck with barbed wire. His death helped spark the civil rights movement. It inspired dozens of poems (from Langston Hughes to Marilyn ~<br>

Abstract: In the end, Gatsby's dream dies in a manifestation of every man's past, rather than one individual's fate; the conclusion prepares us for a transcendence from an individual fate to a universal one, from a presence to a distance, creating a microcosm of the themes of the entire novel: “the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room” (134). The reader, together with the key characters of the book, travel by car toward the verge of destiny, in the most brilliant prolepsis of the novel: “So we drove toward death through the cooling twilight” (136). The party is over; enter the hangover.<br>

Abstract: According to Ricoeur, this activity of appropriation occurs in a phenomenological, prepublic realm. To link this realm with the public world, I turn briefly to the vocabulary of constitutive rhetoric. In “Constitutive Rhetoric: The Case of the
         Peuple Québécois,” Maurice Charland explains how certain public texts, in addressing individuals as a group before that group actually exists in the extratextual world, can constitute a collective based on identity and oriented toward action. Charland uses the work of Kenneth Burke in order to shift the focus of rhetorical scholars away from “persuasion” and toward “identification” (1987, 133). Charland argues that public texts constitute subjects that didn't previously exist. In this sense, such texts do notpersuadealready existing individuals; they invite individuals to think of themselves in a manner thatentailscertain actions (1987, 134). This conceptualization extends Ricoeur's insights about appropriation and refiguration into the public world of action. Within this formulation, readers or listeners not only imagine themselves in new ways.
               They14
            actas the world of the text invites them to do and in so doing close the gap between mimesis3and mimesis1, between reading and acting. This is the space that needs to be crossed in order to give the straight line between mimesis1and mimesis3its arc and so enable it to form a spiral. A child reading Patterson's book, for instance, might simply dismiss it as a stuffy story about a famous person long dead. Or, the reader may actively engage the narrator's subtle closing exhortation to “make Dr. King's dream his own” (96). Because of “Dr. King's dream,” the reader may speak up when she hears someone employ racial slurs or stereotypes or intervene when a classmate is unjustly punished or bullied. The reader thus acts her way into Dr. King's proposed world and becomes the kind of agent whose actions may in turn inspire others. Her actions may be so ~<br>

Abstract: Like Ricoeur, Shaw invests his ethical capital in enhancing life, not in obeying rules. In the celebrated dream sequence of
         Man and Superman, Shaw includes duty as one of the seven deadly virtues that cause more detriment than benefit. For him, there is no act, however heinous, that some well-intentioned individual has not justified under the rubric of duty. The road to hell, Shaw said famously, is paved with the good intentions of those who in the aftermath of disastrous results defended themselves by claiming that duty compelled them to do what they did. For this reason, his recording angel is not keenly interested in what Kantian precepts individuals have or have not followed. What counts for the celestial Shavian bookkeeper is whether actions make the world better or worse, whether they reduce suffering and increase happiness—with happiness defined as the joy, the wellness, that comes from serving a purpose greater than narrow self-interest. “[C]onduct,” Shaw writes, “must justify itself by its effect upon life and not by its conformity to any rule or ideal.”
               And effecting life, in the sense Shaw understands it, is not a matter of dutifully genuflecting before conventional morality but of asserting the autonomous will, even if it engenders charges of immorality. “[L]ife,” he continues, “consists in the fulfilment of will”33
            
               and not in, as he reiterates in34
            The Sanity of Art, “the fulfilment of a moral law or of the deductions of reason.”
               Even so, Shaw makes it very clear that in crowning the will sovereign he is not championing anarchy. For every sanctioned principle his visionaries disavow, they honor nine. Shaw does not condone recklessness or wild abandon. Before the will sets events in motion, prudence and deliberative judgment, he believes, should prepare the way. He is well aware that we cannot dispense with tradition entirely and reasonably expect society to remain stable. Rat~<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Perhaps the resemblance between rhetorical invention and utopia is best illustrated in Plato's dialogue
         Phaedrus. Plato disparaged rhetoric in his earlier philosophical writings, particularly in theGorgias, where he claims that rhetoric is nothing but flattery; it panders to the public and works only to have power for the moment, by showing off with glamour and stirring up desire. For Plato, rhetoric, like the concept of utopia to most twentieth-century Marxists, was an unrealistic waste of time and a useless dream of escape. But in his later works, Plato changed his mind about rhetoric, just as Marcuse changed his about the usefulness of utopia as a concept in history. In thePhaedrus, Socrates is in love with the interlocutor in his dialogue, a young man who is intelligent but easily swayed by shows of verbal/symbolic skill and emotional power—the very propagandistic techniques that Marcuse would scrutinize in the need for a reeducation of desire. Socrates, voicing Plato's mature understanding of the function of rhetoric when it is used for the betterment of society, tells the young Phaedrus that “the function of oratory is to influence men's souls.”
               For the wisest of orators, who would be the best of political and cultural leaders, the art of rhetoric is one that is informed by long study of human nature but also by a divine inspiration. The inventor in this type of rhetorical work is possessed with a kind of love, a divine Eros, by which he or she leads the multitudes to the good, tempered by self-control. In effect, he conceives of rhetoric as a kind of erotic love that seeks to persuade the beloved (that is, the audience, whether an individual or the social collective in a state). The function of Plato's rhetoric in the30
            Phaedrus, like Marcuse's and Bloch's function of utopia, is to use imagination and emotion to lead constituents toward belief in a fuller humanity, a true expression of the good in human nature.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Meta-Utopian Metatext:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Leopold Bloom, in
         Ulysses, expansively describes the Utopian as affording “no known method from the known to the unknown.”
               Utopia is a place that is impossible to arrive at by any known route, in that it is not really a place at all. It is therefore essential that, in order to reach Utopia, one takes an unknown and unknowable route, a path determined by its indeterminacy, a passage that deconstructs its own rationalistic epistemological foundations. It is only in its paradoxical nature that such a route, beyond sense (which forbids entry into the unreal), might discover the reality of that unreality. For, in the end, despite its fantastical absurdities—its self-conscious nowhereness—Joyce's Dublin, like Butler's Erewhon, is the opposite of nowhere: it is somewhere. It is by inscribing the material (the somewhere) within the dream (the nowhere) that the dream might be sustained; and it is also by inscribing the dream within the real that material existence can continue.166<br>
