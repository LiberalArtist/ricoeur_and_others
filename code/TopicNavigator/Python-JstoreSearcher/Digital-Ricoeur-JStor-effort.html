  Book Title: Enigmas of Sacrifice-A Critique of Joseph M. Plunkett and the Dublin Insurrection of 1916<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Cormack W. J. Mc<br>
  Abstract: Enigmas of Sacrifice: A Critique of Joseph M. Plunkett and the Dublin Insurrection of 1916is the first critical study of the religious poet and militarist Joseph M. Plunkett, who was executed with the other leaders of the Dublin insurrection of 1916. Through Plunkett the author gains access to areas of nationalist thought that were more often assumed or repressed than publicly formulated.In this eye-opening book, W. J. Mc Cormack explores and analyzes Plunkett's brief life, work, and influence, beginning with his wealthy but dysfunctional family, irregular Jesuit education, and self-canceling sexuality. Mc Cormack continues through Plunkett's active phase when amateur theatricals and a magazine editorship brought him into the emergent neonationalist discourse of early twentieth-century Ireland. Finally, the author arrives at Holy Week 1916, when Plunkett masterminded the forgery of official documentation in order to provoke and justify the insurrection he planned. Mc Cormack analyzes Plunkett's significant texts and provides context through critical perspectives on his milieu.Enigmas of Sacrificeis unique in its effort to understand a major figure of Irish nationalism in terms that reach beyond political identity.<br>

  Abstract: This essay is in part an effort to influence the continuing debate about textual criticism and critical rhetoric and in part an exercise in self-criticism. Since I am a principal in the debate, I cannot pretend to assume a neutral or disinterested position, but my present concern is not polemic, or at least not explicitly polemic. Instead, following and extending a point made by Dilip Gaonkar,¹ I want to frame the debate in terms that differ from the prevailing conception and in fact differ from the way I have thought about it in the past.

  Abstract: How can intimacy become a subject for critical reflection?¹ Intimacy is typically understood to focus on emotions of love and supportive family bonds. But if family life is the beginning point for reflection on intimacy, it is not the only terrain we can explore in an effort to understand it. Helpfully, Julia Kristeva both broadens and narrows the field for critical reflection on intimacy. She broadens it when she links intimacy to art, religion, and psychoanalysis and cites the unique capacity of these forms of cultural expression to
                  protect the singularity of human life.² Kristeva narrows the context for critical<br>

  Abstract: The vicissitudes of authorship revisited in chapter 6 point to a larger issue. Since around 2000 there has been a lot of musicological effort lavished on the “workconcept” and the competing claims of the fixed, authoritative musical work and the creative act of performance, mostly to the detriment of the work. Like most such binary quarrels, this one reveals a little and obscures a lot. It certainly oversimplifies the historical situation, which is full of complex instances in which the roles of the work—as inscription, conception, or instruction—and of performance—as animation, interpretation, or reproduction—meet, mix, and<br>

  Abstract: The familiar notion of a “later” Renaissance immediately presents itself as an innocent effort at chronological arrangement, as a convenience for determining relationships in time. But of course it is much more. It calls upon us to distinguish the differing characteristics of successive moments, to trace a process of development from inception to maturity and possibly on to decline; and it introduces the complicated problem of the relations between Italy and the Northern Renaissance.¹ It is thus closely connected with one of the most fruitful tendencies in all aspects of modern Renaissance scholarship: the effort to distinguish stages in a<br>

  Book Title: Gadamer’s Repercussions-Reconsidering Philosophical Hermeneutics<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Krajewski Bruce<br>
  Abstract: Certainly one of the key German philosophers of the twentieth century, Hans-Georg Gadamer also influenced the study of literature, art, music, sacred and legal texts, and medicine. Indeed, while much attention has been focused on Gadamer's writings about ancient Greek and modern German philosophy, the relevance of his work for other disciplines is only now beginning to be properly considered and understood. In an effort to address this slant, this volume brings together many prominent scholars to assess, re-evaluate, and question Hans-Georg Gadamer's works, as well as his place in intellectual history. The book includes a recent essay by Gadamer on "the task of hermeneutics," as well as essays by distinguished contributors including Jürgen Habermas, Richard Rorty, Gerald Bruns, Georgia Warnke, and many others. The contributors situate Gadamer's views in surprising ways and show that his writings speak to a range of contemporary debates—from constitutional questions to issues of modern art. A controversial final section attempts to uncover and clarify Gadamer's history in relation to National Socialism. More an investigation and questioning than a celebration of this venerable and profoundly influential philosopher, this collection will become a catalyst for any future rethinking of philosophical hermeneutics, as well as a significant starting place for rereading and reviewing Hans-Georg Gadamer.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter the role of essentialist and normative elements in the study of Pentecostalism is discussed. These elements are part of any academic effort. In studying Pentecostalism, essentialist and normative tendencies may also stem from the identity of Pentecostalism itself and from its perception by others. Any scholar studying this form of Christianity must therefore reflect on them, especially when interdisciplinary work is proposed. The overview given in this chapter serves to raise scholarly awareness of the pitfalls connected with essentialist and normative approaches.

  Abstract: Where have all the places gone? In the long wide wake of Aristotle, the answer has become increasingly evident: submerged in space. Aristotle’s ingenious effort to “bury space in bodies”—to foreclose it in the tightly fitting places tailored for physical bodies as their most intimately containing surface structures—was foredoomed. The yawning emptiness of the void, the “gap”

  Abstract: My account of metaphor and metonymy in the preceding chapters suggests that if the difference between them is fluid, if it is weak in purely structural terms, it can be strengthened by contextualization. But a more serious problem confronts the effort to keep metaphor and metonymy apart. I’ve called them two fundamental tropes, or figures, and this means that I have already taken for granted a prior distinction: the distinction between the literal (or proper) and the figurative uses of language.<br>

  Book Title: A Godly Humanism-Clarifying the Hope That Lies Within<br>
  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): George Francis Cardinal<br>
  Abstract: For Francis Cardinal George, the Catholic Church is not a movement, built around ideas, but a communion, built around relationships. In A Godly Humanism, he shares his understanding of the Church in lively, compelling prose, presenting a way to understand and appreciate the relationships of God to human beings and of human beings to one another. These loving relationships are continually made present to us in and through the Church, from the time of Jesus' first disciples down to our own day. We are introduced to how the spiritual and intellectual life of Christians, aided in every generation by the Holy Spirit working through the Apostles and their successors, resist the danger of splitting apart from one another. Though they take different outward forms at different times, both wisdom and holiness are made possible for every Christian of every station of life. Sign-posting his conversation by the milestones of his own spiritual and intellectual journey, Cardinal George invites us to view the Church and her history in ways that go beyond the categories of politics - through which we find merely human initiative, contrivance, and adjustment - and rather to see the initiative as God's first and foremost. God is the non-stop giver, we are non-stop recipients of his gifts, and the recent popes, no less than the Father of the Church, have made every effort to make us aware of the graces - that is, of the unearned benefits - that God confers on us as Catholics, as Christians, as believers, and simply as human persons. Pope Francis, he reminds us, contrasts human planning with God's providence, and this book is at once an exposition of that providence and a personal response of gratitude for the way it has operated in one man's life.<br>

  Abstract: A good hermeneutic understands the effort toward objectivity but not the pretense of neutrality.¹ The subject “Luther and the Jews”² is an illustrative example. The study is to be done in the context of the oppressive weight of the history of the persecution of the Jews and in the full consciousness of Jewish suffering. Without losing sight of this frame of reference, one has the duty to seek to expose and evaluate the question as objectively as possible.³<br>

  Abstract: Although there is an emerging scholarship in anthropology on evil (e.g., Parkin 1985a)—its symbolism, manifestations, associations, and changes over time—few scholars have explored whether gender shapes experiences and expressions of evil, and if so how. Women and men appear as agents or victims of evil acts or forces, whether as intentionally negligent mothers (Parkin 1985c) or witches (van Beek 1994), but there has been little systematic effort to analyze what evil acts, beings or forces may tell us about gender relations, or, conversely, how a gender analysis may complicate our understandings of evil.

  Abstract: Christianity is a faith that roots, in time, those who would be Christian. But those same Christians are bound by those temporal roots, haunted by the knowledge that they cannot escape time. I want to explore that paradox in an effort to make what I hope will be some useful observations about how Christians understand, as well as tell, time by briefly examining time as God’s time (theological time), time as the secular time of modernity (worldly time), and the time of lived reality for the Christian, which mediates these other senses of time and imbricates them in one another<br>

  Book Title: Mestizaje and Globalization-Transformations of Identity and Power<br>
  Publisher: University of Arizona Press<br>
  Author(s): YOUNG PHILIP D.<br>
  Abstract: The Spanish word
      mestizajedoes not easily translate into English. Its meaning and significance have been debated for centuries since colonization by European powers began. Its simplest definition is "mixing." As long as the term has been employed, norms and ideas about racial and cultural relations in the Americas have been imagined, imposed, questioned, rejected, and given new meaning.Mestizaje and Globalizationpresents perspectives on the underlying transformation of identity and power associated with the term during times of great change in the Americas. The volume offers a comprehensive and empirically diverse collection of insights concerning mestizaje's complex relationship with indigeneity, the politics of ethnic identity, transnational social movements, the aesthetic of cultural production, development policies, and capitalist globalization, with particular attention to cases in Latin America and the United States.Beyond the narrow and often inadequate meaning of mestizaje as biological and racial mixing, the concept deserves an innovative theoretical consideration due to its multidimensional, multifaceted character and its resilience as an ideological construct. The contributors argue that historical analyses of mestizaje do not sufficiently understand contemporary ways that racism, ethnic discrimination, and social injustice intermingle with current discourse and practice of cultural recognition and multiculturalism in the Americas.Mestizaje and Globalizationcontributes to an emerging multidisciplinary effort to explore how identities are imposed, negotiated, and reconstructed. The chapter authors clearly set forth the issues and obstacles that Indigenous peoples and subjugated minorities face, as well as the strategies they have employed to gain empowerment in the face of globalization.<br>

In defense of the British motherland, Canada found its national pride. This is especially applicable to Ontario, where stalwart Loyalist patriotism and a remarkable volunteerism signaled how Toronto would eventually eclipse Montreal culturally, industrially and economically as the national metropolis, having already done so in fact in the war effort.¹ But a Toronto-centric Canadian nation would never have that metropolis as a sentimental focus, neither as the heartland of a folk or an avant-garde culture, nor even<br>

  Abstract: Over the last two decades or so, a thriving cottage industry has developed dealing with the origins and genesis of fundamentalist movements around the globe. Yet the scholars, policy analysts and intelligence experts involved in this huge effort had precious little to say about why such movements survive, and even flourish at times. After all, the odds are pretty much against them, as evidenced by the fact that the membership turnover rate is high.

  Book Title: Freud's Moses-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yerushalmi Yosef Hayim<br>
  Abstract: In
      Freud's
            Mosesa distinguished historian of the Jews brings a new perspective to this puzzling work. Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi argues that while attempts to psychoanalyze Freud's text may be potentially fruitful, they must be preceded by a genuine effort to understand what Freud consciously wanted to convey to his readers. Using both historical and philological analysis, Yerushalmi offers new insights into Freud's intentions in writingMoses and Monotheism.He presents the work as Freud's psychoanalytic history of the Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish psyche-his attempt, under the shadow of Nazism, to discover what has made the Jews what they are. In the process Yerushalmi's eloquent and sensitive exploration of Freud's last work provides a reappraisal of Freud's feelings toward anti-Semitism and the gentile world, his ambivalence about psychoanalysis as a "Jewish" science, his relationship to his father, and above all a new appreciation of the depth and intensity of Freud's identity as a "godless Jew."<br>

  Book Title: The Idea of Wilderness-From Prehistory to the Age of Ecology<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): OELSCHLAEGER MAX<br>
  Abstract: Oelschlaeger begins by examining the culture of prehistoric hunter-gatherers, whose totems symbolized the idea of organic unity between humankind and wild nature, and idea that the author believes is essential to any attempt to define human potential. He next traces how the transformation of these hunter-gatherers into farmers led to a new awareness of distinctions between humankind and nature, and how Hellenism and Judeo-Christianity later introduced the unprecedented concept that nature was valueless until humanized. Oelschlaeger discusses the concept of wilderness in relation to the rise of classical science and modernism, and shows that opposition to "modernism" arose almost immediately from scientific, literary, and philosophical communities. He provides new and, in some cases, revisionist studies of the seminal American figures Thoreau, Muir, and Leopold, and he gives fresh readings of America's two prodigious wilderness poets Robinson Jeffers and Gary Snyder. He concludes with a searching look at the relationship of evolutionary thought to our postmodern effort to reconceptualize ourselves as civilized beings who remain, in some ways, natural animals.<br>

  Book Title: Ancestral Memory in Early China-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Brashier K. E.<br>
  Abstract: Ancestral ritual in early China was an orchestrated dance between what was present (the offerings and the living) and what was absent (the ancestors). The interconnections among the tangible elements of the sacrifice were overt and almost mechanical, but extending those connections to the invisible guests required a medium that was itself invisible. Thus in early China, ancestral sacrifice was associated with focused thinking about the ancestors, with a structured mental effort by the living to reach out to the absent forebears and to give them shape and existence. Thinking about the ancestors—about those who had become distant—required active deliberation and meditation, qualities that had to be nurtured and learned. This study is a history of the early Chinese ancestral cult, particularly its cognitive aspects. Its goals are to excavate the cult’s color and vitality and to quell assumptions that it was no more than a simplistic and uninspired exchange of food for longevity, of prayers for prosperity. Ancestor worship was not, the author contends, merely mechanical and thoughtless. Rather, it was an idea system that aroused serious debates about the nature of postmortem existence, served as the religious backbone to Confucianism, and may even have been the forerunner of Daoist and Buddhist meditation practices.<br>

  Abstract: The present paper aims at investigating — both theoretically and in the context of the Early Mycenaean period in mainland Greece (Table 26.1) — the relation of funerary rituals with processes of shaping, negotiating and transmitting collective identities.

  Abstract: In the nineteenth century Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (1838/39–1897), Muhammad ‘Abduh (1849–1905) and Rashid Rida (1865–1935), who are today considered the founders of Islamic reform, were already urging an inner reform of Islam. Underlying their efforts was a sense of subordination to the West. For all three, the backwardness of the Islamic world had been caused, and exclusively so, by a fixed, inflexible understanding of Islam and the blind imitation of its forefathers. For this reason they demanded a modern interpretation of the Qur’an and of Islamic law that would be appropriate for the altered circumstances. This effort,<br>

  Abstract: From opposing ideological positions—familiarly translated as vitalist-theosophical on the one hand and orthodox Anglo-Catholic on the other—D. H. Lawrence and T. S. Eliot have been considered important in our modern tradition for their effort to reinstate some connection between religion and art in a literature aggressively shorn of religious thought. If we think of early twentieth-century writing as occasionally turning to some prescription for spiritual health, then we do think of Lawrence and Eliot. But what prescriptiveness there is—and it is perhaps less pronounced than criticism would have it—is not the affinity between these two writers<br>

And dances—along with hurtling locomotives, car chases, cattle stampedes, tennis matches, intergalactic dog-fights, and the like—move. Thus, a significant portion of the history of moving pictures involves dance movement.

Critics from the Florentine Accademia della Crusca had violently attacked theGerusalemme Liberata, arguing that it was inferior in style and content to Ariosto’sOrlando Furioso.¹ To defend himself, Tasso had to prove the superiority of his Christian epic to Ariosto’s poem, which was, in Tasso’s view, ethically and aesthetically confused, an “animal of uncertain nature.”² Basically, Tasso defines the difference between his and Ariosto’s poems in terms of a<br>

Second, this process of self-overcoming became linked with a central effort of Gorky’s literary and cultural writings—the task of overcoming Russian history, the painful legacy of violence and disorder in Russian man and life, all that he once called “our most implacable enemy—our past.”² And third, this overcoming ultimately took on the dimensions of a struggle between worldviews,<br>

  Book Title: Paul and Scripture-Extending the Conversation<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Stanley Christopher D.<br>
  Abstract: This book, which grew out of the Society of Biblical Literature’s Paul and Scripture Seminar, explores some of the methodological problems that have arisen during the last few decades of scholarly research on the apostle Paul’s engagement with his ancestral Scriptures. Essays explore the historical backgrounds of Paul’s interpretive practices, the question of Paul’s “faithfulness" to the context of his biblical references, the presence of Scripture in letters other than the Hauptbriefe, and the role of Scripture in Paul’s theology. All of the essays look at old questions through new lenses in an effort to break through scholarly impasses and advance the debate in new directions. The contributors are Matthew W. Bates, Linda L. Belleville, Roy E. Ciampa, Bruce N. Fisk, Stephen E. Fowl, Leonard Greenspoon, E. Elizabeth Johnson, Mitchell M. Kim, Steve Moyise, Jeremy Punt, Christopher D. Stanley, and Jerry L. Sumney.<br>

The important question, then, is how the mood and cognitive disposition were used by the author to persuade his audience to adopt a particular perspective. The pessimism, which is the key element for identifying the genre of the book, serves to lower expectations of the audience about human wisdom, God, and human effort/morality. The lowering of expectations was necessary for mitigating the dissonance that had been created by the optimism of traditional wisdom and Judaism and the oppressed condition of the Jews under Ptolemaic hegemony.

  Book Title: The Bioregional Imagination-Literature, Ecology, and Place<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): ZEITLER EZRA<br>
  Abstract: Bioregionalism is an innovative way of thinking about place and planet from an ecological perspective. Although bioregional ideas occur regularly in ecocritical writing, until now no systematic effort has been made to outline the principles of bioregional literary criticism and to use it as a way to read, write, understand, and teach literature. The twenty-four original essays here are written by an outstanding selection of international scholars. The range of bioregions covered is global and includes such diverse places as British Columbia's Meldrum Creek and Italy's Po River Valley, the Arctic and the Outback. There are even forays into cyberspace and outer space. In their comprehensive introduction, the editors map the terrain of the bioregional movement, including its history and potential to inspire and invigorate place-based and environmental literary criticism. Responding to bioregional tenets, this volume is divided into four sections. The essays in the "Reinhabiting" section narrate experiments in living-in-place and restoring damaged environments. The "Rereading" essays practice bioregional literary criticism, both by examining texts with strong ties to bioregional paradigms and by opening other, less-obvious texts to bioregional analysis. In "Reimagining," the essays push bioregionalism to evolve-by expanding its corpus of texts, coupling its perspectives with other approaches, or challenging its core constructs. Essays in the "Renewal" section address bioregional pedagogy, beginning with local habitat studies and concluding with musings about the Internet. In response to the environmental crisis, we must reimagine our relationship to the places we inhabit. This volume shows how literature and literary studies are fundamental tools to such a reimagining.<br>

  Abstract: As the world moves beyond nationalism into larger global corporate communities, one response has been to retreat to proximity and, in Kirkpatrick Sale’s terms, to “dwell in place.” The “imagined community” (Anderson) of the bioregion is human sized: it is a homeland not a nation. The notion of the “bioregional imagination” as explored throughout this book is created by place-conscious literature, art, natural-history writing, and thoughtful daily living. It is an effort to cultivate the sort of community Sale and others imagine, one that, many believe, might enable us to dwell more sustainably in place. What I investigate here, however,<br>

  Abstract: For most of its post-1992 rapid industrialization, Chinese manufacturing excelled in global markets as a platform for high-volume and low-cost, export-oriented production.¹ Since China’s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001, however, the fruits of rapid industrialization have been creating home market conditions for very different manufacturing strategies. Successful export-led industrialization has created more sophisticated domestic Chinese demand for a broad array of manufactured goods. In an effort to capture this emergent demand, Chinese producers are shifting their focus toward more advanced production and away from what was traditionally needed (or possible) within the framework of export processing relationships.<br>

If Donne’s ‘Lecture on the Shadow’ or ‘A Nocturnall upon S. Lucie’s Day’ or Marvell’s ‘Definition of Love’, provide a recent generic pedigree for ‘Upon Nothing’, Rochester’s salient improvisation on non-entity requires of its readership qualitatively less imaginative effort to succumb to its arguments and admire its paradoxes. ‘Upon Nothing’ asks, supposing it asks anything of its readers, for a take-it-or-leave-it sense of delightedly amused<br>

  Abstract: The discipline of anthropology is, at its best, characterized by turbulence, self-examination, and inventiveness. In recent decades, new thinking and practice within the field has certainly reflected this pattern, as shown for example by numerous fruitful ventures into the "politics and poetics" of anthropology. Surprisingly little attention, however, has been given to the simple insight that anthropology is composed of claims, whether tacit or explicit, about anthropos and about logos--and the myriad ways in which these two Greek nouns have been, might be, and should be, connected.

  Book Title: What's Happened to the Humanities?-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kernan Alvin<br>
  Abstract: This volume of specially commissioned original essays presents the thoughts of some of the most distinguished commentators within the American academy on the fundamental changes that have taken place in the humanities in the latter part of the twentieth century. In the transformation of American higher education from the university to the "demoversity," the humanities have become a less and less important part of education, a matter established by a statistical appendix and elaborated on in several of the essays. The individual essays offer close observations into how the humanities have been affected by declining academic status, by demographic shifts, by reductions in financial support, and by changing communication technology. They also explore the effect of these forces on books, libraries, and the phenomenology of reading in the age of images. When basic conditions change, theory follows, and several essays trace the appearance and effect of new relativistic epistemologies in the humanities. Social institutions change as well in such circumstances, and the volume concludes with studies of the new social arrangements that have developed in the humanities in recent years: the attack on professionalism and the effort to transform the humanities into the social conscience of academia and even of the nation as a whole.<br>

  Abstract: As the École Nationale des Cadres d’Uriage prospered, some of the more senior military officers involved with Vichy’s youth training began to bristle at young Captain Pierre Dunoyer de Segonzac’s pretentions, his independence, and the centrality of his personality in the school. The Study Bureau had attracted other high-profile personalities to Uriage — lively, sometimes controversial, young Catholic intellectuals such as Mounier, Lacroix, Beuve-Méry, de Lubac, and Maydieu. It was becoming clearer that Uriage was the focal point of a collective effort to orient the National Revolution in a certain direction as the school tried to reach the country with publications<br>

  Abstract: During 1906, when French Catholics were beginning to absorb the shock created by the Separation law, the nation’s attention was drawn toward the serious external threat posed by Germany, which was openly challenging France’s increasing influence in Morocco. Since their humiliating defeat in 1870, the French had been debating whether to challenge Germany directly on the Rhine, in an effort to regain domination of the Continent, or to compensate for their losses in Europe by expanding their colonial holdings in Asia and North Africa. The appointment in 1912 of General (future Marshal) Hubert Lyautey as

That’s important. But it’s also a way of getting on top of experience. We all have life rushing in on us. A writer pretends, by writing about it, to have control. Of course a writer has no more control than anybody else.”¹ Munro’s subject-matter, like the aesthetic her answer implies, is fundamentally elegiac in that an effort to control loss often<br>

  Abstract: This chapter begins by examining Johann Baptist Metz’s early understanding of the modern process of secularization and his effort to present a positive interpretation of this process in light of Catholic theology. By tracing the manner in which Metz approached this task in his writing through 1966, we will see that it was through engaging the process of secularization that a distinctive eschatology emerged in his theological program. His transcendental-linear theology of history presented a productive apologetic resource, allowing him to affirm the ongoing validity of Christianity for those who experienced the process of secularization as a threat to their<br>

Malinowski discussed his efforts to understand the Trobrianders’ language by asking them what a word meant, which he then entered into his homemade dictionary.

The United States was determined that the wartime government of Japan must be destroyed by repeated military campaigns. Step by step, the United States helped to craft a small, conservative, pro-American force in Japan into a majority political party, and, in doing so, successfully brought democracy to the island nation.

  Book Title: Narratives of Agency-Self-Making in China, India, and Japan<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Dissanayake Wimal<br>
  Abstract: This multidisciplinary collection underlines the importance of understanding the operations of human agency-defined here as the ability to exert power, specifically in resistance to ideological pressure. In particular, the contributors emphasize the historical and cultural conditions that facilitate the production of agency in an effort to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures of China, India, and Japan. In Narratives of Agency, scholars from a variety of disciplines argue that traditional Western approaches to the study of these cultures have unduly focused on the pervasive influence of family and clan (China), caste and fatalism (India), and groupism (Japan). This tendency has been exacerbated by modern critical approaches, such as postmodernism and poststructuralism, that not only are increasingly popular in studying these cultures but also de-emphasize the role of the individual. The resultant undermining of the notion of human agency tends to give short shrift to the very real individual differences between groups and ignores questions of personal desire and intentionality. These essays remind us that members of a community have to make personal choices, struggle and interact with others, argue about positions, and confront new challenges, all of which involve intentionality and human agency. A new look at a topic central to cross-cultural understanding, Narratives of Agency will be essential reading for those interested in China, India, Japan, and the world beyond._x000B_ _x000B_Contributors: Richard G.

Since

The social sciences in particular have paid little attention to this conceptual move, however. Accordingly, the matter represents one of the most misunderstood elements of Habermasian theory.<br>

  Abstract: When we talk about globalization, we tend to focus on its social and economic benefits. In

The "opening" of different societies to new ideas, products, and forms of prosperity has introduced a persistent uncertainty, or disorder, into everyday life. Multinational corporations have weakened sovereignty. We no longer know who is in control or who is responsible. Economies can collapse without sufficient warning, and the effort to rebuild can drag on for years. Piracy is everywhere. Is there any way to balance the interests of state, marketplace, and society in this new construct of power?<br>

  Author(s) Khalaf Samir<br>
  Abstract: A defining element in Lebanon’s checkered sociopolitical history, one that has had substantive implications for the character and magnitude of collective strife, is the survival and reassertion of communal solidarities. In fact, the three overarching and persisting features—(1) foreign intervention, (2) the reawakening of primordial identities, and (3) the escalation of protracted violence—are all intimately related. This is, after all, what informs the major thrust of this study. We will, in subsequent chapters, identify and account for the various forms foreign intervention has assumed. More explicitly, an effort will be made to explore how the unresolved regional and<br>

  Abstract: In 
                  Democracy and Tradition, the philosopher of religion Jeffrey Stout argues against liberal theorists such as John Rawls and Richard Rorty that religious discourse has a rightful place in the democratic public square. He also argues that “new traditionalist” theologians such as Stanley Hauerwas and John Milbank exaggerate the separation between the church and the secular public discourse of modern Western democracies. These two claims play a major role in Stout’s effort, as I described it in the first chapter, to distinguish between secularism and his own vision of a secular, pluralist framework for public discourse.

  Book Title: The Death of Philosophy-Reference and Self-reference in Contemporary Thought<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): LYNCH RICHARD A.<br>
  Abstract: Philosophers debate the death of philosophy as much as they debate the death of God. Kant claimed responsibility for both philosophy's beginning and end, while Heidegger argued it concluded with Nietzsche. In the twentieth century, figures as diverse as John Austin and Richard Rorty have proclaimed philosophy's end, with some even calling for the advent of "postphilosophy." In an effort to make sense of these conflicting positions-which often say as much about the philosopher as his subject-Isabelle Thomas-Fogiel undertakes the first systematic treatment of "the end of philosophy," while also recasting the history of western thought itself.<br>

  Book Title: Spreading Buddha's Word in East Asia-The Formation and Transformation of the Chinese Buddhist Canon<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yü Chün-fang<br>
  Abstract: The collection undertakes extensive readings of major scriptural catalogs from the early manuscript era as well as major printed editions, including the Kaibao Canon, Qisha Canon, Goryeo Canon, and Taisho Canon. Contributors add fascinating depth to such understudied issues as the historical process of compilation, textual manipulation, physical production and management, sponsorship, the dissemination of various editions, cultic activities surrounding the canon, and the canon's reception in different East Asian societies. The Chinese Buddhist canon is one of the most enduring textual traditions in East Asian religion and culture, and through this exhaustive, multifaceted effort, an essential body of work becomes part of a new, versatile narrative of East Asian Buddhism that has far-reaching implications for world history.<br>

  Abstract: If there is anything like a great tradition in social theory, it must be the multigenerational effort to come to terms with what has been called “modernity.” For well over a century prior to World War I, members of the lineage of classical social theorists posited some inexorable direction of modernization that sooner or later would encompass the human world. Their formulas ranged from Comte’s law of ineluctable stages to Alexis de Tocqueville’s irresistible trend toward social equality to Karl Marx’s dictum of de te fabula narratur to Herbert Spencer’s law of evolution to Max Weber’s thesis of world-historical rationalization.<br>

  Book Title: Promises of 1968-Crisis, Illusion and Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): TISMANEANU VLADIMIR<br>
  Abstract: This book is a state of the art reassessment of the significance and consequences of the events associated with the year 1968 in Europe and in North America. Since 1998, there hasn’t been any collective, comparative and interdisciplinary effort to discuss 1968 in the light of both contemporary headways of scholarship and new evidence on this historical period. A significant departure from earlier approaches lies in the fact that the manuscript is constructed in unitary fashion, as it goes beyond the East–West divide, trying to identify the common features of the sixties. The latter are analyzed as simultaneously global and local developments. The main problems addressed by the contributors of this volume are: the sixties as a generational clash; the redefinition of the political as a consequence of the ideological challenges posed to the status-quo by the sixty-eighters; the role of Utopia and the de-radicalization of intellectuals; the challenges to imperialism (Soviet/American); the cultural revolution of the sixties; the crisis of ‘really existing socialism’ and the failure of “socialism with a human face”; the gradual departure from the Yalta-system; the development of a culture of human rights and the project of a global civil society; the situation of 1968 within the general evolution of European history (esp. the relationship of 1968 with 1989). In contrast to existing books, the book provides a fundamental and unique synthesis of approaches on 1968: first, it contains critical (vs. nostalgic) re-evaluations of the events from the part of significant sixty-eighters; second, it includes historical analyses based on new archival research; third, it gathers important theoretical re-assessments of the intellectual history of the 1968; and fourth, it bridges 1968 with its aftermath and its pre-history, thus avoiding an over-contextualization of the topics in question.<br>

Within a bloc of seemingly stable communist system, one could hardly anticipate a transnational, common voice that would challenge their legitimacy. In 1968 things did not fare better than usual. In Romania, the nationalist dictatorship of Ceauşescu seemed to be solidified.

Abstract: Feyerabend’s epistemology is “harmless and benign” (p. 148), it merely expresses neurobiological facts about ordinary cognition (Paul Churchland). Far from harmless, his epistemological relativism undermines liberal democracy and personal autonomy (J. N. Hattiangadi). Not so, since Feyerabend followed Mill and adopted a relativist stance only to heighten the appreciation of truth (Elisabeth Lloyd). He went further than Mill, however, when questioning the place of truth in human flourishing (Sheldon Reaven). And rather than reveal truth, Feyerabend’s
         reductioarguments demonstrate the possibility of overthrowing the empirical basis of received views (Gonzalo Munévar). This shows that Feyerabend did not adequately appreciate Newton’s rule, according to which alternative hypotheses should only be proposed when new evidence warrants it (Peter Achinstein). But Feyerabend provided a profoundly nuanced critique of Newton’s unfollowable rule that one should listen to experience only (Bas van Fraassen). He was confused and confusing, however, when in his opposition to Popper he claimed that science violates the laws of logic (John Watkins). And he retracted much of his criticism of Kuhn when he finally understood him (Paul Hoyningen‐Huene). Rather than settle old debates, one might engage Feyerabend’s “New Metaphysic” of the 1990s and advance his effort to move beyond the deceptive realism/relativism dichotomy (John Preston).<br>

Abstract: This second, small subgroup enacted a “

In their engaged disengagement, the cynics’ style was somewhat closer to Alexander and Smith’s (1993) default style than the majority of Buffaloes’ style was. In contrast to the majority of Buffaloes, the cynics talked constantly, and rapidly, and the topic was often politics. (Individuals’ level of education do not fully account for this difference here.) Being more attentive to the world and its problems than to the other Buffaloes, the cynics’ effort at pushing the wider world away took more work. The effort was constant; politics could poke into the conversation at any time.<br>

Abstract: Although not always explicitly recognized or theorized, temporality has come to play an important part in these studies, whether in the form of the momentbymoment constitution of conversational exchanges or of the historically situated understanding of particular linguistic practices (e.g., Hanks
         1987). There has been an effort to develop analytical constructs and methods of data collection that can capture language as it moves through time and space. Improvisation has thus become a legitimate focus of research (Sawyer1997). The study of narratives, at first confined to interview situations (e.g., Labov and Waletzky1966), has entered the more spontaneous domains of speakers lives, providing researchers with the opportunity to see beyond structural organization (Bamberg1997, Ochs and Capps1996) and propose a model based on a few key dimensions of narrative as a cooperative activity (Ochs and Capps2001).<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: jmh.2004.76.issue-3<br>
Date: 09 2004<br>
Author(s): Marino John A.<br>
Abstract: Braudel was a self‐proclaimed, patriotic northerner, born in 1902 in the tiny Lorraine village of about two hundred inhabitants, Luméville‐en‐Ornois (Meuse). He spent his early years there until the age of seven with his paternal grandmother, Emilie Cornot, whom he calls in his dedication in
         The Identity of France“lumière de mon enfance.” Thereafter, until the age of twenty‐one, he returned for summers and holidays from his parents and school in Paris, where his father was a secondary school teacher. Paris may have been where the young Braudel lived and went to school for fourteen years, where in later life he remembered his school chum Jean Gabin (1904–76), the great actor; but Luméville was his home, where he learned the nitty‐gritty of preindustrial material life, the names of plants and the rhythm of planting, became acquainted with the village artisans and the arts of village life. Upon completion of university at the Sorbonne in 1923, his ambition was to teachlycéelocally in his region and to become its historian. Mme. Braudel remembers how “a historian of the Meuse was amused to find all the allusions to the village of Luméville” inLa Méditerranée,as if it were a local history writ on a larger scale.105McNeill goes so far as to say that “Luméville undoubtedly provided the inspiration for thelongue durée… [and] provoked Braudel’s most successful innovation in the writing of history: his insistence on the basic importance of geographically variegated everyday custom and almost unconscious routines, which, he claimed, set limits to all deliberate effort, whether in matters economic, political, or military.” And McNeill believes that Braudel found an audience in the “French reading public” much because his work evoked that “vanishing world.”106<br>

Abstract: On seeking for some clue to the law underlying these current maxims, we may see shadowed forth in many of them, the importance of economizing the reader’s or hearer’s attention. To so present ideas that they may be apprehended with the least possible mental effort, is the desideratum towards which most of the rules above quoted point. When we condemn writing that is wordy, or confused, or intricate—when we praise this style as easy, and that as fatiguing, we consciously or unconsciously assume this desideratum as our standard of judgment.

Abstract: A situation of radical pluralism combined with an automatic instinct to define oneself in oppositional terms thus threatens to turn a tradition inside out. In overdefining itself in this way, a theological tradition suppresses those internal theological tensions that, like the creative tensions of metaphor that generate new dimensions of meaning, are productive of theological insight. Tensions that once could be readily found within the tradition are now apparent—at least initially—only outside of it. A theological tradition that has unintentionally suppressed sources of creative theological tension within itself in an effort to define itself vis‐à‐vis others will be forced now to cross interreligious boundaries in order to reappropriate such tensions.
         64This generation of theological insight from tensions spanning religious boundaries is precisely the aim of the defamiliarization procedure outlined above. Defamiliarization thus functions as an antidote to the tendency toward hyperdefinition that results from a situation of radical pluralism.<br>

Abstract: By extending these ideas on reading to a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur is able to argue that identity is a temporal structure that rests on narrative, as well as a project that is ongoing for individuals during their lifetime. Reading is central to this project because it is only in reading that the dynamism of configuration completes its course; in other words, the passage from prefiguration via configuration to refiguration results in transfiguration of worlds. In this relationship of worlds, it is the person as reader who takes this journey [
         21]. His thesis is that “the process of composition, of configuration, does not realize itself in the text but in the reader, and under this condition configuration makes possible refiguration of a life by way of the narrative” [44, p. 430]. As part of this, a person can be called upon to make an account of herself, and such an account, Ricoeur argues, involves a positing of a beginning, a middle with its highs and lows, and an ending [14]. Through composition, or configuration, this account is dynamic; we can weave different plots about our lives. Ricoeur reminds us that “just as it is possible to compose several plots on the subject of the same incidents … so it is always possible to weave different, even opposed, plots about our lives” [30, p. 248]. But, simultaneously, a life can have the quality of being singular and complete. In terms of a hermeneutics of self‐understanding, Ricoeur best captures this when he argues that “to understand oneself is to understand oneself as one confronts the text and to receive from it the conditions for a self other than that which first undertakes the reading. Neither of the two subjectivities, neither that of the author nor that of the reader, is thus primary in the sense of an originary presence of the self to itself” [44, p. 17]. For Ricoeur, it is through this task that we achieve, by dint of effort, a dynamic balancing of a sense of self, which is, on the one~<br>

Abstract: In
         Gender TroubleButler proposes the idea of gender as a performance constructed in the very act of performing, the performance a challenge to the ubiquity of gender categories. Although at moments Butler alerts readers to the punitive system of gender performances within compulsory social systems, the book proliferates the idea of gender as infinite, individualistic performance, as rebellious carnival, without much attention to the pains and problems of performing (1990, 139). Considerations of race are virtually unaddressed in the book. However, at the end, Butler confronts the epistemology of theories that “elaborate predicates of color, sexuality, ethnicity, class, and able‐bodiedness” and “invariably close with an embarrassed ‘etc.’ at the end of the list” (143). Butler suggests that the “etc.” should not be read as a sign of failure but as a sign of the “illimitable process of signification itself,” the “excess that accompanies any effort to posit identity once and for all” (143). Problematically, what Butler questions here is the idea of an identity prior to signification, not the analogizing of vastly different vectors such as able‐bodiedness and color.<br>

For Spivak the pure subaltern cannot speak and represent themselves in both senses of the term, since the moment particular subalterns emerge as spokespersons for their communities—organic intellectuals in Antonio Gramsci’s sense—they cease to be subaltern (“Subaltern Talk: Interview with the Editors,” inThe Spivak Reader: Selected Works of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, ed. Donna Landry and Gerald MacLean [New York and London: Routledge, 1996], 287–92). My argument for restoring and enabling the subaltern representations of religious traditions refers to the “nonpure” subalterns who through an enormous effort have come to speak for their purely subaltern communities—such as Rigoberta Menchú for the Mayans—but whose representations, if to be heard, require a solidary political praxis of resisting the attempts to silence them and whose already silenced and forgotten testimonials call for a similar praxis of rediscovery and restoration.<br>

Also, we see all and sometimes write, from notes from the editorial board meetings, the rejection and acceptance letters. Our principal task, of course, is to copyedit manuscripts for publication. Because the character of a journal is partly determined by those who run it, we thought it important to note that, unlike many other journals, which rotate its editors every few years,CI’spersonnel—its editor, coeditors, and staff—has seen little change.<br>

Abstract: The paradox is that the mausoleum was imposed in 1949 as a public symbol and barely existed as private thought. Today, it is physically excised from the public space but is present as an architectural specter in one's private spatial memory: “Let's meet at the mausoleum!”
         103This will be the case until the generations that have seen it will themselves have passed away, and with them any trace of individual memory of the mausoleum will be demographically cleansed. This should bring at last the private and public closure of the mausoleum of Georgi Dimitrov in Sofia. Koselleck has remarked that “political experiences or messages can only be passed down beyond the death of a particular generation with great effort. To this end, societal institutions are required. In any case, the memorial, the supposed guarantor of sensory transmission beyond death, does not appear to be capable of achieving this task by itself. A conscious adoption of the message is always necessary.”104The demolishers seem to have overestimated the power of the memorial.<br>

Abstract: In the case of children in particular, this responsibility is deeply circular. What is required is both the social self‐creativity of the adults around them and the gradual development of social self‐creative capabilities within children themselves. These have their beginnings in children’s play and imagination, but they also need to be nurtured into competencies for engaging with and changing society. All of us to one degree or another desire not only to participate in society for ourselves but also to have society respond in turn to our own incapabilities, vulnerabilities, and dependencies. Moral responsibility involves, in this case, not just reciprocity and equality but also a moment of ethical distanciation that opens the worlds of those responsible to surprising and disruptive transformation. From a childist point of view, moral responsibility is neither equally reciprocal nor authoritarian but asymmetrical or decentering. It involves what may be called a “distension” (to use Augustine’s word) of existing social assumptions, a creative “stretching out” (
         distensio) of comfortable moral horizons in response to what they marginalize, as well as a continuing effort to draw others and oneself into deeper social participation.52<br>

Abstract: The most systematic exploration of this ethical reading of the image of God is found in the twelfth‐century Jewish theologian Moses Maimonides. While Maimonides shares with Thomas, as above, the effort to synthesize biblical religion with the ethics of Aristotle, he does not accept Aristotle’s separation of ethics from imitative poetics. Instead, Maimonides argues for an
         imitatio Deior imitation of God as humanity’s highest moral perfection. As he puts it, “The perfection, in which man can truly glory, is attained by him when he has acquired—as far as this is possible for man—the knowledge of God, the knowledge of His Providence, and of the manner in which it influences His creatures in their production and continued existence. Having acquired this knowledge he will then be determined always to seek loving‐kindness, judgment, and righteousness, and thus to imitate the ways of God.”20Imitation clearly does not here mean only the mimesis of the visible world (as for Aristotle). It means, in a more mythic register, acting in the likeness of a God who is prior and primordial, a God who is this visible world’s underlying invisible Creator. Both individuals and the people of God collectively may be defined in part by their primal capability for imitating their Creator’s perfect rest and goodness, for imitating what is deepest within humanity itself as God’s image rather than what is corrupted in historical actuality.<br>

Abstract: The derivation of a formal, consistent, agreed‐upon practical and normative ethics is no mean feat. In actuality, librarianship has, in many ways over many years, aimed at this goal. The LBR, codes of ethics, expressions of core values, and other statements are tangible products of the effort. The commentary on these statements and related ethical concerns is also part of the attempt to articulate a coherent ethical theory. Moreover, the statements and the commentary are marks of progress. They constitute a nascent discourse ethics, but the tacit realm in which they have existed needs to become explicit. A foundation built upon rights does not deny consequences, welfare, or duty, but it does couch ethics in terms of the well‐being of everyone in the community. A strong positive right of access to information is weighed only against the negative liberty of not being subjected to any palpable harm. Acceptance of these rights does constitute something of a social contract. “The contract is a moral bond. It connects the strong and the weak, the lucky and the unlucky, the rich and the poor, creating a union that transcends all differences of interest, drawing its strength from history, culture, religion, language, and so on” [
         39, pp. 82–83]. In connecting the advantaged and the disadvantaged, the library’s responsibility is considerable. It cannot be accomplished dogmatically, and it cannot be ignorant to constitutive rights.<br>

Abstract: In a move that proves Derrida even more heretical than Patočka, he shows that the concept of responsibility resists all final thematization. It is a “paradoxical concept” in that, in addition to seeking to cognitively unify what responsibility means in one intuition, it also defies such an effort insofar as “it has the structure of a type of secret—what is called, in the code of certain religious practices, mystery. The exercise of responsibility seems to leave no choice but this one, however uncomfortable it may be, of paradox, heresy, and secrecy. More serious still, it must always run the risk of conversion and apostasy: there is no responsibility without a dissident and inventive rupture with respect to tradition, authority, orthodoxy, rule, or doctrine” (
      GD,p. 27). With this we have already begun to broach Derrida’s own—radically heretical—take on responsibility.<br>

Abstract: If, for Halbwachs, history delegitimizes the “lived
         (vécu)past,” it is possible to observe a similar impulse occurring elsewhere, namely, Japan, where Yanagita Kunio produced a history(Meiji Taishoshi: Sesohen)on the model of an immense tableau comprised of past and present customs mingling together in 1920s Tokyo and actually envisaged history’s vocation as recording the cohabitation of different customs reflecting mixed temporalities in the present. In Peru at around the same time, Jose Carlos Mariátegui was reflecting on the intersection of historical times coexisting in conflict within a developmental framework and with the figure of unevenness that clearly signified the noncontemporaneity of the contemporaneous.32And in our time this fixation on the historical present as the punctual point of mixed temporalities has appeared more frequently, throughout the world, as evidenced by Chinua Achebe’s novelization of the conflict produced by clashing times in eastern Nigeria(The Arrow of God)—the visualization of temporal islands where contacts and collisions have taken place and have launched the production and spread of culturalmétissage—and even Achille Mbembe’s formulation of the entanglements of time employed to explain the postcolony. In fact, there are innumerable examples of the noncontemporaneous contemporary that can be recruited from the domains of literature, cinema, and, obviously, sociology, an immense literature analyzing the conflicts of tradition and modernity that, especially in the great cities of the world, take place between immigrant parents and their children, among the claims and practices of diasporic peoples in the heart of modern metropolitan life, and within virtual pockets of a transplanted Third World. Also, movements like the Zapatistas in Chiapas have managed to balance the cyclical time of the indigenous community with a political project of liberation inscribed in a Marxian narrative of modernity (though free of progressivist~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: With respect to academic arguments over the New Testament’s historicity, philosopher Mary Warnock has argued that the debates “show a failure to understand the full part that imagination plays not only in religion but in literature, history and in life itself, lived as it is through time, yet demanding a constant effort to make sense of time, to turn events into stories.”
         94Analogously, it can be said that the nature and function of Smith’s texts can best be understood not in terms of historical veracity but as a means to “make sense of time,” specifically biblical time. Or, in terms of narrative theory, Smith’s mythmaking may be best understood in terms of its capacity to make “human time,” that combination of what is already (our past) with what is anticipated (our future) to comprise the reality out of which we act in the present.95Thus, by maintaining the narrative function of the Bible in his own writings, Smith made more than a claim to history. He gave his believing readers a sense of what was experientially real, not merely philosophically true. Wittgenstein’s observation about Christianity is equally true of Mormonism. “Christianity is not,” he said, “based on a historical truth; rather it offers us a (historical) narrative and says: now believe! But not, believe this narrative with the belief appropriate to historical narrative, rather … make a quite different place in your life for it.”96Attention to narrative function furthers Wittgenstein’s point by positing that the believing reader’s commitment is not partial. The reader does not make “a place” for the narrative but enters—takes his or her life experience—into the narrative as a world of possibility.<br>

Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: Against the first characterization of Advaita teaching, the recognition of the double‐voiced character of Śaṅkara’s interpretation of the
         anayatvamsutra (II.1.14)—that is, as internally constituted by the realist cosmological discourse that it subverts—suggests that the interpretation of theBhāṣya’steaching in terms of the illusionist doctrine ofmāyāvādais reductionistic. Moreover, well‐intentioned attempts to dissociate Śaṅkara frommāyāvādathat presume a monological conception of theBhāṣya’sdiscourse, attempts such as that of Srinivasa Rao mentioned above, end up effectively conceding the claim they set out to deny; their affirmation of the reality of the world typically appeals to a denial of substantial change, a claim that implicitly relegates changing, finite existences to the realm of the unreal.114As for the static and abstract conception of brahman, this notion can be seen as the result of the later tradition’s attempt to impose a rigid, categorical distinction between the concepts ofīśvaraand the highest (paraṃ) brahman. This effort to systematize Śaṅkara’s somewhat inconsistent, fluid, and intuitive use of the termīśvarawith respect to the various expressions for brahman effectively pulls apart the dialectical interplay between the personalistic and impersonalistic aspects of brahman in theBrahma‐sūtra‐Bhāṣya. What Hacker characterizes as an “illogical” combination of intuitive theism and intellectual monism can perhaps be better understood as an instance of what Michael Sells, in a discussion of apophatic language in the West, calls “a discourse of double propositions.”115A reading of theBrahma‐sūtra‐Bhāṣyathat appreciates the creative interplay among this text’s multiple voices preserves the vitality and intensity of theBhāṣya’sdiscourse on brahman, a liveliness of expression that we may assume more accurately reflects Śaṅkara’s religious vision.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives.

Abstract: Certainly this passage offers an example, at least as much as does the novel's last paragraph, of Dickens's typical effort at focalizing the approach to closure around the self set aside from—and individuated anew against—the social overview. In
            The Way We Argue Now: A Study in the Cultures of Theory,Amanda Anderson compares this inward turn to the shift in Foucault's thinking from a panoptics of power relations to more localized “practices of the self,” the latter paradigm recalling those “modest Dickensian endings” in which “the glare of omniscience is relinquished and theperspectivedescends to meld with the participant's view” (Amanda Anderson,The Way We Argue Now: A Study in the Cultures of Theory[Princeton, N.J., 2006], p. 142; emphasis added).<br>

Abstract: I could not understand and made an effort to endure the pain of this contradiction: on the one hand, an existence, a tenderness, surviving in me just as I had known them, that is, made for me; a love in which everything found its own punctual complement, its goal, its constant direction in me. … On the other hand, no sooner had I experienced this happiness again, as if it belonged to the present, than I felt it was obstructed by the certainty, spreading like a recurrent physical pain, of a void which had effaced my image of that tenderness, which had destroyed that existence, abolished retrospectively our mutual predestination, made of my grandmother, at the very moment when I found her again

Author(s): Andrew Dudley<br>
Abstract: Benjamin's friend Siegfried Kracauer had a better chance to bring Frankfurt‐style critical theory to America, since
         From Caligari to Hitler(1947) andTheory of Film(1960) were published here. The former could be called a study of a cinematic public sphere, though a decidedly dysfunctional one, while the latter (introduced in its latest edition by Hansen) ranks as the most ambitious treatise on the cinema written by anyone from this school of thought. YetTheory of Filmhas until recently been largely ignored. I contributed to this neglect inThe Major Film Theories, being relatively ignorant at the time of Kracauer's journalism of the 1920s. And, indeed, Kracauer'sTheory of Filmdid seem like an orphan, in dialogue with no active discourse community—Frankfurt school or otherwise—especially in comparison to Bazin, whose works, collected around the same time, were written within an unbroken and vibrant French tradition of criticism. Kracauer came off badly in the inevitable comparison with Bazin at a time when realist theory as a whole, and Bazin's star in particular, had dimmed considerably. Kracauer was thus doubly cursed, at least until the 1990s when he benefited from Benjamin's fame and from the fine bibliographic recovery effort of Tom Levin, whose translation ofThe Mass Ornamentappeared in 1995.55These essays, more than Kracauer's book‐length works, encouraged the kind of detailed and imaginative historical research that Anglo‐American film scholars had been pursuing, especially in the area of early cinema and the culture it grew out of. Think of Gunning's wide‐ranging array of essays; one could say that he writes, consciously or not, in the Frankfurt school manner. Critical theory put film in its place, so to speak, and interrogated it from that place. Perhaps its impact could only be felt when American film studies began to realize that media was integral to a discipline no longer bounded by dates or by specific technologies.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: This falling short—described in 1826 as “the
         chasm—or apostasy, or the self‐position of theFinite” (N5411, fol. 44v)—is something frequently attested in Coleridge’s records of his own prayers. Thus, in 1808, his heart during prayer is “dead‐alive, yet trembles ceaselessly” (N3353). In 1825, he recalled that “even in boyhood there was a cold hollow spot, an aching in that heart, when I said my prayers—that prevented my entire union with God—that I could notgive up” (N5275). Yet if violation of one’s responsibility before God is a common theme of prayer, prayer is also one of the few conceivable and valid responses to this disastrous disjunction between the human and divine wills. It is precisely because we fall short that we have to pray: as Coleridge puts it in 1830, prayer is “the effort to connect the misery of Self with the blessedness of God—& it’s [sic] voice is—Mercy! mercy!” (N6244, fol. 74v).<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: The claim that Joyce is the culmination of Christian epic is less persuasive, and part 2 relies too heavily on the work of Gian Balsamo and Altizer. Franke’s contribution is to interpret linguistic repetition in
      Finnegans Wake(London, 1939) as a secular reformulation of negative theology and typology that cannot be definitively interpreted as the death of God. However, I suspect Franke accepts a historical trajectory in which secular literature displaces traditional religion as revelation. If anything, his theological interpretation of Celan, Stevens, and Joyce deconstructs our conventional notion of the secular and demonstrates that literature cannot escape theology. My concern is that we must be careful not to privilege such literature—as the fulfillment of literary or theological tradition—but recognize that Joyce speaks theologically as one voice among many. In short, Franke needs to clarify the role of Joyce in his theoretical argument about poetic language and his practical effort to promote meaningful dialogue. Presumably, Joyce illustrates the apocalyptic power of literature, but does he do so in a way that is representative or superlative in literary or theological terms?<br>

Article Title: Resacralizing the World: The Fate of Secularization in Enlightenment Historiography<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 605587<br>
Date: 6 2010<br>
Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: Despite these oppositions, secularization and resacralization should be regarded as complementary phenomena that arose in response to the problem of a radically transcendent, hidden God. The studies under review, then, are of crucial importance, but their full significance requires a supplementary analysis. Novel conceptions of society, the nation, Scripture, and personhood followed from an intensification of divine transcendence, and, at the same time, necessitated a reworking of the immanent relations between worldly persons, institutions, and things. It was not merely that secularization, now understood by Bell and others as the translation of divine authority into a worldly register, entailed that the latter incorporate the properties and prerogatives once reserved for God alone. Enlightenment-era efforts to resacralize the self as an object of a totalizing force—situated either in the mystic divine or in a purely immanent, materialist conception of nature—suggest another dynamic at work: the closing of the chasm between the divine and terrestrial spheres and the identification of one with the other. Even if human effort was increasingly regarded as the source of one's understanding of the world, the humans undertaking this work had become newly alien to themselves, and in a manner that recalled the radical distance of the divine.<br>

Abstract: What is left, then, of memory's scope and power? one might ask. How to handle the flow of memory and oblivion, the lengthy stretches of desire, the postponement of fulfillment, of the “tomorrow, tomorrow” versus the instantaneous pressure of the present: “Why not now? Why not now an end to my impure life in this very hour?”?
      
            Only the verticality of oblivion:17
         
            Now, there is no denying that this text sounds utterly seducing, expressing longing and desire, falling short and finding fulfillment all at once. As such, it can be called representative of the pulse of the Augustinian language. Yet putting things this way would fail to do justice to the tight nature of
               
         Sero te amavi, late have I loved you, beauty so old and so new:sero te amavi,late have I loved you. And see, you were within and I was in the external world and sought you there, and in my unlovely state I plunged into those lovely created things which you made. You were with me, and I was not with you. The lovely things kept me far from you, though if they did not have their existence in you, they had no existence at all. You called and cried out loud and shattered my deafness. You were radiant and resplendent, you put to flight my blindness. You were fragrant, and I drew in my breath and now pant after you. I tasted you, and I feel but hunger and thirst for you. You touched me, and I am set on fire to attain the peace which is yours.

Abstract: Second, what is the relation between practical “reflection” (or decision) and practical reasoning? While no one can choose or avow for me, my reflective avowal must respond to what I take to be reasons, as Larmore’s argument about grounds of commitment contends—and so it cannot “dispense” entirely with reference to others (65). Thus, the authenticity found in practical affirmation or attestation cannot be an experience of complete independence from others (my choice must in principle be intelligible). And so the “irreplaceable nature of each individual life” seen in authentic self-relation (55) cannot be defined negatively as an exclusion of other perspectives: it must instead depend on the energy, effort, or initiative in avowal.<br>

Abstract: In summary, the Priestly depiction of these conditions presents us with a paradox. On one hand, the characterization of the spread of pollution as well as the isolation and expiatory offerings required of the impurity bearer hint at an underlying concern with the spread of infection or curse. On the other hand, the biblical materials display an effort to de-emphasize or even deny the danger of infection. Despite these efforts to recontextualize pollution as posing a threat only in relation to the sacred domain, the behaviors associated with these forms of impurity indicate that these conditions were not always perceived to be innocuous.<br>

Abstract: It is doubtless compelling to see Evans-Pritchard’s confession that while in the field he too “used to react to misfortunes in the idiom of witchcraft, and it was often an effort to check this lapse into unreason” (
         1937:99). When he does directly address morality and evil, however, it is to point out that the sentiments they condemn correspond to those we condemn, including jealousy, uncharitableness, ill will, greed, and hatred. It is not that being a witch causes or consists in bad action or feeling, but that such action or feeling “is bad because it may lead to witchcraft and because it brings the offending person into greater or less disrepute” (110). Moreover,
               
         Moral condemnation is predetermined, because when a man suffers a misfortune he meditates upon his grievance and ponders in his mind who among his neighbors has shown him unmerited hostility or who bears unjustly a grudge against him. These people have wronged him and wish him evil, and he therefore considers that they have bewitched him, for a man would not bewitch him if he did not hate him. (109–110)<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: This article seeks to answer the question, In what sense can Alain Badiou’s idea of evental grace, conceived of as radically immanent, be understood as the continuation of the legacy of Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s nonreligious interpretation? The thematic scope of my analysis is determined by two factors: first, the notions of “religionless Christianity” and “immanent grace,” which, as I will argue, despite the evident discrepancy between Bonhoeffer’s and Badiou’s ontological backgrounds, allow for grasping some analogies between both their general insights and particular views and, second, the willingness to preserve the integrity of each approach. In order to meet the latter requirement I will, first, examine the contexts of Bonhoeffer’s concept of worldly faith and Badiou’s concept of immanently actual infinity one by one, through the lens of their respective agendas. Only then several analogies among them will be suggested by pointing to the essential continuity of Bonhoeffer’s legacy in Badiou with concurrent discontinuity regarding both the ontological basis and the theological implications of their views. Finally, I will suggest a possible message that the trajectory of thought indicated by Bonhoeffer and Badiou might convey to Christianity today. It ought to be mentioned that while Bonhoeffer’s theology constitutes the proper and direct object of this study, my treatment of Badiou’s philosophy assumes an effort of appropriating his thought theologically, which in itself constitutes an unobvious and often audacious task.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673118<br>
Date: 09 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Huth Kimberly<br>
Abstract: The second two qualities of metaphor important to early modern tragedy’s use of the figure pertain to the effects of this conceptual reorganization on the audience. Many theorists of metaphor describe the figure as “provoking,” “inviting,” or “asking” something of the audience.
      
            Thus, the third notable quality of metaphor is its function as, in the words of Ted Cohen, an “intimate” figure that forges a community by initiating a “cooperative act of comprehension.” Cohen argues that metaphor, as a special type of speech, emphasizes a process present but generally unstated in all communication: “Three aspects are involved: (1) the speaker issues a kind of concealed invitation; (2) the hearer expends a special effort to accept the invitation; and (3) this transaction constitutes the acknowledgment of a community.”15
         
            In doing the work of deciphering the relationship between tenor and vehicle, the strange and the familiar, audiences become part of an interpretive community, both drawn into the interpretation intended by the maker of the metaphor and participating in the creation of new knowledge formulated through the metaphoric conjunction. If the metaphor is accepted, and thus both the tenor and vehicle are “modified” in the process, the poet and the audience have been carried by the metaphor into a new discursive community. In the tragic theater’s metaphors of pain, this process paves the way for further audience engagement with the play in the forms of empathy for the characters and potential adoption of a new worldview.16

Abstract: In an effort to overcome David Hume's skepticism, Immanuel Kant attempted, among other things, to establish both the validity of knowledge and the impossibility of knowledge without sensory experience. The idea of times derives from the succession of our perceptions. For, as it is from the disposition of visible and tangible objects that we receive the ideas of space, it is also from the succession of ideas and impressions that we form the idea of time. Time, then for Kant, becomes a “necessary” representation that underlies all “time,” he remarks, “is therefore a purely subjective condition of our (human) intuition [ … ] and in itself, apart from the subject, is nothing” (p. 166). G. F. W. Hegel proceeded beyond Kant to posit that “the narration of history and historical deeds and events appear at the same time; a common inner principle brings them forth together.” In discussing Paul Ricoeur's approach to the question of time, formulated in
      Time and Narrative, Mooij traces the philosophic traditions of idealism, phenomenology, and hermeneutics in that three‐volume work. For Ricoeur, “time requires narratives in order to manifest itself fully” (p. 240).<br>

Abstract: Nietzsche’s famous admonition will be recalled: “Truths are illusions of which we have forgotten that they are illusions, metaphors which have become worn by frequent use and have lost all sensuous vigor, coins which have lost their embossing and are now treated as metal and no longer as coins” (quoted in
            Ricoeur 1978, 379–80). In a genealogy spanning Vico, Herder, and, later, the speculative philology that came out of German Romanticism, there is a repeated insistence that the primary use of metaphor is in a conceptualizing role and not one of adornment or embellishment via poetic transposition; this is also taken up by Max Müller, who writes: “The old metaphor was rather the result of a need, and was usually not so much the transfer of a word from one concept to another as the creation or more accurate determination of a new concept using an old name” (quoted inCassirer 1973, 107–8 [M. Müller,Das Denken im Lichte der Sprache]). Where philosophical work is concerned, images of the sensory space have routinely been extended metaphorically in an effort to grasp the ideal, including a metaphorics of what is held to be suprasensory; as Ernst Cassirer observes: “It is as though all intellectual and ideal relationships could only be made accessible to the linguistic consciousness by projecting them into space and ‘reproducing’ them there analogically. Only in the relationships of ‘together,’ ‘apart’ and ‘adjoining’ does this consciousness acquire the means to represent the most heterogeneous qualitative connections, dependencies and oppositions” (Cassirer 1985, 162).<br>

Abstract: Of course, Maybeck was not always satisfied with the temporary nature of his buildings. According to Craig, he was unwilling to compromise the structural integrity of his work at Principia College, even in the case of those buildings that the college "had no desire to maintain as a permanent part of the group."
         
               This led to some tension between the architect and his client. The claylike appearance of his designs for Principia, therefore, should probably not be seen as an expression of their shorter duration. His consistent effort to soften the edges of buildings and their details at Principia was guided principally by his desire to simulate the effect of aging.114
            
               However, his design approach at Principia could still be interpreted as an evocation of the impermanent thatch and wood of Elizabethan vernacular architecture, which was the main historic source of his design.115<br>

Abstract: The use of theories of Sanskrit syntax by Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta to explain the action of monistic Śaiva myth and ritual is examined. These thinkers develop a distinctive approach to syntax that reductionistically emphasizes the role of the true Self/Śiva as omnipotent agent, in opposition to the denigration of agency by the majority of Hindu as well as Buddhist philosophies. An analogy to the Indian discussions is seen in the typological effort of Kenneth Burke's "Grammar of Motives," and it is suggested that indigenous theories of action syntax would be a useful focus for comparative research.<br>

Author(s): Pangle Fred<br>
Abstract: Recent literature on Heidegger concentrates heavily on his (temporary) involvement in or collusion with Nazi ideology and policies. Without belittling the gravity of the issue, this article shifts the focus somewhat by invoking a distinction which recently has emerged (or reemerged) in political thought: namely, the distinction between "politics" and "the political" or between politics viewed as partisan ideology or policy making, on the one hand, and politics seen as regime or paradigmatic framework, on the other. The main thesis of the article is that Heidegger's promising contributions to political theory are located on the level of ontology or paradigmatic framework rather than that of ideological partisanship. While not neglecting the dismal intrusions of the latter plane, the article probes Heideggerian cues for a "rethinking of the political" by placing the accent on four topical areas: first, the status of the subject or individual as political agent; second, the character of the political community, that is, of the polity or (in modern terms) the "state"; thirdly, the issue of cultural and political development or modernization; and finally, the problem of an emerging cosmopolis or world order beyond the confines of Western culture. In discussing these topics, an effort is made to disentangle Heidegger from possible misinterpretations and to indicate how, in each area, his thought pointed in the direction of an "overcoming" of Western political metaphysics.<br>

Author(s): Llosa Roberto<br>
Abstract: Notre analyse repose sur deux hypothèses générales complémentaires. La première hypothèse affirme l'existence non pas d'une crise de la pensée politique mais de trois situations critiques auxquelles doit faire face le pensée politique et qui déterminent des formes d'incertitude spécifiques, irréductibles les unes aux autres. La deuxième hypothèse affirme que l'intelligibilité des crises que connaît la pensée politique passe par celle des conditions politiques dans lesquelles s'exerce cette pensée. Pour préciser ces deux hypothèses nous faisons appel à un modèle construit à partir de la structure d'une action. Trois formes d'incertitude sont ainsi repérées: une incertitude concernant les valeurs, une incertitude concernant l'état des choses et une incertitude portant sur les voies d'action. Transposées sur le plan ou la dimension de la structure sociale, ces trois formes d'incertitude sont à saisir et à examiner respectivement comme crise au niveau du système de légitimation et de motivation, comme crise au niveau du système organisationnel ou des institutions et comme crise au niveau des stratégies ou système "opérationnel". Nous localisons la première forme de crise dans les sociétés du capitalisme "central", la deuxième dans les formations sociales socialistes et la troisième dans les sociétés du capitalisme "périphérique". A partir d'une analyse des conditions politiques qui ont rendu possible l'émergence de ces formes spécifiques de crise nous essayons de déterminer au moins certaines conditions nécessaires--mais non pas suffisantes--de leur dépassement. /// Two general complementary hypotheses underlie this analysis. The first contends that, although political science does not confront a crisis, it faces three critical challenges giving rise to uncertainty in the discipline. The second hypothesis asserts that to understand the present challenges testing political theory, it is necessary to relate the latter to the prevailing political context. To clarify the tw~<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303101<br>
Date: 7 1, 1938<br>
Author(s): Al-Zayyat Israel<br>
Abstract: This paper is an attempt to rethink the much-discussed topic of the so-called crisis of orientation among, or shift of, Egyptian intellectuals who turned to Islamic subjects in the 1930s. Those intellectuals who, during the 1920s, had adhered to the principles of Westernization and secularization were said to have abandoned these principles to embrace Islam and Arabism a decade later. The commonly ventured historical account of this shift attempted to describe and explain it from the "top down," that is, from the perspective of the intellectual producers, either on the basis of content analysis of their texts or through the reconstruction of authorial intentions. It was assumed that the impact of this shift on the culture and politics of contemporary society could be extracted from the meanings invested by the authors in their texts or from the context of the act of writing. This paper approaches the subject from a different perspective, namely, from the "bottom up." While not ignoring authorial intentions or the meanings with which authors invested their texts, I emphasize the ways in which readers reinterpreted intellectual literature on Islam as they consumed it and argue that a proper understanding of the social and political impact of literary products cannot be attained without also understanding the reception of these products. I concentrate especially on one of the major representative texts of this shift, Muhammad Husayn Haykal's biography of the Prophet, and reconstruct the different interpretations of this work's major communities of contemporary readers in the discursive context of their different "horizons of expectations." Through recontextualizing the "crisis of orientation" debate in the paradigm of reader-response criticism and reception theory, the paper is intended to show that each community of readers produces an autonomous interpretation, "another reading." Despite differences among the various reading communities, some common features emerge f~<br>

Abstract: Dans des pages très célèbres de L'Être et le Néant, Sartre avait mobilisé à
son tour l'argument de la régression à l'infini pour établir la nécessaire antériorité
d'un cogito préréflexif : « Ainsi n'y a-t-il aucune espèce de primat de la réflexion
sur la conscience réfléchie : ce n'est pas celle-là qui révèle celle-ci à elle-même.
Tout au contraire, c'est la conscience nonréflexive qui rend la réflexion possible :
il y a un cogito préréflexif qui est la condition du cogito cartésien. » (L'Être et le
Néant, Paris, Gallimard, 2000 [1943], p. 19.) La réflexion détient pourtant un rôle
insigne dans l'économie sartrienne du pour-soi : elle est « le pour-soi conscient
de lui-même », « le pour-soi qui cherche à se reprendre lui-même comme totalité
en perpétuel inachèvement », ou encore « une possibilité permanente du pour-soi
comme tentative de reprise d'être. Par la réflexion, le pour-soi qui se perd hors de
lui tente de s'intérioriser dans son être, c'est un deuxième effort pour se fonder »

Abstract: Si la voie majeure d'accès à la philosophie de Ricœur réside dans une phénoménologie de l'homme capable, une nouvelle entrée pourrait consister dans une anthropologie de l'homme vulnérable.

La tâche du travail éthique peut alors être comprise comme effort pour lier vulnérabilité et autonomie.<br>

Aristote comme horexis, par Spinoza comme conatus - j'aime me référer à Spinoza non seule-
ment parce qu'il définit à titre primordial toute substance finie par son effort pour exister et per-
sévérer dans l'être, mais parce que dans le Traité politique il place le concept de potentia dans
le prolongement direct de son ontologie du conatus pour l'opposer à la potestas de Hobbes et de
Machiavel. »<br>

Author(s): Amthor David<br>
Abstract: Emmanuel Levinas' earliest development of thought is presented here as a phenomenological endeavor, i.e. in its relation to Husserl and Heidegger as well as in its own effort to give an appropriate philosophical account of ‚things themselves‘. The latter task is shown to have a transcendental dimension as it is a self-awareness of conscious life in which the faithful analysis of concrete phenomena and the concept of this life itself have to be brought into attunement. The perspective of Levinas' phenomenological gaze is then presented in these terms and shows two fairly distinct stages. Up to the mid-1930s Levinas appears as a follower of Martin Heidegger, when he advocates an appropriate approach to being in all its richness and therefore criticizes Husserl's alleged intellectualism. Later, with a radicalized perspective, Levinas' own philosophical project advocates an appropriate account of the problem of radical alterity beyond experience and phenomenology. He therefore criticizes both Husserl and Heidegger and remodels phenomenology so that it can adequately ‚understand‘ radical alterity and at the same time confine itself before it.<br>

Abstract: This study is based on 150 interviews carried out in three countries among individuals of working class origin who have experienced very rapid social advancement. My approach consists of three stages. First, I establish a typology of the many forms taken by attempts to rehabilitate their working class origins among those interviewed. Second, I draw upon this typology to open up avenues for reflecting on what makes it possible to present working class origins as a resource. In this respect, it would seem that the narrative skill with which this experience is recounted – a matter of genuine social competence – constitutes a decisive factor. The conception of working class origins as a resource is above all permitted by a process of mystification which seeks to obscure the fact that this value is the product of an effort of self-narration. Third, I take a comparative approach to show that such individual strategies of narration remain extremely contingent on the cultural specificities of the countries in which they take place.<br>

Abstract: Cet article se propose de tracer l'histoire de l'interprétation des rapports entre L'Ornement des Réalisations et les sūtra de la Parfaite Sagesse en Inde. On y examine quatre étapes de cette évolution: dans L'Ornement lui-même, chez les deux Vimuktisena, chez Haribhadra et chez Dharmamitra. L'enquête révèle que L'Ornement est d'abord à rapprocher des sūtra philosophiques non-bouddhiques qui entretiennent un rapport ambigu avec les textes fondateurs dont ils sont censés révéler le sens. Cette ambiguïté donne naissance à une tradition exégétique qui montre un constant effort de dé-textualisation aboutissant dans le commentaire de Dharmamitra à une élévation de L'Ornement à un statut égal à celui des textes mādhyamika et ainsi à une refonte de l'herméneutique bouddhique. This article aims to investigate the history of the interpretation of the relationship between The Ornament of Realizations and the sūtras of Perfect Wisdom in India. It shows four stages in this evolution: The Ornament itself, the commentaries of the two Vimuktisenas, Haribhadra, and Dharmamitra. This inquiry reveals that The Ornament should first be compared with non-Buddhist philosophical sūtras. These show a similar ambiguous relationship with the original texts they are supposed to explain. Such an ambiguity has given rise to an exegetical tradition displaying a continuous effort to de-textualize Perfect Wisdom, which results in Dharmamitra considering The Ornament to be equal to mādhyamika treatises and consequently in a general reevaluation of Buddhist hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: I am indebted to the insightful work of Emily Rosenberg and Frank Costigliola. See,
for example, Rosenberg, "Gendered Discourses in Dollar Diplomacy," and Costigliola, "The
Nuclear Family: Cold War Gendered Discourse in the Western Alliance," both papers deliv-
ered at the Annual Meeting of the Organization of American Historians, 1993. One might
argue that gendered analysis of international relations should do more, that is to explain why
women everywhere are treated unequally. See Sarah Brown, "Feminism, International
Theory, and International Relations of Gender Inequality," Millennium: Journal of International
Studies 17 (1988): 461-75. But Brown makes no effort to show that the structure of international

Abstract: Because of the close association between ideology and utopia, Volodymyr Vynnychenko's three-volume utopian novel "Soniachna mashyna" (1921-24, published in 1928), one of the most well known and discussed works in Ukrainian literature, has more often been approached as a product of his political and ideological preoccupations. While I do not disregard this, in my paper I propose a new reading from a largely neglected perspective of geographical displacement as a social, cultural and psychological phenomenon in an effort to bring fresh theoretical insight into the study of utopian writings. It maintains that Vynnychenko's utopia was largely inspired by his involuntary stay outside his homeland, in Germany, which led to a state of existential uncertainty, feelings of extreme uprootedness, and the desire to overcome this conflict with the reality of his day. The paper examines the writer's personal attitude to his displacement and uses the theoretical paradigm of utopia and nostalgia to argue that his utopia was aimed at a 'reconstruction' of his highly unstable identity by transcending the intolerable present and a projection of a better future.<br>

Abstract: We respond in language to catastrophic, or traumatic, shocks to symbolic systems, for which the fall of the Tower of Babel can be seen as a mythic model. One response is an exploration of new uncertainties; another is a fearful rigidity that seeks to return to an imagined Adamic wholeness of language; another is an effort to transcend language altogether. This essay examines two contemporary responses to a perceived "fall" of language-several case studies of Oliver Sacks's and two novels by Don DeLillo-and places them in the context of the twentieth-century "linguistic turn" in the humanities and social sciences and what I call a "counterlinguistic turn" that is contemporaneous with the linguistic turn and represents developments of some of its key assumptions.<br>

Abstract: L'histoire sociale se détourne aujourd'hui des approches quantitatives mises en œuvre par l'histoire économique et sociale, pour s'interroger sur la construction des entités collectives que sont les «classes», les groupes», les «communautés». Cet article apporte une contribution à cette entreprise, en s'appuyant sur l'exemple de l'histoire des réfugiés politiques en France. La sociologie politique et juridique de Max Weber est mobilisée pour mettre en valeur l'importance sociologique de la différence entre «catégories» et «groupes» sociaux. Le processus de catégorisation juridico-administrative est analysé à partir de sa double dimension: opération de classement qui vise à créer une catégorie «sur le papier», mais aussi, et dans le même temps, opération d'identification des ayant droit grâce à laquelle la catégorie abstraite devient véritablement une catégorie sociale. Today, social history has turned away from the quantitative approaches used by economic and social history in questioning how collective entities such as "classes", "groups" and "communities" are constructed. The article contributes to this effort through the example of political refugees in France. Max Weber's political and legal sociology is called upon to highlight the sociological importance of the difference between social "categories" and "groups". The process of legal and administrative categorisation is analysed on the basis of its two-fold dimension: the operation of classifying aimed at creating a category "on paper" and the simultaneous operation of identifying those entitled to political refugee status, thereby turning the abstract category into a genuine social category.<br>

Abstract: In this regard the comments of Lévi-Strauss regarding Freud are of parti-
cular interest: "Our interpretation may take into account, and is certainly
applicable to, the Freudian use of the Oedipus myth... not only Sophocles,
but Freud himself, should be included among the recorded versions of the
Oedipus myth on a par with earlier or seemingly more 'authentic' versions"
("The Structural Study of Myth," pp. 92-93). As James A. Boon comments,
"This is to say that he is not treating the Oedipus-myth-in-relation-to-the-
experience-of-classical-Greeks. Rather, he is treating more generally various
efforts to come to terms with several sets of contradictions, such as 'how
one can be born from two.' Sophocles provides a version that can be
interpreted as such an effort; so does Freud." See From Symbolism to
Structuralism: Lévi-Strauss in a Literary Tradition (N.Y., Evanston, San
Francisco and London: Harper and Row, 1972).<br>

Abstract: International and national agendas are redesigning the terms of intellectual-property (IP) Laws to create cultural property for developing nations. Debates over IP and cultural-property "rights" or legal needs for "protection" are critical to anthropology's effort to reflect on how the production of knowledge, even culture itself, is variously construed to originate with, or "belong to," particular individuals, ethnic communities, or nation-states. We explore the implications of two Indonesian legal documents to show the disjunction between discourses of regional artists who describe the ritual exchanges, relationships, and transgenerational messages their arts shape and (inter)nationalists legal initiatives that bypass artists' concepts of process, access, and authority in an effort to disembed and control ritual-based expressions as products with exclusive owners.<br>

Abstract: Typically people make ethical judgments with reference to unchanging principles, standards, rights, and values. This essay argues that such an ahistorical approach to ethics should be supplemented by a due regard for history. Invoking precedents by authors such as Jonsen and Toulmin, McIntyre, Niebuhr, Weber, De Tocqueville, Machiavelli and others, this essay explores several important ways in which a due regard for history can and should shape the practice of business ethics. Thus a due regard for history helps us both to cultivate fitting appreciation of cultural mores and to understand how current problems and issues have developed as they have; it helps us to gauge current responsibilities with respect legacies of problems inherited from the past; it helps us to develop a lively sense of what is possible in the present, given current contingencies and past experiences; and it moves us to rethink the practice of ethical auditing: not just as a backward-looking effort to gauge compliance but as a forward-looking way of learning from actual experiences and developing fitting responses.<br>

Abstract: El surgimiento de una identidad aymara entre la población indígena del norte grande de Chile es un fenómeno reciente, como lo han demostrado algunos investigadores en los últimos años. En este artículo se aborda el vínculo problemático que se establece entre indentidad y memoria como parte de este fenómeno nuevo en el que los sujetos involucrados, principalmente aymaras urbanos, sienten la necesidad de articular una memoria representativa de ese colectivo amplio que es el pueblo aymara, planteándose, al mismo tiempo, el desafío de construirla, o como sus promotores sostienen, de "conocerla" y "descubrirla". El análisis tiene como punto de partida las tensiones que cruzan este proyecto y cómo éstas se reflejan en los documentos producidos por distintas organizaciones aymaras a partir de los años noventa. Nuestro interés se concentra en aquello que los sujetos dicen acerca de la memoria aymara (nivel de metamemoria), los esfuerzos desplegados en su construcción y los recursos utilizados en este intento. The emergence of an Aymara identity among the indigenous population in the northern part of Chile is a recent phenomenon, as some researchers have shown in the last few years. This paper discusses the difficult link between identity and memory as a part of a new phenomenon, where the concerned individuals, mainly urban Aymara, feel the necessity of articulating a memory that would represent this broad collective group, the Aymara people. At the same time, they assume the challenge to build this memory, or, in their own words, to "know" and "discover" it. The analysis focuses on the tensions that exist in this effort and on the way in which these tensions appear in the writings of different ethnic organizations since the nineties. Our interest centers on what the subjects say about Aymara memory (the level of metamemory), as well as on the efforts they put on its construction, and the resources they use.<br>

Abstract: La stèle du Bronzo est gravée d'un oiseau "levé", en plein vol, la tête tournée vers l'extérieurs, superposé à un filon de quartz blanc; une crosse, également traitée en champlevé, lui barre le passage. En première lecture, une identification plausible du genre volatile semblait prévaloir et le colombidé emportait notre adhésion. Mais une analyse plus posée et un effort de déconstruction graphique du motif permettront cette fois de reprendre et d'affiner la reconnaissance, en décrivant les différents filtres autorisant tel ou tel rejet de catégorie ou d'espèce, pour ne conserver en dernier ressort que les meilleurs prétendants à la seule confrontation possible, celle qui oppose les corvidés aux colombidés. La représentation du Bronzo est en définitive équivalente en substance et en structure aux scènes figurées sur les stèles voisines dans lesquelles un phallus s'oppose qu tranchant d'une lame de hache (Mané Rutual), tandis qu'un cachalot affronte la coalition des animaux et des outils de l'homme (Table des Marchand). A "flushed" bird is engraved on the Bronzo stela, in full flight, its head turned to the exterior, superposed over a white quartz vein; a crook, equally treated in cut-away engraving, bars its passage. At a first reading, a plausible identification of the bird seemed to prevail and the Columbidae met with our approval. However, more deliberate analysis and an effort at the graphic deconstruction of the motif allows the identification to be reconsidered and improved, by describing the various filters authorising the rejection of such or such a category, finally preserving the best claimants to the only possible confrontation, opposing Corvidae to Columbidae. The Bronzo representation is equivalent in substance and in structure to the scenes on the neighbouring stelae where a phallus is opposed to the sharp edge of an axe blade (Mané Rutual), while a sperm-whale confronts the coalition of animals and human tools (Table des Marchand). However Bronzo is a ~<br>

all those forces whose dominance over man increases or seems to increase in pro-
portion to man's effort to master them. Tempests, forest fires, and plagues, among
other phenomena, may be classified as sacred. Far outranking these, however,
though in a far less obvious manner, stands human violence - violence seen as
something exterior to man and henceforth as a part of all the other outside forces

Author(s): Tobias Arati<br>
Abstract: The combined works of John Dewey and Jerome Bruner provide a framework spanning a century of educational thought which can inform curriculum decisions concerning students' educational development, especially for middle school students whose waning of motivation toward school has been well documented by researchers and has long concerned parents and teachers. This framework, combined with recent contributions of motivation and interest researchers, can create broad understandings of how to collaboratively construct effective educational contexts. As early as 1913, Dewey specifically looked at the pivotal role of students' genuine interests in Interest and Effort in Education. Our current research focus on how students' interest can inform curricular contexts marks the recent shift showing an increased use of interest in education research since 1990. In this article, we discuss our study of a team-taught double classroom of sixth grade students whose interests were determined through a series of brainstorming sessions, and individual and focus group interviews. Students' interests fell into six categories centering around subject areas such as Drama, Science, and Animal Studies. Learning contexts were constructed around four of these subject areas. Students participated in their first or second choice of subject area group. We found significantly higher scores on measures of Affect and Activation if students participated in their first choice group. We found intra-group unities of preferred and dispreferred ways of learning which distinguished each group from the class as a whole. Finally, our findings indicated that students reliably described their genuine interests over time. Students' interests were found to be effective tools for informing curriculum decisions in the creation of sixth grade learning contexts.<br>

Author(s): Bernstein John Andrew<br>
Abstract: Shaftesbury's deism, widely representative of eighteenth-century liberal theology, may be profitably viewed as a reaction against Puritanism in particular and Pauline theology in general. Seen from this perspective, it implies, without explicitly asserting, a reduction of moral standards from the infinite conception of moral law characteristic of Protestantism. Shaftesbury showed no appreciation of the need for redemption or forgiveness, and changed the emphasis in religion from devotion to God above all else to a purely anthropocentric morality which God merely supported. But, in spite of the crudity of his theology and the dubious implications of his ethics, Shaftesbury sought to combat some of the harmful psychological effects to which Paulinism might lead when received in the wrong spirit, and manifested genuine religious insight in this effort.<br>

Abstract: This review essay explores Josiah Young's project of developing a liberatory Pan-Africanism that is attuned to cultural diversity and Victor Anderson's advocacy of postmodern cultural criticism in African-American religious thought. After situating African-American religious thought as a branch of Africana thought, the author examines these two religious thinkers' work as an effort to forge a position on African-American religious thought--including its relation to theology--in an age where even theory is treated as a god that is about to die. At the conclusion, secularism emerges as a religious project that normatively undergirds the methodological dimensions of these works..<br>

Abstract: Aun cuando el pormenor de este ensayo se centra principalmente en los cambios de acento que experimenta la obra de Karl Mannheim en los años veinte, cuando éste se consagró resueltamente a la sociología, el autor quiere contribuir a explicitar las razones que justifican la plena actualidad de su figura intelectual y de su obra. Sostiene que la obra de Mannheim está vertebrada con inequívoca unidad de intención y procura fijar el sentido preciso de la misma. Mannheim fue un pensador del cambio y del conflicto que consagró toda su energía intelectual a interpretar y a afrontar la crisis de orientación y participación que mina la organización de las sociedades de nuestro tiempo. Concebía la sociología como la ciencia de integración necesaria para orientar la convivencia humana en una situación cultural disgregada y altamente polarizada y compleja. Su visión de la misma apela con claridad a la condición interdependiente e intersubjetiva de la existencia y es congruente con el empeño de quienes, para superar la crisis de la ciencia de la sociedad, tratan de armonizar la sociología equilibrando los excesos estructuralistas con un adecuado tratamiento de la dimensión comunicativa de la vida social. /// Althought this essay focuses mainly on the variations in emphasis suffered by Karl Mannheim's works 1920's, when he devoted himself determinaly to Sociology, it is the author's propose to help highlight the reasons justifying the absolute topicality of both his intellectual dimention and thought. It is defended that Mannheim's works are organized with a clear oneness of intention and an attemp is made to explain its meaning. Mannheim was a thinker of change and conflicit who dedicated his entire intellectual energy to interpreting and facing the crisis of orientation and participation undermining contemporary societies.

Abstract: Although philosophers often focus on the essays of Leopold's Sand County Almanac, especially "The Land Ethic," there is also a normative argument present in the stories that comprise most of the book. In fact the shack stories may be more persuasive, with a subtlety and complexity not available in his prose piece. This paper develops a narrative ethics methodology gleaned from rhetoric theory, and current interest in narrative ethics among literary theorists, in order to discern the normative underpinnings of the stories in Part 1. The narrative ethics approach sidesteps the need to ground the land ethic in ethical theory—which has been a reconstructive and problematic task for the philosophical interpreters of Leopold—and suggests, instead, that it emerges in Leopold's very effort to narrate his, professional, personal, and practical experience with nature. The involves examining the stories in terms of their emotional, logical and performative aspects. The result is an analysis that shows not only how these stories express normative claims, but also justify them. One conclusion of the analyses is that, in the narratives, there is less emphasis on the problematic notion of an over-arching "community" than in the prose pieces, and more emphasis on the metaphor of other living things as "fellow travelers" in the "odyssey of evolution." Second, the narratives take on an ironic attitude toward the ecological order, less discernable in the prose essays. The order itself may not be ethically admirable, but should be preserved since it makes possible any ethical relations within it. Thus, the narrative reading suggests some temperance to the usual holistic interpretation of his land ethic and its concomitant criticisms especially the charge of ecofacism. We should not take the land ethic imperative at its face value, in the sense that the good of the order itself is an intrinsic good. In the narratives, individuals are shown not merely to be means to the ecological whole,~<br>

Abstract: Ambient Intelligence is a vision of a future in which autonomie smart environments take an unprecedented number of decisions both for the private and the public good. It involves a shift to automated pattern recognition, a new paradigm in the construction of knowledge. This will fundamentally affect our lives, increasing specific types of errors, loss of autonomy and privacy, unfair discrimination and stigmatisation, and an absence of due process. Current law's articulation in the technology of the printed script is inadequate in the face of the new type of knowledge generation. A possible solution is to articulate legal protections within the socio-technical infrastructure. In particular, both privacy-enhancing and transparency-enhancing technologies must be developed that embed legal rules in ambient technologies themselves. This vision of Ambient Law' requires a novel approach to law making which addresses the challenges of technology, legitimacy, and political-legal theory. Only a constructive and collaborative effort to migrate law from books to other technologies can ensure that Ambient Law becomes reality, safeguarding the fundamental values underlying privacy, identity, and democracy in tomorrows ambient intelligent world.<br>

Abstract: II n'y a rien d'étonnant à ce que la religion soit au départ de la philosophie. Sicelle-ci poursuit la connaissance la plus ample et la plus approfondie de la réalité telle qu'elle nous est donnée, elle ne peut faire abstraction de la religion comme phénomène humain universel, c'est-à-dire comme un fait qui a un sens. Ce sens nous paraît être donné dans une expérience du rapport réel de l'homme qui prie, avec Dieu, soi-même, le prochain et le monde. Cet article se limite aux relations de l'homme qui prie avec soi-même, le dialogue ego-(Dieu)-ego. Ce dialogue est un effort de sincérité au sens d'authenticité. La sincérité de l'homme qui prie apporte, en premier lieu, de la clarté et de l'unité dans l'homme lui-même. Dans la prière une harmonie s'établit à un triple niveau : au plan extérieurintérieur : je me présente à Dieu tel que je suis ; au plan de la temporalité : une unité se fait dans ma vie à la suite de la compréhension du présent avec une rétention du passé et une protention vers l'avenir ; au plan du rapport moi-réel et moi-idéal se manifeste un mouvement vers l'honnêteté et la loyauté. La prière de contrition éclaire la formation de mon moi au point de départ ; l'impétration d'une vie morale au point d'arrivée. En cas d'accord du moi-extérieur avec le moi-profond, tout n'est pas encore dit. Il importe de savoir comment va s'orienter le moi-fondamental. Vais-je me replier orgueilleusement sur moi-même ou m'ouvrir humblement à Dieu ? Le choix ultime : Dieu / moi-même, déterminera la qualité de l'ego. Celui qui choisit Dieu entrera en une relation d'amour avec lui. Non seulement l'amour unit, mais il exige l'abandon de tout ce qui n'est pas la personne aimée. La vie de l'homme qui prie se présente comme un rapprochement de Dieu et un abandon toujours plus prononcé de tout le reste. C'est un processus d'abaissement qui commence, basé sur la collaboration de Dieu et de l'homme. Parfois l'initiative de l'homme prédomine, comme dans l'ascèse, parfois celle de Di~<br>

Abstract: Mise radicalement en question par l'accusation de l'épître aux Corinthiens : „La sagesse du monde est folie devant Dieu.” (I Cor. 3,19), la raison humaine doit chercher une méthode, qui lui permettra de parvenir à une conscience de soi, capable d'assumer cette accusation. Cette méthode ne peut être que la réflexion, à laquelle les protagonistes de la phénoménologie, aussi bien que ceux de l'analyse reflexive, font appel. Thévenaz entamera une étude approfondie et critique de ces deux méthodes pour en garder ce qui lui semble valable. Ce faisant il parviendra à une position intermédiaire. Husserl, en épistémologue, ignorant toute conscience de soi, même implicite, reconnaît l'inténtionnalité comme structure unique de la raison humaine. Aussi, pour découvrir et expliciter le sujet concret et intentionnellement lié au monde, il ne lui reste que la solution de projeter cette liaison dans le champ transcendantal, qui se déploie sous les yeux d'un spectateur impartial. Ainsi surgit une nouvelle facticité qui reste nécessairement irréfléchie. Thévenaz accepte volontiers les avantages de cette méthode. Non seulement elle permet de dépasser l'opposition idéalisme-réalisme, mais en plus elle échappe au formalisme kantien, en nous livrant le concret comme tel, le vécu, l'être comme rencontre. Cependant, en insistant exclusivement sur l'intentionnalité, elle met en question cette même intentionnalité. Le sujet concret, doublure du moi transcendantal et intentionnel, redevient ce qu'il était avant la réduction, un oeil sans intériorité braqué sur un nouveau spectacle, le champ transcendantal. Le sujet concret n'y apporte aucun apport constitutif. Le concret s'échappe à nouveau et la naïveté de la „natürliche Einstellung” n'est pas vaincue, mais consacrée. Sartre, quoiqu'il admette une conscience (de) soi, résultant d'un acte de néantisation radicale, se heurte à la même difficulté. Le sujet concret échappe à la réflexion à cause du dédoublement inéluctable inhérent à cette réfle~<br>

Abstract: 1. Le but de cette étude est d'élucider quelques traits de la philosophie hégélienne, comme „technique de la consolation”, pour en tirer quelques conclusions pratiques quant à la situation de la philosophie et de la théologie contemporaines, en particulier en ce qui concerne l'élaboration du problème de l'angoisse. Nous essayons d'y parvenir en partant d'une esquisse rapide du genre littéraire antique de la „littérature de la consolation”. Et ensuite par une interprétation de quelques traits de la pensée post-hégélienne, en particulier de Kierkegaard, Marx, Nietzsche et Freud. 2. En effet, la „raison élargie” impliquée dans l'entreprise philosophique de Hegel ne se laisse-t-elle pas interpréter comme l'effort de pratiquer une technique d'assimilation et de dépassement de l'histoire ? Et ne représente-t-elle pas dès lors une reprise prestigieuse de deux traits fondamentaux de la philosophie consolatrice antique, l'un étant la „technè alupias” (l'art de consoler) et l'autre la „ préméditation" (des souffrances) ? 3. A partir de cette hypothèse d'interprétation, les réactions des auteurs cités se comprendaient comme une révision de la fonction consolatrice de la philosophie. En fait nous nous sommes restreints à signaler le déplacement du sens de quelques concepts fondamentaux, en particulier des concepts de „travail”, „réalité”, „angoisse” et „souffrance”. Par ce déplacement la raison s'est „élargie” de nouveau, mais non point pour arriver à un nouveau couronnement ou une espèce de super-structure philosophique. Au contraire : une nouvelle dimension, d'un tout autre ordre, fut symbolisée par plusieurs auteurs dans la figure de l'enfant. 4. En ce symbole une certaine critique de la conception hégélienne de la philosophie se résume, nous semble-t-il, comme en une synthèse paradoxale d'une „ excroissance" (Ricoeur) et d'une „discrétion” qui se manifestent à la fois. La place centrale de la libre raison dans l'homme est fortement contestée. Et pourtant : dans cette même e~<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to outline Ricoeur's outlook on the basis of ethics and on the main elements to shape the ethical intention. Although this topic is not to the fore in his thought, Ricoeur has often raised the ethical problematic and delivered most valuable insights into it. We explain how he let a subjective, intersubjective and neutral moment precede the relationship between freedom and law. We also inquire into his vision on values and on the impact and meaning of evil for ethics. The ground of ethical existence is the fact that man basically is original affirmation of being which manifests itself in longing and striving. This dynamic facticity which is only discoverable through a reflection upon the works and creations of man, represents the starting-point for an autonomous ethics having a historical character. In this way, Ricoeur - in the main stream of J. Nabert - turns against I. Kant whose duty ethics misjudges the basic dialectic of human action. Besides, this starting-point allows ethics to meet the Christian kerygma in a more meaningful way than duty ethics is in a position to it. For the kerygma sacralizes no ethical interdiction but situates man into a history of salvation and proclaims healing and fulfilment to man's longing. A second and decisive moment in ethical existence is the appearance of the other. When the other enters into my life, he calls me up to foster mine and his freedom als well. The other becomes a centre of obligation to me, and I am called up to promote the well being of all mankind. Ricoeur also points out that the very norm of morality is man both as an individual and communitarian being. Furthermore, as human freedom is always mediated, we should fully take into account the economic, political and cultural reality which is ethically most relevant. The practice of freedom raises the question of values. Ricoeur rejects any voluntaristic and essentialistic view. Values are immanent requirements of freedom in its effort ~<br>

Abstract: Cavell's influential mid-1960s critique of the "new music" of the postwar era poses significant challenges for contemporary composers who value this music. As with postmodernist critics, he has ably identified shortcomings in justifications for recent modernist music. With the benefit of time, however, the distance between Cavell's and the postmodernists' views concerning subjectivity and the role of the arts in defining it have become increasingly clear. In Cavell's scenario, a contemporary listener or critic confronted with the new music faces a sort of existentialist crisis: he or she is unable to individually affirm the value of a music that conforms to no recognizable models for music yet accepts the fact that this music is, according to Cavell's model of modernism, the fruit of an inexorable historical development. Cavell's interest in this dilemma stems. from the wider aims of his philosophical project, particularly his focus on the perils of the nihilism he finds evident in deterministic and mechanistic theories of the arts. In this light, in both "Music Discomposed" and "A Matter of Meaning It," Cavell appears to be using new music primarily as a vehicle to articulate his concerns and to criticize formalist theories of artistic interpretation, such as that of Wimsatt and Beardsley. Unfortunately, there is little evidence of an effort on Cavell's part to engage this music with the same seriousness that is evident in his writings on modernist authors and visual artists. Toward the end of the article, attention is drawn to the ethical responsibility, given the situation Cavell has sketched, for a critic of the modern arts to make a commitment, either to an existing modern music or to a possible future music.<br>

Abstract: À partir d'une définition de l'éducation comme « relation dissymétrique, nécessaire et provisoire, visant à l'émergence d'un sujet », la pédagogie est proposée comme effort pour penser cette activité dans des situations données. Refusant une posture philosophique qui décrète l'existence du sujet pour le faire advenir, comme une attitude inspirée des sciences humaines qui abolit le sujet en réduisant ses actes à la résultante des forces qui s'exercent sur lui, la pédagogie peut se définir comme « anticipation contextualisée ». Dans cette perspective, elle requiert un discours qui exprime la singularité des sujets en situation et la mette en perspective d'universalité. Le récit peut avoir cette fonction et « faire théorie » sans, pour autant, s'abstraire des situations particulières qu'il décrit. La pédagogie comme « récits d'éducation » a alors pour fonction de favoriser la prise de décision éducative. Education being defined as "a dissymetric, necessary and temporary relation focusing on the emergence of a subject", pedagogy is considered as an endeavour to think this activity in given situations. If we refuse a philosophical position which decides the existence of a subject to make it turn into a reality - as an attitude inspired by human sciences which reduces the subject's acts to the resultant of forces exerced on him - pedagogy may be defined as a "contextualized anticipation". In this perspective, we must display the uniqueness of subjects in a specific situation and set it in a universal perspective. Narratives may have this function without neglecting the specificity of situations. Pedagogy as "narratives on education" is able to facilitate educational decision making.<br>

Abstract: Attention to bodies has transformed the study of religion in the past thirty years, aiding the effort to overcome the discipline's Protestant biases by shifting interest from beliefs to practices. And yet much of this work has unwittingly perpetuated an individualist notion of the religious subject. Although religionists are now well aware that bodies cannot be studied apart from the social forces that shape them, all too often the religious subject stands alone in a crowd, participating in communal rituals, subject to religious authorities and disciplinary practices, but oddly detached from intimate relationships. In this article, I first argue that the turn to the body was motivated by what it appeared to reject: theoretical questions about subjectivity. I then seek to challenge prevailing trends by arguing that these same theoretical insights should now prod us to attend to the import of intimacy and personal relationships.<br>

Abstract: For the last six years, China's historic yaodong cave dwellings, still home to millions of people, have been a focus of work by the Green Architecture Research Center (GARC) of Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology. To date, the GARC, working intimately with the local people of Zao Yuan Village outside of Yan'an in Shaanxi Province, has designed and constructed more than one hundred new yaodong units using the principles of "green architecture." This report suggests that these efforts represent an exemplary application of Kenneth Frampton's notion of "critical regionalism." Specifically, in contrast to the rampant and largely unreflective importation of Western architectural styles common to new construction in many of China's urban centers, the new yaodong units result from a sensitive effort to merge the old with the new and maintain vernacular values.<br>

Abstract: A lively concern for new instruments of knowledge has led sociology, among other disciplines, to collect life stories in order to explore social phenomena. Dialogue and interpersonal communication thus become crucial tools, as well as loci of knowledge. This paper investigates the epistemological suppositions of 'the biographical approach': the quest for identity in the narrative, the dialogical relationship between the narrating self and the researcher, the fixation of speech into text and more. The overall effort of the investigation is to reach criteria of analysis which are not simply borrowed from other areas, but are the outcome of reflection upon the constituent features of life stories. This investigation, however, does not widen the gap between 'qualitative' and 'quantitative' sociology, but rather it contributes to put this division into question.<br>

Abstract: Mimika Kranaki, écrivaine bien connue de la Diaspora hellénique, constitue un cas particulièrement significatif d'une littérature d'immigration fondée sur une situation d'exil et sur la construction identitaire qui vit, pense et écrit dans ce que Nancy Huston appelle «l'entre-deux». Pour Kranaki qui éprouve d'une façon douloureuse sa propre étrangeté, la littérature de l'exil se veut une «littérature de désappartenance». Incarnation d'une identité déterritorialisée, Mimika Kranaki, dans un effort pour transformer la souffrance de l'exil en créativité, s'enracine dans l'écriture. À travers les pages du roman Contre-Temps, du texte autobiographique Mataroa à deux voix. Journal d'exil et du roman autobiographique Philhellènes. Vingt-quatre lettres d'une Odyssée, Kranaki essaie de construire sa propre identité avec les éléments de son passé. Pour elle, le véritable exil est toujours intérieur.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd<br>

Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Hill Robert J.<br>
Abstract: Biblical Inspiration has long been considered an important concept for Catholic theology, but the difficulties experienced in trying to give an adequate and convincing explanation of how divine and the human authors could collaborate in producing Biblical texts has discouraged many writers from pursuing the topic. Some have considered that the difficulties are so great that the task of exploring a theology of Inspiration is too great to make the effort worthwhile. This article, in attempting to sketch a model for Biblical Inspiration, begins by trying to identify exactly what is required for the theology of Inspiration, and then discarding what is not; it also sets out to distinguish clearly between Revelation and Inspiration, while recognising that the two are closely related, and using a model of symbolic mediation for Revelation. The article goes on to propose a model of Inspiration which satisfies not only the demands of contemporary Biblical scholarship and philosophical hermeneutics, but also the requirements of the doctrine of Inspiration as found in the Magisterial documents of the Catholic Church.<br>

Abstract: Après une période de recherches homilétiques marquées par le paradigme de la crise, l'actuelle synergie de travaux dynamiques sur la prédication laisse supposer que l'on aborde le temps de la construction d'un nouveau modèle. l'article s'inscrit dans ce mouvement et propose d'envisager la prédication comme conversation et comme reconnaissance: conversation initiatique d'abord, puis herméneutique, en particulier par un travail d'intertextualité et de partage des voix. La dernière partie dégage la notion de reconnaissance, élément fondamental, pour ne pas dire «sacramentel», de la réception homilétique. Enfin, pour provoquer le dialogue entre texte biblique et réflexion homilétique, l'argumentation s'appuie sur la trame du récit des pèlerins d'Emmaiis (Lc 24,13-33), récit-métaphore d'un processus homilétique renouvelé. After a period of homiletic research marked by the paradigm of crisis, todays dynamic synergy on the subject of preaching suggests the construction of a new model. Along this line, Graesslé's article envisages preaching as conversation and as acknowledgment : first comes initiatory conversation, than hermeneutics, particulary by the effort to relate texts and separate voices. The last part draws out the fundamental, if not «sacramental», element of acknowledgment in homiletic reception. The web of the story about the disciples on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24,13-33), a metaphor for a renewed process of homiletics, is taken to provoke dialogue between the biblical text and homiletic reflection.<br>

Abstract: L'affirmation selon laquelle le mariage chrétien est le signe efficace de l'union du Christ et de l'Église est une donnée de la Tradition. Elle n'en soulève pas moins, au regard des sciences humaines (ethnologie, psychanalyse), de la philosophie, de la théologie enfin, un certain nombre de difficultés théoriques dont plusieurs sont examinées ici. L'effort ensuite tenté pour les lever aboutit à une présentation nouvelle de la sacramentanté du mariage. Le couple uni et fécond aurait à prophétiser la réconciliation des sexes et des générations. Ainsi témoignerait-il, dans l'Esprit, de ce qui est déjà et qui sera, mieux encore: de Celui qui est et vient: Dieu tout en tous. L'étude se termine en évoquant les pratiques externes et internes du couple qui dérivent logiquement de cette prophétie. Asserting that Christian marriage is an effectual sign of Christ's union with the Church is a datum of the Tradition. It nevertheless raises, as far as human sciences (ethnology, psychoanalysis), philosophy and in fine theology are concerned, a certain number of theoretical difficulties, several of which are here examined. The subsequent effort to overcome them leads to a new presentation of the sacramental character of marriage. The united and fruitful couple should prophecies the reconciliation of sexes and generations. Thus would it testify in the Spirit, what already is and shall be, better still: from Him who is and comes, God, the whole power in all men. The essay is concluded by evoking the external and internal experiences of the couple logically resulting from this prophecy.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur se propose de vérifier l'affirmation de Lavelle selon laquelle l'ouvrage de 1937, De l'Acte, se serait progressivement développé comme une synthèse complète de sa philosophie. Or il existe, à l'état dactylographié, une version antérieure de ce livre, qui permet de comprendre combien l'aisance presque trop grande des analyses de 1937 cache en fait une élaboration lente et un effort continu. La version inédite insiste sur l'intemporalité transcendantale de l'acte, et sur l'impersonnalité de l'acte fondateur de toutes les existences personnelles. Ces thèses seront abandonnées en 1937. On analyse ensuite l'article « Être et Acte » et la conférence de la société française de philosophie sur « Acte créateur et acte réflexif », où est discutée la position de Jean Nabert. Les thèses de De l'Acte montrent une progression de l'identité de l'être et de l'acte (dans l'acte d'être) jusqu'à l'acte en sa forme la plus haute, l'acte d'amour. Situer cette œuvre capitale implique qu'on ait bien compris l'interprétation du sensible comme de la donnée matérielle qui doit être spiritualisée. L'expérience extérieure du sensible s'oppose à l'expérience intérieure de l'esprit. Et l'acte est l'œuvre de l'être spirituel. L'ontologie dynamique de Lavelle est une affirmation de la liberté humaine comme participation à l'acte créateur divin. Divin ou humain, l'être est subjectif parce que libre. Ainsi Lavelle s'inscrit dans la tradition platonicienne moderne, celle d'Avicenne d'abord, celle de Hegel ensuite. The author proposes to verify Lavelle's assertion that the 1937 work, De l'Acte, would be progressively developed as a complete synthesis of his philosophy. Now there exists in typewritten state an earlier version of this book, which allows us to see the extent to which the almost excessive facility of analyses of 1937 in fact conceals a slow development and a continuous effort. The unedited version insists upon the transcendental atemporality of act, and upon the impersonality of ~<br>

Abstract: With positivist and technocratic notions still prevalent, Paul Healy's (1986) insightful effort to advance "interpretive policy inquiry" both underscores the limitations of conventional analysis and helps us to grasp the policy process in human terms. Yet the article falls short of a systematic presentation of the interpretive position and, in doing so, reveals the limitations of that approach: the need for an explicitly critical posture becomes clear. This point is made with particular attention to a pre-positivist figure, Machiavelli.<br>

Abstract: Modern critical theory is commonly thought of as a collection of diverse methods, schools, systems, and approaches. There is, however, a significant pattern in the diversity. This pattern is generated by the conflict between the widespread effort of twentieth-century theorists to make criticism scientific and the internal resistance to that effort presented by the hermeneutic impulse. The scientific tradition is characterized and unified by a set of common theoretical principles and by a common sequence of transformations that each school within it undergoes. The result of these transformations is that every proposed scientific model for criticism changes into an interpretive method and the project of scientific criticism is subverted.<br>

Abstract: Formal Christian theological training/education is unsurprisingly diverse. This diversity in theological training encompasses: providers and beneficieries from different denominations of modern Christianity, curricula and contents, and aims. If one supposes that theological training is imparted within or in direct/indirect relations with communities of faith (which likely possess different notions of theology and theological training/education) one is compelled to ask: What is ‘theological education’? Is this quest worth the effort?<br>

Author(s): Wolf Larry D.<br>
Abstract: Since the founding of this nation, the theater metaphor has had an influence on political discourse. Politicians often invoke the metaphor when they enact political dramas to construct themselves in the image of leader. An argument is presented that former President Ronald Reagan and his political strategists made extensive use of this strategy and were effective in portraying public administrators as evil villains. It is also argued that supporters of the administrative state relied on the theater metaphor as well. In an effort to counter Reagan's negative image of villain, supporters responded by portraying public administrators as heroes and innocent victims. This article suggests that the theater metaphor is problematic when viewed from the perspective of public administration theory and practice. The images of villain, hero and innocent victims emanating from the theater metaphor are troublesome and deserve scrutiny.<br>

Abstract: In the second part of the novel these rose motifs reappear with regularity and remind the reader of the beginning of the novel: “Our eyes lifted over the rosebeds” (118), “I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon” (142), and “the pink glow from Daisy's room” (144). But it is not only through the noun “rose” that Fitzgerald reminds readers of the past. His vocabulary is over-represented by “rose” the verb: “With an effort her wit rose faintly” (125), “a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom” (116). Even a melody assists our chain of associations: “someone had begun to whistle ‘The Rosary’” (170).<br>

Abstract: Brentano concedes that we do not grasp the substance of our self merely in general as anything whatsoever but specified as a mental substance and adds that “we do not grasp this substance as individuated by ultimate substantial differences.”
            
                  However, in an effort to account for how it is that each I is de facto aware of himself as being a determinate individual and as the one individual substance underlying all psychical or mental activities—and we are aware innerly of this with the absolute certitude of inner perception—Brentano has recourse to a kind of transcendental argument: Something can have such immediate evidence not through perceiving another thing but only because it is identical with itself—“now a thing can have immediate evidence only of that which15
               is identicalwith it.”

Abstract: In the SPEP volume published in 1983 and made up of selected papers from the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth meetings, the editors, William McBride and Calvin Schrag, commented on the “radicality, openness, passion for dialogue, freedom, and interest in pluralism” that the included papers made apparent. The year 1984 marked a significant turning point especially for the organization. The Committee on the Status of Women formed with the purpose of increasing the participation of women in SPEP. In 1981 six women participated in the program, three of them as moderators. In 1982 four women participated, one as moderator, and Joan Stambaugh gave an invited paper at the Nietzsche Society. In 1983 nine women participated, and two others gave papers at the Society for Phenomenology and the Human Sciences. In 1984, five women participated, with one moderator among them, and there were three women giving papers at the Society for Phenomenology and the Human Sciences. Then, after the founding of the Committee on the Status of Women in 1984, the program in 1985 had sixteen women on the program inclusive of two moderators, a keynote address by Julia Kristeva, and a book session on Ofelia Shutte's book
         Beyond Nihilism. One woman gave a paper at the Nietzsche Society. In that year Arleen Dallery became the first woman elected to SPEP's Executive Committee. The voting members at the twenty-fifth SPEP conference in 1986 selected Professor Dallery as the first woman co-director of SPEP, and twenty-four women were on the program, with four moderators. A panel discussed Linda Nicholson's bookGender and History, and Joan Stambaugh gave the paper “The Future of Continental Philosophy” in a plenary session symposium. Also in that year, at a tumultuous business session, the membership agreed that the Executive Committee would provide annually statistics on the number of papers by women that were submitted and that were accepted.

Abstract: In the early seventies I heard Bob Fogelin give a lecture to incoming first-year students. It was part of a series on current, cutting-edge developments in various disciplines. He pointed out that for some time philosophers had spent little time and effort trying to determine what was right and what was wrong, what was just and unjust, and so on. Instead they asked whether, when we make moral judgments, we are expressing emotions, evoking emotions, prescribing behavior, asserting some natural facts, asserting some nonnatural facts, and so forth. In short, normative ethics had been largely supplanted by meta-ethics. But that seemed to be changing. A guy named Rawls had written a book in which he tried to articulate principles in terms of which we could distinguish just from unjust social practices and institutions. Fogelin prophesied that Rawls had opened Pandora's box and that philosophers were likely to return to the challenging tasks of normative ethics.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>
Date: 7 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: Janicaud's most thought-provoking suggestions arise out of his attempt to challenge hermeneutic phenomenology from the outside and to show that it imposes an illegitimate narrowing of the scope of phenomenological appearing. Here, Janicaud calls on the assistance of Gilles Deleuze, who famously denounces phenomenology and hermeneutics as “the two diseases of the earth, the pair of the despot and priest.”
         
               Deleuze links phenomenology, on the one hand, to the figure of the despot, in light of its effort to establish the transcendental ego as the source and master of all meaning. Hermeneutics, on the other hand, is linked to the figure of the priest, inasmuch as its search for hidden meanings is suspected to carry the residue of its biblical lineage, with its pursuit of the divine. These two discourses, though separate, suffer in fact from the same underlying disease: the choice for meaning. This choice, for Deleuze, imposes a restriction on their scope, which implies that they are only able to address the aftereffects or residues of a pre-subjective and pre-objective life that they ignore.18<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.46.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: I turn to Ricoeur's work first because of its resonances with rhetorical studies. Scholars such as Michael Leff, Andreea Deciu Ritivoi, and Barbara Warnick have productively engaged some of these common themes, but there has not been a sustained effort to use his insights in rhetorical analysis generally, let alone in the rhetorical analysis of memory (Hauser
         1999; Leff1987and2003; Ritivoi2006; Warnick1987).
               This lack of attention may result in part from Ricoeur's own ambivalence toward rhetoric, which he once described as “philosophy's oldest enemy and its oldest ally” (1977, 10). Although Ricoeur maintained a rather narrow view of rhetoric, his preoccupation with its themes suggests that scholars of rhetoric can discover ideas in his work that can be developed into tools for critical analysis. Therefore, this article intends to contribute to a broader—albeit currently only intermittent—effort to assess the resonances between Ricoeur's work and the rhetorical tradition and to fashion useful tools from those mutual concerns.1<br>

Abstract: For Ricoeur, there is something more originary than evil is radical, and that something is the goodness of creation, as attested to by the Genesis narrative at 1:31: “And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.”
         
               While Ricoeur refrains from interpreting the Bible literally, he does discern in the symbolic story of creation a bedrock affirmation of the human capability for the good that precedes metaphysics and history and resides at the uppermost limit of rational thought. And this attestation is expressly the testimony he chooses to stake his life and work on, even if it cannot be verified empirically. Without such a leap into the Kantian unknowable, without this wager on the elemental goodness of being, faith, hope, and meaning itself, Ricoeur maintains, would eternally elude the grasp of humankind. Hence, Ricoeur can agree that evil is primordial and still believe that something—the good—is even more primordial. In other words, Ricoeur starts from the premise that we are predisposed toward the good but have a propensity toward evil. This means, in effect, that the will, although corruptible, is not fundamentally corrupt. It has to be seduced, led astray, before it falls victim to evil. Thus, for Ricoeur, we do not come into the world as damaged goods; rather, we damage our intrinsic goodness through the imprudent deeds we later enact. To put Ricoeur's point another way, that we have fallen implies that we fell from somewhere, and that somewhere is just our original, untainted state of goodness. Moreover, the fact that we have fallen also intimates to Ricoeur that with effort we might be able to get up, that with exertion we might become upright once again in the ontological sense of reclaiming something approaching our initial moral wholesomeness.37<br>

Abstract: James Joyce wrote
         Finnegans Wakebetween 1923 and 1939, during which time another mid-European Jewish émigré (like Bloch, like Bloom), Herbert Marcuse, was writing arguments for the position that Utopianism—which he saw as having for long represented “the only progressive element in philosophy”—offered the only possible path toward the realization of freedom.
               Marcuse suggested that any truth that could not be “realized within the established social order” was designated as Utopian and that this designation (and the accompanying exclusion from the orthodoxy), far from undermining that truth, should be seen as evidence of its validity. This position, although somewhat absurdly self-justifying, may nevertheless afford a useful perspective upon Joyce's relationship with Utopianism. To extend Marcuse's argument that Utopianism is validated by its exclusion from normative probability, then we might suggest that it is only possible insofar as it is impossible—or that it, in Paul Ricoeur's words, “extends to the boundary line between the possible and the impossible.”48
            
               Utopianism is valuable precisely because of its impossibility: because it can never be achieved, it is always formative or aspirational, dynamic, and progressive. Ricoeur suggests that we might therefore see Utopia not as a fixed state beyond material history or the human condition but as exactly the opposite of that: “the utopian element may be the notion of humanity that we are directed toward and that we unceasingly attempt to bring to life.”49
            
               It is because the end is virtually unattainable that the effort—and therefore the progress—is unceasing.50<br>

Abstract: If capitalism is not only total in its reach but also terminal in itself, the value of recollecting Utopia—as proposed, or defined, by More—resides in the degree to which doing so helps to untangle
         Utopiafromdystopia, and fromvisionaryas well, and thus charts pathways toward substantive social dreaming. As commonly used in architectural discourses and elsewhere,Utopiaseems to always already suggestdystopia. However, as withvisionary, the two are not interchangeable; actually, they signify quite different things. In an effort to clarify what these are, one might do well to begin with theOxford English Dictionary. Butbeginmust remain the operative word. According to theOxford English Dictionary,dystopiais “an imaginary place or condition in which everything is as bad as possible,” the opposite of Utopia. Thus, a “dystopian [is] one who advocates or describes a dystopia,” but it also pertains “to a dystopia,” whereas “dystopianism [indicates] dystopian [qualities] or characteristics.”
               Most interesting, perhaps, is that17
            dystopiais a relatively young word, the first recorded appearance of which in English is dated as 1868: “It is, perhaps, too complimentary to call them Utopians, they ought rather to be called dys-topians, or cacotopians. What is commonly called Utopian is something too good to be practicable; but what they appear to favour is too bad to be practicable.”
