  Abstract: Yo tengo mortificaciones; tu tienes mortificaciones; todos tenemos mortificaciones!We all have minor and major troubles that beset us. This chapter discusses a single concept,mortificación,but the method of examination can be used to clarify other terms relating to people’s well-being. What is taken up in these pages is the intentionality of consciousness of the emotion calledmortificación,the experience of being mortified. The consciousness of mortification is experienced in the consciousness of body and in social interaction, what the phenomenologists call intersubjectivity. What is presented in these pages is not new, since it is well known in the<br>

  Abstract: The story of Jezebel’s violent death belongs among the cold accounts of bloody wars, battles, and massacres in the Old Testament. Despite the frequency of similar stories, there is something especially disturbing about Jezebel’s slaughter by men who then “eat and drink,” thereby treating her murder as a routine task that does not involve emotion. Bloch, who was attracted to the savagery of some Old Testament stories and who, as his opera
                  Macbethreveals, did not shrink from setting bloodshed to music, chose Jezebel as the heroine of his projected Jewish opera. The opera stage required some leavening of the<br>

In an exuberant rush of movement and emotion, Surbakti’s (1978:34) account draws the reader into the action as their 1938 Ford coupé convertible speeds back toward the city, loaded now with the disinterred Japanese guns: “Their spirits seethed with joy, as if no power on earth could oppose them.” When a policeman stops the car<br>

  Book Title: Tastes of the Divine: Hindu and Christian Theologies of Emotion-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS MICHELLE VOSS<br>
  Abstract: The intensity and meaningfulness of aesthetic experience have often been described in theological terms. By designating basic human emotions as rasa, a word that connotes taste, flavor, or essence, Indian aesthetic theory conceptualizes emotional states as something to be savored. At their core, emotions can be tastes of the divine. In this book, the methods of the emerging discipline of comparative theology enable the author's appreciation of Hindu texts and practices to illuminate her Christian reflections on aesthetics and emotion. Three emotions vie for prominence in the religious sphere: peace, love, and fury. Whereas Indian theorists following Abhinavagupta claim that the aesthetic emotion of peace best approximates the goal of religious experience, devotees of Krishna and medieval Christian readings of the Song of Songs argue that love communicates most powerfully with divinity. In response to the transcendence emphasized in both approaches, the book turns to fury at injustice to attend to emotion's foundations in the material realm. The implications of this constructive theology of emotion for Christian liturgy, pastoral care, and social engagement are manifold.<br>

  Author(s) Dumm Thomas L.<br>
  Abstract: Some scholars and laypersons alike worry aloud about the current state of African American Christianity. They witness, especially on television, what many take to be peculiar performances of African American religiosity often draped in tailor-made suits with matching alligator shoes. They see enormous sanctuaries and massive gatherings of worshippers enraptured by very charismatic personalities who proclaim the word of God and offer a blueprint for individual healing. For some, these events—and they are events in scale and in emotion—confirm the somewhat standard claim that the tone and timbre of Pentecostalism have come to dominate African American religious expression,<br>

  Author(s): JACKSON MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: This volume explores what phenomenology adds to the enterprise of anthropology, drawing on and contributing to a burgeoning field of social science research inspired by the phenomenological tradition in philosophy. Essays by leading scholars ground their discussions of theory and method in richly detailed ethnographic case studies. The contributors broaden the application of phenomenology in anthropology beyond the areas in which it has been most influential-studies of sensory perception, emotion, bodiliness, and intersubjectivity-into new areas of inquiry such as martial arts, sports, dance, music, and political discourse.<br>

  Author(s) Jackson Michael<br>
  Abstract: This chapter explores the centrality of both kinesthetics and emotion to dance performance, and uses phenomenology to address the challenges that arise in learning the art of storytelling in the north Indian dance form of kathak. Kathak storytelling is danced, not spoken; the story is narrated through the use of gesture, facial expression, and bodily movements. The kathaka’s performance has the intended goal of the evocation of rasa, a concept from Indian aesthetic theory most often translated as mood or aesthetic enjoyment. Limitations to learning arise for both Indian diasporic dancers and foreigners in their attempt to portray abhinaya, or<br>

  Book Title: The Renaissance of emotion-Understanding affect in Shakespeare and his contemporaries<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sullivan Erin<br>
  Abstract: This collection of essays offers a major reassessment of the meaning and significance of emotional experience in the work of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. Recent scholarship on early modern emotion has relied on a medical-historical approach, resulting in a picture of emotional experience that stresses the dominance of the material, humoral body. The Renaissance of emotion seeks to redress this balance by examining the ways in which early modern texts explore emotional experience from perspectives other than humoral medicine. The chapters in the book seek to demonstrate how open, creative and agency-ridden the experience and interpretation of emotion could be. Taken individually, the chapters offer much-needed investigations into previously overlooked areas of emotional experience and signification; taken together, they offer a thorough re-evaluation of the cultural priorities and phenomenological principles that shaped the understanding of the emotive self in the early modern period. The Renaissance of emotion will be of particular interest to students and scholars of Shakespeare and Renaissance literature, the history of emotion, theatre and cultural history, and the history of ideas.<br>

  Abstract: Psycho-social studies is an emerging tradition that very much focuses on emotion and affect to illuminate some of the core issues in the social sciences. Issues such as identity construction, dilemmas in public service sectors and the experience of rapid social change. It recognises that the split between individual and society, sociology and psychology is now unhelpful if we are to understand social and psychological phenomena. It therefore seeks to research beneath the surface using both psychoanalytic and sociological ideas using innovative new methodologies including the use of free association, biographical life history interviews and the development of psychoanalytic fieldwork.<br>

  Abstract: What are the theological contours of human emotionality? This has been the guiding question throughout my inquiry. Does theological reflection furnish any graspable points of orientation concerning the significance of the emotions and affectivity besides the clearly formulated tenets it provides concerning the theological role of the intellect? In order to find an appropriate answer, I first had to delineate the context within which the issue can be adequately treated in a theological manner. The cultural historical claim that there is a rupture, a dissociation, between intellect and sensibility, reason and emotion, seems to articulate a deep-seated experience of our<br>

  Abstract: Though formalism reached its full flowering in the 20th century, there are vigorous statements of formalist themes in the 19th century and its roots go back to the 18th century. To trace the origins of 20th century versions is by no means an easy task. In part formalist theories emerge as protests against other theories, partic:ularly those emphasizing emotion and biographical criticism on the one hand and those which emphasize general rules and classical traditions on the other. Partly also they emerge in response to the challenge of developing critical methods adequate to late 19th and 20th century art forms.<br>

  Abstract: Sociorhetorical interpretation (SRI) is a heuristic that is properly called an interpretive analytic rather than a method. This means an interpreter can select any series of strategies to analyze and interpret rhetorical, social, and cognitive picturing and reasoning to help interpreters learn how a text prompts and influences thinking, emotion, and behavior. Since it is not a method, it does not prescribe a series of scientific steps or formulae designed to perform and produce predictable results in accord with a particular conceptual framework. Rather, the goal is to produce a programmatic exploration guided by a particular constellation of strategies and<br>

It can be argued that a key component in the construction of Irish political and cultural identity is the practice of emotion of ‘feeling with’ and standing in the same place with black Others. From the end of the eighteenth century we can see the articulation of Irish national identity being formulated (at least partially if not centrally) in terms of an ability to share in and hence represent the political and cultural sufferings and triumphs of the racialised Other.

As a reaction against mainstream classicism, Enlightenment rationalism, scientific objectivism, disenchantment, and attempts to crush religion, Romanticism¹ attempted to revive and liberate subjective feeling and emotion, passion, horror, and melancholy. It tried to reenchant the world and unite what was divided. It searched for personal liberation and freedom from convention and tradition, experimented with drugs and various forms of sexual<br>

  Abstract: Animal and human gestures are used for action but also as signposts, symbols, and to indicate intention. They are neither simple nor complex. They are simplex because, in a very global and immediate way, they enable the brain to grasp a reality, an emotion, a thought, or a complex social relationship. Gesture is a fundamental mark of culture and art, which are always simplex expressions. Gesture is essential to them. Drawing, painting, music, mime, acting, sculpture, and dance are always expressed in gestures. For this reason, we must not be content with a physiology (or a philosophy) of action. We<br>

  Abstract: La presente Tesis estudia las relaciones entre la ciencia y la poesía. Nuestro trabajo aborda el modo en que el conocimiento científico modula la creación literaria, así como algunos de los procedimientos del pensamiento literario. Las hipótesis de investigación reposan sobre dos niveles de la escritura de Lorand Gaspar: la dimensión epistemológica del discurso poético y su valor cognitivo. A partir del análisis de un corpus literario se propone una metodología de estudio que atiende a la complejidad epistemológica y cognitiva de la enunciación poética. Tres apartados teóricos organizan la investigación de algunos de los procesos del pensamiento poético: percepción, emoción y metáfora. Lo anterior se enmarca en una argumentación que favorece la transdisciplinariedad mediante estrategias de análisis literario que integran consideraciones de carácter interdisciplinar.This thesis studies the relations between Science and Poetry. The research approaches the way in which the scientific knowledge modulates the literary creation, as well as some of the procedures of the literary thought. The hypotheses of investigation rest on two levels of Lorand Gaspar’s writing: the epistemological dimension and the cognitive value of the poetic discourse. Based on the analysis of a literary corpus this research proposes a methodology of study that attends to the epistemological and cognitive complexity of the lyrical enunciation. Three theoretical chapters organize the investigation of some of the processes of the poetical thought: Perception, Emotion and Metaphor.

  Book Title: Overcoming Our Evil-Human Nature and Spiritual Exercises in Xunzi and Augustine<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stalnaker Aaron<br>
  Abstract: Can people ever really change? Do they ever become more ethical, and if so, how?
      Overcoming Our Evilfocuses on the way ethical and religious commitments are conceived and nurtured through the methodical practices that Pierre Hadot has called "spiritual exercises." These practices engage thought, imagination, and sensibility, and have a significant ethical component, yet aim for a broader transformation of the whole personality. Going beyond recent philosophical and historical work that has focused on ancient Greco-Roman philosophy, Stalnaker broadens ethical inquiry into spiritual exercises by examining East Asian as well as classical Christian sources, and taking religious and seemingly "aesthetic" practices such as prayer, ritual, and music more seriously as objects of study. More specifically,Overcoming Our Evilexamines and compares the thought and practice of the early Christian Augustine of Hippo, and the early Confucian Xunzi. Both have sophisticated and insightful accounts of spiritual exercises, and both make such ethical work central to their religious thought and practice. Yet to understand the two thinkers' recommendations for cultivating virtue we must first understand some important differences. Here Stalnaker disentangles the competing aspects of Augustine and Xunxi's ideas of "human nature." His groundbreaking comparison of their ethical vocabularies also drives a substantive analysis of fundamental issues in moral psychology, especially regarding emotion and the complex idea of "the will," to examine how our dispositions to feel, think, and act might be slowly transformed over time. The comparison meticulously constructs vivid portraits of both thinkers demonstrating where they connect and where they diverge, making the case that both have been misunderstood and misinterpreted. In throwing light on these seemingly disparate ancient figures in unexpected ways, Stalnaker redirects recent debate regarding practices of personal formation, and more ~<br>

  Book Title: Black Intersectionalities-A Critique for the 21st Century<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rocchi Jean-Paul<br>
  Abstract: Black Intersectionalities: A Critique for the 21st Century explores the complex interrelationships between race, gender, and sex as these are conceptualised within contemporary thought. Markers of identity are too often isolated and presented as definitive, then examined and theorised, a process that further naturalises their absoluteness; thus socially generated constructs become socialising categories that assume coercive power. The resulting set of oppositions isolate and delimit: male or female, black or white, straight or gay. A new kind of intervention is needed, an intervention that recognises the validity of the researcher’s own self-reflexivity. Focusing on the way identity is both constructed and constructive, the collection examines the frameworks and practices that deny transgressive possibilities. It seeks to engage in a consciousness raising exercise that documents the damaging nature of assigned social positions and either/or identity constructions. It seeks to progress beyond the socially prescribed categories of race, gender and sex, recognising the need to combine intellectualization and feeling, rationality and affectivity, abstraction and emotion, consciousness and desire. It seeks to develop new types of transdisciplinary frameworks where subjective and political spaces can be universalized while remaining particular, leaving texts open so that identity remains imagined, plural, and continuously shifting. Such an approach restores the complexity of what it means to be human.<br>

  Author(s) BEATTY BERNARD<br>
  Abstract: Of all the major English poets, Rochester is the most irrepressibly disruptive. The very idea of the anarchic libertine poet, as created in the gossip of his contemporaries and in the notoriety of unpublishably obscene texts, disrupts any attempt to account for his writings from within the institutions and procedures of the Academy. To submit Rochester to scholarship is to effect an even starker juxtaposition of a poet’s emotion and its eventual recollection into the tranquillity of footnotes than that of Yeats’s ‘The Scholars’:<br>

  Book Title: Captured by Evil-The Idea of Corruption in Law<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): UNDERKUFFLER LAURA S.<br>
  Abstract: One of the most powerful words in the English language, "corruption" is also one of the most troubled concepts in law. According to Laura Underkuffler, it is a concept based on religiously revealed ideas of good and evil. But the notion of corruption defies the ordinary categories by which law defines crimes-categories that punish acts, not character, and that eschew punishment on the basis of religion and emotion. Drawing on contemporary examples-including former assemblywoman Diane Gordon and former governor Rod Blagojevich-Underkuffler explores the implications and dangers of maintaining such an archaic concept at the heart of criminal law.<br>

  Abstract: To what extent can we draw on our personal and professional narratives as a valid source of knowledge in order to substantiate a critique of our respective academic fields? How can we possibly crosscut from a subjective to a critical discourse, from emotion to fact and back? The following attempt to account for the unusual relationship between “my self” and “my work,” and between “my work” and “my field” will be partial both epistemologically and chronologically.

  Abstract: In the previous chapter I explored how the ghost was used in Chinese literature to stage a confrontation with mortality. Endowing the ghost with a voice capable of expressing subjective emotion, primarily through the vehicle of lyric poetry, opened a window onto the unknowable: what would it feel like to be dead, to be on the other side? Accordingly, these ghost stories represent death as an interior state of exile in which suffering and longing are intensified rather than annihilated. The paradigmatic sites of such stories are the cemetery, the unmarked grave, uninhabited wasteland; the paradigmatic poetic genres involved are<br>

  Abstract: This theoretical innovation allows Monelle to describe how the Classical style of the eighteenth century--which he reads as a balance of lyric and progressive time--gave way to the Romantic need for emotional realism. He argues that irony and ambiguity subsequently eroded the domination of personal emotion in Western music as well as literature, killing the composer's subjectivity with that of the author. This leaves Dr. Strabismus suffering from the postmodern condition, and Raymond Monelle with an exciting, controversial new approach to understanding music and its history.<br>

Ferguson points to this need for approbation in noting that “what comes from a fellow-creature is received with peculiar emotion; and every language abounds with terms that express somewhat in the transactions of men different from success and disappointment.”¹ He continues: “The bosom kindles in company,<br>

  Author(s) Fernandez James W.<br>
  Abstract: There is a kind of rhetorical functioning in the disorderly zones of human life, which sustains and transforms the persons involved. Linguistic operations at the edges of disorder appear as we engage our human deceptive and imaginative abilities, our abilities to produce alternatives, to resist what we learn is expected of us. In these zones, discomfort with the limits of our own cultures motivates tropological experiments, ‘the sleight of hand at the limit of a text’, as Voloshinov wrote. Here especially, the rhetorics of emotion work to transform socioemotional reality, having a critical and often unwitting impact on social life.<br>

Extensive research in folklore studies, the ethnography of speaking, and linguistic anthropology have also proved this claim over and over again, the most spectacular cases being the use of parallelism and metaphor (e.g., Fox 1988,<br>

It follows that the dancer, whose means of expression is the body, has a virtually unparalleled command of this language. The philosopher Johann Georg Sulzer likewise observes in 1774 in his

Date: 01 2003<br>
Author(s): Lichterman Paul<br>
Abstract: Culture in interaction helps us think about institutions and organizations outside the broad sphere of civil society, too. We have already outlined one way of using this analysis to investigate work settings, in conjunction with the emotion work concept. Schools make up another intriguing site for studying culture in interaction. Impressive and astonishing scholarship shows that schools around the globe have become more alike in some ways; school curricula have become more uniform, so that “villagers in remote regions learn about chemical reactions; members of marginalized groups who will never see a ballot box learn about their national constitutions” (Meyer et al.
         1997, p. 150; Meyer, Nagel, and Snyder1993). An inspection of culture in interaction could complement this far‐reaching and important macroscopic analysis by asking how this massive uniformity plays out in everyday interaction. Habitual, unspoken group styles might filter a curriculum differently, expecting and inviting students to band together around it; to treat it as scaffolding for each student’s deep personal identity, to treat the curriculum as official nonsense worth memorizing for strategic reasons but otherwise irrelevant to everyday life. But whatever the explicit curriculum is, groups have implicit, culturally rooted styles for enacting it.<br>

Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: The practical and normative ethics of our profession will undoubtedly be accompanied by emotive and affective reactions. After all, human action is motivated by emotion, cognition, reason, and other things. The profession’s desire to identify core values is a product of these multiple motivations. Just as identification of a core value requires an explication of what qualities are attached to a thing that is valued and for whom the thing is valuable and why, so too does discourse ethics in general require such full argumentation. More than just formal argument, though, discourse ethics entails participation broadly; it invites those concerned to have a voice within the communicative endeavor. The voicing, however, follows some norms that are aimed at the outcome of the deliberation—workable and agreed‐upon practices. Habermas says that “discourse ethics, then, stands or falls with two assumptions: (
         a) that normative claims to validity have cognitive meaning and can be treated like claims to truth and (b) that the justification of norms and commands requires that a real discourse be carried out and thus cannot occur in a strictly monological form” [35, p. 68]. Habermas presents an ideal that can suggest a beginning for the furtherance of a practical and normative ethics for librarianship.<br>

Author(s): Scimeca Ross<br>
Abstract: This unique notion of truth for librarianship that we are proposing is derived from what has been called historicism. Historicism is not really a theory of truth as much as it is a theory of knowledge in which the question of objective truth is eliminated. This elimination of objective truth implicit in historicism has been attacked from many quarters. The origin of this theory is J. G. Herder’s
         Reflections on the Philosophy of the History of Man[71]. With regard to the question of truth, historicism interprets both human consciousness and the propositions expressing the nature of humans themselves and all of reality as historically conditioned, even current knowledge [71, pp. 96–104]. Herder looked at the supposed teleological progression of reason and found it often wanting. Nevertheless, he believed that reason and goodness would eventually triumph over irrationalism and human folly [71, pp. 115–18]. Consider the following example that illustrates the difference between historicism and the three theories of truth discussed above. For the historicist, the proposition that the world is the center of the universe was true for the medieval mind. For the correspondence theorist, that proposition is simply false, although the additional fact that the medieval mind accepted this proposition to be true would be conceded. The coherence theorist would say that, although the medieval mind accepted the Aristotelian‐Ptolemaic view of the universe, which in itself is a coherent system of propositions, this coherent system would eventually be supplanted by Copernicus’s view. This revolutionary change in knowledge is often expressed as a paradigm by Thomas Kuhn and other philosophers of science. The historicist would point out that such paradigms of knowledge usually have a localized point of origin and gradually expand to the other areas of scholarship, finally entering the public consciousness, where they are accepted or rejected [67, pp. 160–73]. The historicist ackn~<br>

Abstract: One such case of self‐betrayal occurs in the often‐cited episode of the trees of Hudimesnil. Riding on the carriage of Mme de Villeparisis, Marcel feels an unexplainable happiness at the sight of three trees; yet, try hard as he may, he cannot find a reason to his happiness. These trees, so strangely familiar, are perhaps a memory from childhood or from a dream, or a cryptic epiphany, or just an optical impression owing to eye fatigue. They seem to be asking of Marcel that he “return them to life”; he recognizes in their “naïve and passionate gesticulations the impotent regret of a dear person who, having lost the usage of words, feels he cannot tell us what we are unable to guess.” Having failed repeatedly to identify the source of his emotion, Marcel gives up puzzling over it, and at that precise moment he feels “as if he had just lost a friend,
            died to himself, denied a dead person, or misidentified a god.” Proust,À l’ombre des jeunes filles en fleursII, 568–69; my emphasis.<br>

Abstract: It is explicitly cinema's contribution of new concepts that prompts Rodowick, in another state‐of‐the‐field article, to hitch both Deleuze and Stanley Cavell to an enterprise within “philosophy” rather than within “theory,” whose energy he declares to be drained.
         47For theory seems too programmatic and imperious, whether driven by science in Althusser's sense (Grand Theory) or by models taken from natural and cognitive science (posttheory). Defending the latter, in a rebuke to Rodowick, Malcolm Turvey proudly reminds us that once continental film studies had been deracinated from the anglophone field, thanks largely to the relentless analyses of Noël Carroll, room was cleared for specific, targeted, and useful work. Turvey runs through a litany of recent and distinct gains in theories of emotion, editing, perception, imagination, pleasure, music, comprehension, interpretation, character identification, narrative, and suspense.48While those who write books and articles in these areas invariably do so by turning to well‐developed notions in the social sciences or philosophy, they do so, Turvey believes, from the strength of their own discipline. Here he connects to something I have been advocating all along; “most of us are not philosophers, sociologists, or economists butfilmscholars. What this means is that, at the end of the day, we have to use our expertise—gained from watching large numbers of films, observing them and the response of viewers to them carefully, and learning about the contexts in which they were made and exhibited—to evaluate the theories we take from other disciplines in terms of whether they successfully explain (or not) film.”49<br>

Abstract: Consider recent thinking on ritual, music, and persuasion: “The formality, sequence, pattern, and repetition of such musical structures themselves elicit emotional response through their instantiation of ritual. Music thereby creates an emotive ‘proto‐symbolic’ system capable of abstracting both the signals and structure of ritual” (Alcorta and Sosis, “Ritual, Emotion, and Sacred Symbols,” 336–37). “Human use of ritual to conditionally associate emotion and abstractions creates the sacred; it also lies at the heart of symbolic thought” (348–49).<br>

Abstract: To summarize, consideration of evil is necessary if an anthropological approach to morality is to be complete and comprehensive; arraying evil along dimensions of internal/external and passive/active may provide a more systematic way for it to operate as an analytic category; and approaching morality in terms of symbolic oppositions such as those between good and evil may provide a framework for cross-cultural analysis. None of this, however, obligates us to treat morality as a cultural system in Geertz’s sense, as a coherent system of symbols that can potentially sustain an institutional order. In this respect we ought to be wary insofar as treating morality as a noun creates a semantic milieu that rhetorically moves us toward thinking of it as an entified cultural system or domain to be placed alongside religion, ideology, law, or politics. The move to pluralize the noun as “moralities” is a valuable hedge that helps guarantee pluralism across cultures and internal diversity within, keeping the issues of relativism and variation before us. However, this move does not invite us to analyze morality as a modality of being in the way we might by instead emphasizing how we use “moral” as an adjective that can precede and modify any number of terms: obligation, challenge, sensibility, emotion, crisis, failing, code, system, education, community, judgment, order, actor. In the adjectival rather than its nominal sense it may be easier to recognize that the moral can enter into—spontaneously or by conscious evocation—virtually any corner of human concern.<br>

Abstract: Gloucester’s lines have rightly been at the center of many critical readings of
      King Lear. As an example of how the play uses figurative language to formulate a fatalistic worldview, the image of the helpless flies underscores the characters’ descent into what Susan Oldrieve has called “experiential misery”: “here is the moment when emotion explodes, overwhelming reason and the capacity to make knowledge out of allegory.”
            Emily R. Wilson argues that the figure is indicative of “tragic overliving,” Gloucester’s blindness symbolic of his having lived too long and seen too much to integrate his experience into the narrative of his life.36
         
            Yet he does produce a figure of pain that helps audiences to integrate the events on stage into a tragic narrative, a figure that enables us to make sense out of the sensory experience we have just watched. It is the figure’s relationship to the physical performance that makes it powerful. As Edward L. Rocklin writes, the image of men as flies at the mercy of capricious gods “resonates so intensely because in performance it is incarnated before it is articulated.”37
         
            We see the pain before we hear the rhetorical reflection on its meaning, and the lines are in fact a union of two figures of pain: Gloucester himself and the simile he produces.38<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i23071596<br>
Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Scott Bede<br>
Abstract: This article explores the crisis initiated by colonial modernity in Naguib Mahfouz's 1947 novel Midaq Alley. I begin by discussing the significance of anger within the narrative, arguing that this dominant structure of feeling could be read as a collective response to wider social and historical forces. In other words, rather than understanding emotion as the "subjective property" of the individual, I regard it here as a relational practice embedded within and determined by quite specific sociocultural circumstances. I then proceed to discuss the role of rumour in the novel and the significance of its pronounced melodramatic qualities. In the first case, I shall argue, the circulation of rumour provides a way of containing or quarantining the negative feelings produced by modernity, while also reinforcing the boundaries of a community facing the very real possibility of its own demise. In the second case, I would like to suggest that the narrative's tendency to privilege the melodramatic mode creates a sense of social order and moral intelligibility by channelling these feelings into a stable and predictable generic structure. This latter project is ultimately frustrated, however, when the forces of evil emerge to destroy the novel's principle representative of virtue.<br>

Author(s): Banerjee Sanjoy<br>
Abstract: How does international interaction shape states' patterns of thought, emotion, and action? This paper examines the processes by which motives and practices feed each other in reproducing historical structures. An artificial intelligence model defines state-subjects as cultures combining special meanings that produce causal attribution, state self-identification, emotions, and action motives. These special meanings are built from subjective cultural categories describing social acts and group character of the self and others. Anger, pride, fear, and relief motivate action. A collection of such subject-cultures may produce a pattern of actions that reiterates the cultures. The model discriminates between those combinations of elements in special meanings which reproduce subjects and historical structures, and those which do not. The meanings discovered in such reproduction analysis can be validated by discourse analysis.<br>

Date: 10 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Leget C.<br>
Abstract: Beginning with an exemplary case study, this paper diagnoses and analyses some important strategies of evasion and factors of hindrance that are met in the teaching of medical ethics to undergraduate medical students. Some of these inhibitions are inherent to ethical theories; others are connected with the nature of medicine or cultural trends. It is argued that in order to avoid an attitude of evasion in medical ethics teaching, a philosophical theory of emotions is needed that is able to clarify on a conceptual level the ethical importance of emotions. An approach is proposed with the help of the emotion theory Martha Nussbaum works out in her book Upheavals of thought. The paper ends with some practical recommendations.<br>

Abstract: El texto póstumo de Maurice Halbwachs, titulado "L'expression des émotions et la société" (1947), presenta un triple interés entre otros. 1) Al descubrir la obligación social de sentir y la influencia de los grupos sociales, Maurice Halbwachs se convierte a la vez en digno sucesor de Durkheim, cercano colaborador de Marcel Mauss y también fino lector de Weber y de Simmel. 2) Al tratar la cuestión de la transmisión de las emociones, el autor reencuentra los problemas de la mémoire collective, eje de su obra, y trata la cuestión de la emoción en una temporalidad que afecta a la misma existencia y, más allá, a la transmisión intergeneracional. 3) Al insistir sobre la formalidad y la eficacia de las prácticas rituales para comprender "la expresión de las emociones", Maurice Halbwachs ofrece finalmente las vías de una posible superación de las oposiciones clásicas entre ritos y emociones o entre expresión y representación. /// The posthumous text by Maurice Halbwachs, "L'expression des émotions et la société" (1947), presents more than a triple interest. 1) When discovering the social obligation of feeling and the influence of social groups, Maurice Halbwachs becomesat the same time a worthy Durkheim successor, a close Marcel Mauss collaborator and a fine Weber and de Simmel reader. 2) Dealing with the question of transmission of emotions, the author reviews again the problems of la mémoire collective, axis of his work, and approaches the question of emotion in a temporality affecting existence itself and, beyond, the intergenerational transmission. 3) When insisting on the formality and efficiency of ritual practices to comprehend "the expression of emotions", Maurice Halbwachs offers at last the ways of a possible superation of the classical oppositions between rites and emotions or between expression and representation.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000938<br>
Date: 7 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Nussbaum Martha<br>
Abstract: In "Upheavals of Thought", Martha Nussbaum offers a theory of the emotions. She argues that emotions are best conceived as thoughts, and she argues that emotion-thoughts can make valuable contributions to the moral life. She develops extensive accounts of compassion and erotic love as thoughts that are of great moral import. This paper seeks to elucidate what it means, for Nussbaum, to say that emotions are forms of thought. It raises critical questions about her conception of the structure of emotion, and about her conception of compassion, in particular. Finally, the paper seeks to show how analyzing the structure, as well as the moral value, of the emotions ultimately requires entering the realm of religious ethics.<br>

Abstract: Vico maintained that metaphor is a fundamental process of human mental life which bridges the gap between emotion and cognition. This Vichian perspective is reflected in areas of critical theory treating metaphor and other tropes, particularly their use in narrative. In psychology too, the significance of metaphor is increasingly recognized despite the Cartesian emphasis on literal thought and language in contemporary psychology's central paradigm, cognitive science. The paper compares the Cartesian and Vichian perspectives and suggests that the former limits the integrated treatment of cognition and emotion. This is illustrated with an example of how a child's feelings about a distressing situation are both revealed and changed in storytelling. The Vichian perspective is more appropriate to understanding this therapeutic interaction of cognition and emotion through metaphoric narrative play. This perspective has significant echoes in psychoanalytic and textual studies suggesting how sensitivity to the latent content of narrative metaphors offers both speaker and hearer a unique insight into the experience of the narrator.<br>

Abstract: El artículo trata de resaltar tanto la especificidad como las dificultades en la comprensión de la comunicación política. Concebida ésta, desde Aristóteles, como singular combinación de racionalidad y emotividad, ha sido blanco de variados ataques. Estos abarcan desde la habitual desconfianza, intelectual y popular, hacia las prácticas políticas hasta la búsqueda, en filosofía y lógica, de un lenguaje puramente referencial o denotativo. Sin embargo, se argumenta aquí, entender el lenguaje político requiere conjugar otros enfoques sobre significado (antropología del lenguaje, pragmática de Austin y continuadores, teoría habermasiana de la acción comunicativa), diferentes entre sí, pero coincidentes en recuperar aspectos clave de la retórica clásica. También se apunta a algunas inevitables carencias de esos enfoques en materias tan complejas como las que tienen que ver con el lenguaje. /// This paper sets out to highlight both the specifíc nature and the difficulties of understanding political communication. Conceived since Aristotle's day as a singular combination of rationality and emotion, it has been the target of varied attacks. These range from the habitual distrust, intellectual and popular, of politics, to the quest, in philosophy and logic, of a purely referential or denotative language. However, the author contends that in order to understand political language, other approaches to its meaning must be taken into account (linguistic anthropology, the pragmatics of Austin and those who followed him, Habermas' theory of commuhicative action), which, while different in themselves, retrieve key aspects of classical rhetoric. The author also singles out certain inevitable shortfalls vis-à-vis these approaches in such complex fíelds as those related to language.<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo expone los principales resultados de una investigación realizada con el objeto de analizar el papel que cumplen las emociones colectivas en el mantenimiento del orden social. En concreto, trata de explicar el hecho de que las noticias más importantes que aparecen en los medios de comunicación sean noticias de horror, es decir, noticias en las que la muerte siempre aparece en el primer plano de la escena. Los informativos de los medios de comunicación expresan y fomentan la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. Ahora bien, para entender esta cultura es preciso determinar previamente la naturaleza emocional del horror, así como establecer una definición sociológica de este sentimiento. El horror es una emoción compleja compuesta por sentimientos de terror, de asco y de conmoción. El horror, sociológicamente, puede entenderse como "la emoción mediante la que un orden social señala sus límites más extremos". El estudio concluye señalando que existen dos modos alternativos de mantener el orden y la cohesión en el seno de un sistema social. El primer modo de legitimación, característico de las sociedades centrípetas, funciona mediante la gran potencia atractiva que ejerce sobre el campo social un núcleo central de valores sociales positivos. El segundo, característico de las sociedades centrífugas, funciona mediante la gran potencia repulsiva que ejercen sobre el campo social las transgresiones flagrantes del orden moral. El modo típico en el que las sociedades centrífugas regulan el orden social explica la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. /// This article sets out the main results obtained from a research study carried out for the purpose of analysing the role that collective emotions play in maintaining social order.

Abstract: This review explores the most significant dimensions and findings of phenomenological approaches in anthropology. We spell out the motives and implications inherent in such approaches, chronicle their historical dimensions and precursors, and address the ways in which they have contributed to analytic perspectives employed in anthropology. This article canvasses phenomenologically oriented research in anthropology on a number of topics, including political relations and violence; language and discourse; neurophenomenology; emotion; embodiment and bodiliness; illness and healing; pain and suffering; aging, dying, and death; sensory perception and experience; subjectivity; intersubjectivity and sociality; empathy; morality; religious experience; art, aesthetics, and creativity; narrative and storytelling; time and temporality; and senses of place. We examine, and propose salient responses to, the main critiques of phenomenological approaches in anthropology, and we also take note of some of the most pressing and generative avenues of research and thought in phenomenologically oriented anthropology.<br>

Abstract: In the twentieth century the phenomenon of the subjective body was integrated into ontology in philosophy, moving from Phenomenology to Existentialism. The rediscovery of the body and affect as a way of thinking also led contemporary cognitive science to the topic of the relationship between emotion and cognition, to the necessity of expanding the model of the mind and of experiencing emotions and physical sensation. The extension of the explanatory possibilities of a scholarly metalanguage into the area of the emotions and physical sensation is also important for the analysis of the acoustic aspect of lyric verse. In the acoustic flow of verse, the sounds of language have, apart from a phonemic function, their own sensuous (emotional) effect of the articulating body. In literary studies so far the acoustic flow has been interpreted only at the segmental level as a sequence of phonemes or sounds (for example in constructs of acoustic succession, phonetic instrumentation, or phonetic composition). At the suprasegmental level the acoustic flow must be conceived of as a sequence of syllables, a sequence of articulated phonations, the semantic movement of the phonemic flow. A syllable has no semantic value, but does have an experiential form, which influences motivation, behaviour, and experience. In addition to sonic and tonal modulation at the suprasegmental level, qualitative modulation, modulation of timbre, and the sequences of tones and of noise are also employed. In modelling the semantic movement of syllables in a phonemic flow the methodological approaches of experimental psychosemantics have been used. Connotational objectivization took place in three dimensions that were polarized on the basis of domestic and alien, light and darkness, activity and passivity, and research was conducted with a sample of 2,800 respondents. The analysis of the acoustic side of lyric verse would be incomplete if in addition to accentual rhythm and melody we did not also consider ~<br>

Abstract: "Empathy" and "contagion" are semantically related in their common reference to the suffering of infectious disease, spiritual and physical. How exactly do they differ as interpersonal phenomena? René Girard establishes a link between mimetic behavior and the contagious transference of emotion that spreads through groups of people, resulting in victimage. Jewish philosophers Edith Stein and Simone Weil distinguish such an emotional transference from genuine empathy, which involves a different, ethical stance and a saintly imitation. Empathy for the afflicted individual, in fact, makes one immune to the contagion that too often results in scapegoating.<br>

Article Title: Poetry Is Theft<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: complitstudies.51.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: In an infamous 1927 article, “Contra el secreto profesional” (“Against Professional Secrets”), Peruvian poet César Vallejo uses a similar metaphor to criticize the “false and epidermic” pan–Latin Americanism of Mistral, as well as the modish cosmopolitanism of other
         vanguardistawriters (including Borges). Echoing Emile Zola's “J'accuse,” Vallejo writes, “Acuso, pues, a mi generación de continuar los mismos métodos de plagio y de retórica de las pasadas generaciones, de las que ella reniega” (“I accuse, then, my generation of continuing the very same methods of plagiarism and rhetoric used by the past generations that they repudiate”).
               In direct opposition to the academicized poetic formulas borrowed from European Surrealism, Vallejo advocates particular elements of the Romantic ethic (notions of inspiration, honesty, authenticity, emotion, and the human), yet without drawing on its aesthetic. Vallejo's own poetry grows in part from an investigation of the linguistic function of “I,” that stuttering, fragmented convergence of energies. His poetry is not subjective, per se—it is an investigation of the61
            possibilityof subjectivity. His poems are shaped by a concern with the plasticity of language and the process of writing, ludic maneuvers, and a mix of registers (colloquial speech, and Peruvianisms romp with arcane scientific vocabulary) as he fashions a poetic form that corresponds to his sense of the contemporary.<br>

Abstract: Asyndeton increases the sense of speed and energy by disregarding normal punctuation. It can be valuable if one attempts to convey motion, tumult, and vigor as part of an exceptional memory. This device also helps to involve the reader in the scene. However, it is actually the use of polysyndeton that carries the most nostalgic value. “And” in normal context signals both the oral and the ordinary, such as a single occurrence in an opening phrase such as, “And then we went there.” The repetitive “and” has another connotation: that of pathos and expansive emotions. In Genesis 1:2 we find it contributing to the high-toned style: “And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” Polysyndeton has the capacity, as in the example from
         Gatsby, to infuse a text with awe, pathos, and poignancy. Its general seriousness combines well with lyricism or symbolism to establish the gravity of the nostalgic emotion, as opposed to more ironic or satirical moods.<br>

Abstract: In the same line of argument as House's, Stephen Halliwell states in
         Aristotle's Poeticsthat pity and fear refer specifically to the “capacity to sympathize with the sufferer.” He emphasizes that “Aristotle does not derive this sympathy from an undifferentiated sense of humanity: instead, he takes it to be rooted in a felt or perceived affinity between the subject and the object of the emotion.” In that regard, tragic characters “have to be within the reach of an audience's compassion” (175–79). When we see actors perform on stage, we become direct witnesses to their fate. In narratives, the poet/novelist achieves the same effects by providing us with realistic details that bring the characters to life so that we can begin to know them. In B. L. Ullman's understanding, “pitiful and fearful situations are better produced by the structure of the story than by actual scenes on the stage. But those, who through such scenes produce not fear but mere sensationalism, have nothing to do with tragedy” (26). Stories become relevant to readers or audiences in the totality of their elements, through which the story reflects plausible events to the readers themselves. Paul Ricoeur's understanding of the function of poetry, as indicated in the epigraph, goes to the core of the relation of narrative and ethics. Poetry enables the imagination to piece together, in ways acceptable to human flourishing, bits of human conduct, the elements of our happiness and misfortune. He explains in “Life in Quest of Narrative,” that by “means of poetry we learn how reversals and fortune result from this or that conduct, as this is constructed by the plot in the narrative” (23). Ricoeur differentiates between phronetic (prudential), and theoretical/scientific understanding of human nature. Narratives provide the former, while science provides the latter. In line with Ricoeur, Richard Kearney states in “Narrative and Ethics” that “what is peculiar to the ethical quality of narrative unders~<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Perhaps the resemblance between rhetorical invention and utopia is best illustrated in Plato's dialogue
         Phaedrus. Plato disparaged rhetoric in his earlier philosophical writings, particularly in theGorgias, where he claims that rhetoric is nothing but flattery; it panders to the public and works only to have power for the moment, by showing off with glamour and stirring up desire. For Plato, rhetoric, like the concept of utopia to most twentieth-century Marxists, was an unrealistic waste of time and a useless dream of escape. But in his later works, Plato changed his mind about rhetoric, just as Marcuse changed his about the usefulness of utopia as a concept in history. In thePhaedrus, Socrates is in love with the interlocutor in his dialogue, a young man who is intelligent but easily swayed by shows of verbal/symbolic skill and emotional power—the very propagandistic techniques that Marcuse would scrutinize in the need for a reeducation of desire. Socrates, voicing Plato's mature understanding of the function of rhetoric when it is used for the betterment of society, tells the young Phaedrus that “the function of oratory is to influence men's souls.”
               For the wisest of orators, who would be the best of political and cultural leaders, the art of rhetoric is one that is informed by long study of human nature but also by a divine inspiration. The inventor in this type of rhetorical work is possessed with a kind of love, a divine Eros, by which he or she leads the multitudes to the good, tempered by self-control. In effect, he conceives of rhetoric as a kind of erotic love that seeks to persuade the beloved (that is, the audience, whether an individual or the social collective in a state). The function of Plato's rhetoric in the30
            Phaedrus, like Marcuse's and Bloch's function of utopia, is to use imagination and emotion to lead constituents toward belief in a fuller humanity, a true expression of the good in human nature.<br>
