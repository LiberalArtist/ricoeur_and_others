  Book Title: Superchurch-The Rhetoric and Politics of American Fundamentalism<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Edwards Jonathan J.<br>
  Abstract: Christian Fundamentalism is a doctrine and a discourse in tension. Fundamentalists describe themselves as both marginal and a majority. They announce the imminent end of the world while building massive megachurches and political lobbying organizations. They speak of the need for purity and separation from the outside world while continually innovating in their search for more effective and persuasive ways to communicate with and convert outsiders. To many outsiders, Fundamentalist speech seems contradictory, irrational, intolerant, and dangerously antidemocratic. To understand the complexity of Fundamentalism, we have to look inside the tensions and the paradoxes. We have to take seriously the ways in which Fundamentalists describe themselves to themselves, and to do that, we must begin by exploring the central role of "the church" in Fundamentalist rhetoric and politics. Drawing on five fascinating case studies,
      Superchurchblends a complex yet readable treatment of rhetorical and political theory with a sophisticated approach to Fundamentalism that neither dismisses its appeal nor glosses over its irresolvable tensions. Edwards challenges theories of rhetoric, counterpublics, deliberation, and civility while offering critical new insights into the evolution and continuing influence of one of the most significant cultural and political movements of the past century.<br>

  Book Title: Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy-The Living Art of Michael C. Leff<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Henry David<br>
  Abstract: What distinguishes the study of rhetoric from other pursuits in the liberal arts? From what realms of human existence and expression, of human history, does such study draw its defining character? What, in the end, should be the purposes of rhetorical inquiry? And amid so many competing accounts of discourse, power, and judgment in the contemporary world, how might scholars achieve these purposes through the attitudes and strategies that animate their work?
      Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy: The Living Art of Michael C. Leffoffers answers to these questions by introducing the central insights of one of the most innovative and prolific rhetoricians of the twentieth century, Michael C. Leff. This volume charts Leff 's decades-long development as a scholar, revealing both the variety of topics and the approach that marked his oeuvre, as well as his long-standing critique of the disciplinary assumptions of classical, Hellenistic, renaissance, modern, and postmodern rhetoric.Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy includes a synoptic introduction to the evolution of Leff 's thought from his time as a graduate student in the late 1960s to his death in 2010, as well as specific commentary on twenty-four of his most illuminating essays and lectures.<br>

  Abstract: In the second main section of
                  Permanence and Change, near the end of the chapter entitled “The Range of Piety,” Kenneth Burke presents us with an unlikely vision. Imagine, says Burke, a scene where Matthew Arnold is found “loafing on the corner with the gashouse gang.” Picture Arnold studiously trying to ape the style of his buddies—the casual lean on the lamppost, the cut of a cap across the eyes, the demeanor of calculated indifference. It is a wildly implausible scene, and Arnold emerges as a hapless figure. Witness, says Burke, “the crudeness of his perception as regards the<br>

Compatriots, Weil and Girard each retell the long story of French history from the Middle Ages, beginning in medias res and dwelling upon many of the same modern turning points—1789, 1815, 1914, 1940. Girard explicitly links his own childhood memories of the war years with the Free French radio broadcasts from London and the names of Maurice<br>

  Abstract: I address in this book the relationship between the mass media and Christian ʺtribesʺ in America. At its core this relationship is a dynamic tension between civil generality, on the one hand, and a sectarian particularity, on the other. The Christian metanarrative of transcendence assumes a theistic perspective where God acts in real human history; this God-oriented view of human affairs is never fully in accord with the mainstream mediaʹs own subnarratives of immanence, which morally assume that human action is the beginning and end of history.

  Book Title: Alef, Mem, Tau-Kabbalistic Musings on Time, Truth, and Death<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfson Elliot R.<br>
  Abstract: This highly original, provocative, and poetic work explores the nexus of time, truth, and death in the symbolic world of medieval kabbalah. Demonstrating that the historical and theoretical relationship between kabbalah and western philosophy is far more intimate and extensive than any previous scholar has ever suggested, Elliot R. Wolfson draws an extraordinary range of thinkers such as Frederic Jameson, Martin Heidegger, Franz Rosenzweig, William Blake, Julia Kristeva, Friedrich Schelling, and a host of kabbalistic figures into deep conversation with one another.
      Alef, Mem, Taualso discusses Islamic mysticism and Buddhist thought in relation to the Jewish esoteric tradition as it opens the possibility of a temporal triumph of temporality and the conquering of time through time. The framework for Wolfson's examination is the rabbinic teaching that the wordemet,"truth," comprises the first, middle, and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet,alef, mem,andtau,which serve, in turn, as semiotic signposts for the three tenses of time-past, present, and future. By heeding the letters ofemetwe discern the truth of time manifestly concealed in the time of truth, the beginning that cannot begin if it is to be the beginning, the middle that re/marks the place of origin and destiny, and the end that is the figuration of the impossible disclosing the impossibility of figuration, the finitude of death that facilitates the possibility of rebirth. The time of death does not mark the death of time, but time immortal, the moment of truth that bestows on the truth of the moment an endless beginning of a beginningless end, the truth of death encountered incessantly in retracing steps of time yet to be taken-between, before, beyond.<br>

  Abstract: In considering languages of grief in relation to languages of certainty, there is a tension in the ways death can be thought of in connection to modern knowledge. On the one hand, we can consider death as that which underlies the possibility of knowledge, as that end point to the fostering or disallowing of life that stands for the modern configuration of power/knowledge (as Foucault [1978] had it). And on the other hand, we can imagine death as that which cannot be spoken in languages of modernity (as de Certeau [1986] suggested). Put differently, this is the distinction between death<br>

Profitable discussion of Italian affairs in this period must therefore make careful distinctions of place. This caveat is, indeed, particularly true for the period following the Peace of Bologna, early in 1530, which brought to an end the Italian phase of the Hapsburg-Valois wars; it marked the conclusion of a long ordeal which,<br>

  Book Title: The Fate of Place-A Philosophical History<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Casey Edward S.<br>
  Abstract: In this imaginative and comprehensive study, Edward Casey, one of the most incisive interpreters of the Continental philosophical tradition, offers a philosophical history of the evolving conceptualizations of place and space in Western thought. Not merely a presentation of the ideas of other philosophers,
      The Fate of Placeis acutely sensitive to silences, absences, and missed opportunities in the complex history of philosophical approaches to space and place. A central theme is the increasing neglect of place in favor of space from the seventh century A.D. onward, amounting to the virtual exclusion of place by the end of the eighteenth century. Casey begins with mythological and religious creation stories and the theories of Plato and Aristotle and then explores the heritage of Neoplatonic, medieval, and Renaissance speculations about space. He presents an impressive history of the birth of modern spatial conceptions in the writings of Newton, Descartes, Leibniz, and Kant and delineates the evolution of twentieth-century phenomenological approaches in the work of Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Bachelard, and Heidegger. In the book's final section, Casey explores the postmodern theories of Foucault, Derrida, Tschumi, Deleuze and Guattari, and Irigaray.<br>

  Abstract: Upon losing their homeland at the end of the Algerian War of Independence in 1962, the community of Pieds-Noirs, or former French citizens of Algeria, set out to protect their fragile memories through literature, photography and film. Every year the communities gather together in France to commemorate their exodus, and each reunion is guided by images of colonial Algeria. As the ageing Pieds-Noirs assemble, so do fragments of their past: school photos endlessly emerge from Pieds-Noirs seeking to identify lost or forgotten classmates, and iconic Algerian monuments reappear in slide presentations, films, photodocumentaries, paintings and websites. The Pieds-Noirs are eager<br>

  Abstract: Today, the study of sexuality brings together scholars from a wide variety of disciplines – history, politics, literature, religion, the arts, psychology, anthropology, medicine, and biology. At its best, this interdisciplinary work promotes critical self-reflection on disciplinary assumptions about sexuality and the data used to test those assumptions: Is there such a thing as a fixed sexuality and how would one prove its existence? Such questions have arisen ever since the emergence of the concept of ‘sexuality’ at the end of the eighteenth century.

  Book Title: Lyric Apocalypse: Milton, Marvell, and the Nature of Events-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Netzley Ryan<br>
  Abstract: What's new about the apocalypse? Revelation does not allow us to look back after the end and enumerate pivotal turning points. It happens in an immediate encounter with the transformatively new. John Milton's and Andrew Marvell's lyrics attempt to render the experience of such an apocalyptic change in the present. In this respect they take seriously the Reformation's insistence that eschatology is a historical phenomenon. Yet these poets are also reacting to the Regicide, and, as a result, their works explore very modern questions about the nature of events, what it means for a significant historical occasion to happen. Lyric Apocalypse argues that Milton's and Marvell's lyrics challenge any retrospective understanding of events, including one built on a theory of revolution. Instead, these poems show that there is no "after" to the apocalypse, that if we are going to talk about change, we should do so in the present, when there is still time to do something about it. For both of these poets, lyric becomes a way to imagine an apocalyptic event that would be both hopeful and new.<br>

  Book Title: Crediting God: Sovereignty and Religion in the Age of Global Capitalism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatter Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Tocqueville suggested that the people reign in the American political world like God over the universe.This intuition anticipates the crisis in the secularization paradigm that has brought theology back as a fundamental part of sociological and political analysis. It has become more difficult to believe that humanity's progress necessarily leads to atheism, or that it is possible to translate all that is good about religion into reasonable terms acceptable in principle by all, believers as well as nonbelievers. And yet, the spread of Enlightenment values, of an independent public sphere, and of alternative projects of modernitycontinues unabated and is by no means the antithesis of the renewed vigor of religious beliefs.The essays in this book shed interdisciplinary and multicultural light on a hypothesis that helps to account for such an unexpected convergence of enlightenment and religion in our times: Religion has reentered the public sphere because it puts into question the relation between God and the concept of political sovereignty.In the first part, Religion and Polity-Building,new perspectives are brought to bear on the tension-ridden connection between theophany and state-building from the perspective of world religions. Globalized, neo-liberal capitalism has been another crucial factor in loosening the bond between God and the state, as the essays in the second part, The End of the Saeculum and Global Capitalism,show.The essays in the third part, Questioning Sovereignty: Law and Justice,are dedicated to a critique of the premises of political theology, starting from the possibility of a prior, perhaps deeper relation between democracy and theocracy. The book concludes with three innovative essays dedicated to examining Tocqueville in order to think the Religion of Democracybeyond the idea of civil religion.<br>

Instead, I want to turn to the question of justice (the preoccupation of the Hebrew Bible), for the infusion of this ethical concern is vital: political life must be lived under the horizon of justice.

This led to a paradoxical situation in which Heidegger’s readings are most compelling when they undermine his own portrayal of them. The first of these observations impacts on how we read Heidegger: if we take Heidegger’s refusal of exegesis seriously, we cannot perform an exegesis of Heidegger’s readings, but rather the preservation of a preservation.<br>

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, eac~<br>

  Abstract: In
                     The God Who May Be, Richard Kearney has given us a gift whose power to provoke thought is out of proportion to its small size. Its opening sentences read as follows: “God neither is nor is not but may be. That is my thesis in this volume. What I mean by this is that God, who is traditionally thought of as act or actuality, might better be rethought as possibility. To this end I am proposing here a new hermeneutics of religion which explores and evaluates two rival ways of interpreting the divine—theeschatologicaland theonto-theological.”¹<br>

  Abstract: To end with a discussion of the work of Maurice Blanchot is rife with difficulties, two of which I will mention by way of beginning. The first involves the sheer difficulty of reading his work. While to be sure, this seems to be something of a “side issue,” it is one with important consequences: An encounter with Blanchot’s texts—whether those of his fiction, his criticism or the aphoristic, fragmentary texts of the later years—induces a deep feeling of exposure and vertigo, the negativity or indeterminacy of which is hardly conceivable as a mediating moment toward a higher reconciliation,<br>

  Book Title: Technologies of Life and Death: From Cloning to Capital Punishment-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oliver Kelly<br>
  Abstract: The central aim of this book is to approach contemporary problems raised by technologies of life and death as ethical issues that call for a more nuanced approach than mainstream philosophy can provide. To do so, it draws on the recently published seminars of Jacques Derrida to analyze the extremes of birth and dying insofar as they are mediated by technologies of life and death. With an eye to reproductive technologies, it shows how a deconstructive approach can change the very terms of contemporary debates over technologies of life and death, from cloning to surrogate motherhood to capital punishment, particularly insofar as most current discussions assume some notion of a liberal individual. The ethical stakes in these debates are never far from political concerns such as enfranchisement, citizenship, oppression, racism, sexism, and the public policies that normalize them. Technologies of Life and Death thus provides pointers for rethinking dominant philosophical and popular assumptions about nature and nurture, chance and necessity, masculine and feminine, human and animal, and what it means to be a mother or a father. In part, the book seeks to disarticulate a tension between ethics and politics that runs through these issues in order to suggest a more ethical politics by turning the force of sovereign violence back against itself. In the end, it proposes that deconstructive ethics with a psychoanalytic supplement can provide a corrective for moral codes and political cliches that turn us into mere answering machines.<br>

Despite the attempts to restore humanism to a spiritualist, Marxist, or existentialist form, the great humanist tradition could not withstand the dual trauma of Auschwitz and Hiroshima, in which the opposite of humanity laid waste to the very idea of humanity.¹ Regardless of the direct and even instrumental conditions that underpin the drafting of the “Letter,” the need of such an epistemological break is central to Heidegger’s text: a culture<br>

  Book Title: Dis-Enclosure: The Deconstruction of Christianity-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Smith Michael B.<br>
  Abstract: This book is a profound and eagerly anticipated investigation into what is left of a monotheistic religious spirit-notably, a minimalist faith that is neither confessional nor credulous. Articulating this faith as works and as an objectless hope, Nancy deconstructs Christianity in search of the historical and reflective conditions that provided its initial energy. Working through Blanchot and Nietzsche, re-reading Heidegger and Derrida, Nancy turns to the Epistle of Saint James rather than those of Saint Paul, discerning in it the primitive essence of Christianity as hope. The religion that provided the exit from religion,as he terms Christianity, consists in the announcement of an end. It is the announcement that counts, however, rather than any finality. In this announcement there is a proximity to others and to what was once called parousia. But parousia is no longer presence; it is no longer the return of the Messiah. Rather, it is what is near us and does not cease to open and to close, a presence deferred yet imminent.In a demystified age where we are left with a vision of a self-enclosed world-in which humans are no longer mortals facing an immortal being, but entities whose lives are accompanied by the time of their own decline-parousia stands as a question. Can we venture the risk of a decentered perspective, such that the meaning of the world can be found both inside and outside, within and without our so-immanent world?The deconstruction of Christianity that Nancy proposes is neither a game nor a strategy. It is an invitation to imagine a strange faith that enacts the inadequation of life to itself. Our lives overflow the self-contained boundaries of their biological and sociological interpretations. Out of this excess, wells up a fragile, overlooked meaning that is beyond both confessionalism and humanism.<br>

  Book Title: Italian Irish Filmmakers-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lourdeaux Lee<br>
  Abstract: "This penetrating study examines how these filmmakers confronted their cultural heritage and used it as a counterpoint to their depiction of mainstream America." --American Cinematographer In this unique film history, Lee Lourdeaux traces the impact of Irish and Italian cultures on four major American directors and their work. Defining the core values and tensions within each culture, and especially focusing on the influence of American Catholicism, he presents John Ford, Frank Capra, Francis Coppola, and Martin Scorsese as ethnic Americans and film artists. Lourdeaux shows each filmmaker on set with writers and actors, learning to bypass stereotypes in order to develop a shrewd reciprocal assimilation between his ethnic background and Anglo America. Beginning with D. W. Griffith's depiction of Irish and Italian immigrants, the author discusses Hollywood's stereotypical portrayals of ethnic priests, cops, politicians, and gangsters, as well as their surface acculturation in the movies of the 1920s. By the decade's end, John Ford was using all-American stories to embody the basic myths and tensions of Irish-American life. In his later westerns and foreign films, he tried to understand both Irish political strife and the key figures of Irish liturgy. Frank Capra pitted Italian family values against the Anglo success ethic, turning out social comedies about oppressed little people. Several decades later, Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola were highly critical of their religio-ethnic heritage, though they gradually discovered that to outline its weaknesses, like the blind pursuit of success, was to fashion a critical mirror of mainstream America. Lourdeaux discusses a number of recent films by Coppola and by Scorsese that have not yet been analyzed in any book. And, in the chapter on Scorsese, a personal interview with the director reveals how his ethnic childhood shaped his work in film. Examining the conflicts within American culture, Lourdeaux shows how the filmmake~<br>

The first is in 12:15, citing Zech 9:9 at the triumphal entry, and the second is in 19:37, citing Zech 12:10b at the end of<br>

  Book Title: Tropical Apocalypse-Haiti and the Caribbean End Times<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): Munro Martin<br>
  Abstract: The author begins by situating the question of the Caribbean apocalypse in relation to broader, global narratives of the apocalyptic present, notably Slavoj Žižek's
      Living in the End Times.Tracing the evolution of apocalyptic thought in Caribbean literature from Negritude up to the present, he notes the changes from the early work of Aimé Césaire; through an anti-apocalyptic period in which writers such as Frantz Fanon, Antonio Benítez-Rojo, Édouard Glissant, and Michael Dash have placed more emphasis on lived experience and the interrelatedness of cultures and societies; to a contemporary stage in which versions of the apocalyptic reappear in the work of David Scott and Mark Anderson.<br>

  Abstract: There is in Haiti and elsewhere a curious relationship between utopian discourse and apocalyptic outcomes. One might argue that many of the apocalyptic wars of the twentieth century were driven and justified by utopian discourses—Marxism, fascism, religions, and various forms of nationalism. The fall of the Berlin Wall seemed to announce the start of the “happy ’90s,” and gave rise to Francis Fukuyama’s utopian idea of the “end of history,” the belief that “liberal democracy had, in principle, won out, that the advent of a global liberal community was hovering around the corner, and that the obstacles to this<br>

  Abstract: Although things are not living beings, in a metaphorical sense they can be considered to have lives. Things are made; they often do something; and over time many things move from place to place. Their meanings and functions change in different contexts. As time goes by things age and eventually they end up at a final resting place where they gradually disintegrate. Things can reach very different ages, from a few minutes to many millennia, but once dead only very few are brought back, for example as antiques or collectables, and given additional meanings in a new life.

  Abstract: At the end of World War II, more than 10,000 Jewish children in France found themselves without one or both of their parents. By “children,” I refer to boys and girls who were between infancy and adolescence (up to age fifteen or sixteen) when they first experienced the sudden, violent separation from a parent. Most of these orphaned or semi-orphaned children had been born in France to impoverished immigrants from eastern Europe who had arrived there in the 1920s and 1930s; some came from more well-to-do immigrant families, and a few were from families of established “israélites” (as the euphemism<br>

  Book Title: Time-A Vocabulary of the Present<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Elias Amy J.<br>
  Abstract: Featuring twenty essays that reveal what we talk about when we talk about time today, especially in the areas of history, measurement, and culture, each essay pairs two keywords to explore the tension and nuances between them, from "past/future" and "anticipation/unexpected" to "extinction/adaptation" and "serial/simultaneous." Moving beyond the truisms of postmodernism, the collection newly theorizes the meanings of temporality in relationship to aesthetic, cultural, technological, and economic developments in the postwar period. This book thus assumes that time-not space, as the postmoderns had it-is central to the contemporary period, and that through it we can come to terms with what contemporaneity can be for human beings caught up in the historical present. In the end,
      Timereveals that the present is a cultural matrix in which overlapping temporalities condition and compete for our attention. Thus each pair of terms presents two temporalities, yielding a generative account of the time, or times, in which we live.<br>

  Abstract: Among the questions we asked our interviewees in 2005–6 was what being British meant to them. Their responses reflect the precise historical moment in which this project took place: the end of the first decade of devolution, the recent 9/11 and 7/7 attacks and bombings, an intense focus on asylum and immigration, and an attempt to reinstate Britishness as an explicit point of collective identification. Starting by outlining some of the theories of national belonging, we will go on to present and analyse responses picked up in our fieldwork.

  Book Title: Cities of Affluence and Anger-A Literary Geography of Modern Englishness<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): KALLINEY PETER J.<br>
  Abstract: Providing a compact literary history of the twentieth century in England, Cities of Affluence and Anger studies the problematic terms of national identity during England's transition from an imperial power to its integration in the global cultural marketplace. While the countryside had been the dominant symbol of Englishness throughout the previous century, modern literature began to turn more and more to the city to redraw the boundaries of a contemporary cultural polity. The urban class system, paradoxically, still functioned as a marker of wealth, status, and hierarchy throughout this long period of self-examination, but it also became a way to project a common culture and mitigate other forms of difference. Local class politics were transformed in such a way that enabled the English to reframe a highly provisional national unity in the context of imperial disintegration, postcolonial immigration, and, later, globalization.Kalliney plots the decline of the country-house novel through an analysis of Forster's Howards End and Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, each ruthless in its sabotage of the trope of bucolic harmony. The traditionally pastoral focus of English fiction gives way to a high-modernist urban narrative, exemplified by Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, and, later, to realists such as Osborne and Sillitoe, through whose work Kalliney explores postwar urban expansion and the cultural politics of the welfare state. Offering fresh new readings of Lessing's The Golden Notebook and Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, the author considers the postwar appropriation of domesticity, the emergence of postcolonial literature, and the renovation of travel narratives in the context of globalization. Kalliney suggests that it is largely one city--London--through which national identity has been reframed. How and why this transition came about is a process that Cities of Affluence and Anger depicts with exceptional insight and originality.<br>

These efforts at evangelization alongside social reform among university youth in Brazil in the late 1950s and early 1960s preceded similar official changes in the Catholic Church with Vatican II (1962–1965) and the Bishops’ Conference in Medellín in 1968.

In theology, such narratives range from biblical to confessional literature, as well in the twentieth century to the positing of narrative theology either in place of or as complement to systematic theology.¹ Theology has as its chief end greater understanding of the divine and of the relationship of the divine to creation, in particular to humankind. That project has led theologians to consider human nature and behavior at great length, often with impassioned interest, although not always<br>

With respect to the utopian tradition, however, as A. L.

  Book Title: Crossing the Rubicon: The Borderlands of Philosophy and Theology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Shank Reuben<br>
  Abstract: In France today, philosophy--phenomenology in particular--finds itself in a paradoxical relation to theology. Some debate a "theological turn." Others disavow theological arguments as if such arguments would tarnish their philosophical integrity, while nevertheless carrying out theology in other venues. In Crossing the Rubicon, Emmanuel Falque seeks to end this face-off. Convinced that "the more one theologizes, the better one philosophizes," he proposes a counterblow by theology against phenomenology. Instead of another philosophy of "the threshold" or "the leap"--and through a retrospective and forward-looking examination of his own method--he argues that an encounter between the two disciplines will reveal their mutual fruitfulness and their true distinctive borders. Falque shows that he has made the crossing between philosophy and theology and back again with audacity and perhaps a little recklessness, knowing full well that no one thinks without exposing himself to risk.<br>

  Abstract: The notion of French exceptionalism is deeply embedded in the nation's self-image and in a range of political and academic discourses. Recently, the debate about whether France really is "exceptional" has acquired a critical edge. Against the background of introspection about the nature of "national identity," some proclaim "normalisation" and the end of French exceptionalism, while others point out to the continuing evidence that France remains distinctive at a number of levels, from popular culture to public policy. This book explores the notion of French exceptionalism, places it in its European context, examines its history and evaluate its continuing relevance in a range of fields from politics and public policy to popular culture and sport.<br>

  Abstract: Contrary to the negative assessments of the social order that have become prevalent in the media since 9/11, this wide-ranging collection of essays, mostly by social anthropologists, focuses instead on the enormous social creativity being invested as collective identities are reconfigured. Using fieldwork findings drawn from Africa, Asia, and Europe, special emphasis is placed on the reformulation of ethnic and gender relationships and identities in the cultural, social, political, and religious realms of public life. Under what circumstances does trust arise, paving the way for friendship, collegiality, knowledge creation, national unity, or emergence of leadership? How is social life constructed as a collective endeavour? Does the means towards sociability become its end? And what can be said about the agency and collegiality of women? The inspiration for examining these conundrums is the work and persona of Shirley Ardener, to whom the volume is dedicated.<br>

  Book Title: Death's Following: Mediocrity, Dirtiness, Adulthood, Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>

  Abstract: Almost all twentieth-century philosophy stresses the immanence of death in human life-as drive (Freud), as the context of Being (Heidegger), as the essence of our defining ethics (Levinas), or as language (de Man, Blanchot). In Death's Following, John Limon makes use of literary analysis (of Sebald, Bernhard, and Stoppard), cultural analysis, and autobiography to argue that death is best conceived as always transcendentally beyond ourselves, neither immanent nor imminent. Adapting Kierkegaard's variations on the theme of Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac while refocusing the emphasis onto Isaac, Limon argues that death should be imagined as if hiding at the end of an inexplicable journey to Moriah. The point is not to evade or ignore death but to conceive it more truly, repulsively, and pervasively in its camouflage: for example, in jokes, in logical puzzles, in bowdlerized folk songs. The first of Limon's two key concepts is adulthood: the prolonged anti-ritual for experiencing the full distance on the look of death. His second is dirtiness, as theorized in a Jewish joke, a logical exemplum, and T. S. Eliot's "Ash Wednesday": In each case, unseen dirt on foreheads suggests the invisibility of inferred death. Not recognizing death immediately or admitting its immanence and imminence is for Heidegger the defining characteristic of the "they," humanity in its inauthentic social escapism. But Limon vouches throughout for the mediocrity of the "they" in its dirty and ludicrous adulthood. Mediocrity is the privileged position for previewing death, in Limon's opinion: practice for being forgotten. In refusing the call of twentieth-century philosophy to face death courageously, Limon urges the ethical and aesthetic value of mediocre anti-heroism.<br>

  Abstract: Just how serious was Socrates when he claimed to know nothing? “When Socrates said that he was without knowledge [uvidende],” Kierkegaard writes, summing up his treatment of Socratic irony near the end of his thesis, “he nevertheless did know something, for he knew about his ignorance [Uvidenhed]; on the other hand, however, this knowledge [Viden] was not a knowledge of something.”¹ At stake, as always for Kierkegaard, is therefore the degree to which the negativity of irony—its own nothingness—is serious; is to be, or can be, taken in earnest.

  Book Title: Ascent into Heaven in Luke-Acts-New Explorations of Luke's Narrative Hinge<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Pao David W.<br>
  Abstract: In comparison with other aspects of Jesus’ life and ministry, his ascent into heaven has often been overlooked within the history of the church. However, considering its placement at the end of the Gospel and the beginning of Acts—the only narrative depictions of the event in the New Testament—the importance of Jesus’ ascent into heaven is undeniable for Luke’s two-volume work. While select studies have focused on particular aspects of these accounts for Luke’s story, the importance of the ascension calls for renewed attention to the narratological and theological significance of these accounts within their historical and literary contexts. In this volume, leading scholars discuss the ascension narratives within the ancient contexts of biblical, Second Temple Jewish, and Greco-Roman literature; the literary contours of Luke-Acts; and questions of historical and theological significance in the wider milieu of New Testament theology and early Christian historiography. The volume sets out new positions and directions for the next generations of interpreters regarding one of the most important and unique elements of the Lukan writings.<br>

  Book Title: Dealing with Dictators-The United States, Hungary, and East Central Europe, 1942-1989<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): VINCZ JASON<br>
  Abstract: Dealing with Dictators explores America's Cold War efforts to make the dictatorships of Eastern Europe less tyrannical and more responsive to the country's international interests. During this period, US policies were a mix of economic and psychological warfare, subversion, cultural and economic penetration, and coercive diplomacy. Through careful examination of American and Hungarian sources, László Borhi assesses why some policies toward Hungary achieved their goals while others were not successful. When George H. W. Bush exclaimed to Mikhail Gorbachev on the day the Soviet Union collapsed, "Together we liberated Eastern Europe and unified Germany," he was hardly doing justice to the complicated history of the era. The story of the process by which the transition from Soviet satellite to independent state occurred in Hungary sheds light on the dynamics of systemic change in international politics at the end of the Cold War.<br>

As Alasdair McIntyre observed in
                     After Virtue, the apodictic use of moral principles serves only to put an end to the ethical dialogue itself. In other words, the broad convergence on ethics in public debate almost never translates into ethical consensus.<br>

  Book Title: Reading Daniel as a Text in Theological Hermeneutics-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hebbard Aaron B.<br>
  Abstract: Reading Daniel as a Text in Theological Hermeneutics sets out to read the book of Daniel as a narrative textbook in the field of theological hermeneutics. Employing such disciplines as historical criticism, literary criticism, narrative theology, and hermeneutics, this work seeks to maintain an interdisciplinary outlook on the book of Daniel. Two inherently linked perspectives are utilized in this reading of Daniel. First is the perception that the character of Daniel is the paradigm of the good theological hermeneut; theology and hermeneutics are inseparable and converge in the character of Daniel. Readers must recognize in Daniel certain qualities, attitudes, abilities, and convictions well worth emulating. Essentially, readers must aspire to become a Daniel. Second is the standpoint that the book of Daniel on the whole should be read as a hermeneutics textbook. Readers are led through a series of theories and exercises meant to be instilled into their theological, intellectual, and practical lives. Attention to readers is a constant endeavor throughout this thesis. The concern is fundamentally upon contemporary readers and their communities, yet with sensible consideration given to the historical readerly community with which contemporary readers find continuity. Greater concentration is placed on what the book of Daniel means for contemporary readers than on what the book of Daniel meant in its historical setting. In the end, readers are left with difficult challenges, a sobering awareness of the volatility of the business of hermeneutics, and serious implications for readers to implement both theologically and hermeneutically.<br>

The readings are, in order, Shekalim (Exod 30:11–16), Zakhor (cited above), Parah (Num 19:1), and HaChodesh (Exod 12:1–20).³ One may argue that these readings lay out four essential pillars of Judaism: charitable giving, remembrance, ritual purity, and observance of sanctified time.⁴ These four areas are firmly intertwined, and a discussion of any one will necessarily involve<br>

The reason for such a drastic proclamation is simple. The boy (“John”) is Roman Catholic. This would be a “mixed marriage.” In the world of pre–Vatican II Presbyterianism this<br>

  Abstract: As the above excerpts indicate, writers of the South Asian diaspora self-consciously foreground their multiply positioned identities. In evoking their “many selves,” South Asian diasporic writers call upon a diverse range of literary fields, at least as they are defined in cultural and national terms. For instance, Cyril Dabydeen, Ottawa’s former poet laureate (1984–87) of Indo-Guyanese origin, can just as readily fall under the rubric of Canadian literature as that of English, Guyanese, Caribbean, Indo-Caribbean, South American, and South Asian literature. To this end, the Toronto-based diasporic writer M.G. Vassanji suggests: “The term

For many scholars and commentators, the words of the narrator to the audience in 20:30–31 mark the end of the original Johannine Gospel.¹ Increasingly, however, interpreters regard 21:1–25 as part of the original gospel.

  Book Title: Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fiction-Explorations in Readers' Engagement with Characters<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): CARACCIOLO MARCO<br>
  Abstract: A storyteller's craft can often be judged by how convincingly the narrative captures the identity and personality of its characters. In this book, the characters who take center stage are "strange" first-person narrators: they are fascinating because of how they are at odds with what the reader would wish or expect to hear-while remaining reassuringly familiar in voice, interactions, and conversations. Combining literary analysis with research in cognitive and social psychology, Marco Caracciolo focuses on readers' encounters with the "strange" narrators of ten contemporary novels, including Bret Easton Ellis's
      American Psycho, Haruki Murakami'sHard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, and Mark Haddon'sThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. Caracciolo explores readers' responses to narrators who suffer from neurocognitive or developmental disorders, who are mentally disturbed due to multiple personality disorder or psychopathy, whose consciousness is split between two parallel dimensions or is disembodied, who are animals, or who lose their sanity.A foray into current work on reception, reader-response, cognitive literary study, and narratology,Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fictionillustrates why any encounter with a fictional text is a complex negotiation of interlaced feelings, thoughts, experiences, and interpretations.<br>

Karl Marx had assumed that the organized working class would eventually engage in a successful political struggle against the ruling class alongside a background of systematic crises in the economic system. A wide range of explanations as to why this transformation did not take place has been developed over the decades after Marx’s death in 1883. At the end of the nineteenth century, it appeared that the condition of the German working class had improved, suggesting that capitalism could be reformed.<br>

  Book Title: Supper at Emmaus-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): OLSEN GLENN W.<br>
  Abstract: Supper at Emmaus traces various important intellectual topics from the ancient world to the modern period. Generally, as in its treatment of the question of whether the long-standing contrast between cyclical and linear views of history is helpful, it introduces important thinkers who have considered the question. A preoccupation of the book is the appearance and reappearance across the centuries of patterns used to organize temporal and cultural experience. After an opening essay on transcendental truth and cultural relativism, the second chapter traces a distinction, common in historical writings during the past two centuries, between an alleged ancient classical "cyclic" view of time and history, used to describe the claimed repetitiveness of and similarities between historical events ("nothing is new under the sun"), and a contrasting Jewish-Christian linear view, sometimes described as providential in that it moves through a series of unique events to some end intended by God. In the latter, history is "about something," the education of the human race or the redemption of humankind. As in each of the remaining essays, the book then attempts to draw out the limitations of what the current consensus on this topic has become. It does this for such things as our current understanding of religious toleration, humanism, natural law, and teleology. Some of the essays, such as those on debate about Augustine's understanding of marriage or the concluding illustrated essay on the baroque city of Lecce, are published for the first time. Others are based on previously published contributions to the scholarly literature, though generally each of these chapters concludes with a postscript that engages with current scholarly debate on the subject.<br>

  Book Title: The Intimate. Polity and the Catholic Church-Laws about Life, Death and the Family in So-called Catholic Countries<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): PÉREZ-AGOTE ALFONSO<br>
  Abstract: The waning influence of the Catholic church in the ethical and political debate. For centuries the Catholic Church was able to impose her ethical rules in matters related to the intimate, that is, questions concerning life (from its beginning until its end) and the family, in the so-called Catholic countries in Western Europe. When the polity started to introduce legislation that was in opposition to the Catholic ethic, the ecclesiastical authorities and part of the population reacted. The media reported massive manifestations in France against same-sex marriages and in Spain against the de-penalization of abortion. In Italy the Episcopal conference entered the political field in opposition to the relaxation of several restrictive legal rules concerning medically assisted procreation and exhorted the voters to abstain from voting so that the referendum did not obtain the necessary quorum. In Portugal, to the contrary, the Church made a “pact" with the prime minister so that the law on same-sex marriages did not include the possibility of adoption. And in Belgium the Episcopal conference limited its actions to clearly expressing with religious, legal, and anthropological arguments its opposition to such laws, which all other Episcopal conferences did also. In this book, the authors analyse the full spectrum of the issue, including the emergence of such laws; the political discussions; the standpoints defended in the media by professionals, ethicists, and politicians; the votes in the parliaments; the political interventions of the Episcopal conferences; and the attitude of professionals. As a result the reader understands what was at stake and the differences in actions of the various Episcopal conferences. The authors also analyse the pro and con evaluations among the civil population of such actions by the Church. Finally, in a comparative synthesis, they discuss the public positions taken by Pope Francis to evaluate if a change in Church policy might be possible i~<br>

As per Michel Foucault¹, new bio politics are being developed, a new “government of bodies” (according to Didier Fassin and Dominique Memmi²).

  Abstract: In the theory of autobiography, theoretical developments in literary studies are clearly reflected. From an earlier mimetic understanding of the genre as the representation of an autonomous and homogeneous self the pendulum swung to the deconstructionist view, dominant in the late 1970s and early 1980s. According to deconstructionist tenets, there can be no representation of self in language, but only an illusion of “self” generated by a purely textual subject. It was at this point that theorists like Michael Sprinker even went as far as to proclaim the “end of autobiography” (Sprinker 1980). Since the late 1980s, however, the pendulum<br>

The combination of culturalist critique, moral judgment, and risk-taking that these activities required and called forth signifies a change in the conceptualization of working and lower class life among male intellectuals in the 1890s, especially among those we associate with what we are calling the “discourse of the abyss.” If the model of the earnest<br>

His outspoken views were echoed by others such as Hippolyte Passy and Théobald Piscatory, both parliamentarians who were adamantly against colonial expansion.

  Book Title: New Romantic Cyborgs-Romanticism, Information Technology, and the End of the Machine<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Coeckelbergh Mark<br>
  Abstract: Romanticism and technology are widely assumed to be opposed to each other. Romanticism -- understood as a reaction against rationalism and objectivity -- is perhaps the last thing users and developers of information and communication technology (ICT) think about when they engage with computer programs and electronic devices. And yet, as Mark Coeckelbergh argues in this book, this way of thinking about technology is itself shaped by romanticism and obscures a better and deeper understanding of our relationship to technology. Coeckelbergh describes the complex relationship between technology and romanticism that links nineteenth-century monsters, automata, and mesmerism with twenty-first-century technology's magic devices and romantic cyborgs.Coeckelbergh argues that current uses of ICT can be interpreted as attempting a marriage of Enlightenment rationalism and romanticism. He describes the "romantic dialectic," when this new kind of material romanticism, particularly in the form of the cyborg as romantic figure, seems to turn into its opposite. He shows that both material romanticism and the objections to it are still part of modern thinking, and part of the romantic dialectic. Reflecting on what he calls "the end of the machine," Coeckelbergh argues that to achieve a more profound critique of contemporary technologies and culture, we need to explore not only different ways of thinking but also different technologies -- and that to accomplish the former we require the latter.<br>

  Toward the (Real) End of the Machine? from:

  Abstract: In the previous chapters I have employed the phrase “the end of the machine.” But what, exactly, does
                  endmean? I have used the term in at least two senses, meanings that can be clarified by looking briefly at Heidegger’s discussion of ending and death inBeing and Time(1927). In section 48, Heidegger distinguishes between, on the one hand, ending as stopping and disappearance, and on the other hand, ending as ripening and fulfillment (227). Whereas the former meaning is about termination, the latter concerns end as a telos, a purpose. It is about completion and fulfillment. Now whatever<br>

  Book Title: Time and the Shape of History-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): CORFIELD PENELOPE J.<br>
  Abstract: In its global approach the book is part of the new shift toward "big history," in which traditional period divisions are challenged in favor of looking at the entire past of the world from start to end. The approach is thematic. The result is a view of world history in which outcomes are shown to be explicable, once they happen, but not necessarily predictable before they do. This book will inform the work of historians of all periods and at all levels, and contributes to the current reconsideration of traditional period divisions (such as Modernity and Postmodernity), which the author finds outmoded.<br>

  Author(s) Corfield Penelope J.<br>
  Abstract: Paramount among the cataclysmic surprises that history might spring is the possibility of the imminent end of the world. After all, stylistically, an abrupt, transformational finale to any story remains one of the leading alternatives to the slow, gradual fade-out.¹ So perhaps the world will conclude not with a whimper after all, but instead with a bang. Fears and hopes about cosmic endings lead some to intense experiences of ‘time anxiety’ – although for all who worry there are others who scoff at the prospect and others still who just decide to wait and see.<br>

  Book Title: Contesting Democracy-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): MÜLLER JAN-WERNER<br>
  Abstract: This book is the first major account of political thought in twentieth-century Europe, both West and East, to appear since the end of the Cold War. Skillfully blending intellectual, political, and cultural history, Jan-Werner Müller elucidates the ideas that shaped the period of ideological extremes before 1945 and the liberalization of West European politics after the Second World War. He also offers vivid portraits of famous as well as unjustly forgotten political thinkers and the movements and institutions they inspired.Müller pays particular attention to ideas advanced to justify fascism and how they relate to the special kind of liberal democracy that was created in postwar Western Europe. He also explains the impact of the 1960s and neoliberalism, ending with a critical assessment of today's self-consciously post-ideological age.<br>

It was particularly severe in France and in England, where for a long time skeptical philosophies had undermined the foundations of Christian beliefs. By the end of the eighteenth century, the French masses, pressed by economic hardship, felt abandoned by a Church closely linked to a political regime indifferent to their suffering. In England, after two centuries of religious turmoil, the willingness of the Church to adapt its doctrine to the will of the sovereign had drained common people<br>

  Abstract: Western philosophy grew from that of the ancient Greeks at the end of the seventh century bce. Among the first were the Milesians: Thales (ca. 624–548 bce), Anaximander (ca. 611–547 bce), and Anaximenes (ca. 570–500 bce). As Geoffrey Lloyd recounted in 1970, this was a time of important technological progress, the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age. Classification developed from observation and rationalization. These early philosophers discovered nature and distinguished between natural and supernatural, and they then avoided the supernatural. Thales declared that gods were everywhere, but he left them there.<br>

  Book Title: Frontiers of History-Historical Inquiry in the Twentieth Century<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLEY DONALD R.<br>
  Abstract: This book, the third volume of Donald Kelley's monumental survey of Western historiography, covers the twentieth century, especially Europe. As in the first two volumes, the author discusses historical methods and ideas of all sorts to provide a detailed map of historical learning. Here he carries the survey forward to our own times, confronting directly the challenges of postmodernism and historical narrative. Kelley offers highly original discussions of historians of the last half century (including friends and mentors), the "linguistic turn," the "end of history," the philosophy of history, and various new methods of histories.The book focuses first on the state of the art of history in France, Germany, Britain, and the United States on the eve of World War I. Kelley then traces every important historiographical issue and development historians have encountered in the twentieth century. With the completion of this trilogy, Kelley presents the only comprehensive modern survey of historical writing. He provides an unparalleled portrait of the rich variety of historical method along with an insider's view of the challenges of capturing history on the written page.<br>

Many Soviet films of the twenties were devoted to consolidating a tradition for the new nation, commemorating its revolutionary founding in historical spectacles, like V. I. Pudovkin’s

  Book Title: Love and its Critics-From the Song of Songs to Shakespeare and Milton’s Eden<br>
  Publisher: Open Book Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Movsesian Arpi<br>
  Abstract: This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton’s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin’amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur’s phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself – in short, the very things it resists. The book engages with some of the seminal literature of the Western canon, including the Bible, the poetry of Ovid, and works by English authors such as William Shakespeare and John Donne, and with criticism that stretches from the earliest readings of the Song of Songs to contemporary academic literature. Lively and enjoyable in its style, it attempts to restore a sense of pleasure to the reading of poetry, and to puncture critical insistence that literature must be outwitted. It will be of value to professional, graduate, and advanced undergraduate scholars of literature, and to the educated general reader interested in treatments of love in poetry throughout history.<br>

  Abstract: The research work carried out by Sostris was based on the shared assumption that our subjects were active and resourceful individuals dealing with all kinds of challenges. This chapter puts this basic assumption to the test. Nicolás from Catalonia and Heike from eastern Germany, two well-educated young adults who, geographically speaking, happen to live at opposite ends of the EU, have both come to a dead end in their life journeys – a ‘biographical blockage’. Although we found it demanding enough to try to understand the processes that brought these two young people to this point, we also wanted to<br>

The cannons mentioned in the description of the battle, whether fired from the government or from the rebel side, owed a considerable debt to European military technology, as the war effort was heavily conditioned by the willingness of one Belgian Jesuit, Ferdinand Verbiest, to design and cast<br>

  Book Title: Dynastic Crisis and Cultural Innovation-From the Late Ming to the Late Qing and Beyond<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Wei Shang<br>
  Abstract: This volume addresses cultural and literary transformation in the late Ming (1550–1644) and late Qing (1851–1911) eras. Although conventionally associated with a devastating sociopolitical crisis, each of these periods was also a time when Chinese culture was rejuvenated. Focusing on the twin themes of crisis and innovation, the seventeen chapters in this book aim to illuminate the late Ming and late Qing as eras of literary-cultural innovation during periods of imperial disintegration; to analyze linkages between the two periods and the radical heritage they bequeathed to the modern imagination; and to rethink the “premodernity" of the late Ming and late Qing in the context of the end of the age of modernism. The chapters touch on a remarkably wide spectrum of works, some never before discussed in English, such as poetry, drama, full-length novels, short stories, tanci narratives, newspaper articles, miscellanies, sketches, familiar essays, and public and private historical accounts. More important, they intersect on issues ranging from testimony about dynastic decline to the negotiation of authorial subjectivity, from the introduction of cultural technology to the renewal of literary convention.<br>

  Abstract: In traditional Chinese poetry, the task of witnessing-especially on the subject of war and other political issues-was generally assumed to be male territory.

To this end, Zhu outlined a core group of reading skills: “playing with the savor of the text” (

  Abstract: Religion played a crucial role in European expansionism. Toward the end of the Middle Ages, the rise of the Spanish Empire, fostered by the myth of the Reconquista, blended nationalist and religious motives. According to that myth, “Spain was born as a nation convinced that God had entrusted it with the defense of the Catholic faith against all Muslims, Jews, heretics, and other unbelievers.”¹ Under that banner, the Spaniards invaded and explored the “New World … convinced that this was a sacred trust so that they could bring their religion to the benighted people in these lands.”²<br>

  Abstract: Anthropology’s venerable and unusual tradition of self-critique addresses its complicity with colonialism and has sought, moreover, to periodically reconstitute its political relevance by addressing social inequality worldwide (Asad 1980[1973]; Hymes 1969). Toward this end, anthropologists have absorbed the critical insights from allied disciplines and the broad parameters of nonpositivistic critique. One only has to think of Marx or the numerous anthropologists who have been influenced by the Frankfurt School and the multiple contemporary currents of Continental social theory more generally. In what follows, I explore the historical relation between the “linguistic turn” in social theory and the strides that anthropologists<br>

  Author(s): Saito Hiro<br>
  Abstract: Seventy years have passed since the end of the Asia-Pacific War, yet Japan remains embroiled in controversy with its neighbors over the war’s commemoration. Among the many points of contention between Japan, China, and South Korea are interpretations of the Tokyo War Crimes Trial, apologies and compensation for foreign victims of Japanese aggression, prime ministerial visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, and the war’s portrayal in textbooks. Collectively, these controversies have come to be called the “history problem." But why has the problem become so intractable? Can it ever be resolved, and if so, how? To answer these questions, Hiro Saito mobilizes the sociology of collective memory and social movements, political theories of apology and reconciliation, psychological research on intergroup conflict, and philosophical reflections on memory and history.<br>

On the one hand, literary descriptions before the eighteenth century were often stylistic exercises in rhetorical enumeration.

  Book Title: Return from Exile - Rückkehr aus dem Exil-Exiles, Returnees and Their Impact in the Humanities and Social Sciences in Austria and Central Europe<br>
  Publisher: Verlag der österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften<br>
  Author(s): PRISCHING MANFRED<br>
  Abstract: The tremendous loss to the humanities and social sciences in the 20th century resulting from the expulsion of thousands of scholars and artists from Austria and Central Europe has been well documented. The present collection of articles deals with a related but under-researched aspect – it combines analyses of the complex bureaucratic and the ideological obstacles which exiled scholars from a wide range of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences and creative artists faced when they were willing to return and specific essays documenting the varying opportunities for individual returnees to influence the development of their different disciplines after the end of the Nazi tyranny. The 27 essays highlight the roles of a number of returnees as generous mentors for younger scholars and their encouragement of modernization and internationalization in an atmosphere of stagnation and provincialism in the universities. Eminent experts in history, philosophy or political science who had returned were hampered by the denial of full academic appointments despite their highly stimulating initiatives, while theatre directors had a relatively strong impact on the programs in the theaters and the other media. The volume also illustrates personal factors, including the understandable hesitation of prominent intellectuals such as Oskar Morgenstern or Ernst Krenek to give up the advantages of US American citizenship for academic positions, especially in a country exposed to political threats in the Cold War; but the essays also bring out the fact that quite a few of the émigrés remained exiles on both sides of the Atlantic. A particular strength of the volume is the detailed consideration of the fortunes and the influence of the impressive array of exiled Austrian economists. Many of them returned from Britain, helping to shape economic theory and Austrian economic policy, even though necessarily mainly from outside the universities, while transatlantic exiles largely remain~<br>

Addressing how Canadian women religious envisioned and lived out the changes in religious life brought on by a pluralistic and secularizing world, Vatican II and Beyond analyzes the national organization of female and male congregations, the Canadian Religious Conference, and the lives of two individual sisters: visionary congregational leader Alice Trudeau and social justice activist Mary Alban. This book focuses on the new transnational networks, feminist concepts, professionalization of religious life, and complex political landscapes that emerged during this period of drastic transition as women religious sought to reconstruct identities, redefine roles, and signify vision and mission at both the personal and collective levels. Following women religious as they encountered new meanings of faith in their congregations, the Church, and society at large, Vatican II and Beyond demonstrates that the search for a renewed vision was not just a response to secularization, but a way to be reborn as Catholic women.The year 2015 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second Vatican Council, which aimed to align the Church with the modern world.

  Abstract: This essay develops the hypothesis that social death is utterly central to the evil of genocide, not just when a genocide is primarily cultural but even when it is homicidal on a massive scale. It is social death that enables us to distinguish the peculiar evil of genocide from the evils of other mass murders. Even genocidal murders can be viewed as extreme means to the primary end of social death. Social vitality exists through relationships, contemporary and intergenerational, that create an identity that gives meaning to a life. Major loss of social vitality is a loss of identity and<br>

It is various because it functioned in very diverse circumstances—in a Hellenic and in a Roman milieu, in Greek and in Latin, in democracies, aristocracies, and monarchies—and changed its fashions to suit each circumstance. And yet it is unified, because in this diversity of situations it constructed and preserved a fundamental identity.

Not surprisingly, historians are much better qualified to analyze the events of yesteryear than to predict what might happen tomorrow.

  Abstract: History defies linearity. In a time when, at least in the Western world, major issues appeared to be settled and some even predicted the “end of history,” drama has suddenly erupted elsewhere—and especially in the Muslim world. A political arena that in many respects seemed relatively stagnant has unexpectedly been gripped by radical turmoil and revolutionary fervor. This does not mean that such turmoil is ever completely unprepared or unmotivated. Contrary to their portrayal (by some academics) as near-apocalyptic interruptions beyond intelligibility, revolutions have precursors or conditioning factors; usually they are the product of a deep social malaise, of<br>

In the best case, the sense of where we are headed will make us aware of those texts most relevant to our question. This anticipation of a plausible end is also the condition of the possibility of ever being taught by the texts that an initial aim is untenable; the preconception of a systematic goal is what makes possible its verification or falsification along with the<br>

Its purpose was predominantly normative, even technical. Hermeneutics limited itself to giving methodological directions to the specifically interpretive sciences, with the end of avoiding arbitrariness in interpretation as far as possible. Virtually unknown to outsiders, it long maintained the status of an “auxiliary discipline” within the established disciplines that concerned themselves with interpreting texts<br>

  Book Title: Passage to Modernity-An Essay on the Hermeneutics of Nature and Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dupré Louis<br>
  Abstract: Did modernity begin with the Renaissance and end with post-modernity? In this book a distinguished scholar challenges both these assumptions. Louis Dupré discusses the roots, development, and impact of modern thought, tracing the fundamental principles of modernity to the late fourteenth century and affirming that modernity is still an influential force in contemporary culture.The combination of late medieval theology and early Italian humanism shattered the traditional synthesis that had united cosmic, human, and transcendent components in a comprehensive idea of nature. Early Italian humanism transformed the traditional worldview by its unprecedented emphasis on human creativity. The person emerged as the sole source of meaning while nature was reduced to an object and transcendence withdrew into a "supernatural" realm. Dupré analyzes this fragmentation as well as the writings of those who reacted against it-philosophers like Cusanus and Bruno, humanists like Ficino and Erasmus, theologians like Baius and Jansenius, mystics like Ignatius Loyola and Francis de Sales, and theosophists like Weigel and Boehme.Baroque culture briefly reunited the human, cosmic, and transcendent components, but since that time the disintegrating forces have increased in strength. Despite post-modern criticism, the principles of early modernity continue to dominate the climate of our time.
      Passage to Modernityis not so much a critique as a search for the philosophical meaning of the epochal change achieved by those principles.<br>

There were established chairs of history in the universities of Europe, especially in England, France, and Germany, as well as official historiographers, official collections of documents, and other kinds of private and public support for practitioners of history.¹ What was new in the Enlightenment was the encounters between history and philosophy, which had likewise, and even earlier, emerged as a professional field with an academic base.<br>

  Book Title: Types of Christian Theology-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Placher William C.<br>
  Abstract: In the book Frei proposes classifying theologians according to whether they see Christian theology primarily as an academic discipline or as an internal activity of Christian communities. He describes fie different variations of these views. the first, represented by Immanuel Kant and Gordon represented, regards theology as a philosophical discipline within the academy. The second, represented by theologians as diverse as represented represented, David Tracy, and Carl Henry, correlates specifically Christian with general cultural structures of meaning. The third type, represetned by represented represented and Paul represented, occupies the middle of the spectrum. The fourth type, represetned by Karl Barth, emphasizes the internal descriptive task of theology but remains open to ad hoc correlations with concerns of the wider culture. the fifth, which includes D. Z. Phillips and other Wittgensteinian fideists, opts for pure self-description though this group defends its position with philosophical arguments that, oddly enough connect it with the other end of the spectrum. Frei argues in favor of the third and fourth options. In his view, theologians like Schleiermacher and, even more, Barth, although often seen as polar opposites, enable theology to remain most faithful to the priority of the ecumenically attested literal sense in biblical interpretation.<br>

  Book Title: Detecting Texts-The Metaphysical Detective Story from Poe to Postmodernism<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Sweeney Susan Elizabeth<br>
  Abstract: Although readers of detective fiction ordinarily expect to learn the mystery's solution at the end, there is another kind of detective story-the history of which encompasses writers as diverse as Poe, Borges, Robbe-Grillet, Auster, and Stephen King-that ends with a question rather than an answer. The detective not only fails to solve the crime, but also confronts insoluble mysteries of interpretation and identity. As the contributors to
      Detecting Textscontend, such stories belong to a distinct genre, the "metaphysical detective story," in which the detective hero's inability to interpret the mystery inevitably casts doubt on the reader's similar attempt to make sense of the text and the world.Detecting Textsincludes an introduction by the editors that defines the metaphysical detective story and traces its history from Poe's classic tales to today's postmodernist experiments. In addition to the editors, contributors include Stephen Bernstein, Joel Black, John T. Irwin, Jeffrey T. Nealon, and others.<br>

  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): GOLDSTEIN JAN<br>
  Abstract: Hysteria Complicated by Ecstasyoffers a rare window into the inner life of a person ordinarily inaccessible to historians: a semiliterate peasant girl who lived almost two centuries ago, in the aftermath of the French Revolution. Eighteen-year-old Nanette Leroux fell ill in 1822 with a variety of incapacitating nervous symptoms. Living near the spa at Aix-les-Bains, she became the charity patient of its medical director, Antoine Despine, who treated her with hydrotherapy and animal magnetism, as hypnosis was then called. Jan Goldstein translates, and provides a substantial introduction to, the previously unpublished manuscript recounting Nanette's strange illness--a manuscript coauthored by Despine and Alexandre Bertrand, the Paris physician who memorably diagnosed Nanette as suffering from "hysteria complicated by ecstasy." While hysteria would become a fashionable disease among urban women by the end of the nineteenth century, the case of Nanette Leroux differs sharply from this pattern in its early date and rural setting.<br>

  Abstract: A Holocaust literature that took its imperatives from the existential conditions of the camps would begin always as at the end of culture, in a world of dying, degradation, and atrocity wherein all books and learning exist but as a faint memory of what it meant to be human in some other time, some other place. For Elie Wiesel, there is in fact no other condition from which a literature about the Holocaust might begin, which is to say, there is no way of speaking about the Holocaust in books except from within a state of historically conditioned anxiety about<br>

  Abstract: This chapter is about the cultural work that dementia does, the sociomedical uses to which it is put in the American hospital at the end of life. I suggest that dementia works there in three ways: as a rationale for facilitating death, as a contested feature of what matters about the patient’s identity, and as a moralclinical designation of value when a frail life is perceived to hang in the balance. In performing this multiplex work, dementia makes manifest one aspect of the ethics and politics of life itself in the negotiations it elicits about “quality of life,” “loss of<br>

  Abstract: The King James Bible came at the end of the Elizabethan age, between Shakespeare and Milton, when Englishmen were using words more passionately, richly, vigorously, wittily, and sublimely than ever before or since. Although none of the divines or scholars who made it were literary men, their language was touched with genius—the genius of a period when style was the common property of educated men rather than an individual achievement.¹<br>

  Abstract: In keeping with developments in the human and social sciences, we have for some time now experienced a recovery and reconsideration of the oral factor in biblical studies. Negatively speaking what is at stake is a challenge to what Foley has called “the textualist bias of our scholarship, with its easy assimilation of all forms of verbal art to the literary-textual model” (1995, 87). This text-centered perspective has involved a sense of textual autonomy, textualization as an end in itself, texts’ localization in intertextual networks, and a dominantly textual hermeneutics—all notions closely allied with the historical and literary paradigm.<br>

  Abstract: There is a curious relationship between the birth of an academic field and its death. In the manifestos and declaration of intent that mark the invention of a field there is often a recognition of its limitations and an intimation of its future demise. In some cases there is even a tacit challenge to bring about and hasten that expiration, or at least quickly to render the field’s initial manifestations and conceptual apparatus redundant.

  Book Title: On Diary-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): DURNIN KATHERINE<br>
  Abstract: On Diary is the second collection in English of the groundbreaking and profoundly influential work of one of the best-known and provocative theorists of autobiography and diary. Ranging from the diary’s historical origins to its pervasive presence on the Internet, from the spiritual journey of the sixteenth century to the diary of Anne Frank, and from the materials and methods of diary writing to the question of how diaries end, these essays display Philippe Lejeune’s expertise, eloquence, passion, and humor as a commentator on the functions, practices, and significance of keeping or reading a diary. Lejeune is a leading European critic and theorist of diary and autobiography. His landmark essay, "The Autobiographical Pact," has shaped life writing studies for more than thirty years, and his many books and essays have repeatedly opened up new vistas for scholarship. As Michael Riffaterre notes, "Lejeune’s work on autobiography is the most original, powerful, effective approach to a difficult subject. . . . His style is very personal, lively. It grabs the reader as scholarship rarely does. Lejeune’s erudition and methodology are impeccable." Two substantial introductory essays by Jeremy Popkin and Julie Rak place Lejeune’s work within its critical and theoretical traditions and comment on his central importance within the fields of life writing, literary genetic studies, and cultural studies.<br>

In 1997, according to another major study, Christianity’s numerical edge over Buddhism was even larger—27.4 percent versus 18.3 percent.

  Author(s) BORGEN ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: The Heian period has often been characterized as a golden age of Japanese religious culture, one in which the Buddhist literature, painting, sculpture, and architecture produced at court are considered to have reached unprecedented heights. It is thus all the more surprising that in this time of cultural florescence many Buddhists, monastics and aristocrats alike, understood themselves to be living in an age of decay. According to their interpretation of Buddhist chronologies, the eleventh century marked the beginning of the end: the onset of

  Book Title: Traces Of A Stream-Literacy and Social Change Among African American Women<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Royster Jacqueline Jones<br>
  Abstract: Traces of a Streamoffers a unique scholarly perspective that merges interests in rhetorical and literacy studies, United States social and political theory, and African American women writers. Focusing on elite nineteenth-century African American women who formed a new class of women well positioned to use language with consequence, Royster uses interdisciplinary perspectives (literature, history, feminist studies, African American studies, psychology, art, sociology, economics) to present a well-textured rhetorical analysis of the literate practices of these women. With a shift in educational opportunity after the Civil War, African American women gained access to higher education and received formal training in rhetoric and writing. By the end of the nineteenth-century, significant numbers of African American women operated actively in many public arenas.<br>

  Abstract: Like philosophy for Plato, the narration of the New World begins with a sense of wonder: the wonder of new lands, new animals, new people, and above all a new sky. With the discovery of America, it is said, modernity comes into being, and the Middle Ages end. A traditional view images the Middle Ages as a period during which human beings stood crucified between the small piece of land where they were born (and where they would, in all probability, die) and the heaven toward which both their thoughts and their soul were directed.

  Abstract: If we treat the question of to what extent art can be an interpretation of our world, self-concept, and historical forms of life by referring to Hegel, it seems that we come to a dead end. The authoritative and original place for a connection between art and interpretation in the traditional philosophy of aesthetics is at best the aesthetics of reception. Its traditional version relies on the basic assumption that a piece of art is constituted each time in its reception, that is, in the multiple, historically varying interpretations of its meaning and sense.¹ Even a discussion of the impact<br>

  Book Title: Religion after Religion-Gershom Scholem, Mircea Eliade, and Henry Corbin at Eranos<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wasserstrom Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: By the end of World War II, religion appeared to be on the decline throughout the United States and Europe. Recent world events had cast doubt on the relevance of religious belief, and modernizing trends made religious rituals look out of place. It was in this atmosphere that the careers of Scholem, Eliade, and Corbin--the twentieth century's legendary scholars in the respective fields of Judaism, History of Religions, and Islam--converged and ultimately revolutionized how people thought about religion. Between 1949 and 1978, all three lectured to Carl Jung's famous Eranos circle in Ascona, Switzerland, where each in his own way came to identify the symbolism of mystical experience as a central element of his monotheistic tradition. In this, the first book ever to compare the paths taken by these thinkers, Steven Wasserstrom explores how they overturned traditional approaches to studying religion by de-emphasizing law, ritual, and social history and by extolling the role of myth and mysticism. The most controversial aspect of their theory of religion, Wasserstrom argues, is that it minimized the binding character of moral law associated with monotheism.<br>

In some sense, he draws an alliance with Descartes’s meditation, “I am a thinking thing,” as the “true” center of his identity. Indeed, the modernist endeavor to define personal identity begins by recognizing that the self cannot be derived, but instead, the Cartesian
                  cogitans—the end point of the skeptic’s query—serves as the starting point of self-consciousness.¹ Accordingly, to the extent that “identity” has a definition in the Freudian universe, it must be that which can be identified; that is, the conscious ego examines and<br>

  Abstract: Since its first publication in 1990,
         Brahms and His Worldhas become a key text for listeners, performers, and scholars interested in the life, work, and times of one of the nineteenth century's most celebrated composers. In this substantially revised and enlarged edition, the editors remain close to the vision behind the original book while updating its contents to reflect new perspectives on Brahms that have developed over the past two decades. To this end, the original essays by leading experts are retained and revised, and supplemented by contributions from a new generation of Brahms scholars. Together, they consider such topics as Brahms's relationship with Clara and Robert Schumann, his musical interactions with the "New German School" of Wagner and Liszt, his influence upon Arnold Schoenberg and other young composers, his approach to performing his own music, and his productive interactions with visual artists.<br>

  Book Title: Contesting Spirit-Nietzsche, Affirmation, Religion<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS TYLER T.<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche criticizes the ascetic hatred of the body and this-worldly life, yet engages in rigorous practices of self-denial--he sees philosophy as such a practice--and affirms the need of imposing suffering on oneself in order to enhance the spirit. He dismisses the "intoxication" of mysticism, yet links mysticism, power, and creativity, and describes his own self-transcending experiences. The tensions in his relation to religion are closely related to that between negation and affirmation in his thinking in general. In Roberts's view, Nietzsche's transfigurations of religion offer resources for a postmodern religious imagination. Though as a "master of suspicion," Nietzsche, with Freud and Marx, is an integral part of modern antireligion, he has the power to take us beyond the flat, modern distinction between the secular and the religious--a distinction that, at the end of modernity, begs to be reexamined.<br>

  Abstract: Could World War I have been averted if Franz Ferdinand and his wife hadn't been murdered by Serbian nationalists in 1914? What if Ronald Reagan had been killed by Hinckley's bullet? Would the Cold War have ended as it did? In
      Forbidden Fruit, Richard Ned Lebow develops protocols for conducting robust counterfactual thought experiments and uses them to probe the causes and contingency of transformative international developments like World War I and the end of the Cold War. He uses experiments, surveys, and a short story to explore why policymakers, historians, and international relations scholars are so resistant to the contingency and indeterminism inherent in open-ended, nonlinear systems. Most controversially, Lebow argues that the difference between counterfactual and so-called factual arguments is misleading, as both can be evidence-rich and logically persuasive. A must-read for social scientists,Forbidden Fruitalso examines the binary between fact and fiction and the use of counterfactuals in fictional works like Philip Roth'sThe Plot Against Americato understand complex causation and its implications for who we are and what we think makes the social world work.<br>

The social aftershocks of the Revolution continued to shake the United States’ political structure as the country neared what appeared to be the apocalyptic end of the eighteenth century. In the 1780s and 1790s, America found itself tested by the internal conflicts as the two parties, the weakening Federalist party and the ever-more-powerful Republicans (the opposition party arising from Antifederalist sentiment), fought for control. Aggravating these internecine battles were fears of an international conspiracy stemming from the French Revolution.¹ The projected fears eventually gave rise to the Alien and Sedition<br>

  Author(s) Crosman Inge<br>
  Abstract: When raising the question of the reader’s status in the text, we may have in mind two sets of problems. According to one approach, the reader is thought of as an end conceived by the writer, whose work, accordingly, may be read in reference to the idea we have of that reader. A certain number of studies have enriched the history of literary criticism in this way, showing that the expectations of a particular public aimed at by the writer were determinative down to the most secret strata of the text (Jauss’s
                     Erwartungshorizontfor example).<br>

  Abstract: Historical texts of the eleventh and twelfth centuries are, on the whole, accumulations of anecdotes. They lack the fundamental elements of narrative wholeness—a beginning, middle, and end—and they flagrantly defy the canons of proportion and clarity. And yet I have argued in this study concerning the Kingdom of God, their segmented and directionless mode of discourse was possible because it was, for the authors and the intended readers, informed by a general esthetic, namely, an esthetic of cult, which presupposed much that was unsaid in the said, including an acceptance of violence (beginning with sacrifice) as a medium<br>

  Abstract: At the core of most classical and contemporary approaches to politics—including the recently fashionable Carl Schmitt and his epigones—lies the commitment to the concept of sovereignty and the tendency, dominant since the nineteenth century emergence of sociology and economics, to treat human beings primarily as rational calculators or creatures of practical reason. But it is not clear that the Romans who think constructively about politics privilege either sovereignty or reason as starting or end points—or indeed that they believe that politics can yield much to systematic analysis.<br>

  Book Title: Living Prism-Itineraries in Comparative Literature<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KUSHNER EVA<br>
  Abstract: She discusses the current state of comparative literary studies and the renewed role of comparative literature in a world that is at once more plural and more globalized, as well as some of the debates now taking place within literary criticism as a whole, including the interchange between comparative literature and cultural studies, the re-envisaging of the Renaissance, the work of Northrop Frye, myth and literature at the end of the twentieth century, modern drama, and post-colonialism. To play an important role in the human sciences, comparative literature had first to free itself of a number of restrictive habits, such as an insufficiently critical literary history. In order to do this, it had to think theoretically, but without yielding to the temptation of letting theory become an end in itself. Kushner demonstrates that, while under strong pressures to be a more rigourous science, comparative literature has realized that in the human sciences the validation of knowledge has to seek its own tests and criteria, becoming increasingly more open to individuality, difference, and life situations and controlling its tendency to universalize. With its emphasis on whether literary history is possible and the problems it raises for literary theory and for comparative literature in particular, The Living Prism adds an important dimension to the ongoing debate about criticism and comparative literary studies.<br>

Of course, violence tends, at the end of the day, to be the basis of war, while the other two, being modes of dialogue, are constitutive of politics. But whereas the politics of negotiation aims for accommodation, for resolving conflict through the making of trade-offs and concessions, those who converse strive instead for genuine understanding, for learning from each other and progressively transforming their positions so that they can be not compromised but integrated, reconciled. That is why only conversation is a matter of trying to “convince” people<br>

One only has to think of the social division of labour which has distanced architecture from engineering, and both of these professions from urban studies in the social sciences as well as in the humanities. Furthermore, fragmentation has had profound spatial consequences, since privately owned parcels of space are used for construction rather independently of one another. In<br>

  Abstract: Rewriting Apocalypse in Contemporary Canadian Fiction is the first book to explore the literary, psychological, political, and cultural repercussions of the apocalypse in the fiction of Timothy Finley, Michael Ondaatje, Margaret Atwood, Thomas King, and Joy Kogawa. While writers from diverse nations have adopted and adapted the biblical narrative, these Canadian authors introduce particular twists to the familiar myth of the end. Goldman demonstrates that they share a marked concern with purgation of the non-elect, the loss experienced by the non-elect, and the traumatic impact of apocalyptic violence. She also analyzes Canadian apocalyptic accounts as crisis literature written in the context of the Cold War - written against the fear of total destruction.<br>

  Abstract: Fashioning an ending for a book about fictions that advocate skepticism about endings is, admittedly, a tricky business. However, in light of this study’s findings that it is dangerous to ignore the myth of the end, it seems prudent to offer some concluding remarks. This study began with the desire to explore the treatment of the apocalyptic paradigm from the ex-centric perspective of contemporary Canadian writers. In effect, their works confirm Ronald Granofsky’s observation that 1945 was “the year a certain innocence ended for the human race, a Second Fall” (2).

As a consequence of an anti-colonial uprising that had broken out in early January of that year, members of the Herero community were to be shot on sight, with those escaping direct execution to be driven into the Omaheke Desert where they would be left to die from exposure. This policy did not exclude women or children. In short, this order sought in explicit terms to eliminate the Herero people and thus end a conflict that<br>

  Abstract: The following chapter presents the main results of a work in progress intended to reconstruct the ideal of the orator in classical rhetoric.¹ Classical rhetoric, or school rhetoric, is a theory that is mainly based on rhetorical handbooks from Greek and Roman antiquity, and more recent ones written up until the end of the eighteenth century. I shall give here only an outline without detailed references of the sources. My aim is not just the reconstruction of the concept of the orator, but also its application to problems in modern rhetorical research. In many scientific fields today, scholars speak of<br>

  Abstract: For France, the quarter-century between the end of World War II and the early 1970s was a period of extremely rapid social change – economic, political and demographic – which informed the lived experience of millions of individuals. These years were characterised particularly by the strong pull of a new modernity, in difficult and often acute tension with the past. The new emerged, but strongly informed by the old, as well as by the progressive and oppressive possibilities of a new, fast-moving, consumerised culture that expanded in the context of a remarkable and sustained economic boom.

At the outset, the main line of production consisted of custom, handmade, luxurious (luksuzni) pieces of carved wood that required lengthy manufacturing time and cost a significant amount of money. These were purchased mainly by the members of the newly rich who had become wealthy due to their dealings in the new market economy<br>

  Abstract: Rhetoric Culture theory has its roots in a long history, and in what follows I present some of the ideas that scholars—mainly rhetoricians, but also some philosophers—have developed over the centuries in order to grasp the difficult and complex relationship between rhetoric, culture, and humanity.

At the end, I recall the work of scholars who were among the first to empirically study the constitutive role of rhetoric in non-European cultures.<br>

Spanish anarchism indeed succeeded in creating a specific political culture and became a major political force in the first decades of the twentieth century.

  Book Title: Scientific Understanding-Philosophical Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Eigner Kai<br>
  Abstract: To most scientists, and to those interested in the sciences, understanding is the ultimate aim of scientific endeavor. In spite of this, understanding, and how it is achieved, has received little attention in recent philosophy of science.
      Scientific Understandingseeks to reverse this trend by providing original and in-depth accounts of the concept of understanding and its essential role in the scientific process. To this end, the chapters in this volume explore and develop three key topics: understanding and explanation, understanding and models, and understanding in scientific practice.Earlier philosophers, such as Carl Hempel, dismissed understanding as subjective and pragmatic. They believed that the essence of science was to be found in scientific theories and explanations. In Scientific Understanding, the contributors maintain that we must also consider the relation between explanations and the scientists who construct and use them. They focus on understanding as the cognitive state that is a goal of explanation and on the understanding of theories and models as a means to this end.The chapters in this book highlight the multifaceted nature of the process of scientific research. The contributors examine current uses of theory, models, simulations, and experiments to evaluate the degree to which these elements contribute to understanding. Their analyses pay due attention to the roles of intelligibility, tacit knowledge, and feelings of understanding. Furthermore, they investigate how understanding is obtained within diverse scientific disciplines and examine how the acquisition of understanding depends on specific contexts, the objects of study, and the stated aims of research.<br>

  Abstract: Canada’s national television news anchors opened the programs of 27 October 1992 by taking stock of the dramatic and historic events of the day before. The country had just reached the end of a gruelling, month-long referendum campaign, and Canadians had just voted on the Charlottetown Accord, a sweeping agreement that held the potential to change the constitutionally defined relationships between the federal, provincial, and Aboriginal levels of government. The accord itself was a result of a yearlong consultation process during which representatives of federal and provincial commissions met with Canadians from across the country to find out their constitutional<br>

  Abstract: A defining attribute of culture at the end of the twentieth century is the appeal of the eclectic, a penchant for hybrids, fusions,
                  bricolage. And this attribute of the culture is reflected in its advertising. Consider events in the United States, always the home of experiment, in 1997 and 1998: the federal government adopted paid PSAs (for the census and for anti-drug campaigns), the Ad Council agreed to tailor PSAs to the network’s promotional efforts, the Arthritis Foundation turned to an ad-supported infomercial to raise funds, and the Children’s Television Network (purveyors ofSesame Street) proudly announced a new initiative<br>

  Abstract: Representations of war are determined not only by the ages in which they appear, but also by the boundaries understood to define war. The idea, for example, that it is not battle but war itself that leaves behind scars presumes that war has both a beginning and an end, or that we can differentiate between the event and its traces. War is, however, an extended process, one that can hardly be isolated or made wholly distinct from peace. The vagueness of the concept suggests that much remains unknown about its limits. For this reason, detailed depictions of occupation are of<br>

  Abstract: Let us look again at the sentence that concludes ‘Jonas.’ All appearances to the contrary, we have still not exhausted its implications. In addition to its autoreferential rôle on the level of the generation of the text, it also points to the other end of the chain of literary communication: the subsequent reception of the literary text. The word on the artist’s canvas is, we are told, decipherable except for the doubt concerning one letter, a ‘

  Abstract: All the existentialists are united in their opposition to idealist philosophies which ignore space and time as necessary conditions of the human existence. In no way is the finiteness of the human creature more evident than in the fact that he must live an earthly existence, and, since things in time have a beginning and an end, that he must be subject to the mysteries of birth and death. Ignoring these fundamental facts, the idealists sought to transcend the time process by rational system and they imposed a rational pattern upon the course of historical events.

  Abstract: One might suppose that life’s end is of special importance to narrativist views of the self, even if the specific nature of that import is opaque. Many philosophical discussions of the narrative self touch upon the end of life.¹ End-related terms and concepts that occur in these discussions include finitude, completion, closure,
                  telos, retroactive meaning-conferral, life shape and a closed beginning-middle-and-end structure. Those who emphasise life’s end in non-philosophical narrative contexts are perhaps clearer on its significance. The end is thought to play a key role in the story of a life, securing or enhancing the life narrative’s meaning or<br>

It opened a new period that political analysts named the ‘transition’, to designate an alliance between politics (re-democratisation) and economics (neoliberalism). During those years, the post-dictatorship presidents – until 2010, all from the Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia¹ – were determined to reconcile Chileans, whom the dictatorship seemed to have irreparably divided.

Yet modernity is defined precisely by our awareness of unsurpassable historicity. In the words of Jacques Rancière, we have entered into the ‘ age of history’. He adds that it is also the ‘age of cinema’, as this late art possesses a singular power of ‘historicity and<br>

  Abstract: In the two books he wrote on the cinematic image, Gilles Deleuze proposes a fundamental break in the history of film form. This break occurred, he declares, sometime around the end of the Second World War and finds its first expression in the work of Italian neorealist film-makers such as Roberto Rossellini. In Rossellini’s images of aimless characters wandering through the ruins of a bombed-out Europe, Deleuze uncovers a decisive rupture with the logic of classical cinema, a rejection of the possibility for action upon which classical narrative depends.

  Abstract: Life by itself does not constitute a ‘twentieth-century philosophy.’ But it amounted to a constant theme throughout the twentieth century since European philosophers in particular continuously appropriate and transform the concept of life. So, after the nineteenth-century philosophies of vitalism and

However, in 1927, Heidegger published hisBeing and Time. Heidegger himself told us thatBeing and Timewas written out of the experience of the ‘forgetfulness of being’ in Western metaphysics (Heidegger<br>

Its attainment, however, often seemed a distant goal: virtually all of the philosophers who defended individuality believed that it was endangered, if not entirely stifled, in their own societies. Individuality was, for them, a way of imagining a modern world worth living in. It gave ethical content to their imagined utopias; it also served as the normative foundation of<br>

By the end of 1849, all the revolutions had collapsed and the short and violent European experiment in liberal (and, in some countries, democratic) politics was over.

  Author(s) Seed John<br>
  Abstract: Several factors converged in the 1770s to bolster interest among Dissenters in their own history. First, in 1767 the long, wearying legal battle between the City of London Corporation and the Protestant Dissenting Deputies came to end when six out of seven Law Lords decided in favour of the Dissenting position.¹ By Lord Mansfield’s judgment, Dissent was legally secured. Dissenting religious worship was, he said, ‘not only exempted from punishment, but rendered innocent and lawful: it is established, it is put under the protection, and is not merely under the connivance of the law’.²<br>

  Book Title: Language and Power in the Modern World-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Atkinson David<br>
  Abstract: This book explores key areas of modern society in which language is used to form power and social relations. These are presented in five sections:Language and the MediaLanguage and OrganisationsLanguage and GenderLanguage and YouthMultilingualism, Identity and EthnicityWith a unique combination of selected readings and student-centred tasks in a single volume, the book covers contemporary issues in language and power, ranging from the global to the interpersonal. Each area - and each reading chosen to explore it - is substantially contextualised and discussed through a detailed introduction and then followed up with related activities.Each section comprises:*a substantial, specific introduction which draws students’ attention to key themes and issues relevant to its topic; *a set of four or five selected readings which encourages students to locate critically these issues in context; *a task, or set of tasks, obliging students to undertake ‘hands-on’ linguistic analysis of data and engage in more sophisticated discussion of pertinent issues.*In-depth exploration of a variety of approaches to the study of language and power*Unique combination of advanced readings, student-centred tasks and editorial guidance*Hands-on activities at the end of each chapter<br>

  Abstract: The immediate post-war period saw the publication of a number of secret service accounts recounting wartime exploits, giving the impression that, with the end of hostilities, these could now be revealed.¹ In fact, as has been clearly demonstrated by Richard J. Aldrich, officials in Whitehall attempted to manage the release of intelligence-related subject matter into the public domain, largely to protect the secrets of code-breaking and strategic deception.² While receiving the most attention, these were not the only wartime activities which were strictly off-limits to publishers, as far as the authorities were concerned.

  Abstract: This turn of the millennium certainly offers us another opportunity—and incentive—to get more serious about trying to explain, and perhaps reduce the incidence of, that brutal, stupid, and destructive form of collective behavior known as war. In almost every epoch and almost every corner of human civilization, we find the politicians and the priests calling for an end to such barbarous behavior. But time after time, their prescription is to demand that the other party give up its aggressive behavior and meet the demands of our reasonable and accommodating brethren.<br>

  Abstract: In 1897, toward the end of the period covered in this book, a new genre emerged alongside the constellation of visual and literary arts dedicated to a realist Christ image: the Jesus movie. There are many ways in which the early history of the Jesus movie echoes that of the Jesus novel more than a half century earlier, from the new genre’s immediate international scope to the hesitant, incremental advance of its pictorial resources. Over the years of 1897 and 1898 alone, French and American production companies, each working in relative isolation, made about half a dozen known Jesus movies,<br>

Several institutions were physically damaged or destroyed during the siege of Sarajevo (1992–95) and required reconstitution and rebuilding on a large scale. But even before the war began, the triumph of nationalist political forces and the end of socialist rule had initiated far-reaching changes in the country’s major institutions. Nationalist leaders reconstructed some long-standing institutions, allowed others to atrophy, and established new ones in support of their political and cultural objectives.

  Abstract: This is a study of race and how Americans write about it. In America, writing about race with ink and paper has shaped the race that people see on the flesh and bone bodies of others and of themselves. Words that describe degrees of distinction—shade of skin, curl of hair, shape of lips and eyes—get read onto bodies as distinctions of kind. That is, in American history, writing about race has done the cultural work of defining racial sameness as well as racial difference.

  Book Title: The Poetics of Inconstancy-Etienne Durand and the End of Renaissance Verse<br>
  Publisher: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Department of Romance Studies<br>
  Author(s): ROGERS HOYT<br>
  Abstract: The transformation of Late Petrarchism from earlier stages reflects a profound shift in cultural values--a 'crisis of the Renaissance' that generated new perspectives in poetic theory and practice. Broadly, this book identifies a distinctive 'poetics of inconstancy' that came to the fore at the end of the sixteenth century and pervaded the love verse of the age. At the same time, as a study based on the inductive method, the book takes as its point of departure a single poet: Etienne Durand. Because of his frequently anthologized 'Stances a l'Inconstance,' Durand is often singled out as 'the poet of inconstancy.' This study, however, identifies the theme of universal change as a hallmark of Durand's contemporaries as well--a signal of a stylistic revolution that heralded the end of Renaissance verse.<br>

  Book Title: The Thought of Death and the Memory of War-  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
  Abstract: War lays bare death and our relation to it. And in the wars-or more precisely the memories of war-of the twentieth century, images of the deaths of countless faceless or nameless others eclipse the singularity of each victim's death as well as the end of the world as such that each death signifies. Marc Crépon's The Thought of Death and the Memory of War is a call to resist such images in which death is no longer actual death since it happens to anonymous others, and to seek instead a world in which mourning the other whose mortality we always already share points us toward a cosmopolitics. Crépon pursues this path toward a cosmopolitics of mourning through readings of works by Freud, Heidegger, Sartre, Patocka, Levinas, Derrida, and Ricœur, and others. The movement among these writers, Crépon shows, marks a way through-and against-twentieth-century interpretation to argue that no war, genocide, or neglect of people is possible without suspending how one relates to the death of another human being. A history of a critical strain in contemporary thought, this book is, as Rodolphe Gasché says in the Foreword, "a profound meditation on what constitutes evil and a rigorous and illuminating reflection on death, community, and world." The translation of this work received financial support from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<br>

  Abstract: “Few facts about the life of our culture are more striking than the recent growth of literary criticism in both extent and prestige.” It is now “fiercely professional, an ‘institution’ as well as a discipline, a self-contained world as well as a secondary branch of humane letters.” When Irving Howe wrote this in 1958, the end seemed near to what Randall Jarrell had called “The Age of Criticism.” M. D. Zabel noted in 1962 “the effect of selfcancellation which a large part of contemporary critical writing conveys.” Yet to mark this effect, Zabel reached back to Mencken’s mockery of “criticism<br>

  Abstract: Martin Heidegger’s destructive phenomenology has shown that modern philosophy, from Descartes through Kant and Hegel to the discourse of positive science, constitutes an “anthropology” that fulfills the imperatives of a metaphysical or logocentric concept of truth and thus brings “philosophy to its end.”¹ Simultaneously, in dis-closing the temporality being that the (anthropo)logos as Word or Presence encloses (covers over and forgets), Heidegger’s destruction of the tradition points to a hermeneutics of being that is capable of surpassing metaphysics (

A distinction is often made between theories that focus on “power over” persons or groups and those that speak of “power to” do or achieve something. Habermas’s theory of society seeks both to clarify the connections between the most important—and traditionally competing—conceptions of power and to clarify their normative hierarchy. To this end, he distinguishes between communicative, administrative, and social power. With regard to the legitimacy of political processes, the task involves, above all, determining<br>

  Book Title: The Specter of Democracy-What Marx and Marxists Haven't Understood and Why<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Howard Dick<br>
  Abstract: Howard uses a critical rereading of Marx as a theorist of democracy to offer his audience a new way to think about this political ideal. He argues that it is democracy, rather than Marxism, that is radical and revolutionary, and that Marx could have seen this but did not. In Part I, Howard explores the attraction Marxism held for intellectuals, particularly French intellectuals, and he demonstrates how the critique of totalitarianism from a Marxist viewpoint allowed these intellectuals to see the radical nature of democracy. Part II examines two hundred years of democratic political life -- comparing America's experience as a democracy to that of France. Part III offers a rethinking of Marx's contribution to democratic politics. Howard concludes that Marx was attempting a "philosophy by other means," and that paradoxically, just because he was such an astute philosopher, Marx was unable to see the radical political implications of his own analyses. The philosophically justified "revolution" turns out to be the basis of an anti-politics whose end was foreshadowed by the fall of European communism in 1989.<br>

  Abstract: In his famous book
                  The History of Piracy, Philip Gosse (1989 [1932], 298) recalls that people, at the end of the nineteenth century, believed the disappearance of pirates was imminent. It was the dream of a world where there is no territory without sovereignty, in other words, no one distanced from the rules of the state (Thompson 1994; Anderson 1997). Subsequent history seems to flatly disprove this prediction. Piracy has stopped being a historical curiosity or a simple metaphor. Pirates are among us and taking on diverse forms in many different realms: pirates of the air and seas, radio pirates,<br>

  Book Title: The Disclosure of Politics-Struggles Over the Semantics of Secularization<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lara María Pía<br>
  Abstract: Postmodern political critiques speak of the death of ideology, the end of history, and the postsecular return of religious attitudes, yet radical conservative theorists such as Mark Lilla argue religion and politics are inextricably intertwined. Returning much-needed uncertainty to debates over the political while revitalizing the very terms in which they are defined, María Pía Lara explores the ambiguity of secularization and the theoretical potential of a structural break between politics and religion.<br>

  Abstract: The end of World War II resulted in the defeat of Japan and the end of Japanese colonial rule in Taiwan. The government of the Republic of China (hence-forth, the Nationalist government) took over Taiwan from Japan.¹ During the half-century of colonial rule, the Japanese colonial government aggressively promoted assimilation policies, employing state coercion to transfer Japanese culture to Taiwan in order to make Japanese culture dominant in the colony. Japanese nationalism was introduced through educational institutions on various levels. The assimilation policy was further intensified after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937; the imperial subjugation movement banned<br>

  Abstract: As late as the 1980s, a period that saw the end of the Cold War and the spread of free-market global capitalism, many political commentators continued to regard the phenomenon of religion as an anomaly in the hegemonic narrative of Western secularist modernity. Yet barely two decades later, faced with the global resurgence of religion, this uncontested self-identification of Western secularism with modernity and postmodernity was forced to see itself as suffering from a crisis, a rupture in its self-congratulatory narrative.

  Book Title: The Death of Philosophy-Reference and Self-reference in Contemporary Thought<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): LYNCH RICHARD A.<br>
  Abstract: Philosophers debate the death of philosophy as much as they debate the death of God. Kant claimed responsibility for both philosophy's beginning and end, while Heidegger argued it concluded with Nietzsche. In the twentieth century, figures as diverse as John Austin and Richard Rorty have proclaimed philosophy's end, with some even calling for the advent of "postphilosophy." In an effort to make sense of these conflicting positions-which often say as much about the philosopher as his subject-Isabelle Thomas-Fogiel undertakes the first systematic treatment of "the end of philosophy," while also recasting the history of western thought itself.<br>

  Abstract: The return to Kant is in fact the choice of a single path that brings an end to the tension in the critical project. It is a matter of “returning” to the question of representation as an explication of the relation between a subject and an object. Let’s first of all recall that, from 1810 to 1850, Hegel and his disciples were the main figures on the philosophical scene. Henri Dussort points this out, “From 1800 to about 1840, speculative thought, its famous developers and their disciples occupied the center stage.”¹ Friedrich Engels himself noted that this enthusiasm for the<br>

She uses case studies of art and architecture produced in response to government commissions to demonstrate that established visual forms and meanings in Mexican art reflect and inform desires, expectations, memories, and ways of being in the world-in short, that visual culture and cosmopolitanism are fundamental to processes of subjectification and identity.<br>

  Abstract: Let us try for a moment to imagine that modern philosophy had proceeded according to the methodological program set out for it by Descartes, and had arrived at that definitive conclusion that Descartes himself believed to be eminently attainable. This ‘end state’ of philosophy, which historical experience permits us to entertain only as a hypothesis, would be defined according to the criteria set out in the four rules of the Cartesian “Discours de la méthode,” in particular by the clarity and distinctness that the first rule requires of all matters apprehended in judgments.

  Abstract: Wagner’s
                  Parsifalmay be thought of as both an end and a beginning. As the completion of Wagner’s programme of recovering and renewing the tradition of religious theatre, it was meant to signify the last stage of overcoming opera. As the paradigmatic example of a new cultic theatre, of art religion in the full sense of the term, it provided a model for the avant-garde search for a synthesis of the arts. How this played out in the theatre, from the Ballets Russes to Brecht and Artaud, will be the subject of the following chapters. In the present chapter I<br>

As parabasis—the Greek term for the chorus stepping out of the action of the play and addressing an ode to the audience—irony is the constant possibility of assuming another subject position, of viewing and representing the world from a different and even contradictory angle.

  Book Title: Narratives of Identity in Alban Berg's "Lulu"-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): dos Santos Silvio J.<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the crossroads between autobiographical narrative and musical composition, this book examines Berg's transformation of Frank Wedekind's Erdgeist (1895) and Die Büchse der Pandora/ (1904) -- the plays used in the formation of the libretto for Lulu -- according to notions of gender identity, social customs, and the aesthetics of modernity in Vienna of the 1920s and 1930s. While Berg modernized several aspects of the plays by Wedekind and incorporated serial techniques of composition from Arnold Schoenberg, he never let go of the idealistic Wagnerian perspectives of his youth. In fact, he went as far as reconfiguring aspects of Richard Wagner's life as an ideal identity to be played out in the compositional process. In the process of composing the opera, Berg also reflected on the most important cultural figures in fin-de-siècle Vienna that affected his worldview, including Karl Kraus, Emil Lucka, Otto Weininger, and others. Adopting an approach that combines a systematic analysis of Berg's numerous sketches for Lulu, correspondence, and the finished work with interpretive models drawn from cultural studies and philosophy, this book elucidates the ways in which Berg grappled with his self-image as an "incorrigible romantic" (unverbesserliche Romantiker) at the end of his life, explaining aspects of his musical language that have been considered strange or anomalous in the scholarship. Silvio J. dos Santos is assistant professor of musicology at the University of Florida.<br>

Yet what is at stake is the continuation of Faust’s self-identity in time versus his dissolution, his Entgrenzung, in a timeless moment of bliss.

Smartberries—discrete, displaced packets of cultural knowledge—are but signs of the literature’s desire for a holistic, tribally specific cultural understanding, and should not be mistaken for an end in themselves.<br>

  Author(s) Maier Charles S.<br>
  Abstract: Until the late 1980s, the Soviet Union’s determination to preserve communism in East-Central Europe was not in doubt. When communist regimes in Eastern Europe came under violent threat in the 1950s—in east Germany in 1953 and Hungary in 1956—soviet troops intervened to subdue those challenges. A very different problem arose in 1968, when Czechoslovakia embarked on a dramatic, but entirely peaceful, attempt to change both the internal complexion of communism and many of the basic structures of Soviet–East European relations. This eight-month-long experiment, widely known as the “Prague spring,” came to a decisive end in August 1968,<br>

  Abstract: The church “Sveta Bogoroditsa” (“Holy Virgin”) in Karlovo cuts a handsome profile with its blue and white bell tower. The bell tower is relatively new, from 1897, but the church building, as the inscription above the western entrance tells us, dates from 1851. Before they began constructing this new building in 1847, there had been a rather insignificant structure erected in 1839 in the place of the older church of the Holy Virgin that had burnt down in 1813. This latter church, about which little is known, is believed by some to have been built already at the end of<br>

  Abstract: The Enlightenment in Austria had two main dimensions: a social and legal reform initiated by the state, and a literary revival. If ‘cameralism’—arguably an internal development within the Austrian political establishment—represented the first aspect (see Joseph von Sonnenfels, 
                  On the love of Fatherland), the second aspect was the result of a combination of exogenous influences and indigenous conditions. As a result, the very notion of ‘Austrian’ literature at the end of the eighteenth century is contested. One of the most important influences on the Austrian cultural context was exerted by the appeal of prominent German writers for the<br>

  Abstract: It was my everyday practice as a university professor that made me face the problem discussed in this volume, and it was the first decade of our century that made the problem entirely evident. Students born toward the end of communism (mid- to late 1980s) knew practically nothing about it. I had to hear innumerable egregious mistakes in my classes, for example, a student once saying that communism was “a medieval event or regime” (it was not a metaphorical statement). About five years ago another student wrote in a paper the following sentence: “Nowadays, as we enter the era of<br>

  Abstract: The death of Slobodan Milošević, on March 11, 2006, in the detention unit of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) put an abrupt end to yet another process dubbed as “the trial of the century.” Three days later the Trial Chamber took notice of the death of the accused, hence terminating the case IT-02-54 that dragged on for more than four years toward its anticlimactic end. Disappointment among the interested parties was as deep as the earlier feeling of success upon his bringing to justice. “I deeply regret the death of Slobodan Milošević. It deprives the victims<br>

  Abstract: The “Velvet Revolution” in November 1989 brought about enormous changes in the political and social environment: the communist regime was abolished and after forty-one years democracy was reestablished in Czechoslovakia. In art, the most important change brought by the Revolution was the end of censorship. Since 1989 artists have been allowed to do as they wish—as long as they can find the funding. Film in socialism was funded exclusively by the state, but since about 1990 the state has not been responsible for what is produced and, not surprisingly, the authorities have cut the subsidies of the costly film<br>

  Abstract: Since science fiction’s¹ advent in the early nineteenth century, concerns with humanity’s end have been one of the central issues thematized by the genre, abounding especially after World War II, when human self-destruction became a disturbing and looming possibility via the development of nuclear weapons and the mounting political tensions of the Cold War. These SF works, both printed and filmic, have certain things in common: they involve a cataclysmic event which brings about the epic destruction of humanity; they verbalize or visualize a collective trauma—human-induced disasters, natural catastrophes, or extra-terrestrial calamities; and depending on the scale of the<br>

  Book Title: Imperfection and Defeat-The Role of Aesthetic Imagination in Human Society<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nemoianu Virgil<br>
  Abstract: Literature is defined in a challenging way as the "science" of imperfection and defeat, or else as a type of discourse that deals with defeat, loss, uncertainty in social life, by contrast with virtually all disciplines (hard sciences or social sciences) that affirm certainties and wish to convince us of truths. If in real history most constructive attempts end up in failure, it follows that we ought to have also a field of research that examines this diversity of failures and disappointments, as well as the alternative options to historical evolution and progress. Thus literature serves an indispensable role: that of gleaning the abundance of past existence, the gratuitous and the rejected being placed here on an equal level with the useful and the successful. This provocative and unusual approach is illustrated in chapters that deal with the dialectics between literary writing and such fields as historical writing, or religious discourses, and is also illustrated by the socio-historical development of East-Central Europe.<br>

  Abstract: I will begin directly with this chapter’s thesis, leaving my conclusions to the end, along with some explanations as to how this helps the whole argument of the present book. My thesis is that over a large area of Central Europe—roughly covering what is now Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, the former Yugoslavia, Romania—society was pervaded by a common ethos, one that differed in many key points from the “Protestant work ethic.” The latter had been indispensable in the formation of modern capitalism and liberal democracy in Anglo-Saxon lands, and in Northwestern Europe in general.

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: The necessity of both solidarity and proceduralism thus holds for both distributive and criminal justice. In the end, Ricoeur remains committed to notions that ground the just polity in community and mutual sharing without thinking that these notions require us to dispense with the formalism of procedures of justice. While the latter are not sufficient on their own to create or sustain a just society, while, indeed, formal procedures always presuppose some conception of the good, procedural conceptions allow us to recognize each other as subjects of rights. Although it is not always clear that Ricoeur succeeds in reconciling Rawls and Walzer or Habermas and Gadamer, he does provide a fresh perspective on current debates within his own interesting account of the structure of moral action.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: ci.2002.28.issue-4<br>
Date: 06 2002<br>
Author(s): Vidal Fernando<br>
Abstract: What became implausible was not resurrection as such but the resurrection
         of the (same) body. Such a judgment stimulated the proposition of alternatives that deeply altered the landscape of belief. By the end of the eighteenth century, the psychological problem of personal identity had triumphed over the numerical sameness of bodies. Disembodiment thus sustained the doctrines of metempsychosis that, since the nineteenth century, have dominated over traditional Christian eschatology.124Yet, on the margins of this transformation, and independently of other discussions on the persistence of personality after death, debates took place during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries on the relations between the resurrection of the flesh and scientific models and data. A version of the germ theory was proposed in 1888; a century later, it was imaginable that DNA and raw materials could suffice to bring about the resurrection of the body.125<br>

In Stuart Hall’s (1973) example, a working‐class union member hears on the TV news that it is in “the national interest” to end inflation, but interprets the phrase as really meaning “in the interests of the corporate ruling class.”<br>

Abstract: The second reason for adopting Kuhns notion is that it is intimately tied to the question of (in)commensurability. I found this idea appealing because I had been feeling for quite some time that, once we start digging deeper, we might find considerable disagreement among colleagues on what constitutes an appropriate way of studying language from an anthropological perspective. It was the hidden incommensurability that I found interesting and tried to make explicit. Pace Rumseys reading, I never suggested that we should be looking for one shared or
         Urparadigm or that differences could be easily reconciled. Perhaps my call for a dialogue at the end of the article was misplaced and potentially misleading. I should then qualify it by saying that the call was never meant as a call for an ecumenical outcome. I take dialogue to mean the possibility of understanding, which may imply the recognition (as well as the achievement) of either agreement or disagreement.<br>

Abstract: However, all the interactions described above, relating to the functioning of this extended body, will totally disappear in the official text handed to me. Even though, as I tried to show previously,
         62Hawking attaches his singular and mortal being to the Corporation of Scientific Geniuses by using his mortal body to place himself in the tradition of his peers,63to establish the paternity of his ideas,64or to justify the choice of his fields of research,65he also effaces all physical evidence of his mortal body, despite its indispensability in the production of this paper. Indeed, Hawking is able to switch between thetalkandwritefunctions of the software. When the program is set towrite,what he composes is stored in a file as in a word processor, but when set ontalk,things are just written, said, and then cleared. Thus, sleeping like the unconscious, the computer’s memory is an immense repository of formal written articles, lectures, and interviews, while all the words concerning informal interactions evaporate, depending on whether or not Hawking deems them worthy of being saved. Accordingly, owing to the computer, I could “see” the (non)simultaneous functioning of these three bodies; owing to the same computer (assuming for example that Hawking had sent me his history by post), we might not have been able to “see” how the dissociation between these three bodies takes place. That is, how Hawking, through the mediation of the machine, could both make his extended body function and, as he responded to my questions, construct his identity as Stephen Hawking, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, while at the same time, as the interview moved towards its completion, effacing all presence of his physical body, the people who surround him, and even me. In his case, the noise and the conditions that made the interview possible were filtered out, not (just) afterwards by the analyst, as it is usually done, but during the interview itself. By the end of the interview,~<br>

Abstract: The Glorious Revolution was, Neal says, “a wonderful revolution” not least because it was “effected with little or no effusion of blood.” However, Neal’s account is critical of its outcomes, ascribed to the baleful role of high churchmen. The latter’s threat to separate in large numbers from a reformed church of England brought to an end all negotiations and all former promises of a comprehension and an unrestricted toleration. The Nonconformists were betrayed by the latitudinarians within the church in order to conciliate their shared enemies. They were, Neal protests, “sold to the Jacobites, by the timorousness of their Friends.”
      46An Act of Toleration was passed that removed some of the legislation against them, but they remained unexcepted from the Test and Corporation Acts and excluded from the universities. Indeed, had it been left to the High Church Tories, there would have been no Act of Toleration and a rapid return to the severities of the Stuart regime:
            On this disappointed and bitter notesuch was the ungrateful Return that these stubborn Churchmen made to those who assisted them in their Distress! For it ought to stand upon Record, that the Church of England had been twice rescued from the most imminent Danger by Men of those very Principles for whose Satisfaction they would not move a Pin or abate a Ceremony; first in the year 1660, when the Presbyterians restored the King and Constitution without making any Terms for themselves; and now again at the Revolution of King William, when the Church fled for Succour to a Presbyterian Prince, and was delivered by an Army of fourteen thousand Hollanders of the same Principles with the English Dissenters; but how uncivilly those Troops were used afterwards, is too ungrateful a Piece of History to remember.

Abstract: But are there not objections to be made? For example, following Heidegger, one could assimilate the biblical definition according to image and likeness to the Greek definition according to the possession of λόγος in order to understand both as imposing upon man the mode of Being “im Sinne des Vorhandensein” (“in the sense of subsistence [occurring and Being‐present‐at‐hand]”).
         40But what proof does Heidegger give of the equivalence between these two definitions? If necessary, the definition by λόγος could fall under reproach; but does the definition according to the image of God not exclude, precisely, anything having to do, in God and thus in man, with Being as subsistence (vorhanden)? Unless, that is, Heidegger includes neither definition in the division of finite being from infinite being.41But there too, does he not take up, as if it goes without saying, the metaphysical distinction par excellence of theensintofinitumandinfinitum, introduced by Duns Scotus through to Suarez, without seeing that this distinction doubtless contradicts the incomprehensibility of the image and likeness? Does he simply want, in the end, to deny theology the right to tackle the question of man’s status, just as he denies it that of responding to the question, “Why is there something rather than nothing?” by holding that “anyone for whom the Bible is divine revelation and truth already has the answer to the question … before it is asked: beings, with the exception of God Himself, are created by Him. God Himself ‘is’ as the uncreated Creator.” This remains, Heidegger believes, unacceptable, because “one who holds on to such faith as a basis can, perhaps, emulate and participate in the asking of our question in a certain way, but he cannot authentically question. … He can act only ‘as if’ [nun so tun `as ob'] … in the beginning God created heaven and earth, etc.’”42This argument presupposes in its turn that, by invoking creation, the believer confidently knows and thus comprehen~<br>

Abstract: Camus outlined his idea of his art and the role of the writer that is resonant with the title of his short story collection,
            Exile and the Kingdom,in his 1957 Nobel Prize acceptance speech, available online (http://www.nobel.se/literature/laureates/1957/camus‐acceptance.html): “[My art] is a means of stirring the greatest number of people by offering them a privileged picture of common joys and sufferings. It obliges the artist not to keep himself apart; it subjects him to the most humble and the most universal truth.… By definition he cannot put himself today in the service of those who make history; he is at the service of those who suffer it. Otherwise, he will be alone and deprived of his art. Not all the armies of tyranny with their millions of men will free him from his isolation, even and particularly if he falls into step with them. But the silence of an unknown prisoner, abandoned to humiliations at the other end of the world, is enough to draw the writer out of his exile, at least whenever, in the midst of the privileges of freedom, he manages not to forget that silence, and to transmit it in order to make it resound by means of his art.”<br>

Abstract: If the document stands at a remove from the genres of both literature and science, this epistemic positioning is related to another oddity of it, the fact that it is both
         ephemeralandpermanent. The memo, for example, might have an audience of one, or none; it might be read once, or never. But however vanishingly ephemeral its interest, it must nonetheless be preserved, that is,filed. It must stand forever at the ready in its stored form, to be consulted if desired by some hypothetical future reader. In this peculiar ontological state, the document differs essentially from the work of literature, which aspires to nothing less than an eternal reading, to canonicity, in Milton’s famous words to be “something so written to aftertimes that men shall not willingly let it die.”14At the other end of our epistemic axis, the writing of science aspires to release knowledge from the prison of its origin in the singularity of writing. So it is precisely the measure of Newton’s scientific achievement that his laws of motion can escape the gravity of hisPrincipia;these laws are freed from having to return always to theincipitof his writing, however interesting we may find that writing still to be. The document by contrast aspires only to a moment of interest, the moment of its transmission; once transmitted, its interest falls off potentially to a zero degree, and it suffers the indignity of being filed away.<br>

Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: Of course, not all of the possibilities revealed in interreligious encounter are compatible with one’s religious identity. The normative claims that, together with the practices with which they are correlated, define that identity will ultimately decide whether a given possibility is a theologically viable possibility. At this point the normative theological judgments that were suspended in order to allow the religious other to present itself to our understanding reassert themselves. An approach to the religious other governed by the
         epocheprinciple eventually gives way to theology proper. The former approach—represented by the complex of disciplines falling under the rubric of “the study of religion”—represents a constitutive, though only provisional, moment within the larger project of comparative theology.33But what renders the detour through interreligious understanding theologically significant is the conviction that one’s home tradition will be understood differently at the end of the process than it was at the beginning, thanks to the real changes undergone by the self in the moment of interreligious encounter.<br>

Abstract: For Kant, a “boundary” always presupposes a positive conception of the enclosing region (e.g., the field of noumena) beyond the enclosed space (e.g., the “field of experience”), defining a shared border where the two spaces “touch” (sec. 57). In contrast, a “limit” defines a border as merely a negation of an incomplete quantitative series. Theoretical reason (mathematics and natural science) has no boundary; new cognition extends to infinity. Bourgeois’s main point is that the very enterprise of critique founders without its boundary relation to the positive content provided by the Ideas of Reason (ideas of the completion of the series of conditions)—in particular, as “postulates of pure reason” practically indispensable for obedience to the objectively binding moral law. Bourgeois cites Kant: “[The end of reason] is ‘to point out to us actually not only the bounds of the pure use of reason, but also the way to determine them’” (p. 43). What grounds critique and critical metaphysics is not reason in its conditioned use, the understanding (
      Verstand) and its categories; rather, it is reason (Vernunft) in its unconditioned use that establishes the sources of cognition, their domain, boundaries, and relations.<br>

Furthermore, in the operation of configuration there is the expectation that the process of emplotment will have an end point, a conclusion to the process from which it can be perceived, even momentarily, as forming a whole. The conclusion occurs at the third operation but is expected during the second. It is at this step that we can speak of imagination in the sense that an act of configuration is the work of the productive imagination [14]. In terms of the process, configuration gives way to the next operation, which is refiguration, or mimesis3.<br>

Abstract: In
         Bodies That Matter(1993), a book that begins, significantly, with an epigraph from Haraway’s “A Cyborg Manifesto” (1991), Butler begins to ponder the problems of the analogical model, although race is arguably still added to arguments about gender and sexuality. The bulk of the introduction theorizes the constructedness of “sex” and interrogates the critical assumption of a prior, unmarked category of sex onto which gender is culturally imposed. Instead of constructedness, Butler proposes the notion of matter, a process that “produce[s]the effect of boundary, fixity, and surface we call matter” (1993, 9). Sex and the contours of the body, Butler argues, are regulated by the heterosexual imperative. It is only much later in the introduction, after the theorizations of the body, sex, and matter have been made, that Butler introduces, as part of her chapter summaries, the idea that “normative heterosexuality is clearly not the only regulatory regime in the production of bodily contours” (1993, 17). Structurally, that is, body, sex, and matter are constituted as the main items of theory to which race is added. As Butler argues, race is not simply another domain separable from sexual difference, “but … its ‘addition’ subverts the monolithic workings of the heterosexual imperative as I have described it so far” (18). Although Butler is clearly aware of the problems of simply adding race to the understandings of the body and of sex, her own positioning of race in the introduction is nonetheless additive. Yet Butler goes on to suggest a focus on the specificities as well as intersections of race and gender construction: “It seems crucial to resist the model of power that would set up racism and homophobia and misogyny as parallel or analogical relations. The assertion of their abstract or structural equivalence not only misses the specific history of their construction and elaboration, but also delays the important work of thinking through the ways in which thes~<br>

Abstract: The model of interreligious engagement here proposed for Christian theology as a way of creating a politically unifying narrative of identity via intentional hybridization, then, is some kind of dialectical relationship between a comparative‐theological undertaking and an inclusivist or confessional‐pluralist theology of religions taking place on the basis of mutual recognition of free participatory agency. Under this model, the demand of another religious tradition for recognition of worth, possibly for the sake of redressing a historical injustice, is first met by my initial theological assessment and recognition of it as attractive and appealing. Having been drawn and opened up to the appeal of another tradition by my initial recognition of its worth, I then descend to the “depth of its riches” by means of the comparative‐theological undertaking of dialogue and immersion.
         38Such an unreserved encounter with another tradition in a posture of openness and vulnerability eventually leads me to revise my original assessment of it and the theological presuppositions on the basis of which that initial recognition was given. In philosophical terms this process could be called a dialectic of infinity and relative totality, in which one’s totalizing recognitive horizon is challenged and relativized by its encounter with the infinite voice of the Other that breaks into and overflows it, leading to a reconfiguration of the totalizing horizon internally and of its assessment of the other externally.39When interreligious engagement is envisaged thus as a dialectic of theology of religions (which represents the comprehensive and totalizing horizon) and comparative theology (which introduces the voice of the infinite Other), what can be expected as the end product of this process is a new and expanded theological horizon that can either recognize the other’s worth in a more informed manner or withdraw the initial recognition in light of a new disclosure of the other’s r~<br>

Abstract: Balliani, “Ragionamento I,” in
            Ragionamenti, 39–40. A similar concept is treated in “Ragionamento IX” (Ragionamenti, 337), where Balliani reminds us that God ordered Moses to place a vase full of water at the entrance of the tabernacle where the high priests could wash their hands. Moses also put some mirrors in which the priests could check if they had any stains to wash off (Exodus 38). In the powerful “Ode in honor della Sacratissima Sindone” (published at the end of Agaffino Solaro’sSindone evangelica, historica, theologica[Turin: Cavalleris, 1627], n.p.), Guido Casoni expands the metaphor of the shroud as “divine mirror of eternal beauties” (verse 15), in which “the loving soul contemplates and sees / glory in torments and mercy in pain” (verses 31–32). Two short quotations from Casoni’s poem on the shroud had already been published in Quarantotto’sLa Sacra Sindone, 13, 19. Let us remember that the image of Christ as a mirror reflecting our own humanity is the core of St. Clare of Assisi’s mysticism. InThe Fourth Letter to Agnes of Prague, Clare suggests that Agnes “look daily into this mirror and continually study [her] face in it” (St. Clare of Assisi, “The Fourth Letter,” inFranciscan Christology, trans. Eric Doyle, 37). In “The Third Letter,” Clare speaks of the “mirror of eternity” (speculo eternitatis; 33).<br>

Abstract: In this passage, the strongest sense of the implications of Midrash for Christian community and practice emerges within Frei’s work. Here, the distinctive political implications of the literal sense for Christian community begin to emerge. This passage, at the end of one of his most influential essays, is particularly striking because the Midrash‐centered life of Judaism, in its particularity, models what Frei wants the Christian community to become.<br>

Abstract: To this end I reintroduce the distinction made earlier in this article between the participant and observer perspectives. I recall that the exclusivist and inclusivist models are approaches from a Christian participant perspective. This means that those who identify with Christianity view their tradition from their insider perspective and then examine and evaluate other religions from that same perspective. Pluralism proceeds differently. It examines all religions, including the one that the person identifies with (e.g., Christianity), from an observer perspective. One adopts the position of an outsider, also toward Christianity, and describes how individuals and groups in the various religions are inspired by divine manifestation with a veridical force that stimulates them to follow the way of (active and/or passive) salvation, individually and/or collectively, spiritually and/or materially.
            39That is what distinguishes pluralism from the other two models: one distances oneself and takes a sort of helicopter view of the diverse ways followed by people in different religions in their search for truth, oneness, and wholeness. In this they appear to be inspired by myths and rituals, which function as cognitive, affective, and enacted models of reality, and to be motivated by these myths and rituals as models for reality to attain reconciliation and peace in their own microcosm and macrocosm.40<br>

Abstract: The paradox is that the mausoleum was imposed in 1949 as a public symbol and barely existed as private thought. Today, it is physically excised from the public space but is present as an architectural specter in one's private spatial memory: “Let's meet at the mausoleum!”
         103This will be the case until the generations that have seen it will themselves have passed away, and with them any trace of individual memory of the mausoleum will be demographically cleansed. This should bring at last the private and public closure of the mausoleum of Georgi Dimitrov in Sofia. Koselleck has remarked that “political experiences or messages can only be passed down beyond the death of a particular generation with great effort. To this end, societal institutions are required. In any case, the memorial, the supposed guarantor of sensory transmission beyond death, does not appear to be capable of achieving this task by itself. A conscious adoption of the message is always necessary.”104The demolishers seem to have overestimated the power of the memorial.<br>

Author(s): Wall John<br>
Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Abstract: How, then, in the end, can moral creativity be saved from the traditional Platonic objection to the moral corruptibility of human poetics itself? This can be done by forging a link between the above contemporary hermeneutical advances and our earlier reflections on humanity as an
         imitatio Dei. Moral life can finally be reclaimed as “poetic” through a fresh and indeed creative mythological affirmation of moral “imitation” as such. This is what I mean by symbolizing humanity as uniquely and originally animitatio Creatorisor “imitation of the Creator.”<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: The concept of the good may apply particularly pointedly to professional codes of ethics. The codes are aimed at the positive right of free speech and also at professional responsibility. They attempt to articulate practical and normative standards of ethics. Both the ALA Code of Ethics and the American Society for Information Science and Technology Professional Guidelines speak in terms of responsibility to communities, to the profession, and to society as a whole. Public pronouncement of the codes does serve to affirm the existence of libraries as just institutions in a democracy. Related to the second scenario above, accuracy does fit with the good since it is in people’s interest to obtain accurate information that they can employ for their own well‐being. Advocacy is certainly not always and everywhere prohibited, but it is secondary to people’s right to information that is as accurate as it is possible to provide. Accuracy also embraces a commitment to truth, which recognizes a fundamental inequality of some information (the true and the false; refer again to the first scenario). It is generally taken to be responsible professionalism to check information sources against one another to corroborate information. This action, as Lynch observes, is not a substitute for truth; it is a means to truth (in the weak sense) [
         19, p. 81]. Toward the end of accuracy and truth, there are some closely related matters. For one thing, there have been some persistent challenges related to government information and its accessibility versus its effective suppression. This is an area in which advocacy and accuracy merge, with the common aim of presenting library users with the most authoritative information possible. Also, libraries’ access mechanisms, including subject headings, can benefit from advocacy directed toward language that encompasses the culture, linguistic distinctions, and other facets of the people who will search for information.<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: This posited, Popkin furnishes a wealth of information on the origins of the historian’s autobiography (Hume, Gibbon, Vico), its nineteenth‐century expressions (Dilthey, Henry Adams), and especially its sociological and literary characteristics during the second half of the twentieth century. Most authors have been white males, from middle‐class backgrounds, nearing the end of distinguished careers. Still, women, minorities (especially Jews), historians of working‐class origin, and middle‐aged authors have made inroads since the 1980s. This produces significant differences: women, for instance, are less likely than men to link their vocation to their teenage interest in history or to depict a nurturing community of scholars. Popkin minimizes, however, the impact of sociology. Commonalities predominate in his analysis. Most historian‐autobiographers, for one, frame their life stories as bildungsroman narratives, in which the author’s personality takes shape through the choice of a vocation. Like Friedrich Meinecke, they tell tales of self‐discovery, free will, and success. Their chronological accounts usually begin with warm childhoods in families that encouraged reading, education, and a thoughtful path toward a meaningful career. They then describe the pivotal apprenticeship and university years, the key mentors, and the decision‐making process through which the authors exercised their will and defined themselves. Theirs is invariably a process of choice rather than conflict or sudden illumination, even if world events captured the imaginations of many budding historians.<br>

Abstract: Derrida’s reference to heritage, and the responsibility to the latter, does not necessarily imply that he would dismiss the notion of tradition. Let us only emphasize that, in contrast to Gadamer, Derrida does not hold tradition to be homogeneous. Indeed, within the tradition one finds “dominant structures, discourses which silence others, by covering over or destroying the archive” (Derrida,
            Politics of Friendship,trans. George Collins [London, 1997], p. 233). Even though repeatedly he notes that “it is no longer possible touseseriously the words of tradition” (Derrida, “Some Statements and Truisms about Neologisms, Newisms, Postisms, Parasitisms, and Other Small Seismisms,” trans. Anne Tomiche, inThe States of Theory, ed. David Caroll [New York, 1990], p. 74), and that in the end all concepts of the tradition have to be put aside, he also “reaffirms the necessity of making recourse to them, at least, in a crossed‐out fashion” (Derrida,Psyché: Inventions de l’autre[Paris, 2003], p. 390; my trans.). Responsibility to the tradition and its deconstruction go hand in hand.<br>

Abstract: What this “provincialism … of time” or what temporal narrowing has opened up is the time of the present as the locus of noncontemporaneous contemporaneity. This is not Arendt’s gap, as such, but the constant concourse of mixed temporalities mingling and coexisting with each other—the historical uncanny that has always remained in the shadow of capital and “our” modernity. Nor is it the end of a historical process, but the recognition that the “intimate structuring of Western culture … had collapsed on our heads” and with it, in particular, the concept of modern history founded on the conceit of process and progress that, for Arendt, still constituted an experience of disoriented time (quoted in
         RH,p. 15).24<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: The building of Zion remains the “future project” of the LDS Church and is “intimately related to the ways in which it remembers itself.”
         93The promise of Zion still orders the experience of Smith’s faithful readers, providing them a beginning and an end between which they, as his readers—by means of their own heuristic powers of imagination—get their bearings to act. Their local ecclesiastical units are called “stakes,” symbolic of the stakes that anchor the tent of Zion, and are collectively referred to as “the stakes of Zion.” Thus, as with other myths that have founded a sense of peoplehood, Smith’s narrative history of human and divine interaction was ultimately oriented to a future time that served as a basis for acting in the present. It provided a world of meaning by which his believing readers understood themselves existentially, including their future and not merely their past. Most fundamentally, Smith’s writings give his believing readers a different sense of what was and what will be and, as a consequence, give significance to and a sense of what is real in the present. Just as the story of a realized messiah and the coming kingdom profoundly reoriented the Jews called “Christian,” Smith’s writings of the “fulness of times” provided a unique means by which the Latter‐day Saints’ alterity has been maintained, even as they integrated with contemporary society.<br>

Article Title: Two Apologetic Moments in Śaṅkara’s Concept of Brahman<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: Against the first characterization of Advaita teaching, the recognition of the double‐voiced character of Śaṅkara’s interpretation of the
         anayatvamsutra (II.1.14)—that is, as internally constituted by the realist cosmological discourse that it subverts—suggests that the interpretation of theBhāṣya’steaching in terms of the illusionist doctrine ofmāyāvādais reductionistic. Moreover, well‐intentioned attempts to dissociate Śaṅkara frommāyāvādathat presume a monological conception of theBhāṣya’sdiscourse, attempts such as that of Srinivasa Rao mentioned above, end up effectively conceding the claim they set out to deny; their affirmation of the reality of the world typically appeals to a denial of substantial change, a claim that implicitly relegates changing, finite existences to the realm of the unreal.114As for the static and abstract conception of brahman, this notion can be seen as the result of the later tradition’s attempt to impose a rigid, categorical distinction between the concepts ofīśvaraand the highest (paraṃ) brahman. This effort to systematize Śaṅkara’s somewhat inconsistent, fluid, and intuitive use of the termīśvarawith respect to the various expressions for brahman effectively pulls apart the dialectical interplay between the personalistic and impersonalistic aspects of brahman in theBrahma‐sūtra‐Bhāṣya. What Hacker characterizes as an “illogical” combination of intuitive theism and intellectual monism can perhaps be better understood as an instance of what Michael Sells, in a discussion of apophatic language in the West, calls “a discourse of double propositions.”115A reading of theBrahma‐sūtra‐Bhāṣyathat appreciates the creative interplay among this text’s multiple voices preserves the vitality and intensity of theBhāṣya’sdiscourse on brahman, a liveliness of expression that we may assume more accurately reflects Śaṅkara’s religious vision.<br>

Abstract: An alternative end to my account of the fate of re‐vision and its place in feminism today presented itself when, recently, a student came to me to discuss a possible subject for her bachelor’s thesis. She wanted to write something that would contribute to the current debate: a feminist topic, she said, but not, as she put it, “women on the barricades.” One idea she had was to write about Anita Diamant’s
         The Red Tent(1997). This novel tells the story of the biblical Dinah, daughter of Leah and Jacob. My student had picked up the book while on holiday in Spain and had been deeply moved by it. It had transformed her views on the Bible and made her rethink the relation of women to the biblical narratives.<br>

Abstract: If one considers all the books that line the shelves of any given library as a collection, including the acquisition of materials for that collection, its accessibility, and its dissemination, a unique concern about truth is revealed. Consider any given library as a record of humanity’s accomplishments and failures. Both the beauty and the ugliness of humanity’s history must be represented in this collection. Sadly, however, this balanced perspective about humanity’s accomplishments and failures is often compromised by a number of factors. One such factor, often affecting public libraries, is the decision to avoid community outcry concerning controversial material. Such material could be different lifestyle perspectives, negative views of various stages of American or world history, art or literature that is deemed morally offensive, and hate literature. Regardless of the truth value of the propositions and perspectives contained in such controversial literature, the truth value must be suspended so that a complete picture of recorded history is not compromised. If the historical record is compromised, any and all theories of truth would be compromised. To what end would an individual or some group in society want this? Just as it is often said that knowledge is power, the compromising of knowledge puts that power in the hands of the compromiser.<br>

Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives.

Abstract: Narratography thus intercepts even the subtlest narratologies of closure. Where a critic like D. A. Miller might distinguish between the “nonnarratable” future of the new Clennam marriage (beyond the needs and scope of story) and the more explicit bar at the end to its “unnarratable” predecessor in the disbanded love match (beyond story's tolerance), narratography would detect the strain of that renewed exclusion of the mother.

Abstract: This is a radical form of metaphysical transcendence: after the allegory of love will have become incorporated in the universe of creation at the end of time, even the most ordinary of mirrors will reflect it punctually because love will have become all‐pervasive, identical with reality. In mortal time, the trope of the mirror of introspection stands for the existential stratagem leading to Augustine’s antiutilitarian affirmation of choice over circumstance, fruition (
         fruendis frui) over usage (utendis uti), love over personal convenience. Only through the paradoxical expedient of such a transformative self‐denial may Augustine’s soul fully come into its own as the token of his personal identity.<br>

Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Equally important, war requires a moral justification, an argument that appeals to the public reason of conscientious persons. War is not self‐justifying, and it may not be sought in haste. For this reason, just‐war morality calls forth the civic virtue of critical self‐analysis. As Plato understood in his design of the Republic, the institution of war must be framed by a broader set of parameters, in which self‐reflection and contemplation of the Good mark the highest forms of human activity. Hence Plato’s desire to subordinate the Guardians to the Philosopher‐Kings along with the need to rank warrior‐poetry below philosophy. The purposes that war might serve must stand within a framework that is self‐reflexive and ordered to activities that do not glorify war as an end in itself. In just‐war morality, reality is not organized in conflictual terms according to which martial virtues are goods in themselves.

Abstract: If anything characterizes our age it is the many endangerments to and alterations of life ranging from the genetic to the planetary. In this situation, some thinkers insist that we need a heuristics of fear about the possible end of nature and also to focus on human mortality in order to evoke a sense of responsibility.
         35Jacques Derrida puts this forcefully inThe Gift of Death. “My irreplaceability is therefore conferred, delivered, ‘given,' one can say, by death. It is the same gift, the same source, one could say the same goodness and the same law. It is from the site of death as the place of my irreplaceability, that is, of my singularity, that I feel called to responsibility. In this sense only a mortal can be responsible.”36As Socrates is reported to have claimed, philosophy is about learning to die. Yet that is not quite right, I submit. While showing wherein the consciousness of responsibility might arise—that is, in the singularity of being toward death, my own or that of the other—the focus on mortality by Socrates, Derrida, Ricoeur, and others cannot clarify the purpose of responsibility, that is, the good human power is to serve. At best, it discloses that we ought not to do harm, a demand of nonmaleficence. Ethical reflection on how we ought to live too often dodges the question of why we ought to affirm life, our own, that of others, and also the wider compass of life on this planet. Here religious resources can and must be explored. That is, too often a theological or philosophical ethicist fails to grasp what Augustine profoundly understood, namely, that the remembrance of death is itself inscribed within life, and, therefore, one can bring this vitality to articulation in terms of the good that moral responsibility can and ought to respect and enhance.37This opens and requires theological reflection into responsibility itself. How then are we to articulate the purpose of responsibility beyond the claims of a modern, humanistic orientation, ~<br>

Author(s): Eades Caroline<br>
Abstract: These methodological oversights are surprising since Eades is clearly familiar with research exploring the links between history, memory, and collective representations. She cites Jacques Le Goff, Marc Ferro, Pierre Nora, Michel de Certeau, Paul Ricoeur, and Henry Rousso alongside a wide range of colonial/postcolonial historians and theorists, including Robert Stam, Benjamin Stora, Edward Said, Homi Bhabha, and Dominick LaCapra. In the end, theory and formal analysis drown out contextual issues of production, distribution, and reception. Three of the book's four chapters deal primarily with theme and form; only the first examines historiographic issues in their own right. This imbalance is not necessarily a flaw, but it does illustrate the challenges of interdisciplinary research and writing. Many film scholars will welcome the author's extraordinarily detailed inventory of the strategies used in postcolonial cinema to critique imperialism, particularly the creative subversion (and to a lesser extent, perpetuation) of representational conventions inherited from colonial‐era painting, literature, and movies. On the other hand, cultural historians will likely be disappointed by the lack of attention paid to the life of these films in society, the multiple meanings attached to them by viewers, and their relation to competing discourses of the same era.<br>

Abstract: It is explicitly cinema's contribution of new concepts that prompts Rodowick, in another state‐of‐the‐field article, to hitch both Deleuze and Stanley Cavell to an enterprise within “philosophy” rather than within “theory,” whose energy he declares to be drained.
         47For theory seems too programmatic and imperious, whether driven by science in Althusser's sense (Grand Theory) or by models taken from natural and cognitive science (posttheory). Defending the latter, in a rebuke to Rodowick, Malcolm Turvey proudly reminds us that once continental film studies had been deracinated from the anglophone field, thanks largely to the relentless analyses of Noël Carroll, room was cleared for specific, targeted, and useful work. Turvey runs through a litany of recent and distinct gains in theories of emotion, editing, perception, imagination, pleasure, music, comprehension, interpretation, character identification, narrative, and suspense.48While those who write books and articles in these areas invariably do so by turning to well‐developed notions in the social sciences or philosophy, they do so, Turvey believes, from the strength of their own discipline. Here he connects to something I have been advocating all along; “most of us are not philosophers, sociologists, or economists butfilmscholars. What this means is that, at the end of the day, we have to use our expertise—gained from watching large numbers of films, observing them and the response of viewers to them carefully, and learning about the contexts in which they were made and exhibited—to evaluate the theories we take from other disciplines in terms of whether they successfully explain (or not) film.”49<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: First, from the perspective of Coleridge studies, prayer—as noted above—is an important yet overlooked topic that is treated, if at all, from an overwhelmingly synchronic perspective, alongside other aspects of Coleridge’s thought rather than within a tradition of thinking on prayer specifically. This is despite prayer playing critical roles in some of his most famous poetry and acting as the focus for much of his intellectual energy in his late career. Emphasizing the diachronic leads to our second reason, which is that Coleridge was placed pivotally across a romantic watershed in theology: after Kant, the higher criticism, and the collapse of the religion of natural reason, and at a moment when religious subjectivity was being reconceptualized by contemporaries like Friedrich Schleiermacher. Coleridge’s reflections can be analyzed within this context as marking a new way in which prayer was to be understood in relation to faith, knowledge, and rationality. As such, an important part of my argument below shall be to compare Coleridge with Kant, Kierkegaard, and others, proving that he stands at an important crux in the historical perception of prayer and faith itself. Finally, an investigation of Coleridge’s philosophy of prayer is all the more pertinent given renewed interest in the phenomenology and language of prayer within recent Continental philosophy and literary theory, accounts to which I shall return at the end of this article. The possibility of prayer—as a performative directed to an absolute Other—continues to engage a contemporary philosophical fascination with the limits of both language and subjectivity, limits that are in no small part related to the philosophical legacies of Kantianism, romanticism, and early nineteenth‐century theology.<br>

Issue: 605587<br>
Date: 6 2010<br>
Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: Dupré complements this account with an attentiveness to cultural continuities between the Enlightenment and preceding periods. Although historical thought during the eighteenth century tended to privilege the possibilities of the future over obligations to the past, at least some measure of faith in distant origins informs works such as Bossuet's
         Histoire universelleand even Vico'sScienza nuova, the latter imploring readers to preserve the “poetic wisdom” of the ancients or else sacrifice their present to a meaningless rationalism. Nor did eighteenth-century historians unanimously profess a belief in progress. Vico, for instance, viewed providence as a cyclical pattern of advancement and decline. Edward Gibbon, the century's most illustrious historian, went even farther in his refusal to accept Enlightenment claims of progress at face value. Despite his commitment to the idea that material and intellectual improvements could forestall decline, the imposing shadow of Rome cast doubt on the possibility that vast empires could avoid its fate in the end. Dupré's interpretation on this point differs from that of J. G. A. Pocock, who argues in his massive study ofThe Decline and Fallthat Gibbon usually resisted the temptation to equate Rome's landed empire with Britain's maritime, commercial network of colonies. Both Pocock and Dupré agree, however, that Gibbon's work effectively removed Christian ends from narratives of the past, thereby facilitating what Pocock calls “an emancipation of secular history from sacred” (Dupré, 187–228, quote on 195).43<br>

Abstract: Aiding in this iconical reconfiguration were the microadjusting features of ritual performance. Procedures such as shaving, showering, praying, and blowing Quranic verses helped to heighten the register of the ritual event, and ultimately to instantiate an irreversible commitment to the end goal. Indeed, the entire ritual process might be seen as secondary to, or at least supportive of, the oath unto death in section 1. No differently than oaths in ancient war literature, the oath of the last instructions was a highly sanctified liturgical order that aimed to instantiate a commitment and to communicate binding intent.<br>

Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: The decisive question remains: what is promised? What offered gift can we take as the token‐as‐promise among the wealth of signs and givens that wash through the world? Owing to his view of prophetic criticism, Tillich claimed that yesterday’s prophetic act may be in need of revision and criticism today. This means that few or no signs may be taken as offered tokens. However, it would not be the case, he thinks, that Protestantism simply would carry out a sort of semiotic iconoclasm, wringing its hands, worried that every sign in the world is always a failing. Interestingly, at the end of his essay he turns to the congregation, and there we may find some ways to construe the prophetic as sign of the cross. Tillich does not develop what he calls the protestant form of grace, a chastened form that would dissent in his view from the objectification of what he calls Catholicism. Of course, this is a severely limited judgment on Tillich’s part, since there are many vibrant accounts of the Eucharist—Catholic and Protestant—together with their practical and political significance that are deeply marked by the same engagements and imperatives that Tillich raised.
         46These senses of Eucharist still would benefit from reflection on promise, and its local form in the congregation makes better sense when it is framed by the Eucharist as site of promise, gift, exchange, and free reciprocity. Eucharist, briefly, invokes the character of promise as the offering of Jesus’s testament as well as a mutual action that is both communion as exchange between God and creation as well as in and amid creation. It would not take much to think through the Eucharist as the liturgical action and embodiment of promise, to reconsider it and its practice toward being otherwise than sovereign, as I have written here. Suffice it to note that the Eucharist is a meal of betrayal, as theVerbaalways announce: “On the night in which he was betrayed.”<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: On the jury were Jean Wahl, Vladimir Jankélévitch, Paul Ricoeur, Gabriel Marcel, and Georges Blin. In the audience standing very discretely was Maurice, always the friend, the unique and brotherly interlocutor. It was the following morning that Maurice Blanchot came to visit Emmanuel Lévinas at his home on 59 rue d'Auteuil. He had, it seems to me, been there several times since the war. This thesis defense of the previous evening marked the end of my father's institutional isolation. Undoubtedly emotion dominated, too strong. Words were pointless.<br>

Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: Rather, the category of literature is troubling for Lévinas. On the one hand, it is clear that a number of Lévinas's most important influences are literary. His recently published
         Carnets de captivitédevotes considerable attention to Proust as a source for his analysis of sociality and even include notes and plans for his own novel.15In later works he quotes Alyosha Karamazov almost as frequently as Descartes.16On the other hand, he is also at times quite damning of literature as an aesthetic pursuit. His most critical statements about literature appear in “Reality and Its Shadow.” Published at the end of 1948, ten months after Blanchot's “Literature and the Right to Death,” this essay is a response to both Blanchot and Sartre's “What Is Literature?” Lévinas condemns literature here as fundamentally escapist. “The poet exiles himself from the city,” he writes. Speaking of artistic pleasure more generally, he adds, “There are times when one could be ashamed of it, as if carousing in a town struck by the plague.”17He does not have much sympathy for catharsis.<br>

Abstract: Let me end by offering my own provocation to thinking about the relationship of history of science with literature and science, one that aims to invite historians of science to explore science as a form of making that involves the convergence of things, material practices, and “meaningful artifacts,” embracing a panoply of possibilities from metaphoric to narrative to visual to instrumental resources.
         8Elsewhere, I have written:
               At stake in the convergence of history of science and literature and science, I would submit, is the very possibility of a poetics of science: of understanding science as itself a form ofThe world as we know it and operate upon it is one in which we continually conjoin discourse and practice, text and action: where we simultaneously learn
            andact by embodying intentions and projecting our metaphorically constructed models onto matter which we shape and use to our ends asinstrumentsof thought and action. The world as we know it and study it is filled with material‐textual, or material‐discursive, hybrids—instruments; machines; illustrations; diagrams; maps; charts; physical models; computer simulations—that are simultaneously part of the material world andinstrumentsfor our knowing and manipulating it. They are all, in their own way, what I like to callmaterial metaphors: embodied metaphors‐in‐action!9

Abstract: Similes like this function both as equation or analogy and to describe a natural phenomenon that draws attention to itself as indifferent to humans and as an end, an entity with its own incarnate viability. In
         Purgatorio26, several similes describe the lovers of both preferences, likening the lovers to ants, to birds, and to fish: “così per entro loro schiera bruna/ s'ammusa l'una con l'altra formica, / forse a spïar lor via e lor fortuna” (thus within their dark band one ant touches muzzle with another, perhaps to spy out their way and their fortune) (26.34–36); “Poi, come grue ch'a le montagne Rife / volasser parte, e parte inver’ l'arene, / queste del gel, quelle del sole schife” (Then, like cranes that should fly, some to the Riphaean mountains and others toward the sands, these shy of the frost, those of the sun) (26.43–45); “Poi, forse per dar luogo altrui secondo / che presso avea, disparve per lo foco, / come per l'acqua il pesce andando al fondo” (Then, perhaps to give place to another following close behind he vanished through the flames like a fish that goes through the water to the bottom) (26.133–35). In the medieval context, ants, fish, and birds are common images for prudent community (ants) and for the human soul (birds and fish), so these choices follow a conventional pattern.61<br>

Abstract: What is left, then, of memory's scope and power? one might ask. How to handle the flow of memory and oblivion, the lengthy stretches of desire, the postponement of fulfillment, of the “tomorrow, tomorrow” versus the instantaneous pressure of the present: “Why not now? Why not now an end to my impure life in this very hour?”?
      
            Only the verticality of oblivion:17
         
            Now, there is no denying that this text sounds utterly seducing, expressing longing and desire, falling short and finding fulfillment all at once. As such, it can be called representative of the pulse of the Augustinian language. Yet putting things this way would fail to do justice to the tight nature of
               
         Sero te amavi, late have I loved you, beauty so old and so new:sero te amavi,late have I loved you. And see, you were within and I was in the external world and sought you there, and in my unlovely state I plunged into those lovely created things which you made. You were with me, and I was not with you. The lovely things kept me far from you, though if they did not have their existence in you, they had no existence at all. You called and cried out loud and shattered my deafness. You were radiant and resplendent, you put to flight my blindness. You were fragrant, and I drew in my breath and now pant after you. I tasted you, and I feel but hunger and thirst for you. You touched me, and I am set on fire to attain the peace which is yours.

Abstract: These criticisms and oversights notwithstanding, there are many redeeming aspects to the book. Insofar as hermeneutics and exegesis are essential for any understanding of religious texts and traditions, Thistleton's work is a good way to be introduced to a complex history, the thorny debates, and the diverse approaches that have come to constitute its history and development. And the copious references that are made throughout and at the end of each chapter will enable readers to probe more deeply into a thinker, subject, or historical period of interest to them.<br>

Abstract: With this understanding of human rights, Regan shows how secular human rights and Christian theology engage in common themes, interests, and areas of concern, arguing that both have in the recent past and could continue in the future to benefit from a reciprocity of critique. In this descriptive mode, Regan discusses the emergence and development of liberation theology but also highlights intellectual engagement with human rights discourse of the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church from the end of WWII to the post–Second Vatican Council era. While reverent toward the deepening and thickening of the church’s vision of the human person, Regan also challenges the institutional church to reflect on apparent moments of dissonance between its theory of human personalism and praxis.<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: Our other literary doctor is less ambiguous, a better example of evil as a purely human phenomenon. Dr. Jekyll was not compelled by the limits of science and wisdom to seek a supernatural solution to his quest for enhanced pleasure and human fulfillment. For him, excess was transmuted into malevolence as he literally became addicted to evil. By the end, one has to suspect that the potion did not actually transform the mild and moral Dr. Jekyll, but in fact brought out Mr. Hyde as his true self—monstrous and evil. If an anthropological study of morality is addressed to the question of what it means to be human—synonymous with the question of defining human nature—this possibility of evil cannot be dodged. The likelihood that Jekyll did not initially realize that he was flirting with and then succumbing to evil enhances the tragedy and, for us, defines the conceptual ground upon which an anthropological approach to morality must be constructed.

Abstract: Janet Adelman sees in Lear’s actions “the rage of an abandoned infant.” G. Wilson Knight remarks that the king’s “tremendous soul” is “incongruously geared to a puerile intellect.” According to Knight, “Lear is mentally a child; in passion, a Titan.” For Jan Kott, both Lear and Gloucester are “too ridiculous” to be tragic: they are “clowns who do not yet know they are clowns.” Nowhere is this more apparent than in Gloucester’s attempt to end his life. The attempted suicide, Kott writes, “is merely a circus somersault on an empty stage…the classic expression of buffoonery.” See Janet Adelman,

Author(s): Hequembourg Stephen<br>
Abstract: In the cosmos of
         Paradise Lostthere is perhaps no stranger fact than this—that the Son at his greatest moment in the poem says almost exactly the same thing as Adam at his worst. I say “almost” because it is of course the minor differences that make all the difference in Milton’s world. The Son is able to imagine the manner in which Satan might react to the fall of man, but unlike Adam, he refuses to give voice to that possibility. He chooses not to speak for the devil. Adam, however, relishes the opportunity to speak the words of another as his own. As in the cases of Eve and Raphael, the dramatic potential of this moment is too often unrecognized. How does Adam look and sound when he suddenly begins to act in the role of archfiend? Does he exclaim like a Roman orator and make elaborate gestures? Does he extend an index finger toward his chest when he says “Me first / He ruined,” feeling perhaps the thrill of being not entirely himself? But again, if Satan will never be able to say these words, then the “me” Adam points to can in the end be no one but himself. It is hardly surprising that in the very next line he consents to the formal act of sin, telling Eve: “I with thee have fixed my lot” (9.952).<br>

Author(s): Huth Kimberly<br>
Abstract: Given the disorder of the final scene, it is hardly surprising that the onstage audience, the Duke, fails to understand the play. At one point he asks, “What’s the conceit of that?” (5.1.157). Caught up in the play, the Duke seeks artistic interpretation, the “conceit,” not criminal explanation of the deaths he witnesses. His question indicates the failure of the masque to make sense out of the suffering the Duke mistakenly thinks is part of the tragic script. Offstage audiences, however, have a larger play-text to draw from when trying to parse the significance of this violence. Hippolyto’s metaphors of fire connect his pain with earlier moments in the play’s exploration of familial relationships and corporeal identity. Astute listeners will remember that in act 4, Hippolyto railed against his sister Livia’s affair with Leantio, saying that his zeal to put an end to her relationship with someone below his family’s class “Puts fire into my blood” (4.2.14). The fire metaphor of the final scene recalls this motif of “fire in the blood” and frames his physical suffering within a larger tragic structure. Fittingly for a revenge plot, Hippolyto is brought down in a manner that references his own character traits.<br>

Abstract: For Aristotle, chance is a cause, similar to nature as a cause. Natural motions operate both for a purpose and in accordance with necessity. They are purposive since the sequences of natural processes are not at random. Having set forth the principles, causes, and kinds of motions, Aristotle proceeds in the third and fourth books of his
      Physicsto determine the nature of motion and to examine fundamental concepts, such as infinity, place, void, and time, associated with motion. It is at the end of the fourth book of thePhysics, Mooij maintains, that Aristotle posits the principle, “there can be no time without the rational mind, that mind is only required to measure something that in other respects has full existence independently of the mind” (p. 77).<br>

Abstract: The essays in
         Eric Voegelin's Dialogues with the Postmodernsare uniformly excellent in their exploration of “foundations without foundationalism”; however, like most volumes of collected essays, it only offers suggestions of a synthesis between Voegelin and postmodernism. Both have different interpretations of classical philosophy and transcendence; both are critics of the metaphysical certainty of the Enlightenment project; and both fail to offer a theory of institutionalized politics. Interestingly, at the end of the volume, the editors propose Camus as a possible synthesis to understand Voegelin and other postmodern thinkers. They fail to develop this theme, however, which is all the more puzzling, since both editors have written on Camus (“Reconstructing the World: Albert Camus and the Symbolization of Experience,”JOP61:2 [1999]); or, it may be that they plan a sequel that will expand on their suggested synthesis.<br>

Article Title: Poetics of Conspiracy and Hermeneutics of Suspicion in Tacitus's<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: ca.2013.32.issue-1<br>
Date: 04 2013<br>
Abstract: This article argues that the end of Tacitus's
         Dialogus de Oratoribusis inconclusive in ways that draw attention to the difficulty of interpretation not onlyofthe dialogue, as by modern scholars, but alsointhe dialogue, as by its leading characters. The inconclusiveness is especially marked by a commonly noted, but little discussed, feature of the end: when the rest of the characters laugh at the point of departure, Tacitus himself does not. Arguing that this difference of affective response on the part of the characters prefigures differences in interpretive response on the part of readers, the article identifies different strains in recent scholarship: pessimistic and optimistic. Both forms of response entail an attribution of a “poetics of conspiracy” (Hinds) to the ultimate speaker of the dialogue, the author Tacitus, and a “hermeneutics of suspicion” (Ricoeur) to its reader. At the same time, the author's double-position, as character and author, between narrated event and narration of the event to the reader, suggests that the other characters in the dialogue may, like the author and reader, also exercise such poetics and hermeneutics on one another and themselves. The article ends with thecomparandumof the first satire of Tacitus's near contemporary, Juvenal, suggesting that, in the case of these works that can look with hindsight on the social and political past of the Early Empire, their modes of transmission and reception may be politically determined (e.g., as conspiratorial, suspicious) but may also demonstrate, within the restrictions of social and political determinations, a high degree of contingency, reflexivity, and autonomy. Such possibilities suggest that the text itself is part of a pragmatic and performative tradition of the kind enacted by its characters, in addition to a tradition of the production of (comparatively static and unfree) “literary” works.<br>

Abstract: See Harold Van Buren Magonigle, "Some Suggestions as to the Making of Working Drawings,"
               Brickbuilder22 (in three parts): no. 5 (May 1913), 101–3; no. 7 (July 1913), 147–53; no. 8 (Aug.1913), 174–78. By 1913 the respective roles of drawings and specifications were not unlike those assigned to them in today's architectural practices, i.e., drawings show shapes, size, and quantities of the whole building and its parts, while specifications describe the quality, performance, and make of building materials and products. It is worthy of noticing, however, that these roles had been assumed not long before the period in the focus of the present article. Mario Carpo argued, in hisArchitecture in the Age of Printing: Orality, Writing, Typography, and Printed Image in the History of Architectural Theory(Cambridge and London: MIT Press, 2001) 25–41, that medieval architectural theory privileged verbal and written means of describing buildings over graphic representation. See Ortenberg, "Drawing Practices," chap. 3, on how these relationships persisted in construction documentation until the end of the eighteenth century. Quite a few surviving building specifications from the early fourteenth through late eighteenth century describe building features that we now expect to be explained by working drawings.<br>

Abstract: The Art of the Yellow Springsconcludes with a short coda that presents “portraits” of three of China’s best-known tombs: Mawangdui Tomb 1 (ca. 168 BCE) in Changsha, Hunan province; Mancheng Tomb 1 (ca. 113 BCE) in Baoding, Hebei province; and the tomb of Zhang Wenzao in Xuanhua, Hebei province (1093). Wu presents these at the end in order to demonstrate the potential advantages of applying the theories outlined in the previous chapters to specific tombs.<br>

Abstract: 1. A survey of music-historical periodizations of the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, together with comments on the current status of periodistic thinking in musicology in general. It is argued that with respect to European music as a whole, the older sense of "Baroque" lasting until ca. 1750 is untenable; it is better to understand a distinct period ca. 1720-80, centering around the Enlightenment, the galant, the international "system" of Italian opera, and (toward the end) the cult of sensibility. The consequence is that the years before
            andafter 1800 must be understood as a period in their own right.<br>

Issue: rh.1999.17.issue-4<br>
Date: 11 01, 1999<br>
Author(s): Selby Gary S.<br>
Abstract: Abstract:This essay argues that in 1 Thessalonians, Paul uses eschatological discourse—language about the end of hme—in order to evoke a symbolic world-view in which his readers become God's elect, living at the end of time and awaiting the sudden, imminent retum of Christ from heaven. This self-identification explains their present misfortunes, while at the sam.e time demanding that they fulfill the ethical and moral demands of the Christian faith. More broadly, this essay points to the role that eschatological discourse played within early Christianity in general, suggesting that it formed a central, paradigmatic drama which helped to define ontological and teleological reality for the movement's adherents.<br>

Journal Title: Symbolic Interaction<br>
Article Title: Text and Temporality: Patterned-Cyclical and Ordinary-Linear Forms of Time-Consciousness, Inferred from a Corpus of Australian Aboriginal and Euro-Australian Life-Historical Interviews<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: si.1999.22.issue-2<br>
Date: August 1999<br>
Author(s): TenHouten Warren D.<br>
Abstract: It is argued that autobiographical texts, such as life-historical interviews, provide the richest possible source of information about a person's temporality and a culture's historical past. It is proposed that time-consciousness can be inferred from such texts. To this end, ethnographic and other studies of Australian Aboriginal time-consciousness were used to construct a seven-part model of patterned-cyclical time-consciousness. Turning these seven attributes of patterned-cyclical time-consciousness into their opposites yields seven features of one-dimensional, ordinary-linear time-consciousness, thereby establishing a structured temporal polarity. A lexical-level, content-analytic methodology, Neurocognitive Hierarchical Categorization Analysis (NHCA), is introduced, in which folk-concepts of time from
         Roget's International Thesauruswere used to construct wordlist indicators for 9 of the 14 definitional components. Then, using NHCA for a comparative analysis of texts consisting of life-historical interviews, earlier results of an empirical study were brieflv re-presented. Australian Aborigines, compared to Euro-Australian controls, used a significantly smaller proportion of words for an index of ordinary-linear time but a higher proportion of words for an index of patterned-cyclical time, indicating a time-consciousness that is primarily patterned-cyclical rather than linear. Females were less linear and more patterned-cyclical than males in both cultures. These cross-cultural results contribute predictive validity to the proposed polarity of time-consciousness. Implications for the culture-and-cognition paradox and its resolution in dual-brain theory are addressed.<br>

Abstract: In this cranky and arrogant chapter I consider several aspects of my use of symbolic interactionist perspectives on my research and thinking. The following are the elements of the chapter: (1) the historical context of my initial encounter with symbolic interactionism (SI); (2) my interpretation of key ideas of SI; (3) its relation to specific research of mine; (4) the relation of other perspectives to my research; and (5) some critiques of SI. I conclude with a truncated discussion of my dissatisfaction with the overtheorizing and overscientizing of sociology. Seeking balance, I end with predictions of a grand and glorious future.<br>

Article Title: Toward a Generic Analysis of a Classic of the Social Gospel: An Essay-Review of Walter Rauschenbusch<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263714<br>
Date: 12 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Rauschenbusch Walter<br>
Abstract: Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis, viewed by many as the masterpiece of the social gospel movement, has been confined to the dusty shelves of the library. Can we catch no glimpse of what astounded its massive reading public, no glimmer of Rauschenbusch's own sense of the work as a "dangerous book" written in fear and trembling? This article suggests that a generic analysis of Christianity and the Social Crisis might lead to surprising disclosures. Any generic analysis involves the discussion of a group of texts. Consequently this study proceeds via a comparison of the structure of Christianity and the Social Crisis with those of other works of a similar type which were produced between 1890 and 1915. The genre is isolated by utilizing the techniques of Tzvetan Todorov. Certain negative traits are specified which separate the genre from its neighbors. The positive leitmotif of a dual crisis-a crisis affecting society as a whole and the ramifications of that crisis within the Christian churches-is specified as the decisive trait of the genre. To deal with this leitmotif a specific structure was generated by the works under consideration. They provided-to pirate the words of Clifford Geertz in his landmark essay on modern ideologies-"maps of problematic reality" and "matrices for the creation of collective conscience." In designing their maps of problematic reality our authors worked along two separate but related vectors. The first of these vectors was constituted by a historical analysis of the origins of the present crisis, while the second consisted of a systemic analysis of the present social order. Each of these elements of the genre is examined in turn. The mapping of problematic reality by means of a historical and a structural analysis was geared towards provoking as well as defining the crisis. Crisis, once defined, demanded decision. Nevertheless the "permanent basis for action" which Rauschenbusch and others sought could not be groun~<br>

for reality. Where the investigations of analysis come upon the libido withdrawn into
its hiding place, a struggle is bound to break out; all the foreces which have caused the li-
bido to regreess will rise up as 'resistances' against the work of analysis, in order to con-]
serve the new state of things" (1912:12)]

Article Title: Dying between the Lines: Infinite Blindness in Lessing's "Laokoon" and Burke's "Enquiry"<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303121<br>
Date: 7 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Wellbery Adam<br>
Abstract: The essay studies the ways in which death-the word, the concept, and the friction between word and concept-informs aesthetic programs of Lessing and Burke. Both writers turn (and return often) to death as a kind of artistic touchstone and, in doing so, illustrate divergent schools of Enlightenment aesthetic thought. Lessing wants to define and maintain, if only conceptually and only pragmatically, the borders between spatial and temporal representation; Burke, to collapse the borders between space and time, if only imaginatively and momentarily. Lessing, in both the Laokoon and How the Ancients Represented Death, although nervous about the slipperiness of the word death, seems to embrace death's certainty; it is an end, the end, the limit to end all limits. Burke, on the other hand, treats death as "the king of terrors"; he opens himself, at least nominally, to the "obscurity" of death, to the possibility of the infinite. Beneath the surface, though, Burke is profoundly ambivalent about giving up finite, spatialized representation in favor of a potentially infinite temporal flow, and his treatment of Milton's "universe of death" is a fascinating study in this ambivalence. This essay closely studies the tropes-blindness, for instance-with which Lessing and Burke approach death and suggests that their strategies are at root more similar than may appear. Both find themselves in a linguistic predicament, and death becomes for both a metaphor for the strife between natural and arbitrary signs.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>
Issue: i20010333<br>
Date: 1 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Johnson Greg<br>
Abstract: This essay takes up the claim made recently by Simon Critchley in The Companion to Continental Philosophy that a "feature common to many philosophers in the Continental tradition" is the "utopian demand that things be otherwise." The general question I pursue has to do with whether or not such a claim includes movements within Continental philosophy that do not self-identify with the utopian (like critical theory). The particular question has to do with whether or not the movement of phenomenology is utopian or does it, because of its other commitments, view the utopian as the antithesis to its orientation, which makes that claim that phenomenology is utopian seem strange. My thesis is that phenomenology can be seen as a utopian tradition but that some account must be given that demonstrates this connection to the utopian. In particular, I argue that Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology provides an understanding of the utopian, which I call a non-conventional view, that is vastly different from the one assumed by most when they see or hear the word "utopian," which I lable conventional. I show that such a non-conventional understanding can be developed in a way that neither requires us to view the utopian solely as opposed to finitude and contingency, nor a form of thought and action from which we necessarily need to dissociate ourselves. It is this non-conventional view of the utopian that in the end enables us to understand how Continental philosophy in general and phenomenology in particular are important bearers of the utopian demand that things be otherwise.<br>

Author(s): Smith Philip<br>
Abstract: Contemporary social theory has turned increasingly to concepts such as civil society, community, and the public sphere in order to theorize about the construction of vital, democratic, and solidaristic political cultures. The dominant prescriptions for attaining this end invoke the need for institutional and procedural reform, but overlook the autonomous role of culture in shaping and defining the forms of social solidarity. This article proposes a model of solidarity based on the two genres of Romance and Irony, and argues that these narrative forms offer useful vocabularies for organizing public discourse within and between civil society and its constituent communities. Whilst unable to sustain fully-inclusive and solidaristic political cultures on their own, in combination the genres of Romance and Irony allow for solidaristic forms built around tolerance, reflexivity, and intersubjectivity.<br>

Abstract: En réaction à la double abstraction manifestée par la traditionnelle histoire des idées et par le structuralisme, l'histoire des intellectuels, à la fin des années 1980, a développé un programme de micro histoire sociale de la vie intellectuelle saisie à travers ses cadres concrets de fonctionnement tels les revues, les maisons d'éditions et les cercles de la sociabilité intellectuelle. Cette histoire culturelle des idées, attentive aux données impliquées par la transmission et la circulation des idées, a cependant délaissé l'examen des réalités langagières. Examiner comment le langage des œuvres modifie l'expérience des acteurs historiques reste un salutaire défi pour l'historien de la culture. Via l'étude des mécanismes de réception des œuvres, à travers celle des controverses, ou par le biais de la construction adéquate du contexte où joue la dialectique des faits moraux et sociaux, l'historien culturel, au carrefour de diverses disciplines voisines (histoire littéraire, sociologie des sciences, histoire conceptuelle du politique) s'inscrit au cœur des sciences humaines. /// Against the double abstraction shown by the traditional history of ideas and by structuralism, the history of intellectuals, at the end of the 1980s, developed a micro social history program of intellectual life seen through the study of journals, publishing houses and intellectual circles. This cultural history of ideas, attentive to the circulation and transmission of ideas, has nevertheless ignored the question of linguistic realities. Examining how the language of intellectual works modifies the experience of historical actors is a good challenge for the cultural historian. Through the study of how works are received, of the controversies, or through the appropriate construction of the context with the dialectical play of moral and social facts, the cultural historian, at the intersection of various related disciplines (literary history, sociology of science, conceptual history of politic~<br>

Abstract: Although the Thai-Lao peasants living in rain-fed agricultural communities in northeastern Thailand have experienced some improvements in their socioeconomic situation as a consequence of the growth of the Thai economy since the mid-1950s, these peasants still constitute the poorest sector of the population of Thailand. Moreover, the socioeconomic position of the rural northeastern Thai populace has actually declined relative to that of the urban populace and that of the rural populace living in central Thailand. The economic disadvantageous position of Thai-Lao peasants is linked with a sense of being an ethnoregional minority within a polity that has been highly centralized since reforms instituted at the end of the nineteenth century. Much of the social action of Thai-Lao peasants with reference to the political-economic constraints on their world can be understood, as long-term research in one community reveals, as having been impelled by rational calculation aimed at improving the well being of peasant families. The ways in which peasants have assessed in practice the justice of these constraints as well as the ways in which they have assessed the limits to entrepreneurship must be seen, however, as being rooted in moral premises that Thai-Lao villagers have appropriated from Theravada Buddhism as known to them in their popular culture.<br>

Issue: i20628279<br>

Author(s): Gödl Doris<br>
Abstract: Using the example of former Yugoslavia, specifically the Serbian and Croatian nations, this article examines the transformation of collective memory of aggression and victimhood by focusing on the content of national narratives. The article begins by examining narratives developed at the founding of Yugoslavia and proceeds to trace the reinterpretation of these narratives as a function of their political instrumentality—especially in Serbia and Croatia—for respective nationalist projects. In the end, the article provides tools with which to frame two questions: first, whether political and social stability is being created at the cost of forgetting and repression; second, whether a "policy of remembrance" is socially "desirable" in practice. Both forgetting and an instrumental "policy of remembrance" based on the power of revelation perpetuate aggressor—victim divisions: what is needed, rather, is a stable, systematic process of remembrance and reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur distills this point well: "When we discover that there are
several cultures instead of just one and consequently at the time when we acknowledge
the end of a sort of cultural monopoly, be it illusory or real, we are threatened with the
destruction of our own discovery. Suddenly it becomes possible that there are just
others, that we ourselves are an 'other' among others" (History and Truth [Evanston,
Ill., 1965], p. 278).

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i23013293<br>
Date: 6 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): SEACHRIS JOSHUA<br>
Abstract: Death and futility are among a cluster of themes that closely track discussions of life's meaning. Moreover, futility is thought to supervene on naturalistic meta-narratives because of how they will end. While the nature of naturalistic meta-narrative endings is part of the explanation for concluding that such meta-narratives are cosmically or deeply futile, this explanation is truncated. I argue that the reason the nature of the ending is thought to be normatively important is first anchored in the fact that narrative ending qua ending is thought to be normatively important. Indeed, I think futility is often thought to characterize naturalistic meta-narratives because a narrative's ending has significant proleptic power to elicit a wide range of broadly normative human responses on, possibly, emotional, aesthetic, and moral levels towards the narrative as a whole.<br>

Issue: i23017455<br>
Date: 8 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Rhodes R. A. W.<br>
Abstract: What intellectual influence, if any, have British public administration scholars had on their American counterparts since World War II? In this article, the author briefly reviews the major areas of theory and research in the British study of publication administration, further identifying important contributions by British scholars in the areas of modernist-empiricism, the new public management, regulation, policy networks and governance, and interpretive theory. Although there is a discernible American influence on British public administration, there is little British impact on U.S. public administration; nowadays it is a one-way street. Increasingly, British scholars are involved in a growing community of European public administration scholars with whom they share active, two-way connections. Recent European developments suggest that American and European public administration academics are growing further apart. Due to the immense strength of modernist-empiricism throughout American universities, plus the interpretive turn to a European epistemology of "blurred genres," these twin, traditionally self-referential, communities seem to be parting company with an attendant danger that future intellectual engagement may be a dead end.<br>

Author(s): Marks Susan<br>
Abstract: Tannaitic rabbis permit wedding processions but prohibit practices associated with these festivities, including the wearing of bridal crowns. Studies of rabbinic ritual based on social scientific models have overlooked the historical disjunction between Tannaitic and Amoraic evidence for weddings. This study explores this puzzling combination of prohibitions and permissions by making use of Catherine Bell's discussion of ritualization. Attention to practice as outlined by Bell leads to a renewed focus on the textual framing of Tannaitic discourse concerning wedding processions. This focus in turn leads to the recognition that the early rabbis create their own vision of wedding practice through negotiating their own historic moment—end-times. The larger eschatological context explored at the end of Sotah with its talk of extreme ascetic responses to end-times provides a framework for understanding Sotah's limited prohibitions concerning wedding processions and reveals a compromise reached by the various agents that remains otherwise obscured.<br>

Abstract: How does a generation without personal memory begin to grapple with its urban past in a nation that has silenced its memories? Moreover, how are symbolic sites of memory recovered and represented by such a generation? Much recent scholarship on post-war Lebanon has studied the memory culture of the decades following the declared end of civil war in 1990. This scholarship deals with the implications of Lebanon's 'amnesiac' political culture on the social and political landscape. In the meantime, Lebanon—and especially Beirut's—urban landscape has been altered beyond recognition by post-war reconstruction, mostly by private real estate holding companies, the most notorious of which is Solidere. In the early 2000s, as Solidere's activity picked up speed, a slew of historical novels about Lebanon and especially Beirut was published in both Arabic and French. In this article, I will focus exclusively on the strategies of urban commemoration in Rabīʿ Jābir's trilogy. I argue that the genre of historical fiction is used in these novels to re-create the downtown life of Beirut in and around Martyrs' Square from the 19th and early 20th century, a commemoration of a cityscape and an urban lifestyle that its author recreates using the tools of the archive (documents, bibliographies, etc.). This post-memorial fiction—here, I use Marianne Hirsch's definition of postmemory as "second-generation memories of cultural and collective traumas and experience" (22)—attempts to recover Beirut's repressed Ottoman urban history, and to re-write Solidere's narrative of the city center. By intertwining downtown Beirut's past with its present, in a clever back-and-forth palimpsestic act that superimposes the historical city upon the present city—site of capitalist consumption—Jābir's novels map out the old upon the new, and thus refuses the erasure of the ancient city by its newest urbanists. In Jābir's novels, a new, contestatory commemorative narrative of Beirut's history and—more significa~<br>

Abstract: This essay explores the suggestion that many American narratives are supplementary, correcting narratives — alternatives to the main story on offer. The guiding thought is that of Henry James's "possible other case," and the chief example is Cormac McCarthy's "No Country for Old Men," in which one story after another fails to cope with the ongoing mystery it faces. The novel may imply, then, that narrative itself, rather than any individual report or fiction, is in crisis or has come to the end of its road. A coda to the essay proposes the option of nonnarrative understandings of the world in those extreme situations where storytelling is no longer the sense-making activity we so often take it to be.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: En este ensayo se presenta un balance de la historiografía mexicana del siglo XX, tomando como eje el tránsito de su "institucionalización" a su "profesionalización". Se dibujan asimismo las tendencias teórico-metodológicas dominantes y se da cuenta, en la última parte del escrito, de las modificaciones recientes: 1) el tránsito de una historia de las mentalidades a una historia cultural y, 2) de una historia cifrada alrededor de los métodos de las ciencias políticas y sociales, a otra en la que se reconoce una especie de retorno de las humanidades o ciencias de la cultura y de los comportamientos humanos a la historia. This paper offers an assessment of Mexican historiography during the 20th century, centering on the transition from its "institutionalization" to its "professionalization". It also outlines the dominant theoretical-methodological trends and, towards its end, sheds light upon recent changes: 1) the transition from a history of mentalities to a cultural history, and 2) from a history encoded around the methods of political and social sciences to another in which one recognizes a kind of return to history of humanities or cultural sciences and of human behaviors.<br>

Abstract: »Die räumlichen und zeitlichen Schichten der Globalgeschichte: Überlegungen zu einer globalen Begriffsgeschichte anhand der Ausweitung von Reinhart Kosellecks Zeitschichten in globale Räume«. Recent debates on global history have challenged the understanding of history beyond the nation-state. Simultaneously, they search for non-Eurocentric approaches. This has repercussions on the relation between historical space and time in both historical interpretation and in research design. This article reflects on the possibilities of a global conceptual history by expanding Reinhart Koselleck's theory of temporal layers (Zeitschichten) into global spaces. To this end, it introduces the notion of spatial layers (Raumschichten). First, historicisation and its relation to and interaction with spatialisation and temporalisation is pondered; then, the impact of global spatial and temporal complexities on comparative and conceptual history is considered, before, thirdly, a framework of three tensions of global history - normative, temporal and spatial - is introduced as a way to concretely unfold historical research questions through global conceptual history. Regarding time and space, the main lines of argument in global history have focused either on the question of whether or not European powers were ahead of non-European ones or on the supposedly Western linearity of time as opposed to a non-Western cosmology or circularity of time. Taking its point of departure in Zeitschichten, which break from the linear-vs.-circular logic, this article instead proposes to foreground an actor-based, multi-lingual, global conceptual history to better understand spatio-temporal practices.<br>

Abstract: History is not neutral. It is rendered ideological by the very act of being conveyed in a narrative form, for language is both the purveyor of meaning and the principle locus of ideology. This paper explores the idea of history as discourse, and its deployment in the cultural-symbolic construction of the Singapore nation. To this end, I have chosen to analyse a key moment for Singapore history, the years 1963-65, when Singapore was first merged with the nation of Malaysia, and then separated from it. The way that these events are described in official histories is used by the government of Singapore to justify its policy of multiracialism, which also serves as a legitimating device confirming the state in its political and ideological hegemony. I have examined the events through analysis of local newspapers, The Straits Times and Berita Harían, to see in what ways their reporting may have helped to mould popular understandings of what was happening.<br>

Abstract: Discussing some aspects of Carl Schmitt's, Chantal Mouffe's, Paul Ricœur's, and Jacques Rancière's political theories the paper tries to determine the proper subject of political and social philosophy. To that end the author constructs two terminological oppositions: ‚the social‘ versus 'the society', 'the political' versus 'politics'. These four nouns form a terminological square which marks the social and the political difference. The social appears when underprivileged people demand a redistribution of wealth and influence, i.e. a reconstruction of a given society. The political emerges when the hidden normative framework of politics comes into vie. Confronting the social and the political difference in this way makes it possible to determine: politics are the matter of the political sciences, the difference between politics and the political, conversely, is the theme of political philosophy; society is the subject of sociology, the difference between the social and any form of society, however, is the issue of social philosophy.<br>

Article Title: Semantics of Time and Historical Experience: Remarks on Koselleck's "Historik"<br>
Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i23730893<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Scuccimarra Luca<br>
Abstract: Moving from Koselleck's most recent essays on Historik, the author explores the role played by historiography in the constitution of historicity as a peculiar experiential dimension of human existence. The essay focuses on the complex link between difference and repetition which, according to Koselleck's theory of experience, constitutes a "specific historical temporality" and its inner articulation. Actually, it is by exploring the "formal temporal structures" which constitute the horizon of historical intelligibility that Koselleck brings to light the decisive role that the point of view of historiography has for the constitution of man as the subject of historical knowledge and action. It is difficult to ignore the importance of this theory of historical temporalization in an age in which the End of History rhetoric tends to transform itself in a sort of media gospel.<br>

Abstract: The main end of this article is to offer a critical analysis of autonomy conceived as a basic idea in modern educational philosophy. After the tragic experience and dramatic consequences of totalitarianism, is not possible to defend a kantian concept of autonomy as a unique source of moral responsibility and ethical action. After holocaust, we need to defend, on the contrary, the principle of previous value of heteronomy, conceived as the practice of otherness, in its levinasian perspective. So, the authors explore the thesis of the prior value of heteronomy on autonomy, as a source and foundation of moral responsibility in educational relationship, and to reflect the general educational implications of the jewish philosophical tradition of otherness in philosophical educational discourse.<br>

Abstract: The city is a key location of the modern social world, a home of rootlessness and transient everyday encounters between individuals. This essay explores the idea of 'the sanctuary' as a way in which people look for anchorage, and create and re-create images of a society, to cope with and negotiate life in the city. It mainly draws on Durkheim's work on ritual, symbolism and the sacred, together with his account of individual and collective representations. But it also discusses these concerns though other writers, notably Freud and Ricœur, and it draws on Kant's theory of art to introduce how Durkheim sees ritual —especially sacred drama — as at once a symbolism and an aesthetics, complete with the energies of a free creative 'surplus'. Even if in the end 'the sanctuary' is unequal to the marketplace, it is a necessary refuge of the transformative social imagination and a realm, not of everyday economics, but of civitas.<br>

Abstract: The problem that Petrarch's Canzoniere poses for the modern reader is the same as that posed by all collections of poems assembled by their author: it is a matter of understanding the connection between each of the poems and the collection, the relation between the whole and the parts. On the one hand, the collection presents a discontinuous series of poems composed separately that can be read as discrete works; on the other hand, the same poems come together as part of a love and/or existential story. Our task is to study the Canzoniere as a macrotext and to clarify the relation of each of the compositions to the collection of lyric verse to which it belongs. Petrarch's desperate attempt to complete his work is the same hopeless challenge that the mythical Arachne dared to make to Minerva. At the deepest level Petrarch reveals an awareness of the fact that every human endeavor is a spider's web that is woven in the course of a lifetime, and thus is never completed. The destiny of human beings therefore is to weave a tapestry that is never finished, just as the fate of the poet is to write an in-finite work; namely, a work that in the end can never reach the perfection and integrity of the divine work.<br>

Abstract: L'apport de l'œuvre de Paul Ricœur est fondamental pour la pratique historienne d'aujourd'hui. Depuis la fin du XIXe siècle, les historiens s'étaient dotés, en se professionnalisant, d'une méthode. Grâce à Paul Ricœur, ils peuvent désormais accéder à une dimension épistémologqiue et mieux comprendre les catégories qui leur sont familières comme celle de temps, de vérité, de causalité ou de sujet. Cet article entend montrer en quoi notamment trois thématiques classiques de l'historien que sont l'événement, la mémoire et la biographie trouvent un éclairage particulièrement enrichissant chez Paul Ricœur et s'en trouvent très sensiblement renouvelées. Paul Ricœur's work has made a fundamental contribution to the contemporary practice of history. Since the end of the 19th century historians had become more professional and had defined an historical method. Thanks to Paul Ricœur, they are now able to achieve an epistemological dimension and to understand better familiar categories such as time, truth, causality or subject. This article seeks to show how three classic historical themes in particular, namely event, memory and biography, are illuminated in a singularly enriching fashion in the work of Paul Ricœur and are very perceptibly renewed by him. Auch für die heutige Geschichtswissenschaft erweist sich Paul Ricœurs philosophisches Œuvre als grundlegend. Im Zuge ihres Professionalisierungsprozesses hatte die historische Zunft gegen Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts nach einer einheitlichen Methode gestrebt. Über das Werk Paul Ricœurs findet sie nun Zugang zur wissenschaftstheoretischen Dimension. Ziel des Aufsatzes ist es, aufzuzeigen, wie drei für den Historiker entscheidende Fragen – nämlich die des Ereignisses, des Gedächtnisses und der Biographie – bei Ricœur einer neuen Behandlung unterzogen wurden.<br>

Abstract: En 1906 los "cabezas de familia" de cinco comunidades indígenas le pidieron al abogado Wistano Luis Orozco que los representara en sus pleitos legales por la defensa de sus tierras. Parte de la estrategia legal fue escribir un memorial de los agravios experimentados y dirigirlo a Porfirio Díaz. El memorial y el proceso judicial que desencadenó ejemplifican cómo los actores sociales daban forma a la cultura política en los ámbitos locales, estatales y nacionales, a finales del porfiriato. In 1906, the heads of household from five indigenous communities asked the lawyer Wistano Luis Orozco to represent them in their legal battle for the defense of their land. Part of their legal strategy was to prepare a written statement detailing their grievances and addressing it to Porfirio Díaz. The written statement and the legal process it sparked exemplify how social actors gave form to political culture at the local, state and national level towards the end of the Porfiriato.<br>

Author(s): LOOBUYCK PATRICK<br>
Abstract: In the first half of the twentieth century noncognitivism was the predominant metaethical point of view in analytical philosophy. This perspective came under critical scrutiny as early as the late 1950s, and by the 1970s its authority began to be undermined. For various reasons cognitivist theories began to be put forward with confidence. Different philosophers tried ways to restore the role of reason in ethics. This shift in the philosophical climate was influenced by—or was at least in accordance with—the thought of the later Wittgenstein. In particular, this article will consider the relevance of Wittgenstein for cognitivist views, such as that of S. Toulmin, relativists like G. Harman, and British moral realists like S. Lovibond and J. McDowell. In fact, Wittgenstein is one of the founding fathers of antifoundationalism. He gives us the hopeful insight that the end of foundationalism does not necessarily imply the end of moral philosophy but must be considered a new start of it.<br>

Abstract: Intensive care and the intensive care techniques in use have considerably changed our attitude towards death and dying –a process that had already been medicalized and professionalized. This study of four intensive care units (ICUs) in France and Britain brings to light the reality of death-related practices and resituates that reality at the core of professional relations and personal experience. Study results strongly suggest that the end-of-life decision is a genuine social construction: far from being purely objective and medical, it is heavily conditioned by context and actors' commitment. The search for professional autonomy and self-regulation has increased the ambivalence of the dying process, already complex because governed by extremely heterogeneous types of logic. This study shows that patient's death in an ICU is more dependant on the organization and culture of the ICU than on patient's own wishes or those of close relatives.<br>

Author(s): Gandsman Ari<br>
Abstract: For anthropologists working on the topic of human rights, fieldwork often consists of collecting narratives documenting experiences of violence and loss. Drawing on research with human organizations in Argentina, this article questions this methodological focus that is often related to human rights activism. While these narratives are often treated as organic accounts, they are also products of the human rights movement. Analyses that fail to address this larger institutional context may end up reproducing conventionally held knowledge. By exploring the larger interconnections between narrative, human rights and trauma, I conclude by questioning the prevalent normative assumptions about narrative. Pour l'anthropologue travaillant sur le sujet des droits humains, le travail de terrain consiste souvent à recueillir des récits documentant des expériences de violence et de perte. À partir de recherches menées auprès d'organismes de défense des droits humains en Argentine, cet article interroge ce parti-pris méthodologique qu'on associe souvent au militantisme pour les droits humains. Alors que ces récits sont souvent traités comme des comptes-rendus organiques, ils sont aussi des produits du mouvement pour les droits humains. Les analyses qui omettent de tenir compte de ce contexte institutionnel plus étendu peuvent finir par reproduire des connaissances conventionnellement admises. En explorant les interconnexions plus étendues entre les récits, les droits humains et les traumatismes, je conclus en remettant en question les a priori normatifs courants relatifs aux récits.<br>

Abstract: Au début du XIXe siècle, la philosophie de l'âme fournit des arguments aux psychologues qui, à la fin de ce siècle, réfléchissent sur les faits de conscience. Ils mettent alors en évidence les caractéristiques psychophysiologiques de l' « effort volontaire », force psychique qu'ils insèrent dans une phénoménologie de l'agir. Dans la première moitié du XXe siècle, de nouveaux discours reformulent la trame conceptuelle élaborée au siècle précédent et les psychologues, attentifs aux procédures adaptatives de l'énergétique humaine, livrent un autre mode de lisibilité de l'effort quand celui-ci représente, avant tout, un combat pour (sur)vivre. Early 19th-century philosophy of the mind or soul would provide arguments for psychologists who, at the end of this century, inquired into the facts of consciousness. They in turn highlighted the psychophysiologic characteristics of « voluntary effort », a psychic force that they placed within a phenomenology of the act. In the first half of the 20th century new discourses reformulated the elaborate conceptual framework of the previous century, and the psychologists attentive to the adaptive procedure of human energetics, offered a different reading of what effort means when it represents above all a struggle for survival.<br>

Abstract: Le présent article s'inscrit dans le prolongement d'une recherche en cours portant sur la compréhension et l'analyse des usages de jeux vidéo en ligne par des personnes en situation de handicap. En soulignant les apports épistémiques et méthodologiques d'une ethnographie en ligne, il pointe les limites heuristiques de la classique distinction entre un monde supposé réel qui se verrait redoublé par son pendant virtuel. L'exemple précis des jeux vidéo permet ici non seulement de questionner la dichotomie virtuel / réel mais aussi la définition traditionnelle du jeu élaborée à partir du modèle de la règle distincte de son effectuation concrète. L'analyse des pratiques ludiques de personnes en situation de handicap pointe enfin la nécessité d'une attention portée sur les modes d'appropriation corporelle d'un dispositif techno-communicationnel. En conséquence, il s'agit d'envisager les formes d'expériences vidéo-ludiques comme des « instances de procuration » autorisant l'exploration sensible de mondes moins disjoints les uns des autres qu'en interaction constante. This article is a continuation of ongoing research to understand the uses of online gaming by people with physical disabilities. By emphasizing the epistemic and methodological contributions of online ethnography, it points to the heuristic limits of the traditional distinction between a supposedly real world and that which would be repeated in the virtual. The specific use of video games in this example, makes it possible not only to question the virtual–real dichotomy, but also to question the traditional definition of the game which starts from the premise that the rule is distinct from its concrete execution. Analysis of the recreational practices of disabled people also points to the need for attention to modes of bodily appropriation of techno-communication devices. In the end, it is a question of considering video entertainment experiences like "instances of proxy," authorizing the sensitive exploration~<br>

Dicha estrategia se enmarca en una investigación cualitativa que permite reconstruir teóricamente un objeto en permanente dinamismo y obtener una comprensión holística de las situaciones sociales; propone para su desarrollo la utilización de un enfoque etnográfico, en tanto la etnografía es una modalidad de investigación que favorece la comprensión de los procesos sociales. This article seeks to present a methodological approach to the study of gated communities in order to focus on the perspective of the actors involved, taking into account the social representations and perceptions those supports. This strategy is part of a qualitative research project that enables one to theoretically reconstruct an object in constant dynamism and obtain a holistic understanding of social situations. To this end, it proposes using an ethnographic approach, since ethnography is a form of research that promotes the understanding of social processes.<br>

Abstract: El texto busca mostrar cómo Pío IX y su más conocido documento, el Syllabus errorum, publicado en 1864, participan del fin de una era multisecular en la historia del catolicismo, caracterizada por la existencia de un dominio temporal pontificio, por un vínculo afectivo de la Iglesia católica con la monarquía como forma de gobierno y por la concepción de la fe católica como única vía para la salvación. Fin de una era, no solo desde la perspectiva de la vigencia de las instituciones, sino de las representaciones que las acompañan. La demostración se apoya en un análisis de los tiempos en que el pontífice y su documento se enmarcan, desde la perspectiva braudeliana de los tiempos históricos, así como en las categorías propuestas por R. Koselleck para el estudio de la experiencia del tiempo. This article aims to show how Pius X and his most famous document, the Syllabus of Errors, published in 1864, participated in the end of a centuries-old era in the history of Catholicism that was characterized by the existence of the temporal dominion of the Popes, close ties between the Catholic Church and monarchism as a form of government and the conception of the Catholic faith as the only road to salvation. This was the end of an era, not just from the perspective of the power of institutions, but also in terms of the representations that accompanied them. The article is supported by a Braudelian analysis of the times in which the Pope and his document belonged and makes use of the categories proposed by R. Koselleck for the study of the experience of time.<br>

time, which does contain the passage about the human soul which "naar het getuigenis van de
Schrift door den tijdelijlten dood niet getroffen wordt, maar ook na de aflegging van het
"lichaam", d.i. van heel den tijdelijken in individualiteits-structuur besloten beslaansvorm, blijft
voortbestaan." But the translation is incorrect! The translators of Berkouwer's book rendered
the passage as follows: "The soul. Scripture shows, is not affected by temporal death, but after
the end of the body (i.e. of all the temporal aspects of man), it continues as a form of existence
with an individuality structure" (Cooper 1989, 251). The Dutch text, Berkouwer (1957, 285,
note 148), quotes Dooyeweerd correctly. In Dooyeweerd the term 'individuality structure'
refers to the body; the translators related it, wrongly, to the soul. It is likely that this has
occasioned Cooper's misunderstanding. The passage should read: "As Scripture testifies, [the
human soul] is not touched by temporal death, but continues to exist even after the shedding
of the 'body', i.e. [the shedding] of the entire temporal, individuality-structure-enclosed form of
existence."<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de François Laplanche prend délibérément pour objet la longue durée : l'exégèse biblique entretient un rapport constant au Texte originel et l'historien ne peut s'exonérer de connaître les interprétations patristiques et médiévales de la Bible. L'histoire d'une pratique de lecture savante est ici réintégrée à l'intérieur de l'ensemble de la culture, de la société et des événements d'une période donnée. Prenant pour centre d'analyse les théologiens calvinistes de Saumur vers 1620-1670, François Laplanche montre que, tandis que leur système demeure arrimé à l'orthodoxie réformée, ils la minent et conduisent à une désacralisation de l'Écriture par un double éloignement : éloignement de l'origine puisque la disqualification de l'Ancien Testament le transforme en objet d'histoire; éloignement de la fin des temps par la récusation catégorique du prophétisme et du millénarisme. The work of François Laplanche deliberately deals with long duration: biblical exegesis maintains a constant relationship to the original Text and the historian cannot exempt himself from knowing the patristic and medieval interpretations of the Bible. The history of scholarly reading is here reinstated within the culture, society and events of a given period. Taking as the center of his analysis the Calvinist theologians of Saumur around 1620-1670, François Laplanche shows that, while their system remains linked to reformed orthodoxy, they are undermining it and go towards a desecration of Scripture via a double remoteness: remoteness from the origin since the disqualification of the Old Testament transforms it into an historical object; remoteness from the end of time via the adamant disqualification of prophecy and millenarianism. La obra de François Laplanche toma deliberadamente como objeto la larga duración: la exégesis bíblica establece una relación constante con el Texto original y el historiador no puede eximirse de conocer las interpretaciones patrísticas y medievales de la Biblia.~<br>

Abstract: "Like a house's balcony, I overlook whatever I desire." At first glance, this line by the late Palestinian poet Mahmud Darwish may not seem to bear multiple or complex meanings. A daring attempt at interpretation, however, can show that this simple metaphor is capable of bearing and provoking various philosophical ideas. To achieve this end, the interpretation invites the ideas of several theorists of metaphor and imagery, including Bachelard, Derrida, Heidegger, Ricoeur, Nietzsche, and Deleuze, in approaching Darwish. «أطل كشرفة بيت، على ما أريد ». للوهلة الأولى، لا يبدو هذا السطر الشعري للشاعر الفلسطيني الراحل محمود درويش قابلاً لأن يحمل معاني متعددة أومعقدة. على أن محاولة أكثر جراة في التأويل قد تظهر أن تلك الاستعارة البسيطة قادرة على استفزاز أفكار فلسفية عديدة. ومن أجل الوصول إلى تلك الغاية، فإن التأويل الذي تقوم عليه هذه المقالة يستدعي أفكاراً لمنظرين متنوعين حول الاستعارة والصورة، بمن فيهم باشلار وهيديجر وريكور ونيتشه ودولوز .<br>

Abstract: French politics in the 1970s is notoriously hard to decipher. The increasingly violent attacks on Gaullism and Communism, the decline in French geopolitical power, and the end of postwar economic growth led to unprecedented unease about the nation's collective future. But rather than treat the 1970s as an endpoint, I argue in this article that the 1970s represented a new beginning. I explore how more modest conceptions of political action, the emergence of a new kind of liberalism, and the development of identity politics led to a profound transformation of French political culture – one that tried to reconcile France's long statist tradition with the realities of an ever-more fragmented polity.<br>

Author(s): Richter Pál<br>
Abstract: The Schumann's sonata form (or sonata form-like) compositions little can be explained from the standpoint of tradition. Instead of classical dramatic contrasts, thematic action develops towards a definite goal. This type of musical narration often lasts to the end of the coda, in other cases the constant evolution of a thematic thought or the continual transformation of a motif receives the leading role. In order to obscure the essential events of the works or of the movements Schumann often employs "traditional" formal gestures. One of the most interesting is the repetition of a longer section in different keys, reminding of the exposition-recapitulation duality. The déjà vu feeling was generally one of the starting-point in Schumann's workshop to move away from traditional sonata procedures. Influenced by the narrative content of the works, various strategies were elaborated by him to excite the déjà vu, or to relive musical moments.<br>

Abstract: This essay argues for theatre as a mode of becoming rather than one of vanishing. By working through the temporal constructs that have traditionally fostered a sense of transience in performance, this essay attempts to establish appearance as a category of thought. It focuses on the praxis of performance, taking as its example a 2002 production in the Philadelphia Fringe Festival entitled machines machines machines machines machines machines machines and its subsequent unfolding in the everyday. Contrary to the dominant critical model of thought that casts theatre as inevitably and unstoppably moving towards its own end, absence, and death, this essay contends that performance is a force of animate presence, continuation, and becoming.<br>

Abstract: Nous avons tenté de montrer que les recherches longtemps réunies sous le nom de biologie de l'art ont constitué les racines oubliées de la pensée anthropologique d'Aby Warburg. Connues par lui en 1895-1896, ces perspectives nourrissent encore en 1927, à la fin de sa vie, sa réflexion. À partir de l'analyse ethnographique de la représentation des noms propres dans le Sepik, nous avons ensuite montré que, pour tenter de déchiffrer l'utopie dont témoigne sa pensée - formuler une anthropologie de la mémoire sociale telle qu'elle se fonde sur les traditions iconographiques -, il est nécessaire de reprendre, d'un point de vue critique, la méthode morphologique de la biologie de l'art, et sa manière de reconstruire les opérations mentales impliquées par le déchiffrement des images. /// The studies that have, for a long time now, been assembled under the name " Biology of Art " form the forgotten roots of Aby Warburg's approach to anthropology. He learned about them in 1895-1896, and the thus opened perspectives were still enriching his thinking at the end of his life in 1927. An analysis of conceptions about proper names in the Sepik area is used to show that, to decipher the utopia in Warburg's thinking - formulate an anthropology of social memory in relation to iconographic traditions - it is necessary to critically examine the morphological method of the biology of art and its way of reconstructing the mental operations involved in deciphering images.<br>

Abstract: In this semiotic analysis of the Spanish auto defe, we begin to understand for the first time the meaning of religious rituals that have appeared completely incomprehensible in traditional accounts. The morning processions of penitents through city streets, the formal denunciations of heretics on public scaffolds, and the final burning at the stake of unrepentant sinners are placed within the context of medieval penitential practices and eschatological beliefs. The ceremony of the auto defe unveiled in time the Judgment Day awaiting all humankind at the end of time. For this reason, the spectacle aroused the interest of spectators all over Christendom, filling them with apprehension of their own final judgment.<br>

Abstract: This paper compares Maurice Halbwachs's theory of collective memory to the most typical articulation of group memory in France before the twentieth century, especially from the late sixteenth century to the end of the eighteenth century. It argues that the twentieth-century notion of collective memory, largely based on Halbwachs's work, differs significantly from earlier articulations of this concept and that these two conceptions are modeled on two different types of personal memory. Finally, it suggests that, given these differences, we should question whether our modern concept of collective memory is a useful tool in analyzing early modern French texts.<br>

Publisher: Society for Historical Archaeology<br>
Issue: i25616488<br>
Date: 1 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): McCarthy John P.<br>
Abstract: Much archaeological scholarship on consumption has approached its subject matter as the means to an end—e.g., as a way of studying socioeconomic status—rather than as a proper object of study in its own right. The "consumer choice" school, and, more recently, advocates of consumer behavior studies, have supported approaches that emphasize quantitative methods, at the same time downplaying the "qualitative" or symbolic aspects of consumption. A considerable body of literature on the symbolic aspects of consumption exists both in historical archaeology and other fields. The intention of this essay is to draw together this recent literature on consumption and combine it into a single approach that emphasizes shopping as the meaningful action at the very heart of consumption. With the emphasis on agency, this approach presents shopping as that crucial moment of transformation where identity, intention, and symbol combine in the decision to purchase, to own, an object.<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo se ubica en el campo de la metodología y refiere a la sistematización de las experiencias etnográficas del trabajo realizado durante varias temporadas en la Oficina María Elena (II Región, Chile), último pueblo de la tradición salitrera. Destaca cómo y desde dónde se va construyendo por parte de sus habitantes el imaginario y la memoria pampina desde el "ser los últimos" representantes de esta tradición laboral, e identificando los ejes de recurrencia en que se apoyan. Asimismo, revela los distintos ángulos desde los cuales se construye la mirada antropológica, y cómo esta va logrando densidad, profundidad y extensión en un juego entre la individualidad y la comunidad, en un contexto en el que permanentemente ronda la imagen del cierre del pueblo y con ello el fin de la cultura pampina. This paper deals with methodology and is centered on systematizing several ethnographic field seasons in María Elena (Northern Chile) the last village within the nitrate tradition. It highlights how and where its inhabitants build their "pampa" imaginary and memory of being the last representatives of such a working tradition. Likewise, we identify the axis of recurrence on which these patterns are based. In addition, this paper reveals the angles from where an anthropological view is created developing density, depth and width within a context containing the image of the village's end and thus the end of the "pampa" culture itself.<br>

Tanto historiadores como historiados, se encuentran en la misma condición de recordar acompañados. Ello nos compele a saber escuchar para entender las formas de olvido y contribuir a que la memoria aflore y estimule el ejercicio mnemotécnico. Como advertía Frances Yates, la memoria es un arte, y por tanto, el historiador asume que frente al el proceso destructor del olvido, la historia logra reconstruirse, siempre y cuando exista una memoria que perviva. Historians insist on finding truth and defending the freedom to interpret it. The different «truths» entail the permanent building of history, to which end we need to keep endlessly on looking for traces and remains of the past. Historians, as well as their subjects, find themselves in the situation of remembering accompanied. This compels us to know how to listen to forms of oblivion and to contribute to bring memory to the surface and stimulate the mnemonic exercise. As Frances Yeats warned, memory is an art, and therefore the historian assumes that, before the destructive process of oblivion, history achieves its reconstruction as long as there is a memory surviving.<br>

Abstract: Tras el fin del régimen del apartheid en Sudáfrica, la Comisión Verdad y Reconciliación, creada durante las negociaciones que llevaron al traspaso de poder, fue un instrumento decisivo para la transición pacífica a la democracia. Si esta forma negociada de compartir el poder entre enemigos acérrimos cogió por sorpresa al mundo exterior, este segundo proceso provocaría una sorpresa todavía mayor: la Comisión Verdad y Reconciliación fue un desenmascaramiento no judicial, no político y sin represalias de los perpetradores de la época del apartheid, y generó un proceso de amnistía sin precedentes. Este ensayo explica cómo funcionó dicho proceso y cómo se enmarcó en una nueva concepción de la justicia, arraigada en la confesión voluntaria por parte de los perpetradores y en una retórica reparadora de los relatos personales. Defiende que los perpetradores son, paradójicamente, el lugar antropológico donde asentar los cimientos de la democracia. After the end of the apartheid regime in South Africa, one fundamental instrument for a peaceful transition to democracy was the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, agreed upon during the negotiations that lead to the handing over of power. In the same measure as such negotiated power sharing between bitter enemies took by surprise the outside world, this second process was to provoke an even greater surprise: the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was a non-judicial, non-political, non-retaliatory exposure of apartheid-era perpetrators, and created a unique process of amnesty. This essay explains how the amnesty process operated and how it was framed by a new conception of justice, rooted in voluntary disclosure by perpetrators and a restorative rhetoric of personal narratives. It argues that perpetrators are paradoxically the anthropological site for a democratic foundation.<br>

Abstract: This article analyzes the ways in which Polish migrants in Ireland negotiate prevalent Polish discourses on migrant identity. The author emphasizes the complexity of migrant identity transgressions first, in order to displace a belief in a fixed homogeneity of the Polish migrant community, and secondly, to illustrate the problematics of young Polish migrants' relations with politically and culturally endorsed notions of Polishness, and, finally, to stress the need to engage migrant voices into the discussion on issues of Polish cultural and national identity. To that end the author analyzes two narratives of Polish migrants in Ireland which not only engage in contestation and negotiation of fixed identities but also emphasize the value of migration in shaping ideas about identity that transgress the idea of the nation as an absolute.<br>

Abstract: Las migraciones masivas de población, en particular a Europa, siempre han generado conflictos; pero si además estas ocurren bajo una profunda crisis económica, se crea un ambiente propicio para las expresiones xenófobas o racistas. Para aliviar esta tensión, desde finales del siglo pasado se implementa, con mayor énfasis en Estados Unidos, Canadá y Japón, un modelo de convivencia, el de la multiculturalidad, algo así como un "juntos pero no revueltos", que sobrevalora lo exótico de los inmigrantes, pero que, a pesar de sus aciertos, responde de forma limitada a los retos actuales. Este artículo presenta un modelo que sugiere la liberación de buena parte de la pesada carga que conlleva toda identidad con el fin de transformar a los individuos en seres plurales, abiertos a las transferencias de las identidades de los otros, ya sean estos nativos o foráneos. Mass migrations of people, particularly into Europe, have always created conflict; however, if they are also taking place in the middle of a profound economic crisis, an atmosphere conducive to xenophobic and racist expression is created. To alleviate this tension, since the end of the past century (and with particular emphasis in the United States, Canada and Japan) a model of coexistence has been implemented — that of multiculturality, which can be loosely translated as "together but not intimately involved". In spite of its success, this model (which overestimates the exotic nature of immigrants), only deals with current challenges in a limited manner. This article presents a model that suggests the freeing-up of much of the heavy load that any identity entails with the aim of transforming individuals into plural beings, which are open to the transparencies of others' identities, whether they are native inhabitants or foreigners.<br>

Abstract: First of all an overview is presented of the development in the social sciences that led to postmodernism. The starting point for this is the modernity that was under the influence of Parsons after the second World War. It extended to the Third World mainly in the context of development research. Since the end of the 1970s the contributions of two German scientists, Niklas Luhmann and Jürgen Habermas, have received international recognition. During this time the first critical voices concerning the modernist theories were heard. Among ideas opposing these theories the approaches should be named first, which the author calls "post industrial". To these he counts primarily the analysis of the modern socio-economic system by Daniel Bell and the studies of the "post-material personality" by Ronald Inglehart. Research on the change of values in modern societies should be named in the same context. However, "post-industrial" should not be confused with "post-modern". The origin of the latter term from the "culture scene" is explained. The language of the post-modernists can be viewed as their characteristic, as well as the attempts of deconstruction imprinted by Derrida. Ever since Lyotard the strong bond between the name and the named object within the language has been questioned. Therefore, Jean Baudrillard is correct in noting a loss in the sense of orientation of the modern human being. For example, the works of two post-modernists, Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck, are discussed in detail, after which the author concludes: "That is the most important meaning of postmodernity: as a symbol for the weakened autonomy of the sciences and arts, as a lack for the support of sciences in culture and politics". Nevertheless one can observe a return to rationality in recent years.<br>

Author(s): Smalley B.<br>
Abstract: See above, 45, 170-172. The Migne édition of Β is incomplète, lacking the
prologue; see F. Stegmüller, Repertorium Biblicum Medii Aevi (henceforward
referred to as RB) no. 2604. Canon B. Merlette has discovered that B represents
an abridgement, with altérations, of a commentary entitled 'Glose magistri Anselmi
de Monte Leonis et Remensis archiepiscopi super Matheum' in MS Paris, Bibl.
nat. lat. 2491, foll. 1-143. He takes this for 'le Commentaire "magistral" d'Anselme'.
The fact that Master Anselm was never archbishop of Reims and that this manu-
script is datable from the end of the twelfth Century (Catalogue général des MSS
latins 2, Paris 1940, 487) makes me wonder whether it was really the original
and not an enlargement of B. Merlette does not question the doubtful ascription
of B to Geoffrey Babion, nor does he consider the evidence for the late dating
of B. If B depended on Anselm's 'magistral' commentary, he must have changed
it drastically. See B. Merlette, Enseignement et vie culturelle IXe-XVIe siècle.
Ecoles et bibliothèques, in Ministère de l'Education nationale. Comité des travaux
historiques et scientifiques, Actes du 95' Congrès national des sociétés savantes,
Reims, 1970. Section de philologie et d'histoire jusqu'à 1610, 1 (1975) 44-46. This
important discovery makes it necessary to reconsider the relationship between
MS lat. 2491 and A and B. Meanwhile, the outcome, whatever it may be, would
not affect Comestor's use of B, which concerns us here.<br>

this connection between monasticism and hermeneutics; when speaking explictly
of John Cassian he says: "The monastic life emerges as a cyclical discipline of
askesis preparatory to the understanding of scripture, which in turn is intended to
nourish the ascetic discipline required for an understanding of scripture."<br>

Author(s): Desrosières Alain<br>
Abstract: Dans le cadre du séminaire Bonheur et Travail qui a débouché sur une enquête de l'Insee, Céline Bessière et Frédérique Houseaux ont pu « suivre des enquêteurs » et tirer de leurs observations de terrain quelques conclusions sur la production de données statistiques. Une passation mouvementée du questionnaire auprès d'un salariéagricole agricole montre l'importance de la situation d'enquête ainsi que celle des malentendus sur les mots utilisés. Les auteurs proposent de s'appuyer sur ces «ratés» de la relation d'enquête pour mettre en lumière le rôle souvent oublié de l'enquêteur. Elles suggèrent enfin de rapprocher enquêteurs et concepteurs et d'utiliser les données produites en gardant à l'esprit le travail de traduction qui a présidé à leur fabrication. Christian Baudelot et Michel Gollac en tirent la conclusion qu'il faut «faire avec» et refusent de renoncer aux gains de connaissance qu'apportent les enquêtes statistiques. Ils plaident qu'à condition de ne pas s'y enfermer, on peut les utiliser pour combattre l'ethnocentrisme même qui a pu présider à leur recueil. Florence Weber s'interroge sur la nature de l'interaction entre enquêteur Insee et enquêté: «relation anonyme et formulaire d'enquête» se conjuguent pour la rapprocher des relations qu'entretiennent d'autres agents subalternes de l'État avec les administrés. En jouant sur la nature des questions posées, on déplace simplement le lieu où se produisent les malentendus, à la fois instructifs et constructifs. Enfin, Alain Desrosières se demande «à quoi sert une enquête». Si les mêmes critiques, formulées depuis des décennies, n'ont jamais fait obstacle à la répétition des enquêtes statistiques, c'est que leur enjeu n'est pas seulement cognitif mais aussi politique. Il faut donc restituer la visée d'usage des enquêtes et les moyens sociaux des produits et des énoncés statistiques. Within the scope of the Happiness and Work seminar that led to an Insee survey, Céline Bessière and Frédérique Houseaux were able t~<br>

Abstract: Si le débat qu'a suscité l'esthétique de la réception au sein des disciplines littéraires, s'est cantonné, à de rares exceptions près, au domaine des concepts et des esquisses théoriques, la nouvelle histoire sociale de la lecture a entrepris de rendre raison des variations des appropriations d'un même texte ou d'un même ensemble de textes d'un pôle à l'autre de l'espace social, d'une époque à une autre ou encore d'une société à l'autre. Quant aux résultats des enquêtes accumulées depuis le début des années soixante-dix, l'hypothèse d'une triple homologie entre division du travail – entre «monde des choses matérielles» et «monde des choses humaines» – division scolaire – entre filières scientifiques et filières littéraires – et division entre les sexes, permet de rendre compte des exceptions apparentes à la relation très étroite qui unit les pratiques de lecture et le capital culturel détenu. While the debate generated within literary disciplines concerning the aesthetics of reception has, with few exceptions, been confined to domain of concepts and theoretical outlines, the new social history of reading has attempted to account for the varied ways in which a single text or even a group of texts is appropriated from one end of society to the other of society, from one historical period to another or from one society to the next. As for the results of surveys accumulated since the early 1970s, the hypothesis of a threefold equivalence of the division of labour – between a "world of material things" and a "world of human things" – the academic division between scientific and literary paths – and division of the sexes, accounts for the apparent exceptions to the very close relationship linking reading practices and the possession of cultural assets.<br>

Abstract: Cet entretien, réalisé à l'occasion de la parution du dernier ouvrage d'Arno J. Mayer, Les Furies, permet de retracer l'itinéraire intellectuel de cet historien du contemporain nourri de science politique et d'un marxisme hétérodoxe. Il met en lumière tout l'intérêt des méthodes et des questionnements d'un chercheur soucieux de penser de manière comparée les moments de crise sociale et politique en Europe et d'en comprendre la violence. Les prises de position politiques d'A. J. Mayer éclairent son œuvre et dessinent les difficultés et les originalités d'un parcours engagé dans l'université américaine depuis la fin des années 1950. This interview, conducted on the occasion of the publication of Arno J. Mayer's latest book, Les Furies, recounts the intellectual itinerary of this historian of the contemporary period, nurtured by political science and unorthodox Marxism. It brings out the interesting aspects of the methods and questioning used by this researcher who studies moments of social and political crisis in Europe comparatively and aims at understanding their violence. The political positions taken by A. J. Mayer help explain his writings and indicate the problems and originality of the path taken by a committed scholar who has been working in American universities since the end of the 1950s.<br>

Abstract: Much the same is true of those 'Utopian realists' who, I suggested earlier, in this respect
at least make common cause with Dunn. Giddens, for example, insists that we must
'balance Utopian ideals with realism' given the extremely high-consequence risks of
contemporary social life, echoing Dunn's insistence on the complexity and risk inherent in
modernity, and Booth stresses that his utopianism is not an end-point Utopia but a process
Utopia, agreeing with Dunn's concern that the third task of political theory is to conceive
of realistic ways of getting from where we are to where we might, and should, aim to be.<br>

Abstract: Here, we should beware of the English translation, which tends to reify the two Chinese
characters 仏教.Literally, they indicate “teachings [of the] Buddha,” or "Buddhist teachings，”
with a further step being their identification with "Buddhism." Like the concept of “religion”
that emerged at the end of the nineteenth century to translate a Western concept, there is a sub-
tle shift between the idea of "Buddhist teachings” and the further use of the same term to indi-
cate "Buddhism."<br>

Author(s): Wils Jean-Pierre<br>
Abstract: Over the last few decades there has been a revival of interest in virtue ethics, with the emphasis on the virtuous caregiver. This paper deals with the 'virtuous patient', specifically the patient with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). We believe that a virtue approach provides insights not available to current methods of studying coping styles and coping strategies. Data are derived from seven semi-structured in-depth interviews. The transcripts of the interviews were subjected to an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The focus of the analysis was on 'living well with chronic illness'. It appears that the moral challenges faced by patients with an ESRD are manifold. When they are invited to tell the story of their illness, they do not explicitly speak of virtues, but they often refer to moral qualities, and to attitudes that can be regarded as virtuous. We identify several such concepts in the narratives of patients with ESRD. We conclude that the Aristotelian model of virtue ethics is particularly descriptively (and possibly also normatively) relevant to the explanation of the life narratives and the moral challenges of patients with an ESRD.<br>

Issue: i27643230<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Doja Albert<br>
Abstract: The system of beliefs and practices related to Bektashism seems to have corresponded to a kind of liberation theology, whereas the structure of Bektashi groups corresponded more or less to the type of religious organization conventionally known as charismatic groups. It becomes understandable therefore that their spiritual tendency could at times connect with and meet social, cultural and national perspectives. In turn, when members of the previously persecuted religious minority will acquire a degree of religious and political respectability within society at large, the doctrines of heterodoxy and liberation theology fade into the background. In the end, the heirs of the heterodox promoters of spiritual reform and social movement turn into followers and faithful defenders of a legitimate authority. They become the spokespeople for an institutionalized orthodoxy whose support is sought by the political regime.<br>

Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies<br>

Author(s): Kliger Ilya<br>
Abstract: Ilya Kliger addresses the question of Mikhail Bakhtin's intervention in modernist discourse by taking a step back from Bakhtin's views on modernist literature and outlining instead a more general Bakhtinian conception of the modernist condition as characterized by what Kliger calls "a crisis of authorship." The article focuses on Bakhtin's early work in narratological aesthetics and situates it within the longue durée context of debates about the status of the subject of aesthetic experience and, more generally, of knowledge, debates that can provisionally be seen as originating at the end of the eighteenth century and coming to a head within the intellectual and creative milieu of twentieth-century modernism. Early Bakhtin helps us formulate a specifically modernist—by contrast with what will be called "transcendental" and "realist"—critique, a critique not limited to the field of literary analysis alone but applying to all forms of thinking that either presuppose abstract subject-object division or rely on modes of synthetic reconciliation.<br>

Article Title: The Divine Essence, that Inaccessible <italic>Kabod</italic> Enthroned in Heaven: Nazianzen's <italic>Oratio</italic> 28,3 and the Tradition of Apophatic Theology from Symbols to Philosophical Concepts<br>
Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers<br>

Date: 1 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Giulea Dragoş A.<br>
Abstract: In his second theological oration (Oratio 28,3), Gregory Nazianzen equates the divine glory (kabod) of the Holy of Holies with the divine essence and asserts their inaccessible character. An investigation into the meaning of these two terms unveils their origins in two distinct traditions, the former tracing its roots back to the ancient Semitic symbolisms of the forbidden divine glory and throne, the latter to the Hellenistic philosophical conception of an immaterial and incomprehensible divinity. The thesis advanced in this study is that these two different languages represent two semiotic forms of apophaticism, one expressed through the mysterium tremendum inspiring symbols and images of fire, dazzling glory and enigmatic heavenly creatures, guardians of the enthroned kabod, the other through negative philosophical terminologies. The identity of the two semiotic forms is established at the end of an investigation that concludes with the observation that Hellenistic theologians developed their apophatic discourses mostly in the context of interpreting biblical reports on the theophanies of the divine and unapproachable enthroned kabod. It was in this hermeneutical context that they "translated" the symbols of interdiction into philosophical negative concepts.<br>

Author(s): Pedersen Birthe D.<br>
Abstract: This article presents results from an empirical investigation of the role and importance of ethics in the daily work of Danish oncology physicians and Danish molecular biologists. The study is based on 12 semi-structured interviews with three groups of respondents: a group of oncology physicians working in a clinic at a public hospital and two groups of molecular biologists conducting basic research, one group employed at a public university and the other in a private biopharmaceutical company. We found that oncology physicians consider ethical evaluation as part of their daily work. They discuss how to treat patients in groups and they have interdisciplinary seminars. In contrast, molecular biologists employed at the university do not think that basic research causes significant ethical problems, they do not talk about ethics in their daily work and they do not want to prioritise seminars on ethics. Molecular biologists employed in a private biopharmaceutical company do not think that basic research causes significant ethical problems, but the private company prioritises ethical evaluation. If the company behaves unethical, they will be punished by the consumers and by the investors in the last end. In general, oncology physicians working in the clinic experience a closer relationship between their daily work and ethical problems concerning human beings than molecular biologists conducting basic research.<br>

Abstract: La stèle du Bronzo est gravée d'un oiseau "levé", en plein vol, la tête tournée vers l'extérieurs, superposé à un filon de quartz blanc; une crosse, également traitée en champlevé, lui barre le passage. En première lecture, une identification plausible du genre volatile semblait prévaloir et le colombidé emportait notre adhésion. Mais une analyse plus posée et un effort de déconstruction graphique du motif permettront cette fois de reprendre et d'affiner la reconnaissance, en décrivant les différents filtres autorisant tel ou tel rejet de catégorie ou d'espèce, pour ne conserver en dernier ressort que les meilleurs prétendants à la seule confrontation possible, celle qui oppose les corvidés aux colombidés. La représentation du Bronzo est en définitive équivalente en substance et en structure aux scènes figurées sur les stèles voisines dans lesquelles un phallus s'oppose qu tranchant d'une lame de hache (Mané Rutual), tandis qu'un cachalot affronte la coalition des animaux et des outils de l'homme (Table des Marchand). A "flushed" bird is engraved on the Bronzo stela, in full flight, its head turned to the exterior, superposed over a white quartz vein; a crook, equally treated in cut-away engraving, bars its passage. At a first reading, a plausible identification of the bird seemed to prevail and the Columbidae met with our approval. However, more deliberate analysis and an effort at the graphic deconstruction of the motif allows the identification to be reconsidered and improved, by describing the various filters authorising the rejection of such or such a category, finally preserving the best claimants to the only possible confrontation, opposing Corvidae to Columbidae. The Bronzo representation is equivalent in substance and in structure to the scenes on the neighbouring stelae where a phallus is opposed to the sharp edge of an axe blade (Mané Rutual), while a sperm-whale confronts the coalition of animals and human tools (Table des Marchand). However Bronzo is a ~<br>

Abstract: Since several well known critics have recently declared that the golden age of literary theory has come to an end, this might be the moment to rethink a theoretical problem that attracted some interest in the academic world from the late 1970s to the early 1990s: the relationship between historiography and literary criticism. Although the histoire des mentalités has given the literary text an unprecedented status in the reconstruction of the collective imaginary and although the discussion of similarities between forms of narrative in historical and fictional texts has undoubtedly intensified the dialogue between historiography and literary criticism, some aspects have been overlooked in the debate of the last twenty to thirty years. First, for both types of texts, fictional as well as historiographic, the wide range of narrative and representational strategies has not been taken into account; second, more recent narratological methods of analysis have not been applied to historiographic texts; third, the interest for the narrative character of historiographic texts can be found almost exclusively among literary critics and philosophers and much less among historians; and fourth, the analysis of narrative structures inside and outside the limits of fictional writing has eclipsed the main characteristic of literary texts, their inherent potential to produce pleasure.<br>

Abstract: Most analyses of developments in the religious discourse in Calvinist circles of Languedoc after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) have stressed its basic continuity. The expert comparison of sermons before 1685 with subsequent homilies at the end of the 17th century proves this "continuist" hypothesis to be false. Between the two periods, not only did the speakers change but also the structure of the discourse (transitive/intransitive) was modified as well as its relation to the text of reference (compromise on the meaning/ fundamentalism) and the function of speaking itself (intersocial saturation/intracommunity fragmentation). The pacified public discourse became a private one in a zone of textual violence.<br>

Abstract: Memory and forgetting are key subjects of current historical and sociological research. Their meaning embraces passive as well as active forms of collective recollection and oblivion, activities of retention as well as of dynamic shifting in the broad field of symbolic representation. Applied to Rezeptionsgeschichte and Wirkungsgeschichte in the perspective of the Classical Tradition, those key terms signify the complex interplay between change and continuity. The materials discussed under this assumption mainly range from theories and practices of memory in Antiquity and the Middle Ages to Renaissance systems of architecture and art, from the early emergence of advanced civilizations to a modern conceptualized history of cultural change. The connecting element is the theoretically defined concept of "cultural memory" not only comprising textuality and literary techniques of memory but also image production and ritual activities in non-literate societies. At the end the question will be asked, whether there are any alternative ways of culture-investigation lying hidden within cultural memory itself.<br>

Abstract: This essay argues that literary theory can no longer afford to adopt an exceptionalist view of its own disciplinary identity and relation to the Western tradition. To this end, it outlines a conceptual framework that distinguishes between competing tendencies within the Western tradition represented by the terms metaphysics and ontology. The implications of this distinction for literary theory are that the most important sources of the latter's disciplinary identity are neither the linguistics-based movement of French structuralism, as the term poststructuralism implies, nor a "modernity" that has been superseded, as the term postmodernism implies, but rather a modernist tradition of aesthetics shaped by eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century German romanticism and idealism.<br>

Abstract: The author describes and illustrates a hermeneutically grounded interpretive framework for deriving marketing-relevant insights from the "texts" of consumer stories and gives an overview of the philosophical and theoretical foundations of this approach. Next, the author describes a hermeneutic framework for interpreting the stories consumers tell about their experiences of products, services, brand images, and shopping. An illustrative analysis demonstrates how this framework can be applied to generate three levels of interpretation: (1) discerning the key patterns of meanings expressed by a given consumer in the texts of his or her consumption stories, (2) identifying key patterns of meaning that emerge across the consumption stories expressed by different consumers, and (3) deriving broader conceptual and managerial implications from the analysis of consumer narratives. This hermeneutic approach is compared and contrasted to the means-end chains laddering framework, the "voice of the customer" approach to identifying consumer needs, and market-oriented ethnography. The author concludes with a discussion that highlights the types of marketing insights that can result from a hermeneutic interpretation of consumers' consumption stories and then addresses the roles creativity and expertise play in this research orientation.<br>

Article Title: In the Dark Backward: Time in Pindaric Narrative<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i371935<br>
Date: 12 1, 1899<br>
Author(s): Zeilinski R. Drew<br>
Abstract: This paper considers the temporal relationship between account and story in the narrative passages of Pindar's odes. Highly selective, each narrative covers a vast extent of story-time, creating rapidly juxtaposed tableaux. The account typically begins near the end of the story, proceeding backwards by stages until it reaches the beginning. Thence it returns through all, some, or none of the intermediary stages until it has reached its starting point, beyond which it may then continue forward in time. Prophecy and foreshadowing provide a counterpoint to this basically analeptic structure. Different story lines, simultaneous events, and alternative possibilities all find their place in the narrative. The length of account-time is generally less than that of story-time and diminishes as the narrative proceeds. Repetition is necessitated by the backward and then forward order of combination as well as serving other purposes. Elaboration, when it occurs, serves to explain events that are improbable or inconsistent with the maxims contained in the non-narrative passages.<br>

Article Title: Advocacy and Scholarship<br>
Publisher: School of Law, University of California, Berkeley<br>
Issue: i276945<br>
Date: 7 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Yeats Paul F.<br>
Abstract: The apex of American legal thought is embodied in two types of writings: the federal appellate opinion and the law review article. In this Article, the author criticizes the whole enterprise of doctrinal constitutional law scholarship, using a recent U.S. Supreme Court case and a Harvard Law Review article as quintessential examples of the dominant genre. In a rhetorical tour de force, the author argues that most of modern constitutional scholarship is really advocacy in the guise of scholarship. Such an approach to legal scholarship may have some merit as a strategic move towards a political end; however, it has little value as scholarship, the goal of which is to seek truth. As a formerly monolithic legal system becomes more culturally heterogeneous, judges and academics no longer share as many assumptions about social truth. Hence, they have an increasing need to mask political judgments in order to avoid the contentious political battles that this increased diversity produces. Legal academia's present obsession with defending constitutional law as something more than an ad hoc rationalization of what are essentially political choices suggests that the present genre of constitutional scholarship may well have outlived its usefulness as a discursive form.<br>

Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies<br>
Issue: i370063<br>
Date: 4 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): Fabian Maria<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on the discourse of backwardness as an aspect of what has been recognized as the dominant trope in east European historiography until the end of the twentieth century, namely nationalism. Through a survey of east European historiographies, it demonstrates how different notions of temporality are employed. Eastern Europe as a whole and the particular problem of east European nationalism have been constituted as historical objects of study very much on the pattern of anthropological objects, through structural models of "timeless" theory and method and bracketing out time as a dimension of intercultural study. The article proposes a way to circumvent the trap of origins, which carries backwardness as its corollary, by introducing the idea of relative synchronicity within a longue durée framework. This allows the description of a period in terms of linear consecutive developments but also as a dialogical process without overlooking important aspects of short-term historical analysis involving sequential development, transmission, and diffusion.<br>

Article Title: Workers in the New Economy: Transformation as Border Crossing<br>
Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i370173<br>
Date: 3 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Walkerdine Valerie<br>
Abstract: In this article, I seek to make an intervention in debates between psychological and postmodern anthropology by engaging with the theme of border crossing. I argue that the theme of the border is one that fundamentally instantiates a separation between interior and exterior with respect to subjectivity, itself a fundamental transformation and a painful and difficult border. This is related to a Cartesian distinction critiqued in this article. How the distinction between interior and exterior may be transcended is discussed in relation to examples of transformation from the crossing of class borders to the production and regulation of workers in a globalized and neoliberal economy. I begin with reference to postwar transformations of class with its anxious borders and go on to think about changes in the labor market and how these demand huge transformations that tear apart communities, destroy work-places, and sunder the sense of safety and stability that those gave. Advanced liberalism or neoliberalism brings with it a speeding up of the transformations of liberalism in which subjects are constantly invoked as self-contained, with a transportable self that must be produced through the developmental processes of personality and rationality. This self must be carried like a snail carries a shell. It must be coherent yet mutable, fixed yet multiple and flexible. But this view of the subject covers over the many connections that make subjectivity possible. I conclude by asking what it would mean to rethink this issue of the production of safe spaces beyond an essentialist psychological conception of only one mother-child space, separated from the social world, as having the power to produce feelings of safety? I end the article with an argument for a relational approach to subjectivity and sociality.<br>

Author(s): Martin Mariana<br>
Abstract: Las políticas a través de las cuales los gobiernos democráticos trataron de poner fin a los debates sobre la represión de las dictaduras, en el Cono Sur de América Latina y en Sudáfrica, han fracasado. Esos intentos, representados por el modelo de "la comisión de verdad y reconciliación" -hoy en día activamente promovido en el nivel internacional- no permitieron la reconciliación deseada. La retórica del perdón empleada por los gobiernos fue estéril, confirmando el veredicto de la filosofía moral: no es posible un "perdón político". Sin embargo, este artículo defiende la conveniencia de un análisis de esa retórica. En primer lugar, tomar en cuenta esa retórica ayuda a discutir las explicaciones propuestas por las ciencias sociales y por los juristas de los procesos de transición a la democracia. En segundo lugar, la retórica del perdón produjo efectos políticos en cierto modo contradictorios. Impulsada por los gobiernos para poner un "punto final" a los debates sobre la violación de los derechos humanos, en los hechos impidió su clausura. Pero, por otro lado, esa retórica condujo a la escritura de una historia pacificadora. /// The policies through which democratic governments in the Southern Cone of Latin America and South Africa tried to put an end to the debates on repression during previous dictatorships have failed. Those attempts, embodied in the "Commission for Truth and Reconciliation" model actively promoted today at the international level, did not enable the reconciliation sought after. The rhetoric of forgiveness used by governments was futile, confirming the verdict by moral philosophy: "political forgiveness" is not possible. However, this article contends there are benefits in analyzing that rhetoric. First, taking that rhetoric into account contributes to discussing the explanations of the processes of transition to democracy proposed by social sciences and jurists. Second, the rhetoric of forgiveness produced somewhat contradictory political effects~<br>

Publisher: W. S. Maney & Son Ltd<br>
Issue: i288890<br>
Date: 7 1, 1975<br>
Author(s): FranchAbstract: The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the growth in Spain of a small corpus of woman-authored erotic fiction. Critical response to this literature has varied, with some critics seeing it as a valuable contribution in post-Franco Spain to the broader political projects of europeanization and secularization, and others regretting its inability to find a genuine non-patriarchal voice with which to celebrate women's sexuality. It is possible, however, to read these works as classic examples of how the obstacles to women writing might be overcome. This article examines two textual strategies employed, metaphor and irony, in short stories by Ana Rossetti and Mercedes Abad respectively, and concludes with the suggestion that this corpus represents the process of overcoming obstacles rather than the end product of having done so.<br>

Abstract: L'article présente les premiers résultats d'une recherche en cours, menée d'après les archives de huit Conseils de prud'hommes, depuis leurs origines. A travers l'interaction aux audiences est étudiée l'interaction sur les lieux de travail. L'exploration d'un domaine inconnu jusqu'à maintenant met en cause la vision historique des rapports patrons-ouvriers, depuis le Premier Empire jusqu'au Second, qu'il s'agisse du droit ou des pratiques usuelles. Afin de reconstruire un ordre industriel, la voie conciliatrice s'imposa comme la solution la plus efficace, face à l'impuissance des voies répressives. L'article analyse comment les conflits pouvaient éclater et se régler, comment se sont établies des sortes de législations locales du travail, en dissidence avec le droit national français, puis comment ce modèle a été remis en cause, à la fin du Second Empire, lorsque des patrons prétendirent s'instaurer seuls juges sur le lieu de travail. /// The article gives the first results of an ongoing research through eight "Conseil de prud'hommes" archives. The interactions during the hearings give a way to understand the interactions on the workplace. The exploration of a yet unknown world questions the common historical view of labour relations from the First to the Second Empire, whatever a matter of law or of common practices. The individual conciliator way was thrusted by evidence of efficiency against the repressive way, in order to rebuild an industrial order. The article analyses how the conflicts could break out and be settled, how sets of local rules were laid down and generated a discrepancy between prud'hommes' customs and the national law. And how this model was destabilized at the end of the Second Empire, when employers claimed to be instituted as unique judges on the workplace. seuls juges sur le lieu de travail. /// The article gives the first results of an ongoing research through eight "Conseil de prud'hommes'" archives.

Publisher: Editions de l'Atelier<br>
Issue: i291756<br>
Date: 12 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Gutierrez Sabine<br>
Abstract: L'étude de l'engagement de "Frères du Monde" contre la guerre du Vietnam (1965-1973) permet de mettre en évidence les tensions existant entre la sphère du religieux et celle du politique, au sein d'un groupe de catholiques engagés, au cours de la décennie marquée par mai 68. Au début de la guerre du Vietnam, en février 1965, cette revue catholique, dirigée par des Franciscains bordelais, prend une position originale dans les milieux chrétiens: elle condamne très rapidement et très fermement l'intervention américaine. Ses rédacteurs "témoignent" en faveur du peuple vietnamien et dénoncent, en termes marxistes-léninistes, l'impérialisme américain. A travers les analyses, les prises de positions et les actions de "Frères du Monde" à propos du Vietnam, c'est le glissement vers le gauchisme d'une fraction minoritaire de la gauche chrétienne que l'on peut observer. Après 1968, le discours de la revue sur la guerre du Vietnam perd toute référence religieuse pour devenir, apparemment, exclusivement politique. Il reflète cependant une évolution théologique qui conduit des Franciscains, destinés à l'origine à la Mission, vers une théologie de la Libération, en gestation, à la même époque, en Amérique latine. L'engagement de "Frères du Monde" contre la guerre du Vietnam prend fin prématurément en septembre 1971. Alors que les combats redoublent de violence, la rédaction de la revue ne s'exprime plus sur cette guerre. En proie à des divisions internes, la revue disparaît au cours de l'année 1973. /// The study of "Frères du Monde's" commitment against the Vietnam War brings to the fore the tensions existing between the religious field and the political one, within a group of politically involved Catholics during the decade around May 1968.

Abstract: This article takes up the call of feminist thinkers to reconsider the importance of the utopian. I offer a view of the utopian that is situated, critical, and relevant to transformative politics, a view that is structured by embodiment. To this end, I consider some epistemological and ontological connections of situated utopian thinking that enable us to think the utopian differently. Finally, I argue that this view of the utopian can be found in the political efforts of "integrative feminisms."<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000941<br>
Date: 4 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Rees Geoffrey<br>
Abstract: Widely regarded as the most influential proponent of the truth of original sin in the twentieth century, Reinhold Niebuhr worked hard to excise any "literalistic" element from his interpretation of the doctrine. In his attempt to "correct" the Augustinian tradition on original sin by purging it of all "literalistic errors," however, Niebuhr assumed as his starting point the most characteristically modern objection to the doctrine: that birth is a thoroughly natural, animal, and morally meaningless event. As a result, Niebuhr unnecessarily constrained his vision of the dimensions of human freedom, and hence his description of the dynamic of anxiety and freedom that energizes sin. Through a careful reading of Reinhold Niebuhr's writings on original sin, in light of the truth that the end of human life is inseparable from its origins, a reappraisal and recovery of the meaningfulness of the assertion of original sin as a literal inheritance is possible. The result of such a reappraisal and recovery is an amplified insight into the existential anxiety that Niebuhr otherwise described so convincingly.<br>

Author(s): Kentish-Barnes Nancy<br>
Abstract: La réanimation et les techniques employées ont bousculé notre rapport à la mort, déjà professionnalisée et médicalisée. L'étude de quatre services de réanimation, en France et en Grande-Bretagne, permet de faire apparaître la réalité des pratiques concrètes de la mort et de la replacer au cœur des relations professionnelles et des expériences personnelles. Au terme de ce travail, la décision de fin de vie apparaît être une véritable construction sociale : loin d'être purement objective et médicale, elle est conditionnée par des effets de contexte et par l'engagement des acteurs. La recherche d'autonomie et d'autorégulation professionnelle renforce l'ambivalence du processus de "mourir" déjà complexe puisque régi par des logiques très hétérogènes. La mort dépend plus de l'organisation et de la culture de chaque service que de la volonté du patient ou de ses proches. /// Intensive care units and their techniques have considerably altered our attitude towards death as well as the death process - a process that had already been professionalised and medicalised. This study of four intensive care units in France and Britain brings to light the reality of deathrelated practices and resituates that reality at the core of professional relationships and personal experiences. Study results strongly suggest that the decision to end life is a genuine social construction : far from being purely objective and medical, it is heavily conditioned by context and actors' commitment. The search for professional autonomy and self-regulation has increased the ambivalence of the dying process, already complex because governed by numerous and heterogeneous logics. This study shows that our death depends more on the organization and the culture of the intensive care unit than on our own wishes or those of close relatives. /// Behandlung und technische Mittel in der Intensivstation haben unser Verhaltnis zum Sterben grundlegend verändert und es heute schon zu einer medizinischen Berufssache g~<br>

Abstract: A filosofia prática de Kant, ou seja, o nuclear da sua ética, juntamente com o "primado da razão prática sobre a especulativa" e a "religião nos limites da simples razão", com seu acento no "mal radical", têm inegáveis afinidades com a - e em certos casos influxo da - tradição cristã. O próprio Kant terá em alguns momentos reconhecido isso mesmo. Segundo o autor do presente texto, subsistem, contudo, inegáveis divergências. O artigo, escrito a partir de uma declarada 'simpatia metódica, pretende precisar no possível o alcance de umas e de outras, fazendo sobre o tema um balanço positivo. O autor propõe ainda uma hipótese de leitura do Opus Postumum, reconhecendo aqui uma tentativa por parte de Kant no sentido de purificar o seu "teísmo moral" numa direcção que tão pouco é alheia a importantes intuições cristãs. /// Aim of the article is to show that the practical philosophy of Kant, or, in other terms, the core of his ethics, as is the case with the "primacy of the practical reason over the speculative one" and the "religion within the limits of pure reason", with its accent set upon the idea of "radical evil", have undeniable affinities with -and in certain cases influxes from - the Christian tradition. Kant himself seems to have recognized that much at certain moments. For the author of the article, however, there are a few divergences to be reckoned with. In fact, the article, which is clearly written from the standpoint of a declared methodic sympathy, does whatever is possible in order to determine the reach of the ones and of the others, but in the end concludes that the result is a positive one. The author also suggests a reading hypothesis for the Opus Postumum, acknowledging here an attempt on the part of Kant directed towards a purification of his "moral theism" in a direction that as such is no less close to some very important Christian intuitions.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo pretende dar sentido à afirmação feita, mais do que uma vez, por Paul Ricoeur, de que a sua filosofia poderia ser vista como um kantismo pós-hege-liano. Nesse contexto, o artigo procura abordar o pensar ricoeuriano mostrando de que modo ele se instaura e se desenvolve no horizonte kantiano de uma filosofia dos limites do saber. Essa abordagem é desenvolvida em dois momentos. O primeiro dirige-se à leitura que Paul Ricoeur faz da Crítica da Razão Pura de Kant. O segundo centrar-se-à em três momentos fulcrais da Filosofia de Paul Ricoeur - a definição do seu projecto Filosofia da Vontade, a figura própria da sua Hermenêutica e o filosofema inovação semântica - evidenciando em cada um deles a ressonância da herança kantiana. /// Aim of this article is to to explore the meaning of Paul Ricoeur's persistent characterization of his own work as a post-Hegelian Kantism. In view of this end, the article demonstrates that Ricoeur's thinking is at once rooted and developed within the horizon of Kant's critical philosophy of limits in regard to knowledge. This can be shown by first considering Ricoeur's reading of the first Critique, and then centering on three decisive moments of Ricoeur's philosophy, to wit, the formulation of the project developed in the Philosophy of Will, the shape of his theory of hermeneutics, and his notion of semantic innovation that can be conceived as a philosophema. The Kantian influence can be seen to resonate in all three instances.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo tem por tema a relação entre a Filosofia da História e a problemática epistemólogica da complexidade. A teoria do conhecimento histórico ou epistemologia da História nao pode ser vista de modo linear ou unívoco porque tem sofrido mutações nos seus quadros conceptuais compáraveis às revoluções cientificas concebidas pelo filosofo e historiador das ciências Thomas Kuhn, destacando-se quatro paradigmas (continuando a usar a terminologia deste autor) do conhecimento histórico: o paradigma "omnicompreensivo", que visa compreender o sentido global da História e tem como representante máximo Hegel, retomado no contexto actual por Francis Fukuyama com a sua tese sobre o tlm da Historia: o paradigma positivista guiado por uma ideia de objectividade do conhecimento histórico hoje considerada redutora: o relativismo emergente com o "fim das grandes narrativas de legitimação do saber" e a fragmentação do sentido no pensamento pós-modemo; e a "História aberta" ao misterio do tempo, problematizadora, que constrói o seu objecto na complexidade da relação interdisciplinar com outros saberes, limitada aos instrumentos conceptuais ou técnicos do historiador e excedendo qualquer sistema conceptual fechado mas mantendo uma inquietacao metodologica orientada pela busca interminável de sentido. É este último paradigma -epistemológico, hermenêutico e histórico - que é defendido neste estudo. /// This essay deals with the relation between the philosophy of history and the epistemological problem of complexity. The theory of historical Knowlege or epistemology of history can't be seen in a linear one dimensional way because it has suffered mutations on its conceptual pictures, like the scientific revolutions conceived by the philosopher and historian of sciences.

Abstract: O presente artigo mostra até que ponto a transferência psicanalítica, produto de marca da aliança terapêutica, tem por vocação ser ultrapassada mediante a progressiva tomada de consciência que a pessoa analisada faz do caráeter instrumental da transferência. A transferência, com efeito, está destinada a dissolver-se no final da cura analítica. É verdade que a psicanálise, na sua técnica, contém sérios problemas; o artigo, porém, mostra como o seu "trabalho" essencial consiste em promover a transformação que o próprio sujeito opera mediante a sua palavra criativa, palavra esta que Ihe proporciona o seu próprio nascimento de si. /// This article tries to evince how the psychoanalytical transference, as a regular product of the therapeutic alliance, is meant to be overcome by a progressive consciousness that the patient acquires of its instrumental character. The transference is destined to be dissolved at the end of the analysis. It is true that psychoanalysis, in its technique, harbours serious problems; its essential « travail » , however, is to promote the transformation that a person realizes through his/her own creative word that pushes him/her to give birth to him/herself.<br>

Author(s): Hart Curtis W.<br>
Abstract: J. Robert Oppenheimer was among the most important and enigmatic figures in 20th century science. He is best known for successfully directing the Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan at the end of World War II. Subsequently, he became a scientist and statesman who advised the United States government in the areas of atomic weapons development and public policy. He later became subject to an investigation in 1954 into his previous political affiliations and his personal behavior that ended in the revoking of his security clearance. This essay seeks to chronicle Oppenheimer's coming of age as a public intellectual with a view toward his own psychological history and most especially in relationship to the stages of faith development articulated by James Fowler and colleagues. Moreover, though not conventionally religious, Oppenheimer's life and thought were permeated with themes and ideas of a religious and ethical nature that shaped his adult character and informed his view of the world. This essay was originally presented at The Richardson History of Psychiatry Research Seminar at Weill Cornell Medical College.<br>

Abstract: As alusões implícitas e as referências explícitas ao pensamento de Søren Kierkegaard pontuam toda a obra de Jacques Ellul. Com efeito, segundo o autor do artigo, sempre que trata de temas como a Bíblia, a fé, a esperança, o amor, a oração, a liberdade, a política, a técnica, a não-conformidade ao mundo, ou o sofrimento, Jacques Ellul recorre insistentemente a Kierkegaard em ordem a construir o seu próprio pensamento. Nesse sentido, o artigo pretende mostrar os modos de fidelidade, de retoma e de reinterpretação de uma na outra obra de modo a, de algum modo, também poder esclarecer o significado da expressão "ser kierkegaardiano". /// Implicit allusions and explicit references to Søren Kierkegaard's thought punctuate the entire work of Jacques Ellul. Especially when dealing with topics like the Bible, faith, hope, love, prayer, freedom, politics, technology, nonconformity to the world, or suffering, Ellul calls frequently on Kierkegaard in order to build his own thought. The article shows the different modes of fidelity, resumption and reinterpretation of a work into the other, so that at the end it also clarifies what it means to be kierkegaardian.<br>

Abstract: La ciudad habla a sus habitantes. En este artículo se presenta a la ciudad como texto, susceptible de distintas lecturas. Este nivel significativo orienta los comportamientos urbanos, da cuenta de su trama social y contiene las huellas de las decisiones históricas que incidieron en su construcción. En tanto expresión de la cultura, resultado histórico de la vida social, la ciudad es comparada con la lengua, planteándose en ambos casos el peso relativo del poder político en su constitución y en las hablas o prácticas que propician. La competencia ciudadana indica la capacidad de actuar con eficacia, abrirse camino en el laberinto de signos que la ciudad emite. La ciudad es múltiple y diversa, y propone distintos modos de percepción y apreciación. Da cuenta de la desigualdad social y, en algunos casos, es más explícita que el lenguaje, que a veces carece de palabras para designar aspectos de la vida social. El artículo está referido, sobre todo, a la ciudad de Buenos Aires. Se examinan también aspectos vinculados con la vida urbana en el plano de los espacios de interacción. Se señala que la ciudad ha ido perdiendo condiciones que la tornaban humana y habitable. Fue evolucionando hacia una mayor inseguridad y ello, junto con el desarrollo massmediático y la reducción de espacios públicos propicios, ha contribuido al aislamiento de sus habitantes y la disminución progresiva de la interacción y la participación. Estos aspectos tienen relación con las formas de representación política y la erosión de la condición de ciudadanía. En la última parte (poscriptum) se da cuenta de aspectos de la actual crisis política y económica que, sobre todo a partir de finales del año 2001, han producido una transformación en muchos aspectos de la vida urbana. En especial se observa un cambio notable en las formas de interrelación y uso de los espacios públicos junto con una intensificación de las formas de interpelación, de participación en la vida política y del protagonismo de los habi~<br>

Abstract: Cet article se propose de comprendre le sens musical d'une production de techno dite underground. Au travers de l'analyse de « Let's play » de Crystal Distortion, un artiste réputé de la mouvance free party (ou techno clandestine), on examine principalement la coexistence douloureuse des valeurs utopiques de ce mouvement, aujourd'hui considérablement affaiblies, avec le statut inévitablement commercial du disque sur lequel figure la composition. L'opposition pourrait être frontale, une de ces valeurs premières étant justement le refus de la société marchande, mais on décèle au travers de différentes analyses de nombreuses stratégies pour cacher au mieux l'aspect commercial attelé au morceau. En effet, tout ce qui met une œuvre en situation contribue à son sens, et c'est pourquoi nous consacrons du temps à exposer certains aspects du mouvement acquis par un long travail de terrain et de nombreuses observations participantes : la présentation des valeurs de la free party ; son historique ; la manière dont est considéré Crystal Distortion par les acteurs du mouvement ; ainsi que le fait qu'il vende cette production sur CD (la plupart des productions étant normalement tirées uniquement sur vinyle car destinées au mix par des DJs). Puis nous passons à l'examen des éléments composant la jaquette du CD pour en arriver enfin à l'analyse interne de la production, en relation avec les précédentes strates de l'analyse. The purpose of this paper is to understand the musical meaning of a production of so-called underground techno music. Through the analysis of "Let's play" by Crystal Distortion, a famous artist from the free party trend (or underground techno trend), one examines the painful coexistence of the Utopian values of the movement, tremendously weakened today, with the unavoidable commercial status of the record in which the composition appears. The confrontation could be frontal, as one of these essential values precisely is the refusal of consumer society; but one de~<br>

Author(s): Durand Gilbert<br>
Abstract: La sociologie, née au XIXe siècle, fut trop contaminée par les métaphores biologiques ou mécanistes, alors que la psychologie, depuis Freud, constituait son objet spécifique. Jung, parachevant les topiques célèbres, leur ajoutait les couches profondes de l'Inconscient collectif. Dans le sillage de l'épistémè, et de ses logiques, de la fin du XX e siècle, la sociologie se doit à son tour d'élaborer sa topique propre, où le mythe se découvre comme l'uliime « implicant » (implicate), à partir duquel s'explicitent les rôles, les idéologies, les axiologies et les codes d'une société. Sociology, emerging in the XlXth century, was too contaminated by biological or mechanistic metaphors; psychology however, from Freud's time on, formed its own specific subject. Jung, in amplifying and perfecting the crucial topics, added to them the deep-seated strata of the Collective Unconscious. Following in the wake of epistemy and of its logic, sociology must in turn, by the end of the XXlh century, develop its own subject, in which myth is revealed as the ultimate « implicant » (implicator), on the basis of which the roles, ideologies, axiologies and codes of a society are expounded.<br>

Author(s): Martuccelli Danilo<br>
Abstract: En partant de quelques transformations sodétales majeures, et en s'appuyant sur la fiction romanesque française, l'article dessine deux grandes constellations imaginaires de la mobilité dans la modernité. La première associe le but du déplacement, l'existence d'un ailleurs, le goût de l'aventure, l'attitude de départ actif et le rôle de la mobilité comme logique de pouvoir. La deuxième, souvent en résonance avec les items précédents, souligne plutôt l'exigence de la mobilité pour la mobilité, la fin de l'idée de dehors, l'impératif de la fuite, la prolifération de l'expérience du départ passif, enfin, la centralité croissante de la mobilité dans le saisissement de la domination. Au terme de ce parcours, l'imaginaire de la mobilité apparaît comme une boussole privilégiée pour cerner les transformations de la modernité. The article tracks two major imaginary constellations of modem mobility, through the analysis of important social transformations, illustrated by certain French novels. The first joins the goal of mobility, the existence of an « elsewhere » , the taste for adventure, an active departure, and the role of mobility as a logic of power. The second, frequently in relationship with the precedent, emphasizes the idea of mobility for itself, the end of elsewhere Utopia, the need to run away, the multiplication of experiences of passive departure, and finally the growing link between mobility and domination. The mobility imaginary appears at last as a privileged compass to surround the transformations of modernity.<br>

Abstract: My article contends that Dostoevsky's short novel, The Gambler, is marked by a fundamental conflict of temporalities. While the novel seems to embrace bourgeois optimism and the hopeful narrative temporality that serves as its most resourceful literary embodiment, it also seems to adhere to a strikingly anti-teleological and circular narrative structure. This affirmation and denial of temporality as linear, purposive movement is the appropriate narrative emblem of the peculiar world of Roulettenburg and its inhabitants, a world where beginning and end continually risk equivalence and where the parameters of structure have therefore begun to dissolve. What emerges is an acceptance of inevitable boredom, of permanent failure to resolve conflict, that is both constricting and liberating. As an artistic principle of form, this failure declares a "poetics" of hesitation whose temporal dimensions brilliantly reflect the fundamentally ambivalent eros of the gambler, the latter's inability to accept or escape from a debilitating presentness. In creating this kind of narrative conflict, Dostoevsky reverses the characteristic romantic obsession with the allure of pregnant immediacy that is an illusion of god-like vision to which only a most ungod-like being could succumb.<br>

Abstract: The essay discusses the passage from an ideological, patriotic and anti-fascist memory of the deportations and the extermination to what the author describes as the "ethnic" memory of the Shoah, which has played, and continues to play, a central role in constructing the European historical narrative as that narrative depicts the Jews as Europe's "other". Theoretical reflection on memory is intertwined with historical analysis of the period between 1945 until the end of the twentieth century. Two, binary perspectives are featured, one, which examines memory from a cognitive point of view and the other, which examines memory from a cultural, ideological, moral and political perspective. These perspectives come to the fore in memoire-literature, movies, plays, historiographie and philosophical debates, which illustrate the two perspectives and their articulation, as well as they justify the essay's periodization.<br>

Abstract: Early twentieth-century Viennese modernity, obsessed with identity in crisis, was especially preoccupied with the play between external appearances and internal dimensions of the self. This is the context for Alexander Zemlinsky's opera Der £ werg, which stages the tragic tale of an ugly, misshapen individual who does not recognize his own mirror image. The fatal end to his encounter with his reflection speaks to the devastating consequences of the limits of self-knowledge. While multiple conceptions of recognition— ranging from self-identity to the need for acknowledgement by others— have become increasingly prominent in recent literary, philosophical, and political discourses, theories of recognition have rarely played a role in the interpretation of operatic works. Here, the engagement with Zemlinsky's opera, and the Oscar Wilde text on which it is based, is framed and informed by the multivalent concept of recognition, which illuminates both the thematic and the structural workings of the music and libretto, while reflecting productively on the wider personal and political dimensions of their cultural contexts.<br>

Abstract: Three different concepts of the subject of sociology considera to be dominant in sociological thinking are discussed: the ,socia' as an external, as an internal, and as a serial structure. Comparing these concepts the notion of social structures seems to be dissolving: from a desubstantialization and desubjectivation to a destructuralization and detotalization of the ,social'. This raises the question of the end of sociology.<br>

Abstract: At the heart of this article is a structural approach to narrative, based on the work of Propp, Labov, van Dijk, Halliday, and others. The article highlights the structural features of narrative—basically, the organization of the genre around the semantic template actor-action-actor (syntactically rendered as subject-verb-object but where, in narrative, the subject is typically a social actor and the verb a social action) and the modifiers of each element of this triplet, such as time and space of action—and shows how to implement this structure in a computer environment and how to use this methodological tool in socio-historical research (namely, the rise of Italian fascism, 1919-22). But, taking a cue from Halliday's cover jacket of his An Introduction to Functional Grammar, with its representation of a color circle, the paper takes the reader on an intellectual journey from Newton to Goethe—and the quality versus quantity debate—to Goethe and Propp, to end, back home, with Simmel and Weber.<br>

Abstract: La démocratisation de l'enseignement supérieur en France a conduit, entre 1960 et 1970, à un vif développement des corps d'assistants et de maîtres-assistants, situations universitaires auxiliaires. Après 1968 et le vote de la loi Faure permettant la constitution d'universités autonomes, les statuts des personnels ont fréquemment évolué. Ces modifications résultent à la fois de conflits sociaux, par exemple autour de la situation des assistants ou des vacataires entre 1968 et 1983 ; de conceptions variées, voire opposées, des politiques universitaires ; des changements dans les pratiques professionnelles amenant à aborder de nouvelles questions. On analyse ici les rapports, les réformes et contre-réformes, et les compromis autour desquels se sont bâtis les dispositifs actuels. Sur une cinquantaine d'années, de 1960 à nos jours, les tendances majeures, autour desquelles la gauche et la droite politiques ont fini par converger, sont : la simplification de la typologie des corps universitaires en deux grandes catégories, l'articulation de plus en forte avec les études doctorales qui ont suivi des évolutions liées à celles des statuts, l'importance de la tension entre l'autonomie de chaque universitaire et celle de chaque université. On retrouve, à travers le dernier point, des débats importants au moment des grandes lois universitaires de la fin du XIXe siècle. The democratisation of the student population in France in the 1960s led to a quick growth of two groups: the assistant professors and the newly created associate professors. After the bill prepared by Edgar Faure was passed in 1968, thus paving the way to the constitution of autonomous universities, the statutes of the academics changed quite often. The modifications used to result both from struggles by academics, for instance about the job security of assistant professors and of part-time lecturers between 1968 and 1983, from diverging conceptions of academic policies and from changes in actual work practices~<br>

Abstract: Entrepris depuis un quart de siècle, le démantèlement de l'industrie lourde lorraine (mines et sidérurgie) touche à sa fin. À partir de la comparaison entre le dernier événement en date, la fermeture spectaculaire de la dernière mine de charbon, et la mise en scène, une décennie plus tôt, de la dernière coulée d'une usine de la Lorraine sidérurgique, l'auteur s'interroge sur les finalités patrimoniales de telles célébrations. Présentant quelques moments du traitement culturel — patrimonial, mémoriel... — de la crise industrielle lorraine, depuis les symptômes photographiques d'une mémoire empêchée jusqu'au musée très « contrôlé » en passant par la monumentalisation controversée de restes industriels, il met l'accent sur la lutte des représentations qui se noue autour de la construction de la « Lorraine industrielle » en objet-frontière patrimonial. Cet article souhaite ainsi contribuer à une anthropologie politique de l'institution de la mémoire. The dismantling of the heavy industry in Lorraine that is under way since a quarter of century (mines and iron and steel industry) is nearing its end. When comparing the latest event — the spectacular closure of the last coalmine — with the staging of the last casting in an iron and steel factory of Lorraine ten years earlier the author questions about the patrimonial aims of such celebrations. He shows some sequences of the cultural treatment (patrimonial, memorial) of the industrial crisis in Lorraine, from the photographic « symptoms » of a hindered memory to the highly « controlled » museum and to the industrial remains turned into historic buildings, a largely controversial fact. In this context he stresses the conflicting representations of « industrial Lorraine » as a patrimonial Boundary Object (abstract or concrete, that several actors can appropriate as they like). This article is meant to contribute to a political anthropology of memory institution. Die Zerschlagung der lothringischen Schwerindustrie (Bergwerken ~<br>

Abstract: The essay discusses the different facets of liminality and mnemonic in Ralf Rothmann's novels Stier (1991), Wäldernacht (1994), Milch und Kohle (2000), and Junges Licht (2004). From this perspective, Rothmann's narrative prose belongs to a number of contemporary German novels which break with traditional concepts of cultural thresholds: above and beyond this performance, the retrospective coupling of individual 'Ruhr' biographies and shared German history is the object of literary reflection. Rothmann's novels raise the issue of the special mnemotic gestures and historical semantics which are associated with the 'Ruhr-Gebiet' as a catalyst of liminality. Besides, the literary historical connections to metaphors of mining are central for Rothmann's prose. They can be given profile by discussing the ethnological and anthropological theories of Arnold van Gennep and Victor Turner. In the end the fiction of liminality and the mnemonic techniques emerge as a highly ambivalent code for the expression of social transformation.<br>

Abstract: Inquiry-based teacher education promotes an exploration of concrete particulars as the route to wise practice. The case study presented illustrates one teacher candidate's struggle to let go of a conception of knowledge as generalizable formulae that can be readily applied in practice and to become more open to practice itself as a site of learning. Teacher educators can nurture such openness by helping aspiring teachers to appreciate the fragility of knowledge, the epistemological value of feeling, and the priority of the particular, in teaching. In so doing, educators recover practical wisdom as the beginning and end-in-view of teacher education. /// La formation à l'enseignement axée sur la recherche favorise la prise en compte des conditions particulières et, de ce fait, une pratique éclairée. L'étude de cas présentée dans cet article illustre les efforts d'une candidate à l'enseignement en vue de se départir d'une conception de la connaissance définie comme une formule généralisable, facilement applicable dans la pratique, et de mieux accueillir la pratique elle-même comme un lieu d'apprentissage. Les responsables de la formation à l'enseignement peuvent contribuer à cette ouverture en aidant les futurs enseignants à saisir la fragilité de la connaissance, la valeur épistémologique des sentiments et l'importance des conditions particulières dans l'enseignement. Ce faisant, les éducateurs redécouvrent la sagesse comme le début et l'objectif à atteindre dans la formation à l'enseignement.<br>

Abstract: As the twentieth century comes to an end, and with it a millennium, there has been much heated reflection on the passing age and the period of transition. Among the many characteristic phenomena of modern times, globalization has attracted particularly much attention. The process of European integration may be traced back to ancient times (vide Roman imperialism or Carolingian universalism). Recently, however, globalization has expanded and it has accelerated considerably. The author of this paper focuses on the current, paradoxical coexistence of global tendencies toward integration on the one hand and very clearly manifested, diversifying (or even separatists) national and nationalist tendencies on the other hand. The author analyzes these homogenizing tendencies at the level of media pop culture on the one hand and the increasing, even acute, awareness of diversity, including the diversity of national cultures, on the other hand. She does so within the framework of the symbolic culture concept. Contemporarily, tendencies toward globalization are suspended between the Scylla of uniformizatdon and the Charybdis of diversity. Sociology is particularly qualified to study these phenomena, at both local and universal levels.<br>

Abstract: In the last decades, witness to the Shoa has taken on various forms, from story-telling, to trial depositions and evidence collection, from negotiations for compensations, to "second-generation" accounts. Over the years, what used to be a first-hand narrative, the story of what had been actually seen and felt, has become the account of what have been heard. Since witness to the Shoa, in its various forms, has come to be considered as fundamental "evidence" of the tragedy, second-hands accounts may prove fragile documents to this end. What, therefore, are witness narratives? Are they merely legal documents? How do they stand as historical documents? Will Shoa narratives still have a future while witnesses slowly dwindle and disappear?<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i40059451<br>
Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Baumgartner Frédérique<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on Gina Pane's performance Escalade non anesthésiée (1971), which consisted of the artist mounting a ladder studded with sharp metallic shards, causing injury to herself in the process. Previous art historians have read Pane's performances through a psychoanalytic lens, emphasizing the place of Lacanian thought in the nascent French feminist movement of the 1970s. This article posits that psychoanalytic accounts of Pane's work have neglected the political context of the work's execution and reception. Pane specifically referenced the Vietnam War when she described her intention with Escalade non anesthésiée. Accordingly, this article links her performance to art sociologique - a term applied to a range of politicized works produced in Paris in the wake of the May 68 events - and thereby to the politics of the Internationale Situationniste. Stressing the importance of the concept of alienation in the discourse of the 1970s and in Pane's writings, this article argues that the masochistic elements of her performance were an attempt to end collective passivity. This collective de-anesthetization was carried out by Pane through the photo-documentation of her performance, in which she staged the image of a non-specific rather than individual body.<br>

Abstract: En la primera parte de este texto su autor discute algunos aspectos de la propuesta de Lucien Jaume (véase el resumen del artículo anterior), centrándose especialmente en la distinción entre «conceptos filosóficos» y «conceptos políticos», una dicotomía que le parece difícilmente sostenible, en la medida en que considera inaceptable toda «semántica trascendental» al margen de la historia. Más adelante, se propone una reflexión sobre el uso de los conceptos y discursos en el debate político, enfatizando su contingencia y contestabilidad constitutivas, y, en consecuencia, la imposibilidad de fijar cualquier clase de definición aséptica y normativa de los mismos (ni siquiera por parte de los autores históricos que se sirven de tales recursos argumentativos). Por último, apoyándose —entre otros— en la obra de Koselleck y Gadamer, efectúa el autor una serie de consideraciones críticas acerca de la arrogancia presentista de un sector de la historiografía, para terminar subrayando la radical historicidad de todo conocimiento (incluyendo nuestras propias interpretaciones históricas). In the first part of this text, the author discusses some aspects of Lucien Jaume's proposal (see the abstract of the previous article), focussing especially on the distinction between «philosophical concepts» and «political concepts», a dichotomy that to him seems hardly sustainable. Furthermore, a reflection is proposed on the use of the concepts and discourses in the political debate, emphasizing its constitutive contingency and contestability, and, in consequence, the inability to fix any class of aseptic and normative definition of them (not even by of the historical actors who used such arguments). Finally, resting -between others— on the work of Koselleck and Gadamer, the author carries out a series of critical considerations about the «arrogance presentist» of a sector of the historiography, to end up by underlining the radical historicity of all knowledge (including our own historical ~<br>

Abstract: Taking seriously Linda Martin Alcoff s suggestion that we reevaluate the extent to which poststructuralist artkuhtions of the subject are truly socially constituted, as well as the centrality of Latina identity to her own account of such constitution, I argue that the discussion Alcoff and other Latina feminists offer of the experience of being Latina in North America is illustrative of the extent to which the refotional and globally situated constitution of subjects needs further development in many social-constructionist accounts of selfhood. I argue, however — contra Alcoff — that Michel Foucault I s mode of investigating subjectivation, particularly as it is articulated in his later work, has room for just such an account, especially when it is supplemented by postcohnial theory. With this end in mind, I take as a case study the public discourse surrounding Sonia Sotomayor prior to her confirmation as the first Latina woman to serve on the United States Supreme Court, suggesting that an analysis of this discourse (including its position within and contribution to wider discourses of ethnicity, race, gender, and chss) shows why the accounts of relational subject-constitution offered by both Foucault and Alcoff are indispensable.<br>

Abstract: Los estudios sociales sobre alimentación y las autoridades responsables de este campo coinciden en resaltar la situación paradójica del comensal actual: se sabe cómo se debe comer pero no se come como se debe. Enfrentarse con éxito a las paradojas suele requerir un cierto distanciamiento —lingüístico y disciplinar— que ofrezca la suficiente perspectiva. Aquí se propone hacerlo desde la perspectiva histórica que una sociología de la utopía puede aportar al conflicto entre imaginarios alimentarios. Para ello, este artículo revisará los elementos comunes del pensamiento utópico/distópico en orden a extraer las categorías de mayor interés para un análisis sociológico de las políticas y comportamientos alimentarios. Después, recorreremos los modos en que algunas de las utopías clásicas han enfocado —o desenfocado— la cuestión de la comida e intentaremos sacar algunas conclusiones. Social studies on food and nutritional authorities coincide in emphasizing the paradoxical situation of the modern eater: people know how they should eat but do not eat as they should. Dealing with paradoxes successfully usually requires a certain —linguistic and disciplinary— distance to gain sufficient perspective. We suggest this should be done from the historical perspective that a sociology of utopia offers on the conflict between food imaginaries. To this end, we outline the common elements of utopian/dystopian thought in order to extract the categories of major interest for a sociological analysis of food policies and eating behaviours. Subsequently, we trace the ways in which some classical utopias and dystopias have focused on —or blurred— the question of food and we try to draw some conclusions.<br>

Abstract: This essay treats Carole Maso's novel Defiance as an instance of feminist "anti-narrative." Toward this end, it considers the novel's use of direct address, its formal and thematic silences, and its parody of narrative convention. It reflects on the lack of scholarship on the novel and situates it in the context of Maso's nonfiction to argue that it might be understood as a piece of feminist narratology.<br>

Abstract: This study argues that the exponential growth of divinatory texts variously attributed to ᶜAlī and Jaᶜfar al-Ṣādiq included at the end of Qur'ans produced during the Ṣafavid period provides further evidence for the widespread interest in divination during the tenth/sixteenth and eleventh/seventeenth centuries in Iran. Treatises on 'divination by the Qur'an' (fāl-i Qur'ān) indicate that it was considered permissible to seek guidance by means of holy scripture at this time. On a more symbolic level, fāl-i Qur'āns can be understood as a kind of restoration of the 'defective' ᶜUthmānic codex by re-Shïᶜifying it-if not by reinserting supposedly dropped verses on the ahi al-bayt, then at the very least by adding terminal divinations attributed to the figureheads of Shīᶜī Islam. This particular practice therefore follows general 'Shīᶜification' trends found in a number of cultural and artistic practices of the Ṣafavid period, which also are potentially discernible within the domain of Qur'an production. هذه الدراسة تذهب إلى أن النمو الهائل من النصوص التي تتنبأ بالمستقبل والمنسوبة بأشكال مختلفة لعلي وجعفر الصادق والملحقة بنهاية المصاحف التي أنتجت ﺧﻼﻝ الفترة الصفوية تقدم مزيداﹰ من اﻷدلة على اﻻهتمام واسع النطاق بالعراﻓﺔ في ايران ﺧﻼﻝ القرون / العاشر والحادي عشر السادس عشر / السابع عشر . وتشير المصنفات في الفأل بالقرآن إلى أنه ﺧﻼﻝ تلك الحقبة كان التماس التوجيه من الكتاب المقدس يعتبر أمرا جائزاﹰ. على مستوى أكثر رمزية، فإن فأل القرآن يمكن أن يفهم على أنه معالجة للمصحف العثماني بإعادة " تشييعه " وهذا وإن لم يكن من ﺧﻼﻝ إعادة آيات تتعلق بآل البيت يدعى أنها مسقطة من اﻷصل، فعلى اﻷقل من ﺧﻼﻝ زيادة تنبؤات في آخر المصحف بعد النص القرآني منسوبة لرموز الشيعة. لهذا فإن هذا العمل يتبع توجهات " تشييع " وجدت في عدد من الممارسات الثقافية والفنية في العصر الصفوي يمكن أيضاﹰ ﻣﻼحظتها في إطار إنتاج المصاحف .<br>

Abstract: Dans un contexte d'utilisation croissante des comparaisons internationales par les instances politiques à des fins de pilotage des systèmes éducatifs, par le biais notamment de rétablissement de normes de compétences et donc d'évaluation en vue de l'introduction de réformes, cette contribution entend d'abord réitérer la nécessaire distinction, opérée par Max Weber dès 1922, entre l'entreprise scientifique et l'action politique, mais aussi et surtout rappeler le principe de séparation et de médiation dont relève la démarche comparative en éducation. Les concepts qui composent une langue, circulent et s'imposent dans un monde social renvoient à une histoire, à des usages dynamiques, et sont culturellement enracinés. Négliger cet ancrage social et culturel des mots expose à la construction de la comparabilité sur de seules équivalences fonctionnelles; bien que les pressions en ce sens soient fortes, c'est probablement le moyen le plus sûr de comparer l'incomparable (Marcel Détienne). La rationalité purement instrumentale qui favorise la diffusion de tels cadres ou schémas interprétatifs paraît en effet indifférente aux questions du sens et de la culture, outre qu'elle est irrationnelle sur le plan axiologique, si l'on suit Weber. L'étrangeté, si ce n'est l'altérité, tend à s'y effacer. On se demandera donc quels enjeux impose désormais au comparatiste l'illusion de la spontanéité de la traduction réduite à une équivalence fonctionnelle. Dans la responsabilité de médiation qui incombe au chercheur, c'est à un travail de clarification et d'intercompréhension (inspiré de Taylor) qu'invite la recherche, substituant à la standardisation des mots l'éclairage critique des variations semiotiques que génère leur usage. Governments are making increasing use of international comparisons as a tool to run and reform education systems, through the establishment of competency norms and assessment standards. In light of this trend, this paper wishes not only to reiterate the crucial d~<br>

Abstract: Can the act of creation itself be considered like an infinite forgiveness that God turns to the earth and to those who live there after having preferred the waters as his place of first existence? The conference "In the beginning it was the forgiveness" held in L'Aquila in the occasion of a pluriconfessional meeting, suggests some hypothesis starting even from some biblical episodes like: the universal deluge, the Amalek's remembering, Giuseppe and his brothers, Isaac's sacrifice, and furthermore with Moses' death, to end with the forgiveness from the original sin through the entrance in the promise land. A suggestive analysis of the forgiveness in the Hebraism, seen too often as a pure religion of the contraposition law to the forgiveness given from the religion of love. The forgiveness in this way is dealt with the inter-religious point of view, and also with the human one that in the relationship between God and man has its top and beginning in the solemnity of Kippur.<br>

Abstract: A community, in the same way as an individual, can follow as a normal way of behaviour — or as a wanted criteria for behaviour — for all future circumstances to decide discretionally, «case by case», or to define in a moment in time the rule (or a set of rules) that must be valid for the future. To define rules in a community has been indicated by some authors (Geoffrey Brennan and James M. Buchanan particularly) as a way to exit from a situation of a war of every man against every other man, as in the Hobbesian jungle, on one side, and from a situation dominated by a Leviathan on the other. This in a perspective where rules of a common living have been set through a social contract. The rules established through this contract would also form the criteria for a just conduct, in the end therefore for criteria of justice. The essay analyzes the situations and the conditions in which constraining oneself can be rational, even as it is not definible that in all circumstances constraining is more rational than not constraining oneself, that it is more desirable to have rules rather than discretionary decisions, the definition of ways of behaviour rather than the pre-definition of outcomes. As for what concerns the problem of justice, it is indicated how through a contractarian and constitutional procedure rules can be put by unanimous consent, but the problem of the foundation of the same rules remains unresolved. Rules do not seek truth, but only express values accepted by the counterparts in a certain moment in time, and have individuals as sources of these values.<br>

Abstract: C'est dans la Poétique d'Aristote que se trouve une méthode pour reconnaître le mal en politique. Ce que livre la « reconnaissance » issue de la réflexion poétique tient déjà à trois choses : le temps que prend le travail d'un aveu de soi à soi; la posture rhétorique double de délégation-consolation et de dévoilement plénier ; le joint du mal personnel et du mal public. Cette poétique est au cœur du phénomène de réconciliation en Afrique du Sud après la fin de l'apartheid, dans les travaux de la Commission Vérité et Réconciliation : une poétique de la réconciliation. It is in the Poetics of Aristotle that can be found a method for recognizing evil in politics. The "recognition" that is furnished by poetic reflection stems from three things: the time taken by the process of confession from self to self; the double rhetorical posture of delegation-consolation and complete exposure; the conjunction of personal evil and public evil. That poetic is at the heart of the phenomenon of reconciliation in South Africa after the end of apartheid, in the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission: a poetic of reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: The word "end" was not written by Hugo at the end of Toilers of the Sea; this is because his ending, within the precise delimitations suggested here, does not need it, and might even be spoilt by the word. Indeed, it leads narrative desire and characters to an end which, as in music, resonates with the past reading — while at the same time it metaphorises both the act of writing and the act of reading as it comes to its last words.<br>

Abstract: En explicitant le concept linguistique de prédicat et en étendant sa portée, l'auteur introduit et définit celui de « prédicat somatique », responsable de l'expression du sensible dans le langage. Il en illustre la pertinence et en spécifie le contenu analytique à travers trois exemples. La reprise critique de l'analyse du « sein nu » dans Palomar d'I. Calvino par A. J. Greimas (dans De l'imperfection) permet de dégager les propriétés du « corps percevant ». L'analyse d'un énoncé de la mère de Jamel Debbouze dans Télérama fait ressortir l'expression corporelle d'une vérité « refoulée, proscrite, par le langage », un « ça » vrai, expression d'un non-sujet immanent. Enfin, la relation fondamentale entre « l'acte politique » et « le corps parlant » est dégagée à partir de positions exprimées par Jean-Claude Milner et ici analysées dans la perspective du « prédicat somatique », dont trois variétés se trouvent ainsi dégagées au terme de l'article. Developing and extending the validity of the linguistic concept of predicate, the author introduces and defines the notion of "somatic predicate", responsible for expressing in language the experience of the senses. Three examples both show the notion's pertinence and specify its content. A critical reappraisal of A. J. Greimas' analysis of the « naked breast » in Italo Calvino's Palomar (in De l'imperfection) leads to defining me characteristics of the « perceiving body ». The analysis of an utterance of Jamel Debbouze's mother in Télérama stresses the physical, bodily expression of a truth "repressed, prohibited, by language", a true "id", the expression of an immanent non-subject. Finally, the fundamental relation between the "political act" and the "speaking body" is shown through opinions expressed by Jean-Claude Milner which are here analysed from the perspective of a "somatic predicate", three varieties of which have thus been described and defined by the end of the article.<br>

Abstract: This paper raises the question whether language and violence are internally connected. It starts from the experience of violence and from its theoretical interpretation as violence in the context of political forms of life which are challenged by complaints about violence. Such forms of life have to confront this issue because they are supposed to be responsive to claims and demands of others who articulate violence as an experience of violation. Whether a kind of responsive ethos may be based on the suspected inner connection between language and violence is being discussed at the end.<br>

Author(s): Zamyatin Peter G.<br>
Abstract: This article examines the interplay of dystopian and utopian themes in Terry Bisson's "Pirates of the Universe," utilizing Tom Moylan's concept of "critical dystopia." In the novel, Bisson maps out a number of discontinuous dystopias in a near-future US marked by rampant capitalist enterprise, out-of-control bio-technology, ecological decay, and a weak central state. These dystopias generally produce citizens with fragmented personal experiences, disinterest in social issues, and limited aspirations. Towards the end of the novel, when free and clean energy becomes available to all, Bisson explores continuing dystopian trends, articulates utopian possibilities, and emphasizes the importance of individual and collective imagination for choosing among alternatives.<br>

Abstract: An attempt is made to suggest an alternative approach to certain of the problems central to transcendental philosophy. In particular, it seems that the present understanding of pre-reflective awareness, of reflection, and of their interrelation can acquire a greater degree of rigour and clarity. To this end, attention is paid to preconditions of reference that are entailed by the phenomenological distinction between implicit experience and explicit reflection. L'auteur propose un accès alternatif à certains problèmes centraux de la philosophie transcendentale. En particulier, il paraît que la compréhension des idées de conscience préréflexive, de réflexion, et de Jeurs relations mutuelles, peut être précisée et élucidée. A cet effet, l'attention est attirée sur les préconditions de référence qui sont impliquées par la distinction phénoménologique entre l'expérience implicite et la réflexion explicite. Der Autor versucht, eine alternative Untersuchungsmethode zu bestimmten Hauptproblemen der transzendentalen Philosophie darzustellen. Insbesondere könnte das gegenwärtige Verständnis der vorreflexiven Bewusstheit, der Reflexion, und ihres Zusammenhangs strenger aufgeklärt werden. Zu diesem Zweck wird Aufmerksamkeit auf die Beziehungsvorbedingungen gerichtet, die in der phänomenologischen Unterscheidung zwischen impliziter Erfahrung und expliziter Reflexion miteinbegriffen sind.<br>

Abstract: Deux tendances radicalement différentes semblent se partager la production historiographique médiévale. L'une, inaugurée par l'Histoire ecclésiastique d'Eusèbe et dominée par les réflexions que lui a consacrées saint Augustin (et de loin la plus importante), s'attache à retracer le destin des hommes appelés à se rassembler au sein de l'Église afin d'être portés vers un avenir qui doit leur permettre de sortir de l'histoire et de se retrouver à la fin des temps au sein de la Cité de Dieu. L'autre, renouant avec la tradition antique rejetée par l'historiographie chrétienne, se consacre à une communauté définie qu'elle pourvoit d'une origine et d'un passé qui fondent son identité et son existence présente, mais qui semblent en même temps constamment menacées par la fiction. Après avoir rappelé le point de vue de saint Augustin, et afin de mettre en lumière cette double orientation, cette étude s'appuie principalement sur l'historiographie des îles britanniques : à l'Histoire ecclésiastique du peuple anglais de Bède répond en effet l'Histoire des rois de Bretagne de Geoffroy de Monmouth. La critique adressée à ce dernier par Guillaume de Newburgh au seuil de son Histoire des choses anglaises, s'en prenant au caractère fictif des événements attribués au roi Arthur et aux prophéties de Merlin, éclaire de manière exemplaire le sens de l'opposition entre une histoire devant aboutir au ciel et celle qui trouve son assise sur la terre. Two conceptions, radically different, seem to share the medieval historiography. The first (and far most important) one, initiated by Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History and dominated by the reflections saint Augustine has devoted to it, recalls the destiny of human beings who should put themselves together under the conduct of the Church, in the expectation of a future which will allow them to get out of History and find themselves at the End of Times inside the City of God. The other one, linked to the tradition produced in Antiquity but rejecte~<br>

Abstract: Afin de justifier l'élaboration et l'usage d'une phénoménologie de l'imagination poétique, on montrera comment le langage poétique permet selon le mot de P. Ricoeur « d'articuler une expérience fictive » en dégageant l'« illusion » qui s'attache à la lecture de l'objet poétique. Avec Bachelard on verra comment l'image poétique apparaît comme une aurore de parole et un être nouveau. On verra comment le phénoménologue n'oublie jamais que l'expérience poétique situe le poème dans « le pays de la vérité » et s'efforce de le saisir comme essence, Wesenschau. Mais comme d'autre part une illusion fondamentale s'attache à la lecture de l'œuvre poétique, on évoquera la pensée de Nietzsche qui se déploie dans le jeu de l'illusion et de la vérité. L'artiste est cet illusionniste sublime qui nous fait sentir comme réel le monde des phénomènes. On terminera par une définition du poète comme celui qui nomme et par sa nomination fait être, fait l'Être apparaissant et transparent. To justify a phenomenology of poetic imagination we show how through poetical language a fictitious experience can be articulated, as says P. Ricoeur, by sifting out the « illusion » which pertains to the reading of the poetical object. According to Bachelard poetical image appears as a dawn of words and a new being. The phenomenologist never forgets that according to poetical experience a poem dwells in the « land of truth » and should be grasped as an essence, « Wesenschau ». But, as a fundamental illusion clings to the reading of a poetical work, we shall remember Nietzsche whose thought dwells in the play of illusion and truth. Thanks to the artist as a sublime conjurer we feel real the world of phenomena. To end, a poet is someone who names and, by doing so, makes being appearing and transparent.<br>

Abstract: L'ontologie heideggérienne de l'être-pour-la-mort a souvent servi de référence négative à Paul Ricoeur. Il lui a très tôt opposé trois thèses qu'il n'aurait peut-être pas formulées s'il n'avait pas croisé la philosophie de Jaspers: a) « La naissance signifie plus que la mort » ; b) « la rencontre décisive avec la mort est la mort de l'être aimé » ; c) « la mortalité elle-même doit être pensée sub specie vitae et non sub specie mortis ». La première thèse conditionne les deux suivantes. Elle introduit une phénoménologie de l' « être-envie » qui en appelle de la vie reçue à la vie transmise. On objectera peut-être que la phénoménologie de l'être-en-vie suppose l'ontologie de l'être-pour-la-mort. Mais, même si c'était le cas, elle n'en transformerait pas moins profondément la signification. La compréhension de l'existence est affectée elle-même par les phénomènes de la vie reçue et transmise. C'est ce que veut dire cette expression: « exister vivant ». L'angoisse de la fin n'annule pas la joie des commencements. Peut-être même reçoit-elle de celle-ci son sens. Paul Ricoeur has often referred to Heidegger's ontology of being-towards-death to oppose it. He early set against it three thesis that he might have formulated differently had he not studied Jasper's philosophy : a) « birth means more than death » ; b) « the decisive encounter with death is the death of the loved one » ; c) « mortality itself must be thought sub specie vitae, not sub specie mortis ». From the first thesis, can be inferred the two others. It brings in a phenomenology of being-alive. One may raise the objection that the phenomenology of being-alive presupposes the ontology of being-towards-death. But even so it would be necessarily transform its meaning. The understanding of existence is itself affected by the phenomena of life as given and received. Such is the meaning of the phrase: « existing alive ». The distress of the end never cancels the joy of the beginnings. It may even get its sense from~<br>

Abstract: Cet article offre une vision globale de l'œuvre de Ricœur, l'auteur proposant d'y lire une logique de développement en spirale, parce que dans les ouvrages les plus tardifs du philosophe nous trouvons un retour de la recherche sur la volonté — inscrite dans le cadre d'une anthropologie philosophique — qui avait inspiré son projet de jeunesse. Mouvement en spirale, et non retour circulaire aux origines, car entre le début et la fin il n'y a pas coïncidence mais enrichissement après un long détour à travers l'univers du langage. Ce détour — selon l'hypothèse de travail de l'auteur — progresse à travers trois paradigmes: symbole, texte et traduction. Dans la traduction travaillent le propre et l'étranger, le soi et l'autre, l'autre que nous retrouvons en nous et qui ne se réduit pas à l'altérité de l'autre homme. Un concept pluriel d'humanité — qui est pourtant une — y est à l'oeuvre. Le travail jamais accompli de la traduction suggère enfin l'idée d'une herméneutique de l'inachèvement. This article offers a global vision of Ricœur's work, in which the author suggests the existence of a spiral development, insofar as in the most recent works we find a return to the same research on the will — within the context of a philosophical anthropology — that inspired the project of Ricœur's youthful years. Spiral movement and not circular return to the origin, because the beginning and the end do not coincide but rather enrich one another, after a long detour of many decades through the universe of language. This detour — according to author's working hypothesis — has progressively developed through three paradigms: symbol, text and translation. In translation, what is at work is the familiar and the foreign, the self and the other, the other that we find in ourselves and that cannot be reduced to the otherness of the other man. In translation we find a plural concept of humanity, which is nevertheless one. The never complete work of translation suggests ultimately the idea of ~<br>

Abstract: Objectivistic philosophy and reductionist theories have contributed to a malaise in society and the church. On the one hand, the fruits of modernity and deconstructive postmodernism have led to a situtation where the observable and the empirical are considered the true index of reality. There is a loss of purpose and meaning in life. The church finds itself in a situation of crisis, and needs to admit its own shortcomings in order to be a leaven for society. At the same time, there is an 'outbreak' of interest in issues of spirituality and mysticism throughout the world as the end of the millennium draws near. Mysticism, particularly scriptural mysticism, is an ecclesial charism, and when understood and appropriated can be a source of renewal for the church and society.<br>

Abstract: This contribution looks at the issue of how to present history by taking a look at one of the most cited countries for exemplifying a multicultural society. The author adopts a careful, even critical, stance when it comes to the pluralistic discourse and illustrates how, in the case of Canada, the problem of deciding whether to opt for a blanket discourse (a one-sided view of a country, stretching from one ocean to the next) or an atomising approach (allowing for as many historical interpretations as there are views) does not arise. The focus is more on establishing a factual as well as narrative discourse which allows for a representation of Canada in all its dissonances, changing equilibria, and stormy interdependence.The term "canadianité" would seem fitting, since it refers to the essence of how Canada has formed an historical identity. It could promote a way of relating history which offers an escape from the ostensibly dead-end situations found in the great narratives of Canada which are currently dominating our collective imaginations. Der Autor dieses Aufsatzes geht auf die Frage der Geschichtsschreibung in einem der als Beispiel für eine multikulturelle Gesellschaft meist zitierten Staaten ein. Er nimmt eine behutsame, ja kritische Position gegenüber dem pluralistischen Diskurs ein und zeigt auf, dass im Falle Kanadas das Dilemma nicht in der Entscheidung für einen unitaristischen Diskurs (einheitliche Sicht des Landes von einem Ozean zum anderen) oder einen atomisierenden (so viele Geschichten des Landes wie Sichtweisen) besteht. Vielmehr geht es darum, eine histori(ographi) sche Artikulationsebene faktischer und narrativer Art zu finden, die die Konzeptualisierung und Repräsentation Kanadas in all seinen Dissonanzen, wechselnden Gleichgewichten, stürmischen Interdependenzen ermöglicht. Hierzu könnte der Begriff der „ canadianité" beitragen, der auf den Kern der historischen Identitätsbildung Kanadas verweist. Er könnte Träger einer Geschichtserzählung sei~<br>

Abstract: This study, based largely on unpublished material, is an attempt to describe and evaluate how French Protestantism dealt with the German question in the postwar period. A short description of the perception of Germany by French Protestants towards the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century underlines the new approach which characterized the relations between French and German Protestants after the Second World War. In spite of the shattering defeat of the Third Reich, Germany remained in the eyes of many French Protestants a dreadful danger. However, already shortly after the war, some clergymen and laymen, many of whom had been involved in the resistance against the nazi regime, believed that their mission was to act as mediators and peacemakers despite the official hard-line diplomacy of their country. This article provides a selection of quotations of French Protestants' intentions and conceptions regarding the German question, as well as examining the ways and means they thought best to prevent Germany from becoming a new danger to France and Europe. It shows how seriously they debated all aspects of a common future with yesterday's enemy in a Europe of tomorrow, and affords an insight into how some Protestant personalities on both sides of the Rhine played an important role in the process of Franco-German reconciliation during the postwar period.<br>

Abstract: Le calcul économique, dans sa forme la plus connue, celle de l'analyse coûts/avantages, est depuis quelques années confronté à de multiples remises en cause. Considéré comme technocratique, partiel, voire partial, il est de plus en plus cantonné au rôle de composante parmi d'autres de l'aide à la décision publique. Le développement, dans le Royaume-Uni d'une nouvelle approche, multicritère, de l'évaluation des grands projets d'infrastructure de transport va-t-il sonner le glas du calcul économique ? Nous ne le pensons pas. Nous défendons au contraire la thèse selon laquelle il peut retrouver un rôle important. Mais, pour cela, il est nécessaire de reconsidérer le processus des choix collectifs. Dans cette nouvelle perspective, loin de constituer un processus purement technocratique, le calcul économique, à la lumière des travaux de Keynes et Schumpeter sur le rôle de la prévision et des prix, peut s'inscrire dans une forme renouvelée de maïeutique des choix collectifs, même dans le champ controversé des infrastructures de transport. Economic calculation, and especially cost benefit analysis (Coba), is more and more criticised and accused to be technocratic and partial, leading to a narrow view of projects. An example of this loss of credibility is the New Approach To Appraisal (NATA), implemented in Great Britain at the end of the 90': a multicriteria analysis where Coba gives only one information among many others, quantitative and qualitative. Nevertheless we don't think that we are facing an unavoidable decline of economic calculation. This paper emphasises the important role that Coba can keep within the public decision process. If we remember Keyne's and Schumpeter's points of view about the roles of forecasting and prices, economic calculation could be useful to help the emergence of collective choices, even in the controversial field of transport infrastructures.<br>

Abstract: Dans le contexte des relations communautaires en Belgique, l'évocation des causes du passé est un poncif de l'analyse des tensions et des conflits qui émaillent régulièrement ces relations. L'application d'un cadre d'analyse de path dependence forgé par des travaux en sociologie historique permet de tester et de préciser l'idée selon laquelle le passé belge influe le présent conflictuel. Le recours à cet apport théorique a pour objet d'expliquer, en partant d'un cheminement historique initié à la fin du 19e siècle, les conflits récurrents et le modèle d'autonomie croissante qui caractérisent la vie politique belge. In the context of the communal relationships in Belgium, the evocation of the causes of the past is a common place in the analysis of the tensions and conflicts that mark out these relations. The adoption of a framework of analysis of path dependence elaborated in the field of historical sociology allows to test and precise the affirmation that Belgian past shapes the conflictual present. The recourse to this theoretical and methodological scaffold is intended to explain, by following the evolution of a historical trajectory initiated at the end of the nineteenth century, the regular conflicts and the model of increasing autonomy that characterize Belgian political scene.In the context of the communal relationships in Belgium, the evocation of the causes of the past is a common place in the analysis of the tensions and conflicts that mark out these relations.

Abstract: O plural e conflituoso entendimento da legitimação da pena no Direito, tem origem nas diversas intencionalidades que lhe conferem sentido. Neste artigo são analisadas as intencionalidades mais relevantes, destacando os seus modelos justificativos: retribuição, reparação, prevenção, expiação, reabilitação e restauração (precedidas pela vingança, extrajudiríca). Para melhor análise destes são também consideradas a variável da temporalidade (passado, presente, futuro) e a variável dos sujeitos, que protagonizam a dinâmica do castigo (infractor, víctima, Estado, sociedade). Depois, num momento comparativo, destacam-se criticamente as confluencias e as oposições. Assim será possível concluir que a intencionalidade restauradora e a sua firme relativização do castigo é aquela que melhor consegue articular as variáveis de sentido-com os seus valores-, a temporalidade e os sujeitos, pelo que se mostra ser a referência mais positiva para a legitimização. Contudo, dada a sua precaridade, devido ao seu surgimento recente, impõe-se reforçá-la reflexivamente e prácticamente. The plural and conflictual understanding of the legitimacy of penalty in law stems from diverse intentionalities that constitute their respective meanings. This article analyzes the most relevant intentionalities. It seeks to highlight the models that justifies them: retribution, reparation, prevention, atonement, rehabilitation and restoration (preceded by vengeance, extrajudirical). To better analyze these models, the variable of temporality (past, present, future) and the variable of the subjects are also considered in view of the fact that they operate in the dynamics of punishment (offender, victim, State, society). Then, establishing comparisons, the confluences and oppositions are critically highlighted. In order to conclude that the restorative intentionality and its strong relativization of punishment is the one who can best articulate the variables of meaning -with their values, involving temporalit~<br>

Abstract: Sob o pano de fundo da fenomenologia de Husserl acerca da ciência como conhecimento, os autores propōem uma análise da filosofia da percepção de Merleau-Ponty, em termos do que agora é referido como "estados da experimentação e da prática científica". Para este fim, é conceptualizada a pós-fenomenologia corno uma nova abordagem filosófica à tecnologia, examinando criticamente a análise da percepçāo de Merleau-Ponty. Posteriormente é apresentada uma concepçāo baseada no estudo das práticas em química, que exemplifica a crítica dos autores à necessidade, na teoria da percepção de Merleau-Ponty, da consideração dos mediadores tecnocientíficos. Como conclusão, tendo em conta as práticas tecnológicas e científicas, os autores defendem a utilidade do conceito de percepção na compreensão da geraçāo do conhecimento nas ciências experimentais e na tecnologia. Against the background of Husserl's phenomenology about science as knowledge, we propose an analysis of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy of perception in terms of what now is referred to as "studies of experimentation and scientific practices". To this end, we conceptualize post-phenomenology as a new philosophical approach to technology, and critically examine Merleau-Ponty's analysis of perception. We then present a conception based upon the study of practices in chemistry that substantiates our critique of the lack of consideration for technoscientific mediators in Merleau-Ponty's theory of perception. In conclusion, taking account of technological and scientific practices, we argue for the concept's usefulness in understanding knowledge generation in experimental sciences and technology.<br>

Abstract: This paper is an attempt to explore the continuing relevance of Nietzsche's genealogical analysis of Western rationality to the sociology of knowledge. While Nietzsche is often neglected in classical sociological theory textbooks, this paper argues that Nietzsche has a very significant contribution to sociological theory especially in the field of knowledge production. Recent sociologists are now acknowledging this tradition. Hence this paper discusses how the basic tenets of Nietzsche's critique of Western metaphysics and positivism can be harnessed to create a powerful critique of contemporary sociological understanding of knowledge construction and its legitimation in society. Some of these themes are discussed at the end of the paper especially in relation to Philippine sociology.<br>

Author(s): de Marco Alessandra<br>
Abstract: The present paper investigates Don DeLillo's 1972 End Zone, arguing that football is a metaphor for war and that DeLillo's analysis of football and its culture effectively constitutes a critique of the war mentality undergirding American society. In this novel DeLillo meditates on the historical process that historian Michael S. Sherry calls the "militarization" (xi) of the USA and that, since the 1930s, turned the country into a military and economic superpower allowing a war mentality to enter deep into the grain of American culture. The essay will read DeLillo's focus on language against Nicholas Abraham and Maria Torok's psychoanalytical theories on demetaphorization as the linguistic counterpart of melancholia and against Herbert Marcuse's notion of functional language as a linguistic behavior that facilitates the annihilation of critical thinking. Both functional language and demetaphorization allow militarization to enforce its own discourse. Suffering from melancholia, the novel's protagonists fall prey to incorporation, a process whereby they disavow death as the product of war and, with it, pain, suffering, and destruction. As a result, the novel offers a cautionary tale about the consequences arising from an excessive exaltation of war as a means through which a nation seeks to affirm its "apotheosis" (End Zone 162).<br>

Abstract: La « Fédé » (Fédération française des associations chrétiennes d'étudiants) sort renforcée de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale. Influencé depuis le début des années 30 par la théologie de Karl Barth, le mouvement se tourne davantage après 1945 vers le monde et les problèmes politiques. Les étudiants protestants s'insèrent aussi dans la vie associative universitaire et sont partie prenante du développement de l'UNEF. Dans ces cinq années qui suivent la guerre, on voit poindre un certain nombre de tensions entre la jeunesse « fédérative » et les instances religieuses adultes. At the end of second World War, the "Fède" (French Student Christian Federation) has grown stronger. Influenced since early thirties by Karl Barth's theology, the movement shows after 1945 more interest in world affairs and political problems. The protestant studients also get involved in the university's associative life and take part in the development of the student's trade union, the « UNEF ». During these five years following War some tensions become perceptible between the federative youth and the religious adults' organisations. Mit dem Ende des zweiten Weltkriegs ist die « Fédé » (der französische Verband der christlichen Studentenvereine) noch stärker geworden. Ab 1945 interessiert sich die seit dem Anfang der 30er fahre von K. Barths Theologie beeinfluβte Bewegung immer mehr für die Welt und deren politische Probleme. Die protestantischen Studenten beteiligen sich auch häufig an dem Vereinsleben der Universität und wirken aktiv bei der Entwicklung der UNEF mit. Während der ersten fünf fahre nach Kriegsende treten einige Spannungen zwischen einer fugend, die sich für diese christlichen Vereine interessiert, und den religiösen Behörden der Erwachsenen auf.<br>

Author(s): PAYEN Pascal<br>
Abstract: A l'intérieur du corpus des Vies parallèles de Plutarque, la Vie de Sertorius offretrois singularités : elle est la seule qui se déroule presque en totalité en Occident ; elle appartient au seul couple - Sertorius-Eumène — où le Romain est placé en premier ; le récit ne couvre pas la durée d'une vie, mais isole dix années (83/2 à 73 av. J.-C). Comment rendre compte ensemble de ces trois données situées sur des plans différents ? Les Vies parallèles délimitent un espace qui, à la fin du Ier siècle et au début du IIe, correspond au monde dominé par Rome, devenue garante et protectrice d'une histoire commune. Or autant l'Orient a reçu l'empreinte dts Grecs et des Romains, autant l'Occident est resté à l'écart. Ainsi formulera-t-on l'hypothèse que le sujet principal de cette Vie, tout autant que le personnage même de Sertorius, est l'Espagne, ou plus exactement l'extrême Occident, qui fait écho à l'extrême Orient, aussi bien à l'intérieur du récit (avec l'épisode de la troisième guerre de Mithridate) qu'au sein de l'ensemble des Vies. L'objet de cette étude est donc d'étudier en quoi une source grecque, postérieure de deux siècles aux événements qu'elle rapporte, témoigne de la place et de la fonction de l'extrême Occident dans la Méditerranée gréco-romaine, et, en cela, de mettre au jour quelques-unes des contraintes que pose, en tant que source, la Vie de Sertorius pour l'étude de l'Hispanie de la fin de la République. Within the corpus of Plutarch's Parallel Lives, the Life of Sertorius presents three peculiarities: it is the only one to take place almost entirely in the West; it belongs to the only couple -Sertorius-Eumenes- in which the Roman is given precedence; the narrative does not cover a whole lifetime but isolates ten years (83/2 to 73 BC). How then take together and account for those three facts situated at different levels ? The Parallel Lives delimits a space which, by the end of the 1st century and the beginning of the second, corresponds to a world unde~<br>

Abstract: La revue Christianisme social (1896-1971) était l'organe de la Fédération française du Christianisme social, mouvement protestant d'action sociale orienté vers un socialisme chrétien. De 1954 à 1962, elle a vigoureusement pris parti contre la poursuite de la guerre d'Algérie et pour le rétablissement de la paix au moyen d'une négociation avec le F.L.N. Elle a joué le rôle d'une avant-garde par rapport à l'opinion publique protestante, mais sans oser se transformer en parti de la gauche protestante afin de sauvegarder son unité. Son engagement combinait des motivations fondamentalement morales et spirituelles (refus de la torture pratiquée par la police et l'armée françaises) et une analyse politique attribuant au colonialisme français la responsabilité du conflit. Rejetant le principe révolutionnaire du « la fin justifie les moyens », ses rédacteurs appartenaient aux catégories d'opposants à la guerre que Pierre Vidal-Naquet a qualifiés de « dreyfusards » et de « tiers-mondistes ». Mais une étude historique rétrospective doit constater que l'objectivité de leur vision de la guerre d'Algérie a été en partie biaisée par leur parti-pris. Christianisme social (1896-1971) was the main press organ for the Fédération française du Christianisme social, a protestant social action movement leaning toward Christian socialism. From 1954 to 1962, this magazine strongly condemned the pursuit of the Algerian war and called for establishing peace by negociating with the F.L.N. It played an avant garde role for Protestant public opinion without daring setting itself up as the Protestant left party in order to maintain its' unity. This magazines mission combined basically moral and spiritual motivations (refusing torture practised by the French police and army) and a political analysis placing responsability for the conflict on French colonialism. Having rejected the revolutionary principle "The end justifies the means", its' writers belonged to the war opponents that Pierre Vidal-Na~<br>

Abstract: Desde una perspectiva relacional y a partir de la información contenida en la correspondencia epistolar, este artículo estudia las prácticas mercantiles de los mercaderes vascos establecidos en Buenos Aires durante el período de guerras internacionales de finales del siglo XVIII. Tomando como mirador la Casa de comercio de don Martín de Álzaga, se explorar algunos de los mecanismos que articulaban la integración de los circuitos mercantiles rioplatenses en el sistema de la economía colonial. Entre ellos, las gestiones concretas llevadas a cabo por los «agentes de enlace» organizados por el jefe de la Casa dentro de una conformación familiar de la empresa. A partir d'une analyse en termes de réseaux sociaux et à partir des informations recueillies dans la correspondance, ce travail étudie les pratiques commerciales des commerçants basques installés à Buenos Aires durant la période des guerres internationales de la fin du XVIIIe siècle. Choisissant comme point d'observation la maison de commerce de don Martín de Álzaga il explore quelques-uns des mécanismes qui assuraient l'articulation des circuits commerciaux du Rio de la Plata avec le reste de l'économie coloniale. Parmi eux, le texte souligne l'importance des négociations menées par les « agents de contact » organisés par le chef de la maison commerciale dont la structure restait familiale. From a relational perspective and springing from information gotten form epistolary correspondence, this article studies the business practices of the Bask merchants who settled in Buenos Aires during the international war period towards the end of the eighteenth century. Having as observer Don Martin de Álzaga's business house, we will explore the mechanisms that articulated the integrations of the business circuits of the River Plate area in the colonial economic system. Among them, the concrete deals carried out by the «bond agents» organized by the House's boss within the familiar business constitution.<br>

Abstract: Le Venezuela de la fin de la période coloniale se distingue sur bien des points des autres régions d'Amérique espagnole: une prospérité économique flatteuse fondée sur le commerce du cacao et que confirment les réformes bourboniennes de la fin du siècle; une configuration sociale contrastée mais extrêmement fluide et une aristocratie créole, les mantuanos, dont le discours et les généalogies sociales sont repris à leur compte par les autres groupes sociaux émergents, notamment par le monde des pardos (métis); mais également l'une des révolutions d'Indépendance les plus violentes du continent. Les sensibilités métisses vont de pair avec une mémoire partagée, au quotidien ou lors d'événements bien particuliers tels que visitas ou procès. D'autant qu'un autre élément contribue à faire de cette société métisse une société en mouvement: les femmes, quel que soit leur statut social ou ethnique. Transgressions des normes sociales et morales par les aristocrates mantuanas, revendications des pardas se voulant nobles et défendant leur « honneur »: se situant dans la perspective de l'histoire des sensibilités, cette étude tentera de faire le point sur ce métissage des représentations, ainsi que sur la subversion du modèle culturel hispanique qui en découle dans les pratiques effectives. At the end of the colonial period, Venezuela is quite different from any other regions of Spanish America: first an economic prosperity which benefits from the cacao trade and strengthened by the Bourbon reforms at the very end of the century; a very contrasted but fluid social configuration; a creole aristocracy, the mantuanos, whose words and social genealogies are retrieved by other emergent social groups, such as the pardos (mestizos, half-caste); one of the most violent revolutions of Independence in the mainland. Hybrid sensibilities emerged along with a shared memory at the everyday level or at specific events such as visitas or trials. In this half-caste society, women, whatever their ~<br>

Abstract: A la fin du XIVe siècle, le Dialogue de Catherine de Sienne expose, par sa construction littéraire extrêmement élaborée, la conversion du mouvement raisonnable de recherche du divin en mouvement intelligent de contemplation, la conversion du langage théologique en langage de l'intelligence de l'âme, la conversion du langage difficile de la raison en langage métaphorique audible par tous et susceptible de ramener tous les hommes dans l'obéissance à l'Eglise. La méthode de connaissance recommandée par Catherine est celle des larmes. At the end of the 14th century, the Dialogo of Catherine of Sienna expounds in a very elaborate literary construction the conversion of the reasonable search for the divine into intelligent contemplation, the conversion of theological language into that of the comprehending soul, the conversion of the difficult language of the reason into a metaphorical one, understandable to everyone and fit to bring all men back to obedience to the Church. The method of knowledge which Catherine advises is that of the tears. En el final del siglo XIV, el Dialogo de Caterina de Sena por su construcción literaria muy elaborada expone la conversión del movimiento racional de búsqueda de Dios en el movimiento inteligente de contemplación, la conversión del lenguaje teológico en el lenguaje de la inteligencia del alma, la conversión del lenguaje difícil de la razón en el lenguaje metafórico que todos entienden y que puede reducir a todos en la obediencia a la Iglesia. El método de conocimiento preconizado por Caterina es el de las lágrimas.<br>

Le refus d'appuyer le christianisme à la culpabilité doit-il aboutir nécessairement à une revendication d'innocence sans intégrer l'apport des analyses de la flnitude et thématiser la condition de créature, inséparablement innocente et coupable? Penser que l'écriture est le lieu privilégié de manifestation du « je », n'est-ce pas recourir au postulat ontologique de la vérité comme fusion de la parole, du sens, du vécu, de la présence de l'homme et de sa vie? Some philosophical questions which arose from reading the book of J.-P. Jossua, Lectures en écho. Journal théologique I, Paris 1976. When faced with the failure of various dogmatisms, would not the recourse to "experience" by its very nature prevent "witness" from being an affirmation of the Absolute? By refusing to let Christianity lean on culpability, would one necessarily end up in a claim of innocence which would not integrate the contribution of analyses of limitedness and which would not come to grips with the condition of a creature which is inseparably innocent and culpable? By thinking that writing is the privileged place for the manifestation of the "ego", is one not resorting to the ontological postulate of truth as an amalgamation of word, sens, existence of man and life?<br>

Abstract: Rompant avec la quasi-unanimité de la philosophie occidentale, de Platon à Marx, laquelle a conçu le pouvoir en termes de pouvoir-sur, de domination de l'homme sur l'homme, H. A. propose de le penser autrement, comme expression de l'aptitude d'un groupe à agir en condition de pluralité de façon concertée, et donc comme pouvoir-en-commun. L'A. différencie soigneusement le pouvoir, qui trouve en lui-même sa propre fin, d'avec la violence, d'ordre instrumental, qui n'est jamais légitime, et d'avec l'autorité, qui présuppose la reconnaissance inconditionnelle et le respect. Elle se demande finalement si tout pouvoir peut se passer du facteur de durabilité qu'est l'autorité d'une fondation. In breaking with the near unanimity of Western Philosophy which, from Plato to Marx, had conceived of power in terms of "power over," of a domination of humans over humans, H. A. proposes instead to think of power as an expression of a group's aptitude to act in a pluralistic environment and in concert, thus as power in common. The A. takes care to distinguish power as an end in itself from violence of an instrumental order which is never legitimate, and from Authority which presupposes unconditional recognition and respect, wondering in the end if all power can do without the durability factor that is the authority of a foundation<br>

Abstract: La conception de la contemplation et de la vie contemplative connaît une évolution intéressante dans un ordre contemplatif par excellence, celui des Chartreux entre ses débuts et la fin du XIIIe siècle. Cet article tente d'explorer ce tournant à partir de l'analyse de trois auteurs: Guigues II, Hugues de Balma, Guigues du Pont. Héritier de la tradition monastique de la lectio divina, le premier met en place l'échelle des moines montant de la lecture à la méditation, à la prière et à la contemplation. Mais le second en scie les barreaux : concevant une théologie mystique, union affective à Dieu sans connaissance antécédente ou concomitante, il conduit au paradoxe d'une vie contemplative sans contemplation. Les distinctions subtiles du dernier rendent à la théologie mystique une contemplation anagogique et font place à ses côtés à une contemplation spéculative des philosophes, des théologiens, des mystiques. The understanding of contemplation and the contemplative life sees an interesting evolution in an order contemplative par excellence, the Carthusians, between its beginnings and the end of the XIIIth century. On the basis of the analyses of three authors, Guigues II, Hugh of Balma, and Guigues Du Pont, this article endeavors to explore this turn. Heir to the monastic tradition of lectio divina, the first sets in place the ladder for monks ascending from reading to meditation, from prayer to contemplation. Yet the second saws apart the rungs. Conceiving of a mystical theology, an affective union with God without preceding or concomitant knowledge, he shows the way to the paradox of a contemplative life without contemplation. The subtle distinctions of the last bestow upon mystical theology an anagogic contemplation and clear the away around it for a speculative contemplation of the philosophers, theologians and mystics.<br>

Author(s): Wyschogrod David P.<br>
Abstract: Aristotle's distinction between phronesis, or ethical knowledge, and techne, or productive knowledge, is relevant both to Romantic and to modern discussions of the relations between aesthetic and ethical experience. Wordsworth and Coleridge try in different ways to negotiate between the two kinds of knowledge, advocating the ethical force of poetry while acknowledging its status as techne; in contrast, modern criticism tends either to accept the ubiquity of techne or to revive phronesis while undervaluing the tension between the two. Hans-Georg Gadamer and Emmanuel Levinas provide a way to link phronesis to aesthetic autonomy through the means-end unity of phronesis and the ethical claim of the other, although Gadamer overemphasizes the autonomy of the artwork and Levinas underemphasizes the ethical possibilities of the aesthetic. Wordsworth and Coleridge present the ethical encounter with the other as in tension with techne, but they also show that tension itself to be ethically significant.<br>

Publisher: American Bar Foundation<br>
Issue: i234271<br>
Date: 1 1, 1948<br>
Author(s): Corner Stephen A.<br>
Abstract: American federalism is nothing more-and nothing less-than a metaphor. This was how James Wilson, the most prominent lawyer at the Philadelphia Convention, came to approach the novel problem of understanding and conveying what federalism in a modern republic should mean. The Federal Republic created in 1787 was, for Wilson, more than a matter of ingenious political design, more than a matter of the "new science of politics," and more than a matter of constitutional law or constitutionalism itself-unless the Constitution were seen to "comprehend" the moral purpose and moral promise of the new nation. To Wilson, this view of the importance of the moral content of republican federalism was entailed by the "knowledge" that he took to be the necessary foundation of the Republic. It was this knowledge of certain fundamental principles-of "moral science," human nature, and the nature of language, and, more generally, of "cultivation" as a political and social process that was also an end in itself-that ultimately justified "the People" as the "sublime" metaphor governing American constitutional theory. Yet, for all Wilson's faith in figurative "comprehensiveness," his distinctive approach to securing the New Republic through a federal union of the American People seems to have proved less and less compelling to his contemporaries the more he tried to pursue it as far as his vision of a politics of cultivation directed.<br>

Abstract: Allusion and citation in Philip's
         She Tries Her Tongueexplicitly works to harness cultural capital from the literary canon. As she puts it, her poems are squatters in the house of language: “We have been linguistic squatters, possessing adversely what is truly ours.”
               This appropriation is of a piece with what Oswald De Andrade and K. Silem Mohammad are about in their splicing of Shakespeare, which I mentioned at the outset. In130
            Sonnagrams, Mohammad combines aleatory procedures with the strict observance of traditional meter and rhyme in his recombination of Shakespeare's sonnets. Somewhat like Pierre Menard's re-authoring ofDon Quixote, Mohammad sought to create new poems that were “quantitatively equivalent to Shakespeare's poems,” although this meant they were equivalent only “at the most basic linguistic level: the letter.” Mohammad explains his combinatorial process: “I feed each of Shakespeare's 154 sonnets one line at a time into an internet anagram engine … thus generating a new list of words from each line … The textual output … gives me a bank of raw material.”
               A quatrain from sonnet #3 (“Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest”) becomes:131
            
               As Heather McHugh puts it, Mohammad offers an “anagram as scrupulous as it is full of slang and sass.”Go softly to the Disneyland Hotel,
               Its simulacral threshold grown sublime:
               The bedrooms all emit that new car smell,

               Mohammad notes that he's not interested in being “overtly influenced by Shakespeare's semantic content.”133
            
               His re-authoring is, moreover, consciously situated within a tradition of anagrams (especially those of Ferdinand De Saussure) and rewritings of Shakespeare's sonnets (he names Ted Berrigan, Bernadette Mayer, Jen B~<br>

Abstract: There is much to admire in
      Against World Literature, but I often found myself wishing that Apter had developed her arguments further by opening out more beyond her own cultural and theoretical comfort zone. Throughout her book, “World Literature” is taken to be a unified entity, practiced largely in translation by American academics; no mention is made of the ambitious publication projects undertaken in Japan over the course of the past century, in China since the end of the Cultural Revolution, or in countries as varied as Estonia, Poland, Portugal, and South Korea in more recent years. Within English-language scholarship, Apter rarely discusses work published in the past decade, even though scholars of world literature increasingly focus on complexities of translation and on the cultural politics of transmission and reception. No mention is made, for instance, of Mads Rosendahl Thomsen'sMapping World Literature(Bloomsbury, 2008), Ursula Heise'sSense of Place and Sense of Planet: The Environmental Imagination of the Global(Oxford, 2008), Djelal Kadir'sMemos from the Besieged City: Lifelines for Cultural Sustainability(Stanford, 2010), or Jacob Edmond'sA Common Strangeness: Contemporary Poetry, Cross-cultural Encounter, Comparative Literature(Fordham, 2012). A treatment of untranslatability from a broad temporal and cultural perspective can be found in Ronit Ricci's remarkable bookIslam Translated(Chicago, 2011), which opens with a chapter on “‘Translation’ and its Untranslatability,” exploring the implications of the fact that the very term “translation” has no direct translation in Arabic, Tamil, and Javanese, the languages at the heart of her study.<br>

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: In “Child Soldier,” from
         Before the Palm Could Bloom, the speaker erects a spiritual monument for the “war children / who follow men who have lost all reason” (19). Each of the poem's six stanzas begins with, or is constructed around, a different name. These names—Saye, Ghapu, Kahieh, Nimley, Kortu, Wlemunga—are drawn from the different tribes and ethnicities in Liberia. Ghapu is a Bassa name meaning “light skinned” or “white man.” Nimley means “victor” or “I have survived.” Kortu means “end the war.”

Abstract: Several factors were involved in the formation of European hegemony, not the least being the navigation of the Atlantic Ocean commencing with the voyages of Christopher Columbus at the end of the fifteenth century. This event forms the origin and context that enabled Europe to take on the prestige of a special and peculiar identity. Europe became a continent!
         
               Now it is clear that the landmass known as Europe is part and parcel of the larger landmass of Asia; geographically, Europe is a cape of Asia.6<br>

Abstract: Is SPEP the city of God? This would be going too far. Not even the theological turn in French Phenomenology would make this claim. Dick Howard already threw in a troubling question: “diversification that perhaps gives more breadth than depth?” he asked. And there are plenty more troubling questions. SPEP is now a big operation. It has committees and subcommittees, multiple simultaneous sessions, blind review. All these developments are signs, perhaps inevitable ones, of its success, but all have familiar downsides: bureaucratization, diversification for its own sake, what Habermas would call
   Unübersichtlichkeit. This is what happens when outsiders become insiders, the antis become their own sort of establishment. You can't blame some of us for feeling nostalgic for our long-lost innocence, even though we all know—you don't have to be a philosopher of history to know this—that we can't go there. History has rendered a judgment, but Dick Howard said, “Historywilljudge.” That's one problem with history: It's always rendering judgments, but they are never final. You'd have to be at the end of history for that, and despite the claim of some philosophers, we aren't there yet. The slaughter bench of history looks very different today from the early 1960s, but it's still in some ways a slaughter bench. So how will the SPEP of the early twenty-first century look to the philosopher-historians of 2061—or is it 2062?<br>

Abstract: And so, although we certainly shared their concern for the neglected and misunderstood topics we read about in Kierkegaard, Dilthey, Jaspers, Sartre, Husserl, and Nietzsche, none of their accounts of these matters seemed fully responsive to their experiential sense. All of these thinkers seemed, to me at least, to partially betray their own best insights by how they presented them. Dilthey, for instance, leaves everything that stands in the way of his philosophical success in place. In the end, having self-identified as an epistemologist of the “other” sciences—that is, someone interested in a “second” method for understanding unobservable “inner” life instead of the standard method for explaining observable “outer” nature—he is ultimately able to do no better that assure us that even if
      Verstehenwon't give us “objectivity” in the usual sense, it can at least give us what he weakly calls a “subjectively objective” analogue.

Abstract: Without sovereignty and without ownership, we are responsible for what we cannot and do not control, for our unconscious fears and desires and their effects on others. The fragile hope is that by acknowledging the death drive within ourselves, we can begin to prevent killing and never give up trying to find ways to abolish death penalties in all their forms. The death drive is not the Kantian notion of death as the great equalizer but, rather, the tension in life itself, both destructive and creative, always conjoined with both pleasure and pain, joy and sorrow, and the ambiguities of life that not only exceed but also expose the fantasy of death as an absolute end point or final resting place. Far from the Perpetual Peace of the Dutch innkeeper's sign, with which Kant ironically opens his essay, the death drive is the force that fuels the fantasy of the end of life as everlasting peace.<br>

Abstract: Second, this way of characterizing Heidegger is similar to what I would offer, still with sharp differences, regarding Jacques Derrida. I find Derrida's project governed from beginning to end by the nonability of phenomenology (or of any other intellectual undertaking) to
            reachan ultimate of origin. Placing his 1953–54mémoireand two of his books, one large,De la grammatologie(1967; trans. Baltimore, 1974), and one small,Positions(1972; trans. Chicago, 1981), together with the fact that the transformation of the field of philosophic concern was worked entirely in the play of wordings, in the play ofmeaning differentiation and collusion, exhibits the four characteristics I have proposed. For Derrida regularly showed—afterOn GrammatologyandPositions, usually without saying so—how the absolute nonfeasibility of finding origins would undermine any assertion of canonic status and stability for conceptualities. Instead, the very meaningfulness of canonic terminology (a) demanded a freer play of meaning for understanding any such purported paradigmatic sense, (b) showed the nonvalidity of any absolute priority-granting properness to their usage, and (c) exhibited instead their fundamentalrelativity. No other person in phenomenology came close to the effectiveness Derrida showed in this, and very few, so far as I know, recognize the phenomenology-necessitated character of these efforts.<br>

Abstract: No doubt the rise of religion has not only posed a particular dilemma for critical theory but also provided a curious place to end this reflection. Having started my career doing philosophy of religion it is somewhat surprising to meet religion again as I turn to what surely must be at least a later phase of my career. I am reminded of Antonio's line from the Italian film
            C'eravamo Tanto Amati, translated asWe All Loved Each Other So Much: “We thought we could change the world, but the world changed us.” “Philosophers only interpret the world, the point is to change it,” so said Marx. But in a curious way those who would change the world are changed by it.<br>

Article Title: French Poststructuralism<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Three years later in the next edition of selected SPEP papers the editors, Ronald Bruzina and Bruce Wilshire, noted an article by David Allison, “Structuralism Revisited: Levi Straus and Diachrony.”
         
               They suggested that to understand it the reader would need to draw from knowledge of Heidegger, Derrida, Deleuze, and Ricoeur. They also noted a paper by Matthieu Casalis, “Hermeneutics, Death of God, and Dissolution of the Subject: A Phenomenological Appraisal,” that indicates a growing challenge to what we could call a strong tendency toward totalization in some aspect of phenomenological thought, as well as the high stakes that are at issue. Interest in Marxist thought and critical theory as well as in social science also intensified during the 1970s, and by the end of the decade papers in these areas were common, while papers also emerged on politics and political action. The currents crossing the phenomenological mainstream were now strong and, for some members, challenging in a disconcerting way that most people in SPEP in the 1960s could not have imagined. Many people who were deeply impacted by the civil rights struggle (in spite of the absence in SPEP of a significant presence of people of color), the Vietnam War protests, and the growing awareness of colonialism and gender inequality were taking philosophy in the context of phenomenology and existentialism out of the modern transcendental and metaphysical domain, some by direct challenges to interpretations of canonical texts and others by setting new directions that arose out of contemporary problems and concern for social justice. Social-historical factors and careful analyses of narrative forms began to replace epistemology as leading interests, and these factors and forms often replaced metaphysical foundations in their work. “Humanism” became increasingly a problem rather than an unquestioned term concerning human life and the context of its interpretation.4<br>

Abstract: These are nano-, bio-, info-, and cognotechnologies. For reasons I will clarify, I add robo- and imaging technologies to this list. But before some specific examples, take note of how these new technologies
                  differfrom the mega-, mechanical, industrial technologies called “modern” by Heidegger. In each case the target entities with which these technologies intervene are extrememicrophenomena. Nanotechnologies manipulate at the atomic and molecular levels, trapping atoms, deflecting photons; biotechnologies operate at the genetic level, DNA, RNA, proteins; cognotechnologies, also employing imaging, depict neurotransmissions and the like. I shall later address the info-, robo-, and imaging technologies. At the end of the Cold War, physics, while interested in subatomic particles and wedded to monster colliders to investigate these phenomena, was about to lose its biggest instrument, the supercollider, which was canceled in 1994, in part because it was not deemed so important. The subsequent emergence of biology, also wed to microphenomena, could use much smaller instruments.<br>

Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: It is the emphasis on transcendence that provides the segue from ethics to religion. It is in the ethical relation that God “comes to mind.” Here again, Levinas is in important respects a Kantian. Kant insists that “on its own behalf morality in no way needs religion,” but he adds that it “inevitably leads to religion.”
            
                  Of course, the self-sufficiency of ethics does not for Levinas rest on pure practical reason, nor does it lead to religion as “the idea of a mighty moral lawgiver outside the human being, in whose will the final end (of the creation of the world) is what can and at the same [time] ought to be the final human end.”16
               
                  But it is clear that for Levinas ethics does not depend on religion in this sense and that it does lead to religion in his own sense of the term.17<br>

Abstract: First, hermeneutics rejects the scientific ideal of phenomenology. Husserl conceives phenomenology in foundational terms as a first philosophy whose role is to provide a metaphysical grounding or an Archimedean point for scientific knowledge. But hermeneutics challenges the foundational enterprise altogether.
         
               The search for foundations, on this view, is forgetful of its own origins within a more encompassing context of relations. Thought can never establish itself at the beginning or end point; instead it is always situated in medias res, that is, in the midst of a conversation or dialogue that has already begun.12<br>

Abstract: Stretching
         verbato its breaking point, he dramatically attempts to communicate and re-present an extraordinaryresthrough the disorienting and performative twists and turns of hyperbolicincrementumandcongeries. In a representative example, he writes:
               Amid this teeming sea of paradoxical complexities and discursive amalgamations, Taylor's excessive thought regarding “the Holy” that is “irreducibly ex-orbitant” and interrupts the “circulation of knowledge” reveals the use of hyperbole at work as he navigates across an ambiguous theo-philosophical topography. Incrementally augmenting, accumulating, and building toward this unrealizable term, he “throws beyond” incongruities in order to push toward the apprehension that “the Holy” is “that which cannot be conceived.” He is making the attempt to communicate the inconceivable through his language of excess and exaggeration, which is the only way he could make the attempt effectively, and the insight gleaned from his work is that the disorienting movement of theology and a/theology, beyond the end of theology, is equally and inevitably an impossible possibility.The trace of the fugitive gods is the nonabsent absence of the Holy. This trace is a different trace, the trace of difference itself, which can never be expressed directly, revealed totally, or known completely. It is ever elusive, evasive, excessive. Irreducibly ex-orbitant, the Holy eternally returns to interrupt the circulation of knowledge and to disrupt every form of reciprocal exchange. To hear the “inhuman,” “anonymous,” “uncanny” murmur of the Holy is to become open to that which cannot be conceived, grasped, mastered, or controlled. (1990, 119)<br>

Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: In his foreword to Ricoeur's
         From Text to Action, Richard Kearney asserts that “Ricoeur's work, from beginning to end, was fueled by an ontology of action” (2007, ix). Ricoeur combines his interest in action with questions of memory in the magisterialMemory, History, Forgetting(2004), in which he systematically explores the phenomenological experience—and to a lesser extent, the ethical implications—of the three central terms. However, because this work focuses more on phenomenology than the public implications of a text, other works by Ricoeur are better suited to redeployment in critical analysis. This is not to say that Ricoeur ignores important themes inMemory, History, Forgetting. For instance, he uses the evocative phrase “historian-citizen” in order to denote the public responsibility demanded by certain narratives or representations of the past (2004, 259). Unfortunately, however, Ricoeur moves quickly beyond this promising concept without fully developing it. Thus, the concepts fromTime and Narrativeand, to a lesser extent,From Text to Action, provide a more congenial point of departure for the agential spiral.<br>

Date: 10 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Wixson Christopher<br>
Abstract: Along the same lines, in the preface to
      Man and Superman, he draws a distinction between two states of corporeal infirmity. The first, what he calls “the true joy of life,” results from “the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap, the being a force of nature.” The second is engendered by a failure of will and perspective, producing “a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.”
            Scholars and biographers have taken both views of Shaw. Countless testimonies of friends and acquaintances as well as innumerable pronouncements by GBS himself laud the extraordinary vibrancy of the “active young revolutionist” following his typical schedule of prolific writing and speech giving.22
         
            At the same time, Shaw's private diaries are replete with meticulous physiological self-examination, documenting his crippling headaches as well as myriad illnesses, injuries, changes in weight and appetite, and suspected symptoms. Robert Brustein attributes “a kind of Swiftian disgust at the human body and its functions” to the playwright, while Sally Peters pathologizes his interest in health, arguing its origin in latent psychosis, specifically an obsessive fear of contagion.23
         
            His commitment to vegetarianism, teetotalism, and Jaegerism, she argues, was founded as much upon hygienic paranoia as moral principle: “Fueled by a “desperate revulsion from body and biology[,] … Shaw's was an ever-lasting defense against dirt, poison, and contamination[,] whatever symbolized to him the form-destroying potencies of existence.”24
         
            In any case, the vexed body, on its way to evolutionary elimination, assiduously preoccupied Shaw, and matters of personal and public wellness remained an idée fixe until the end of his life.25<br>

Abstract: We can begin filling in the specifics of this answer by considering another statement Shaw's Lilith makes at the end of
         Back to Methuselah. “From the moment I … lose hope and faith in [humankind],” says the Life Force incarnate, “they are doomed…. I may not spare them forever.”
               This cautionary admonition is instructive not just because it declares that the jury is still out with respect to the race's fate. It is also revelatory in the sense that it gives us a privileged insight into the quintessential being of the man behind the work by way of the implicit homology it provides. The critical point is this: if for Shaw, the cosmic dramatist, “hope and faith” are efficacious in the divine sphere in deferring the species' demise, they are for Shaw, the everyday person, equally efficacious in the earthly sphere. The analogy works as follows. Lilith has not yet given up completely on humans in their present stage of development because she retains hope and faith in their capacity to change for the better. In a similar way, Shaw the individual does not give up completely on Lilith's stiff-necked people for precisely the same reason. He carries within him the unshakable belief that, despite all appearances to the contrary, humans have the permanent capability to modify their behavior in a manner that meets the Jesusian standard Lilith ordains: ever more abundant life on a just and peaceful planet. Whether they will realize this competency in action, no one can say with certainty, not even the goddess herself, for she too lacks the perspective of eternity. But this irreducible metaphysical possibility is all the breathing space Shaw needs to maintain his equilibrium, his wellness, in a world wildly out of kilter.28<br>

It seems so abstract in its focus on generalized terminology and images that it may have no possible concrete object. Burke realized this utopian quality reminiscent of the lack of actualized topos in More's utopian “no-place.” As rhetorician James Zappen explains, “These acts of pure persuasion are devoid of partisan advantage-seeking but also devoid of persuasive purpose. As such, they might not even exist.”
      
               The important thing to take away from Burke's ramblings, though, is the humanistic sense that the search for perfection is inherent in human nature and that understanding this utopian impulse can only help us to live and to seek happiness in a world of competing power and advantage: “Let us observe, all about us, forever goading us, though it be in fragments, the motive that attains its ultimate identification in the thought, not of the universal holocaust, but of the universal order…. [E]ach kind strives toward the perfection of its kind, and so toward the kind next above it, while the strivings of the entire series head in God as the beloved cynosure and ninecure, the end of all desire.”35

            GodBurke means an ultimate ideal transcending all other symbols and fulfilling all desire—the kind of nirvana that would eliminate the need for further utopia-making altogether. This, of course, is not achievable in the course of history, but the mythic experience of it would activate a downward movement in the process, bringing the transcendent ideals back into the pragmatic world of discourse and human affairs. This would be the function of utopia in Burkean terms, and it would result in a habit of mind that would amount to a large-scale educational scheme—dare I say, the education of desires. If the young were informed of the dialectical-rhetorical process of transcendence from the beginning, ~<br>

Abstract: Leopold Bloom, in
         Ulysses, expansively describes the Utopian as affording “no known method from the known to the unknown.”
               Utopia is a place that is impossible to arrive at by any known route, in that it is not really a place at all. It is therefore essential that, in order to reach Utopia, one takes an unknown and unknowable route, a path determined by its indeterminacy, a passage that deconstructs its own rationalistic epistemological foundations. It is only in its paradoxical nature that such a route, beyond sense (which forbids entry into the unreal), might discover the reality of that unreality. For, in the end, despite its fantastical absurdities—its self-conscious nowhereness—Joyce's Dublin, like Butler's Erewhon, is the opposite of nowhere: it is somewhere. It is by inscribing the material (the somewhere) within the dream (the nowhere) that the dream might be sustained; and it is also by inscribing the dream within the real that material existence can continue.166<br>

Abstract: The crossroads of the end of Utopia (apparently ensured by the fall of the Berlin Wall and Soviet Russia), the end of the world (apparently easier to imagine than an alternative to capitalism), and capitalism itself (which is apparently eternal) seems an apt place to turn toward the problem of degenerate Utopia and the city, which, after all, pretty much amount to the same thing in our time. Louis Marin's proposition is that “a degenerate utopia is ideology changed into the form of a myth.”
         
               Arguably, one such myth is capitalism. Another might be modernity or modernism, and a third could be the inevitability of the contemporary city as the concretization of capitalist realism. However, the cities that most of us inhabit could conceivably be construed as Utopias by neoliberals, as constituting the best of all possible worlds for the spread of free markets, or equally so by anti-utopians, who might see in the modern city Utopia realized, that is, dystopia. In any event, and whatever one's preconceived notion of Utopia might be, the contemporary city stands primarily as confirmation “of the impotence of corporate capital to generate a socially cohesive environment.”29
            
               As such, it is also arguably no Utopia, which persists as an open project to be imagined and realized, sometime and somewhere in the future, in the footsteps of present efforts to define Utopia for architecture and the city and to establish its spaces.30<br>

Abstract: R.A. Lafferty's reputation for rollicking humor and poetic verve, as demonstrated in such stories as “Narrow Valley” (1966) and “Slow Tuesday Night” (1965) belies the considerable theoretical and narratological complexity of his entire body of work. This article draws on the vocabulary developed by Paul Ricoeur in
         Interpretation Theory(1966) andTime and Narrative(1983–85) to explore Lafferty's process of world creation in light of his startling 1979 announcement that the cognitive world of humanity had come to an end. Thus, in this post-conscious state, it was left to science fiction to develop potential replacements. In his writings Lafferty seeks not only to project new worlds but also to reconstruct the world-building capacity in others, enabling readers and writers alike to collaborate toward a future for humanity.<br>
