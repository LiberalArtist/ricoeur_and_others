  Abstract: Fundamentalism is, at its essence, a church movement. By this I mean, as we have explored throughout this study, that Fundamentalist counterpublicity is intimately intertwined with narratives about the survival and status of the Fundamentalist church, a universal idealization of local believing communities. This idealization, in turn, conflates political and spiritual, public and private concerns in Fundamentalist rhetoric. The church marks the boundaries and exclusions of Fundamentalist identity, yet it also builds bridges between private belief and public action. It is in defense and propagation of the Fundamentalist church and the ideal of revivalism that the local church finds its<br>

  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Móricz Klára<br>
  Abstract: Jewish Identitiesmounts a formidable challenge to prevailing essentialist assumptions about "Jewish music," which maintain that ethnic groups, nations, or religious communities possess an essence that must manifest itself in art created by members of that group. Klára Móricz scrutinizes concepts of Jewish identity and reorders ideas about twentieth-century "Jewish music" in three case studies: first, Russian Jewish composers of the first two decades of the twentieth century; second, the Swiss American Ernest Bloch; and third, Arnold Schoenberg. Examining these composers in the context of emerging Jewish nationalism, widespread racial theories, and utopian tendencies in modernist art and twentieth-century politics, Móricz describes a trajectory from paradigmatic nationalist techniques, through assumptions about the unintended presence of racial essences, to an abstract notion of Judaism.<br>

  Abstract: Aristotle says that metaphor is ‘the application of a word that belongs to another thing: either from genus to species, species to genus, species to species, or by analogy’.¹ Studies of metaphors in specific texts – such as those considered in the present volume – are, on the whole, served well by the sort of definition Aristotle offers. But that Aristotelian definition, in presupposing that proper names belong to their objects, raises some awkward questions about naming and essence.

  Book Title: Tastes of the Divine: Hindu and Christian Theologies of Emotion-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS MICHELLE VOSS<br>
  Abstract: The intensity and meaningfulness of aesthetic experience have often been described in theological terms. By designating basic human emotions as rasa, a word that connotes taste, flavor, or essence, Indian aesthetic theory conceptualizes emotional states as something to be savored. At their core, emotions can be tastes of the divine. In this book, the methods of the emerging discipline of comparative theology enable the author's appreciation of Hindu texts and practices to illuminate her Christian reflections on aesthetics and emotion. Three emotions vie for prominence in the religious sphere: peace, love, and fury. Whereas Indian theorists following Abhinavagupta claim that the aesthetic emotion of peace best approximates the goal of religious experience, devotees of Krishna and medieval Christian readings of the Song of Songs argue that love communicates most powerfully with divinity. In response to the transcendence emphasized in both approaches, the book turns to fury at injustice to attend to emotion's foundations in the material realm. The implications of this constructive theology of emotion for Christian liturgy, pastoral care, and social engagement are manifold.<br>

  Abstract: Confucianism, as the dominant philosophical/cultural system of East Asia that has evolved over two millennia, is multidimensional and multilayered. Consequently, its interpretations diverge depending on which elements get emphasized and how they are arranged. Most, if not all, of such interpretations may contain some truth, but no one interpretation may capture the whole monolithic and unchangeable “Truth” of Confucianism. Confucianism is a

A resemblance between or among them is predicated with respect to traits that are repeated despite otherwise diverse attributes.

  Abstract: To set up a limit is a dual gesture, at once instituting difference and indicating a point of contact. Martin Heidegger’s critique of the discipline of poetics, a recurrent feature throughout his long engagement with poetry, is just such a gesture. On the one hand, he claims that his own readings of poems or
                  Erläuterungen(“soundings-out”) can articulate aspects of these poems to which poetics itself is blind. It thus stands beyond the limits of poetics—limits, that is, not simply born of bad critical practices, but which belong to the very “essence” of poetics as a mode of questioning.<br>

  Abstract: Michel Henry (1922–2002) was one of the early phenomenologists working in France, more or less contemporaneous with Emmanuel Lévinas and Paul Ricoeur. He is most well-known for developing a “material” phenomenology, or, as he later called it, a “phenomenology of the flesh.” Many of his early writings are heavily influenced by the philosophy of Karl Marx. Only his more recent (and final) writings are more explicitly religious.¹ Although some hints of these concerns are present in his earlier works (such as an analysis of Meister Eckhart’s mysticism in Section III of his major work

  Abstract: Aristotle, in distinguishing between actuality (ἐνέργεια) and possibility (δύναμις), undertook two crucial steps that have haunted the history of Western metaphysics ever since: he gave a qualitative priority to actuality over potency, and then he identified the former with pure essence. Possibility, for Aristotle, is a mode that denotes transition and corruption, and thus imperfection. However, the risk that he acknowledges and fears most is that potency is ambiguous and undecidable. In his words, “the possible could be both a being and a non-being … it could equally be both things and neither” (1050b10, 1051a1). It is this

We might suggest two different answers to these questions, which are in some ways even contradictory. The first is the classic answer, associated with the great twentieth-century philosophical tradition of Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre, to mention a few of the most well-known names. This answer calls for a reading of contemporary historical events through an interpretative lens that philosophy itself provides and singles out as the only one capable of grasping its essence.

  Book Title: Dis-Enclosure: The Deconstruction of Christianity-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Smith Michael B.<br>
  Abstract: This book is a profound and eagerly anticipated investigation into what is left of a monotheistic religious spirit-notably, a minimalist faith that is neither confessional nor credulous. Articulating this faith as works and as an objectless hope, Nancy deconstructs Christianity in search of the historical and reflective conditions that provided its initial energy. Working through Blanchot and Nietzsche, re-reading Heidegger and Derrida, Nancy turns to the Epistle of Saint James rather than those of Saint Paul, discerning in it the primitive essence of Christianity as hope. The religion that provided the exit from religion,as he terms Christianity, consists in the announcement of an end. It is the announcement that counts, however, rather than any finality. In this announcement there is a proximity to others and to what was once called parousia. But parousia is no longer presence; it is no longer the return of the Messiah. Rather, it is what is near us and does not cease to open and to close, a presence deferred yet imminent.In a demystified age where we are left with a vision of a self-enclosed world-in which humans are no longer mortals facing an immortal being, but entities whose lives are accompanied by the time of their own decline-parousia stands as a question. Can we venture the risk of a decentered perspective, such that the meaning of the world can be found both inside and outside, within and without our so-immanent world?The deconstruction of Christianity that Nancy proposes is neither a game nor a strategy. It is an invitation to imagine a strange faith that enacts the inadequation of life to itself. Our lives overflow the self-contained boundaries of their biological and sociological interpretations. Out of this excess, wells up a fragile, overlooked meaning that is beyond both confessionalism and humanism.<br>

  Book Title: Conrad's Marlow-Narrative and death in 'Youth', Heart of Darkness, Lord Jim and Chance<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wake Paul<br>
  Abstract: Variously described as ‘the average pilgrim’, a ‘wanderer’, and ‘a Buddha preaching in European clothes’, Charlie Marlow is the voice behind Joseph Conrad’s ‘Youth’ (1898), Heart of Darkness (1899), Lord Jim (1900) and Chance (1912). Conrad’s Marlow offers a comprehensive account and critical analysis of one of Conrad’s most celebrated creations, asking both who and what is Marlow: a character or a narrator, a biographer or an autobiographical screen, a messenger or an interpreter, a bearer of truth or a misguided liar? Reading Conrad’s fiction alongside the work of Walter Benjamin, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida and Martin Heidegger, and offering an investigation into the connection between narrative and death, this book argues that Marlow’s essence is located in his liminality – in his constantly shifting position – and that the emergence of meaning in his stories is at all points bound up with the process of his storytelling.<br>

These figures are all what Habermas would call ‘post metaphysical’ thinkers.

  Book Title: Thou Shalt Not Kill: A Political and Theological Dialogue-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sitze Adam<br>
  Abstract: In this fascinating and rare little book, a leading Italian feminist philosopher and the Archbishop of Milan face off over the contemporary meaning of the biblical commandment not to kill. The result is a series of erudite and wide-ranging arguments that move from murder and suicide to just war and drone strikes, from bioethics and biopolitics to hermeneutics and philology, from Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer to Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault, from Torah and Scripture to art and literature, from the essence of human dignity and the paradoxes of fratricide to engagements with Levinasian ethics. Less a direct debate than a disputation in the classical sense, Thou Shalt Not Kill proves to be a searching meditation on one of the unstated moral premises shared by otherwise bitterly opposed political factions. It will stimulate the mind of the novice while also reminding more advanced readers of the necessity and desirability of thinking in the present.<br>

He did not want to separate the stable things which we see and the shifting way in which they appear; he wanted to depict matter as it takes on form, the birth of order through spontaneous organization” (Merleau-Ponty 1964 [1945]: 13).<br>

  Abstract: One of the most prominent connections between Nietzsche’s thought and the entire phenomenological enterprise lies in Husserl’s founding postulate that the thing-in-itself is an invalid concept. Although Husserl never formulates it explicitly, the development of phenomenology demonstrates the root of this invalidity: the thing-in-itself is a contradiction insofar as a thing is, by definition and by essence, always an object of perception. This is also, of course, one of Nietzsche’s most explicit, best established, and most consistently repeated claims, and perhaps one that has the greater consequence within the overall economy of his thought. Indeed this connection suggests a kinship<br>

                  El niño proletario: poemas clasistas(The Proletarian Child: Classist Poems). A young, self-designated “revolutionary poet” from the state of Michoacán, Sansón Flores had published widely since the 1920s on social and political issues, garnering a reputation as an ardent defender of the oppressed classes. A book of children’s poetry hardly stood to launch him into international literary fame. Little more than a cardboard-bound pamphlet of fifteen simple didactic verses for children, this collection nevertheless captured the essence of Sansón Flores’s Marxist social critique at<br>

                  In Pursuit of the English(1960), Doris Lessing’s autobiographical account of her first years in London, is obsessed with the location, meaning, and function of English culture, finding its essence in the convoluted folds of a class society. After living in the metropole for two years, the semifictional narrator, Doris, complains that she has yet to stumble upon any genuine, bonafide Englishmen. “I don’t think I’ve met any,” she moans to a friend, explaining, “London is<br>

  Abstract: Ireland has a long and rich sporting heritage. Whether in Gaelic games, soccer, rugby, golf, horse or dog racing, the Irish have regularly produced champions and heroes who have captivated the public imagination. Since the evolution of modern organised sport in the late nineteenth century right up to its saturation of the mass media in the twenty-first, the Irish have shown themselves to be passionate about, and in many cases obsessed by, sport. In essence, sport is about those who watch and those who play. It is about passion, belief, occasional joy, frequent heartbreak and, all too commonly, standing on<br>

  Abstract: A flawed teleology exists in the historiography of Catholic activism in Latin America. In this narrative the Catholic Church before the Second Vatican Council was conservative, preservationist, concerned with its institutional interests as opposed to the plight of the poor, and fundamentally antimodern. It was a church in captivity, chained by its own elite-centered interests, ignorant of its call to shepherd the People of God. The history of the church, in essence, was progressing from captivity to liberation: the Second Vatican Council and its Latin American interpretation, the Conference of Latin American Bishops at Medellín in 1968 was the turning<br>

  Book Title: Religion: Beyond a Concept-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): de VRIES HENT<br>
  Abstract: What do we talk about when we talk about religion? Is it an array of empirical facts about historical human civilizations? Or is religion what is in essence unpredictable-perhaps the very emergence of the new? In what ways are the legacies of religion-its powers, words, things, and gestures-reconfiguring themselves as the elementary forms of life in the twenty-first century?Given the Latin roots of the word religion and its historical Christian uses, what sense, if any, does it make to talk about religionin other traditions? Where might we look for common elements that would enable us to do so? Has religion as an overarching concept lost all its currency, or does it ineluctably return-sometimes in unexpected ways-the moment we attempt to do without it? This book explores the difficulties and double binds that arise when we ask What is religion? Offering a marvelously rich and diverse array of perspectives, it begins the task of rethinking religionand religious studiesin a contemporary world. Opening essays on the question What is religion?are followed by clusters exploring the relationships among religion, theology, and philosophy and the links between religion, politics, and law. Pedagogy is the focus of the following section. Religion is then examined in particular contexts, from classical times to the present Pentacostal revival, leading into an especially rich set of essays on religion, materiality, and mediatization. The final section grapples with the ever-changing forms that religionis taking, such as spirituality movements and responses to the ecological crisis.Featuring the work of leading scholars from a wide array of disciplines, traditions, and cultures, Religion: Beyond a Concept will help set the agenda for religious studies for years to come. It is the first of five volumes in a collection entitled The Future of the Religious Past, the fruit of a major international research initiative funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.<br>

  Book Title: Death's Following: Mediocrity, Dirtiness, Adulthood, Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): LIMON JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Almost all twentieth-century philosophy stresses the immanence of death in human life-as drive (Freud), as the context of Being (Heidegger), as the essence of our defining ethics (Levinas), or as language (de Man, Blanchot). In Death's Following, John Limon makes use of literary analysis (of Sebald, Bernhard, and Stoppard), cultural analysis, and autobiography to argue that death is best conceived as always transcendentally beyond ourselves, neither immanent nor imminent. Adapting Kierkegaard's variations on the theme of Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac while refocusing the emphasis onto Isaac, Limon argues that death should be imagined as if hiding at the end of an inexplicable journey to Moriah. The point is not to evade or ignore death but to conceive it more truly, repulsively, and pervasively in its camouflage: for example, in jokes, in logical puzzles, in bowdlerized folk songs. The first of Limon's two key concepts is adulthood: the prolonged anti-ritual for experiencing the full distance on the look of death. His second is dirtiness, as theorized in a Jewish joke, a logical exemplum, and T. S. Eliot's "Ash Wednesday": In each case, unseen dirt on foreheads suggests the invisibility of inferred death. Not recognizing death immediately or admitting its immanence and imminence is for Heidegger the defining characteristic of the "they," humanity in its inauthentic social escapism. But Limon vouches throughout for the mediocrity of the "they" in its dirty and ludicrous adulthood. Mediocrity is the privileged position for previewing death, in Limon's opinion: practice for being forgotten. In refusing the call of twentieth-century philosophy to face death courageously, Limon urges the ethical and aesthetic value of mediocre anti-heroism.<br>

It tends to be approached in terms of either an origin that is other than human, in traditional transcendent metaphysics, or in terms of a source of meaning immanent in selfhood itself, as in modern transcendental philosophies. The search for origins has been criticized recently on both these scores, the first as so-called ontotheology, the second as in essence a nostalgic continuation of the same ontotheology, only now relocated and hidden within transcendental subjectivity (see Introduction).

Nothing blocks a gift more than the knowledge that it is a gift; Christ’s words to the Samaritan woman—“If you knew the gift of God” (John 4:10)—are less a sign of nostalgia for ancestral knowledge than thoughtfulness concerning a desire that, in essence, could destroy the gift.

Whenever a synthesis is grounded in symbolism, its aesthetic dimension cannot help but be invoked. Heidegger reminds us, for instance, that symbolism constitutes the essence of art.¹ In the creative fashioning of an artifact, truth itself is preserved as beauty.

  Abstract: Divine Simplicityengages recent critics and address one of their major concerns: that the doctrine of divine simplicity is not a biblical teaching. By analyzing the use of Scripture by key theologians from the early church to Karl Barth, Barrett finds that divine simplicity developed in order to respond to theological errors (e.g., Eunomianism) and to avoid misreading Scripture. The volume then explains how divine simplicity can be rearticulated by following a formal analogy from the doctrine of the Trinity in which the divine attributes are identical to the divine essence but are not identical to each other.<br>

  Abstract: Is philosophy ready to take account of the sudden emergence and factuality of the event, which since Plato has been defined as a thought of the generality and invariance of essence? Such is the very general question with which I would like to begin. As Husserl recalls at the very beginning of his lectures on the phenomenology of internal time-consciousness, the question of time and its contingency has always constituted the most crucial challenge for philosophy, marking the limits of its enterprise to intellectually possess the world because, as the very stuff of things, time seems to escape radically from<br>

  Variations across Multiple Groups in Forms of Dreaming from:

  Abstract: Because lucid dreams (and related subtypes) violate all traditional attempts to define an essence of dreaming, their study is especially useful in highlighting the dangers of such a monolithic approach. This in turn helps to explain the defensive hostility with which current research on lucidity has been greeted. Several attempts at a logicophilosophical account of dreaming (Sartre, Boss, Malcolm) have been predicated on the impossibility of what we now term fully lucid dreaming. Indeed, the analytical philosopher Norman Malcolm insists that at best we can only

  Abstract: A persistent question regarding the gratuity of gift remains unanswered. As the previous elucidation has shown, Bruaire’s ontodology perceives gift as the proper name of both absolute and finite spirit, and not only for creation. Considering the absolute spirit in terms of gift requires a conception of its oneness in terms of multiplicity; that is to say, while remaining one, its nature as absolute determinate spirit makes it relational within itself. Therefore, God, out of his own goodness, begets the Word, the perfect expression of himself. If God’s essence is gift, and the Word adequately expresses what the Father is,<br>

Heidegger’s debt to Scotus manifests itself on the opening page of Sein und Zeit. Heidegger asks about the meaning of being, that is, to what essence (logos) does the word “being” refer (SZ 2/1). He assumes a single meaning of being, a univocatio entis, which determines and makes possible all thinking and discourse. And he assumes that this notion of being is the a priori possession of Dasein; it is pre-understood in all that Dasein thinks and says. Further on,<br>

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Neo-Noir-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Conard Mark T.<br>
  Abstract: Film noir is a classic genre characterized by visual elements such as tilted camera angles, skewed scene compositions, and an interplay between darkness and light. Common motifs include crime and punishment, the upheaval of traditional moral values, and a pessimistic stance on the meaning of life and on the place of humankind in the universe. Spanning the 1940s and 1950s, the classic film noir era saw the release of many of Hollywood's best-loved studies of shady characters and shadowy underworlds, including Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, Touch of Evil, and The Maltese Falcon. Neo-noir is a somewhat loosely defined genre of films produced after the classic noir era that display the visual or thematic hallmarks of the noir sensibility. The essays collected in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir explore the philosophical implications of neo-noir touchstones such as Blade Runner, Chinatown, Reservoir Dogs, Memento, and the films of the Coen brothers. Through the lens of philosophy, Mark T. Conard and the contributors examine previously obscure layers of meaning in these challenging films. The contributors also consider these neo-noir films as a means of addressing philosophical questions about guilt, redemption, the essence of human nature, and problems of knowledge, memory and identity. In the neo-noir universe, the lines between right and wrong and good and evil are blurred, and the detective and the criminal frequently mirror each other's most debilitating personality traits. The neo-noir detective -- more antihero than hero -- is frequently a morally compromised and spiritually shaken individual whose pursuit of a criminal masks the search for lost or unattainable aspects of the self. Conard argues that the films discussed in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir convey ambiguity, disillusionment, and disorientation more effectively than even the most iconic films of the classic noir era. Able to self-consciously draw upon noir conventions and simultaneously subvert them, neo-noir d~<br>

  Book Title: The Sexual Person-Toward a Renewed Catholic Anthropology<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lawler Michael G.<br>
  Abstract: Two principles capture the essence of the official Catholic position on the morality of sexuality: first, that any human genital act must occur within the framework of heterosexual marriage; second, each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life. In this comprehensive overview of Catholicism and sexuality, theologians Todd A. Salzman and Michael G. Lawler examine and challenge these principles. Remaining firmly within the Catholic tradition, they contend that the church is being inconsistent in its teaching by adopting a dynamic, historically conscious anthropology and worldview on social ethics and the interpretation of scripture while adopting a static, classicist anthropology and worldview on sexual ethics. While some documents from Vatican II, like
      Gaudium et spes("the marital act promotes self-giving by which spouses enrich each other"), gave hope for a renewed understanding of sexuality, the church has not carried out the full implications of this approach. In short, say Salzman and Lawler: emphasize relationships, not acts, and recognize Christianity's historically and culturally conditioned understanding of human sexuality.The Sexual Persondraws historically, methodologically, and anthropologically from the best of Catholic tradition and provides a context for current theological debates between traditionalists and revisionists regarding marriage, cohabitation, homosexuality, reproductive technologies, and what it means to be human. This daring and potentially revolutionary book will be sure to provoke constructive dialogue among theologians, and between theologians and the Magisterium.<br>

  Abstract: Throughout this book we have argued that Catholic sexual morality is institutionalized within the confines of marriage and procreation, and we have examined the foundations of two principles that articulate the essence of that Catholic morality. The first principle states that “any human genital act whatsoever may be placed only within the confines of marriage”;¹ the second states that “each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life.”² In contemporary Catholic moral theology, two approaches to understanding these principles demarcate two schools of Catholic moral theology.

  Book Title: Genuine Multiculturalism-The Tragedy and Comedy of Diversity<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): FOSTER CECIL<br>
  Abstract: While many modern societies are noted for their diversity, the resulting challenge is to determine how citizens from different backgrounds and cultures can see themselves and each other as equals, and be treated equally. In Genuine Multiculturalism, Cecil Foster shows that a society's failure to bridge these differences is the tragedy of modern living and that pretending it is possible to mechanically develop fraternity and solidarity among diverse groups is akin to seeking out comedy. Arguing that genuine multiculturalism is the search for social justice by individuals who have been trapped by ascribed identities or newcomers who have been shut out of perceived ethnic homelands, Foster details how this process, in essence, is the story of the Americas. Reconceptionalizing the terms of multiculturalism, he offers an intervention into Canada's claim that its definition and practice are based on recognizing equality of citizenship. Identifying genuine multiculturalism as an ongoing work in progress, rather than a tightly defined policy position, Foster challenges readers to imagine a greater and more harmonious ideal. A necessary theoretical reconsideration of diversity within society, Genuine Multiculturalism refocuses the debate about ideals and practices in modern societies.<br>

  Book Title: The Cinema of Attractions Reloaded-  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Strauven Wanda<br>
  Abstract: What have Lumière in common with Wachowski? More than one hundred years separate these two pairs of brothers who astonished, quite similarly, the film spectator of their respective time with special effects of movement: a train rushing into the audience and a bullet flying in slow motion. Do they belong to the same family of "cinema of attractions"? Twenty years ago Tom Gunning introduced the phrase "cinema of attractions" to define the essence of the earliest films made between 1895 and 1906. His term scored an immediate success, even outside the field of early cinema. The present anthology questions the attractiveness and usefulness of the term for both pre-classical and post-classical cinema. With contributions by the most prominent scholars of this discipline (such as Tom Gunning, André Gaudreault, Thomas Elsaesser, Charles Musser, Scott Bukatman and Vivian Sobchack) this volume offers a kaleidoscopic overview of an important historiographical debate.

  Abstract: Tolstoy’s authorial personality, even in the antipoetic guise quoted above, was the fruit of much thought and creative imagination. He considered how his fiction created a public perception of him, and realized that perception would affect how people read his fiction. A work of literature invariably presents some kind of image of the author to the reader, and publication is an opportunity for authors to shape and manage their presentation of a self. What kind of self does Tolstoy craft for his reader? Neither an entirely accessible, unmediated essence (an ideal of the diary), nor an opaque and impersonal source<br>

  Abstract: Instead of carrying a photograph of his wife Patricia in his wallet, the Canadian neurophilosopher Paul Churchland has a scan of her brain. As passionate advocates of eliminative materialism, the couple view psychological phenomena such as belief, hope and love as constructions of the imagination. It is their contention that, in essence, the brain comprises merely the interaction between the neurons contained therein. Believing in a human mind is the same as believing that the earth is flat.<br>

  Abstract: This article offers several preliminary views on the sources of Soviet authoritarianism, which I seek to locate within the popular culture of the prerevolutionary peasantry. The essence of my hypothesis rests on a fundamental reality of life in the prerevolutionary Russian countryside: authoritarian relations served as the basic model for all interpersonal relations among peasants, including social relations. This was a result of the fact that the peasantry’s primary social institutions—the family and the commune—were authoritarian, cultivating, through socialization, authoritarian personalities.

  Abstract: Griesinger and Kraepelin qualified paranoia as one of the three major psychotic disorders, together with schizophrenia and manic-depressive psychosis (Griesinger 1845, Kraepelin 1915). In psychoanalytic thinking, paranoia even became the paradigmatic form of psychosis. Freud’s only case-studies of psychotic patients, for instance, were devoted to paranoid individuals (Freud 1911, Freud 1915). Jacques Lacan (1988), and to a lesser degree Melanie Klein (1946), pursued this line of thinking by considering paranoia as the essence of the psychotic process (Roudinesco & Plon 1997). Contemporary psychiatric nosography, however, handles schizophrenia as the central taxon. In fact, schizophrenia has become a more or less generic<br>

  Book Title: Scientific Understanding-Philosophical Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Eigner Kai<br>
  Abstract: To most scientists, and to those interested in the sciences, understanding is the ultimate aim of scientific endeavor. In spite of this, understanding, and how it is achieved, has received little attention in recent philosophy of science.
      Scientific Understandingseeks to reverse this trend by providing original and in-depth accounts of the concept of understanding and its essential role in the scientific process. To this end, the chapters in this volume explore and develop three key topics: understanding and explanation, understanding and models, and understanding in scientific practice.Earlier philosophers, such as Carl Hempel, dismissed understanding as subjective and pragmatic. They believed that the essence of science was to be found in scientific theories and explanations. In Scientific Understanding, the contributors maintain that we must also consider the relation between explanations and the scientists who construct and use them. They focus on understanding as the cognitive state that is a goal of explanation and on the understanding of theories and models as a means to this end.The chapters in this book highlight the multifaceted nature of the process of scientific research. The contributors examine current uses of theory, models, simulations, and experiments to evaluate the degree to which these elements contribute to understanding. Their analyses pay due attention to the roles of intelligibility, tacit knowledge, and feelings of understanding. Furthermore, they investigate how understanding is obtained within diverse scientific disciplines and examine how the acquisition of understanding depends on specific contexts, the objects of study, and the stated aims of research.<br>

When a writer, a painter, or a film director presents a scene, he or she must define a setting for the act. But creating a place is the primal act of architecture, and consequently these artists unknowingly perform the task of an architect. Unaware of the professional rules of the discipline, they approach the mental dimensions of architectural experience and, hence, reveal the phenomenological basis of the art<br>

As we saw in the last chapter, it was for this reason that Foucault felt uncomfortable with Deleuze’s use of desire, albeit subverted. A number of interpreters – Žižek chief among them – have since made this the basis of their critique of Deleuze and the micropolitics of immanence. It is essentially argued that by virtue of retaining desire as a primordial ‘micro’ essence or pre-social multiplicity, Deleuze ends up viewing power as a negative force concomitant with the macro<br>

  Abstract: The previous chapter ended with a dilemma: if the human is that ‘living being’ which can actually be separated from what once was held to be its essence, that is, ‘language’, what possible effectivity – whether of diagnosis or treatment – is left to psychoanalysis? The ongoing psychiatric, pharmaceutical and philosophical assault against psychoanalysis is one thing; the loss of its very basis for being is quite another. The first, as I have shown throughout this book, is hardly the threat to psychoanalysis that it is often supposed to be; but the second would be fatal. The second, in fact,<br>

  Book Title: Staging Philosophy-Intersections of Theater, Performance, and Philosophy<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Saltz David Z.<br>
  Abstract: The fifteen original essays in
      Staging Philosophymake useful connections between the discipline of philosophy and the fields of theater and performance and use these insights to develop new theories about theater. Each of the contributors-leading scholars in the fields of performance and philosophy-breaks new ground, presents new arguments, and offers new theories that will pave the way for future scholarship.Staging Philosophyraises issues of critical importance by providing case studies of various philosophical movements and schools of thought, including aesthetics, analytic philosophy, phenomenology, deconstruction, critical realism, and cognitive science. The essays, which are organized into three sections-history and method, presence, and reception-take up fundamental issues such as spectatorship, empathy, ethics, theater as literature, and the essence of live performance. While some essays challenge assertions made by critics and historians of theater and performance, others analyze the assumptions of manifestos that prescribe how practitioners should go about creating texts and performances. The first book to bridge the disciplines of theater and philosophy,Staging Philosophywill provoke, stimulate, engage, and ultimately bring theater to the foreground of intellectual inquiry while it inspires further philosophical investigation into theater and performance.David Krasneris Associate Professor of Theater Studies, African American Studies, and English at Yale University.

Does it mean that one of the two terms (hospitality) concerns our relation to the living and the other (mourning) our memory of the dead? Or, on the contrary, should we not say instead that the one term cannot be conceptualized without the other?

We are actually witnessing a perplexing evolution characterized by the always more profound denial of the very essence of the Freudian discovery and its foundation—namely, the existence of the images created by autoerotic sexuality, i.e., the unconscious (infantile) images—Bild[er]—that shape the dream as well as the neurotic symptom, and even psychosis.

Neither nation nor ethnicity is an immanent force, an essence within history, destined for eventual recuperation.

The object of this campaign, the formation of a reading public composed of the enslaved, the free blacks of the North, and the women of the abolition movement, was decried by the enemies of abolition as the essence of jacobinism, or, alternately, hailed by the sympathizers of the cause as the resurgence of a people.

An active engagement policy is badly needed on the peninsula, but in order to overcome some of the most difficult existing security dilemmas, the policy must integrate an understanding and appreciation of difference. Democracy is crucial to this endeavor too, for in its essence a democratic ethos is all about finding ways of appreciating and redeeming difference.

  Book Title: Sanctioning Modernism-Architecture and the Making of Postwar Identities<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): Steiner Frederick<br>
  Abstract: In the decades following World War II, modern architecture spread around the globe alongside increased modernization, urbanization, and postwar reconstruction—and it eventually won widespread acceptance. But as the limitations of conventional conceptions of modernism became apparent, modern architecture has come under increasing criticism. In this collection of essays, experienced and emerging scholars take a fresh look at postwar modern architecture by asking what it meant to be "modern," what role modern architecture played in constructing modern identities, and who sanctioned (or was sanctioned by) modernism in architecture.This volume presents focused case studies of modern architecture in three realms—political, religious, and domestic—that address our very essence as human beings. Several essays explore developments in Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia and document a modernist design culture that crossed political barriers, such as the Iron Curtain, more readily than previously imagined. Other essays investigate various efforts to reconcile the concerns of modernist architects with the traditions of the Roman Catholic Church and other Christian institutions. And a final group of essays looks at postwar homebuilding in the United States and demonstrates how malleable and contested the image of the American home was in the mid-twentieth century. These inquiries show the limits of canonical views of modern architecture and reveal instead how civic institutions, ecclesiastical traditions, individual consumers, and others sought to sanction the forms and ideas of modern architecture in the service of their respective claims or desires to be modern.<br>

Boyle had stated that only a portion of the original matter is necessary for a resurrected body to be the same as a terrestrial body. As Nieuwentijt did a few years later, Clarke identified this portion with the filaments that, in Malpighi’s embryology, function as the rudiments of mature organisms.

Abstract: The icon is properly an icon so long as it fails in none of those attributes which we perceive in the archetype … therefore, since one of the attributes we contemplate in the Divine nature is incomprehensibility of essence (τὸ 'ακατάληπτον τῆς οὐσίας), it is clearly necessary that in this point the icon should be able to show its imitation of the archetype. For if, while the archetype transcends comprehension, the nature of the icon were comprehended, the contrary character of the attributes we behold in them would prove the defect of the icon; but since the nature of our mind, which is according to the icon of the Creator (τῷ κατ' εἰκόνα του κτίσαντος), evades our knowledge, it keeps an accurate resemblance to the superior nature, retaining the imprint of the incomprehensible [fixed] by the unknown within it (τῷ καθ` ἑαυτόν 'αγνώστῳ).

         124Because Braudel, always the schoolteacher, so emphasized his brief against biographical history, critics have often claimed that the delineation of limits and constraints inThe Mediterraneandevalues politics and events and leaves the book devoid of individual freedom.125Such misrepresentations distort the history that Braudel really presented: “The dangers of a social history are clear to us all, and in particular the danger of forgetting, in contemplation of the deep currents in the lives of men, each separate man grappling with his own life and his own destiny; the danger of forgetting, perhaps even of denying, the inimitable essence of each individual.”126For Braudel, the lessons of World War II demanded remembering both the forces acting upon each individual and individual acts freely chosen.127Braudel’sMéditerranéewas a call to arms: “The catastrophes and revolutions, dramas and surprises” of his time revealed “the social reality, the fundamental reality of man … in an entirely new light,” which in turn required a new history, a problem‐oriented and global, total history.128It was a new history slow to be understood, little to be appreciated, and rarely to be practiced in the Anglo‐American world remembering a different past and fighting different battles in the 1950s and 1960s. On the question of individual freedom, however, Braudel’s history of the sixteenth‐century Mediterranean is very similar to the work of its most brilliant contemporary political analyst, Machiavelli. We might recall the wily Florentine exile’s astute judgment when we reread the last words of Braudel’s penultimate paragraph in the second edition: “I would conclude with the paradox that the true man of action is he who can measure most nearly the constraints upon him, who chooses to~<br>

Abstract: Some qualifications of the claims implicit in this schema: (1) I have not attempted to offer an exhaustive account of the genres of writing in modernity, only to suggest how these genres might be regarded epistemically; (2) it is of the essence of modernity that the “central” role of information means that discrete bits of information are crucial across the entire spectrum, obviously so in the scholarly and scientific disciplines, but even in the domain of literature, which in both its modern and postmodern forms has been forced to respond in deep ways to the social condition of information overload; (3) the aim of a generic analysis, which is what I am attempting here, is to understand what writing looks like when the claims to truth or knowledge are subordinated to the task of transmitting information. This definitional proscription distinguishes even journalism from purely informational genres, by virtue of the fact that in journalism strands of opinion and entertainment are bundled with transmitted information; (4) I have not distinguished the report from the memo in this essay because I would argue that the report increasingly takes on the generic features of the memo, while freely appropriating elements from legal, scholarly, and scientific writing. The report has affinities with the premodern form of the treatise, the generic precursor for both scholarly and scientific writing in modernity.<br>

Abstract: According to Paul Ricoeur, the abolition of the literal interpretation in the metaphorical statement gives rise to a reinterpretation of reality itself.
         48Recalling Aristotle’s paradoxical claim that tragic poetry pre‐sents the essence of human action through the creation of a fictitious plot ormuthos(thatmimesisandmuthosare brought together in the activity of tragicpoesis),49Ricoeur maintains that the reinterpretation called forth by metaphorical discourse is at once imaginative and imitative, fresh and creative, and yet true to the reality that is metaphorically described.<br>

Abstract: Through his emphasis on essence, being, interpretation, perception, self and other, and intentionality, Budd [
         3] seems to situate his work within the tradition that takes consciousness as the primary reality. We see, for example, that he offers the following: “The framework that will be articulated … is admittedly somewhat eliminativist; it does, through evaluation, turn us from paths (such as deterministic scientism) that lead nowhere. That said, the framework not only allows, but necessitates, examination of the essential elements of our work” [3, p. 247]. Assuming my interpretation is correct and remembering that the clarity of his ideas may very well be compromised given that the tradition he espouses is a less coherent one than the “deterministic scientism” he rejects, we could nevertheless conclude that he gives prominence to “elements” and not to process. In other words, there is little emphasis on the interpretive process whereby new meaning is created; the dynamics are neglected despite his contention that part of the goal for librarianship is “the organization of information to enhance meaning” [3, p. 1].<br>

Abstract: Critical Inquiryis a journal dedicated to debate, dialogue, and controversy. We may hope for the elevated, disinterested discourse of angels, but we have to settle for the passionate engaged voices of men and women in real historical situations.… Once a question of general urgency has been raised, we would not presume to dictate inflexible limits of propriety or to rely unquestioningly on appeals to the authority of experts. In this policy of critical tolerance of polemic, we find ourselves aligned with William Hazlitt: “passion … is the essence, the chief ingredient in moral truth.”2<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In this chapter, Ricoeur displays an artful capacity to inspire the ongoing research on recognition. Many contemporary thinkers have chosen to shun the troubling question of “What is it that must be recognized?” with something akin to an institutional approach: the answer would not lie in discovering the essence of recognition but, instead, in finding a creative approach to the negotiation of recognition claims. This approach is clearly the one preferred in the defense of multiculturalism. For instance, Will Kymlicka emphasizes the design of fair “structures of culture” that are distinguished from substantial “characters of culture” (Will Kymlicka,
      Liberalism, Community, and Culture[New York: Clarendon, 1989], 167). The idea behind this separation of political from more substantive problems is, most of the time, congruent with considerations about the pluralism of worldviews and the public role of philosophy. Yet this approach, however sound it may be, has displaced deep conflicts in the hands of institutional “designs” that are guided by the need for immediate results, which are likely to shade important issues.<br>

Article Title: European Memories: Jan Patočka and Jacques Derrida on Responsibility<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: How does Derrida respond to this conception of responsibility, a conception that is entirely heterogeneous to the Greek one and to the tradition to which it gave rise, one that he has characterized as “the most convincing and convinced
      doxa”? In seeking to answer this question, let us bear in mind that the Platonic idea of responsibility is the beginning of the genealogy of responsibility in Europe, of the European tradition of thinking about responsibility, although it is, according to Patočka, to be entirely replaced by the Christian model. But the Christian version of responsibility is also part of European memory, which thus consists of at least two different memories regarding what constitutes responsibility, despite Patočka’s description of Christian responsibility as thoroughly heterogeneous to its Greek antecedent. Further, since the lingering presence of Platonism in Christianity has prevented a full rupture with the Greek model of responsibility that Christianity is to accomplish, the break with this tradition must be completed if the very essence or future of Europe is ever to be realized. Yet, as we saw at the beginning of this essay, for Derrida the concept of responsibility makes no sense whatsoever without an experience of inheritance. Consequently, responsibility is first and foremost a responsibility for and to the specific traditions of responsibility that have been bequeathed to us. It is, first and foremost, a responsibility before any particular responsibilities to oneself, the other, God, the animal, the world, and so forth. Such responsibility does not exclude selection and critique. But would not any attempt to ignore, reject, or break with one of those legacies be tantamount to irresponsibility? Indeed, if responsibility is first of all a responsibility for and to an inheritance, to abandon or to deliberately renounce a part of the tradition in its entirety would be the gravest irresponsibility, all the more so in the case of a part of~<br>

Even Riffaterre's approach to the structuring unsaid of textual writing can be seen to represent on its own terms a shift from the ontology of narrative toward its epistemology at the level of form rather than content. By the deliberate provocation of his title, his semiotic narratology is interested not just in the structural essence of fiction as art but in its specific

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: Prayer is, after all, enunciated when our ability to respond and reply (existentially and ethically, as well as linguistically) is most at stake and most fearfully close to failure. If prayer is the performative utterance of faith, then faith ultimately demands the enunciation of a being‐for‐God that, by definition, we are not, and hence one we struggle to articulate with the language at hand. And if the essence of the religious is “the reverence of the invisible,” then prayer is caught up in the visible order of the understanding that marks the human separation from God: “Words force us to speak metaphorically … in the language of the
         eye” (N5411, fol. 44v).52Attempts to articulate a relationship with the divine must be drawn out of human experience marked by a chasm of separation. As Coleridge comments in 1829, “I know indeed, that his ways are not our ways nor his Thoughts our Thoughts.” Yet the struggle against the limits of language must be made: “How can I love him, trust in him, call on him,but as a Man?” (N6155, emphasis mine).53Thus, while Coleridge may indeed believe that language is as potentially sacramental as the moral law or reason, we should also remember the human subject’s intrinsic distance from all three. The finitude of the human subject grounds language in the world, meaning that articulating a response to a call breaking the borders of that world can be as difficult as willing the response in the first place.<br>

Abstract: Abdullah Azzam, a mentor to bin Laden, wrote in his “Martyrs: The Building Blocks of Nations” (
               http://www.religioscope.com/info/doc/jihad/azzam_martyrs.htm): “History does not write its lines except with blood. Glory does not build its loft[y] edifice except with skulls. Honor and respect cannot be established except on a foundation of cripples and corpses. Empires, distinguished peoples, states and societies cannot be established with examples. Indeed those who think that they can change reality or change societies without blood, sacrifices and invalids, without pure, innocent souls, do not understand the essence of this Deen [Islam] and they do not know the method of the best of Messengers [Muhammad].” David Cook (“Suicide Attacks”) points out how forced it is to construe this sentiment as truly Islamic. Nonetheless, he also points out that in the face of adversity Muslims frequently characterize their community as one that is indifferent to death, in opposition to polytheists who love life.<br>

Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: It seems that one way of addressing Agamben’s concerns would follow from stating that Aristotle does not define the political in essence but distinguishes it on the basis of its appearance, eschewing any attempt to get at the being of the political. Readers of Aristotle are divided on this matter. See the following examinations of Aristotle’s definition of politics: John M. Cooper, “Political Animals and Civic Friendship,” in

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: There are two reasons for this. The first is that he is trying to protect his own interpretation as foundational and fundamental. Second, the strain between Lévinas's two strategies of reading is indicative of a more fundamental tension between building up the Jewish community and the impulse to make Judaism universally applicable. When Lévinas emphasizes the plurivocity of the text, he consistently speaks of the renewal of the Jewish people. In these passages there is no mention of the universalization of Judaism. When he universalizes the category, he also deemphasizes the text's plurivocity, prioritizing its philosophical essence. As Moshe Halbertal has shown, the emphasis on rabbinic plurivocity goes hand in hand with other strategies of policing the border of the community. Without a clear demarcation of who has the authority to engage in interpretation, the principle of interpretive openness threatens to disrupt community cohesion.
         23Conversely, Lévinas's universalization of Judaism can only function meaningfully if agreement can be established concerning the tradition's core teachings. Otherwise, there can be no clear criteria for association or identification.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 656725<br>
Date: 01 01, 2011<br>
Author(s): Pranger Burcht<br>
Abstract: If that is indeed the case, it is our historical duty to realize that the rhetoric of
      Confessionscomprises both sound and silence to the effect that the fullness of voice can sound in such a way that it is possible to say about Augustine—and his reader—that he “did not hear [its] silence.” Is that perhaps the essence of the fact that what Augustine is looking for cannot but be a momentary gift and that the rhetoric of this search in all its loudness comes down to shaping the fact that it cannot be ascertained, beyond the “speech act” ofconfessioitself, whether that which is given sounds or not? Saying this, we do not find ourselves in the realm of mystical silence. We are, rather, faced with the demands of rhetorical precision. For to establish the magic of a language of desire that is given—a language with the power of Kafka's hammer of the facts of life in the shape of the song of the Sirens—confessiohas to be framed and shaped, dramatized and theatricalized. Consequently, the possibility has to be taken into account that the phrase “Ulysses did not hear the silence of the Sirens” is not the final word about the matter, just as the dialectic of speech and silence cannot be taken to function as an automatism.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, I have attempted to elucidate the embodied logic of pollution as depicted in the Hebrew Bible. Contrary to the dominant tendency to search for a unifed abstract logic which underlies the purity laws, I have aimed to show that these rules were based on a series of distinct models of contagion, including uncleanness, infection and the stain of bloodshed and sexual misdeeds. These models were based on schemas of recurrent human experiences and involved a correlation between a perceptible phenomenon (stain, odor, etc.) and an unseen essence (pollution). In particular, I have focused on the laws of abnormal genital discharges in Leviticus 15, corpse impurity in Numbers 19, and leprosy in Leviticus 13–14, all of which were based in folk conceptions of infection. Through surveys of philological, ethnographic and historical evidence, I have shown that similar models are attested cross-culturally throughout the ancient and modern worlds.<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: The importance of evil for the study of morality is further highlighted in one more recent anthropological piece that explicitly treats it. In a reflection on abuses by the American military against captives in the prison at Abu Ghraib during the second Iraq war, Caton (
         2010) suggests that anthropology would be well served in some instances to go beyond describing actions as unethical to take seriously the category of evil, and not only as an indigenous cultural category but as an interpretive analytic category. This does not require conceptualizing evil as a universal or transcendent category and is more fruitful with a notion of “situational evil” that identifies the specificity or singularity of evil in discrete events and the manner in which evil or ethical conduct emerges in the way actors construe and respond to those situations. Caton’s rehabilitation of evil as an analytic category corresponds to the strategy of seeking the “essence of the particular” as a way of rehabilitating the concept that does not presume a definition of essence as universal and invariant (Csordas2004). Drawing on the work of Hannah Arendt, he suggests that anthropological consideration of evil in its singularity can be successful by going beyond the issues of intentionality and contingency to include responsibility, will, and moral judgment. This is a promising and forward-looking proposal; here I want to complement it by turning back to the anthropological literature on witchcraft with an eye to how evil has been recognized (or not) and conceptualized (or not), and with the intuition that this literature may offer either something to build on or something to critically surpass in our theorizing of morality in anthropology.

Article Title: Milton’s “Unoriginal” Voice: Quotation Marks in<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673750<br>
Date: 08 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Hequembourg Stephen<br>
Abstract: Hanford, whose edition I cite, clearly segregates the three intersecting voices through his use of double and single quotation marks. But do these marks adequately reflect what happens in this climactic scene? Stanley Fish describes it: “‘Tempt not the Lord thy God; he said.’ Who said? The Son, of course, since the sounds issue from his mouth, but the words are not his…except in the sense that he has identified himself with their speaker. It is not that he appropriates the words, but that they, and their source, appropriate him.”
         
               The great critical question about these two lines is whether, when Jesus says “Tempt not the Lord thy God,” he simply means the Father or whether he now understands his true identity and is essentially telling Satan, “don’t tempt me.”43
            
               Fish’s reading is helpful because it redirects the thorny theological questions of substance, essence, and consubstantiation to the simpler question of quotation. The Son is able to speak the words of the Father so selflessly that he merges with the divine source, becoming the Word of God. We might say that Jesus begins the sentence in quotation marks but that the Son concludes them in his own voice—just as Adam begins speaking the words of Satan only to discover that they are unfortunately his own. In both cases, Milton demands something beyond the powers of our everyday typographical equipment. What we need in such instances is a mark to signify diminishing quotation—the process whereby words attributed to another gradually become, in the act of enunciation, the speaker’s own. If44
            Paradise Lostillustrates how easily this may happen in the case of satanic speech,Paradise Regainedoffers the possibility that it can work in the opposite direction. When the Son speaks, the divisive quotes miraculously slip away as the human and the divine merge in the space of a single utterance. This is the nature of real union with God on the poem: you start qu~<br>

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: According to Badiou, the event is logical rather than phenomenological, which is to say, it draws from presentation itself. Thus the initial intervention is purely “of the order of declaration.”
            
                  It does not declare the meaning of an event, but it simply and emphatically declares the fact of its having happened: “there is an event, it has consequences, and these consequences need to be faithfully elaborated in relation to the status quo that has been interrupted.”107
               
                  From the conditions of his own “conversion” Paul draws the consequence that one can only begin from the declaration of the resurrection being the “real of faith,” a declaration that is in essence subjective, for no preconstituted subset can support it.108
               
                  The apostle must be accountable only for what others see and hear, that is, for his or her declaration.109
               
                  It is the essence of faith to publicly declare itself; even though private conviction is required, only the public confession of faith installs the subject in the perspective of salvation.110
               
                  The truth of a declaration, being without proof or visibility, emerges at that point where knowledge, be it empirical or conceptual, breaks down. Hence Paul’s “antiphilosophy”: apostolic declaration stems from and gives expression to a pure fidelity toward the possibility opened by the event.111
               
                  If truths lack objective strength, then their substance must be provided by the subjective persistence of fidelity that supplies the truth procedure with consistency.112
               
                  The substance of truth is faith. Fidelity is to be seen not as “a capacity, a subjective quantity, or a virtue” but as “a functional relation to an event.”113
               
                  Miller rightly points out that “whether finitude or infinity prevails depends o~<br>

Article Title: Figures of Pain in Early Modern English Tragedy<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673118<br>
Date: 09 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Huth Kimberly<br>
Abstract: Webster’s play, more than any other surveyed here, links the very genre of tragedy to metaphorical thinking. His self-conscious engagement with the genre incorporates both tragic action and tragic reflection or interpretation. That is to say, Webster integrates his own Bradley-like critics into the play itself, making room for both the pessimistic figure of pain and the redemptivist response to it, offering multiple options for affective response to the audience. His universe is one of doubt and uncertainty, and the play seems to be suggesting that metaphor—with all the issues of imprecision and distortion that accompany associative thinking—is an apt cognitive process for facing the tragic world. In the imagery of poison as fire, plays like
      Women, Beware Womenuse association to convey both sensory information and thematic significance. InKing Lear, Shakespeare’s characters speak in metaphors that build on sensory experience to process spiritual truth. But inThe Duchess of Malfi, metaphor becomes, in essence, the only way of knowing because the play continually undermines the veracity of sense perception. Over the course of the play, the Duchess has three children. Numerous characters see her pregnant body, and yet Bosola, employed to spy on her, still must seek further proof that she is with child. At one point, he feeds her unripe apricots, which cause her to go into labor. To conceal her condition and confuse Bosola, a rumor is circulated that she was poisoned—a reinterpretation of her pain that is so effective that even Bosola fears that the apricots might have been poisoned without his knowledge (2.2.31–32).
            And in the final act, the Duchess’s brother the Cardinal is murdered as his guards stand just outside the door, listening to his cries for help. But they had been told by the Cardinal himself that he would “faigne [him]self in danger” (5.4.15), and so they refuse to be taken in by what they think is his counterfeiting.

Abstract: Closely related to the philosophical problem of consciousness of time was the question of the meaning of time and duration in psychology and in literature. Although Mooij mentions William James's notion of “specious present” in passing, he fails to explicate James's perception of time, which attempted to provide an empiricist account of our temporal concepts through the influence of John Locke (p. 197). Apart from this caveat, the book's strength lies in its perceptiveness and breadth of interpretation of the history of the concept of time. Mooij's accuracy in comprehending and in transmitting the essence of such difficult and complicated philosophies is remarkable.<br>

Article Title: “The Pebble in the Water”<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: jm.2014.31.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2014<br>
Author(s): Cochran Timothy B.<br>
Abstract: In volume six of
         Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d’ornithologie, Olivier Messiaen uses the phrase “the pebble in the water” to identify a class of especially stark rhythmic contrasts in Debussy’s music that feature long durations interrupted by rapid rhythms. He invests these contrasts with an expressive logic built around the concept of shock—that is, the sudden stimulation of a static context by an outside presence. Messiaen unites various images—both natural and psychological—around this expressive pattern via analogy, suggesting that its essence is transferrable within a network of associated metaphors. Although for the most part in volume six Messiaen refrains from linking interpretations of Debussy with his own music, many of his rhythmic contrasts manifest the same expressive logic that he ascribes to Debussy’s music, particularly durational events that signify the interjection of birdsong within serene environments and that signal the striking appearance of divine power on earth. In addition to stylistic and semiotic correlations, the logic of shock theorized for the pebble in the water recurs more abstractly in Messiaen’s idiomatic views on musical experience and spiritual encounter. His interpretation of rhythmic contrast bears the marks of his more general aesthetics of shock, which in turn can be read as a reorientation of a broader modernist hermeneutic.<br>

cal interest groups imply controversy and conflict, the essence of politics. For
those who abhor conflict in any form, who long for some past or future golden
age of perfect harmony, these consequences of group activity are alone sufficient
to provoke denunciation." The Government Process (New York, 1958), pp.
502-503

Abstract: En considérant la théâtralité moins comme l'essence du théâtre, lui-même haut lieu de la mimésis, que comme sa condition d'émergence, nous voulons mettre en évidence ce qui pourrait la révéler par-delà le texte et la scène: altérité, imprésentabilité, féminité. Bien que liée intimement au lieu et au jeu de la représentation, impliquant acteurs, spectateurs et décors, la théâtralité se présentera plus comme un lieu de créativité, un espace transitionnel où se joue (de) la vérité. On en en mesurera l'enjeu à travers une relecture intertextuelle de La naissance de la tragédie et de fragments posthumes de la même période, en interrogeant la légitimité d'un instinct théâtral qui serait l'une des formes essentielles du Kunsttrieb dont le destin est de procéder à une métaphorisation de « Dionysos agissant » et à une poétisation dévoilante de la vérité dont l'acteur deviendra finalement l'interprète en cela même qu'il en joue sur le mode de l'absence et qu'il ouvre un texte vers cet autre qui ne s'y présente jamais comme tel. Considering theatrality less as the essence of theatre, which is the high place for Mimesis, than the condition of its emergence, we would like to bring to force what could express it above text and performance: alterity, impresentability, feminity. Even if it seems closely related to place and acting of the representation, including the actors, the spectator and the setting, theatrality will prove to be a place for creativity, a transitional space in which truth can be performed. We will assess its stakes through a second intertextual reading of The Birth of Tragedy and of posthumous extracts from the same period; we can at the same time wonder over the legitimacy of a theatral instinct which would be one of the essential forms of the « Kunstriels »; its fate is to act as a metaphor of an « acting Dionysos » and to a revealing poetisation of truth for which the actor eventually turns out to be the interpret in so far as he plays on it on being absent ~<br>

Abstract: The works of Tiryakian, Bruyn and Douglas are examined as representative of "phenomenological sociology." Radical problems are discovered in their use of key concepts in phenomenology: intention, reduction, phenomenon and essence. These problems are shown to arise out of a failure to grasp the nature of the phenomenological enterprise and its relationship to sociology. Turning back to the original formulation of this relationship by Husserl, we discover problems of transcendental intersubjectivity, of type and essence, and of objectivism. We then point out the existence of sociologies which do not share the shortcomings of what is called phenomenological sociology, yet which make use of the perspective and approach of phenomenology. We then focus on one of these sociologies, ethnomethodology in its relation to phenomenology. We find parallels in their methodology and domains of inquiry, and divergency in their approaches to intersubjectivity.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this essay is to define the nature of the metaphor in Berdiczewski's novel Miriam (1921). For this purpopse I examine the short story included in Miriam about the scholar who was studying a book entitled The Gate of Heaven. Comparing this story with other literary texts which present a hero who stands in a mystical or philosophical sense before the gate of Heaven illuminates the historic-generative essence of the above metaphor. Using the theoretical and methodological system developed by three scholars (P. Ricuer, D. Schon and B. Indurkyia) to follow the metaphorical process, I attempt to show that Berdiczewski's metaphors are not only figures of speech; they form our essential cultural and historical cognition (tolada in Hebrew). I therefore suggest applying to Berdiczewski's metaphor the form 'historic-generative metaphor.'<br>

Article Title: Is the simile a metaphor? / הדימוי בשירה — איך זה עובד?<br>

Abstract: The paper examines the process of figurative reading in the presence of a marker (like / as), namely the unique cognitive impact caused by shaping figurative expressions as similes. The solution is sought through theoretical discussion and analysis of relevant excerpts from Hebrew poetry. Recently Bethlehem argued that a simile does not necessarily indicate the presence of resemblance of some sort; the simile only presents itself as such via its marker, like/as, but actually it can bear a variety of figurative relations, of which metaphoric relations are only one possible option. Consequently, simile has only coincidental relations with metaphor, if any (Bethlehem, 1996: 1997) First I address this criticism, trying to reinforce the widespread view that a simile is indeed a sub-type of metaphor, and that there is no fundamental difference between them, that is, comprehension processes in metaphor and simile are basically similar. Next I distinguish the simile from the literal comparison in a new comprehensive way. Finally I try to identify and study the special impression a figurative expression might create as a result of being shaped as a simile. Despite this basic sameness of simile and metaphor, the marker's presence in a simile has its unique cognitive effects, accumulating to a distinctive impact. I analyze the unique cognitive effects potentially evolved during the construction process of the simile's meaning. In this analysis this paper reexamines central issues pertaining to similes, their essence, and the cognitive processes they trigger in readers. Among these I focus on a problem never thoroughly explored so far: the essential nature of the coexistence of similarity and dissimilarity (without working against each other) in both metaphor and simile.<br>

Abstract: Between the sixties and the eighties metaphysics has been in a state of crisis; logic and the human sciences seemed to have taken over. The last few years have, however, witnessed a return of metaphysics. Having first called to mind some of the features of the aforetold crisis and evoked some recent authors, the article proceeds to show how reflexive metaphysics is capable of integrating the demands of the physical sciences and mathematics, and through them of building up the idea of being. A constitutive requirement of this idea is that epistemology and its categories of objectivity be surpassed through the affirmation of the other, whose existence and essence are the fundamental categories of transcendence. The ethical experience is surpassed in its turn, in such a way that through transcendence a fulness may manifest itself; the doctrine of analogy and the transcendentals opens the understanding of that fulness.

Abstract: Dès ses premiers écrits, Lonergan a été attentif à la dimension d'amitié qui caractérise les ordres trinitaire et créé. L'homme est par essence ouvert au delà de lui-même; ne pouvant pas coïncider à soi, il est appelé à quelque conversion. La pensée moderne, qui par contre l'a prétendu capable de présence à soi; soutint l'individualisme où le rapport à l'autre devenait instrumental. La réaction postmoderne, qui accentue l'idée d''autre', réveille la conscience à ses traits plus humains, en favorisant en même temps un retour à la tradition philosophique et théologique sur l'amitié, où d'ailleurs son idée d''autre' se voit elle-même enrichie. La réflexion thomiste sur la charité comme amitié divine est ici décisive. Lonergan la reprend en explicitant l'essence du corps mystique. L'attention à l'expérience concrète invite enfin à conduire la réflexion jusqu'au plan de l'éducation, d'où on ne peut pas abstraire l'exigence du don de soi, à l'exemple du Christ qu'y s'est abaissé jusqu'à nous. From his earliest writings Lonergan was attentive to the friendship dimension that marks the trinitarian and created orders. Humanity remains essentially open to what is beyond itself: unable to coincide with itself, it is called to some conversion. Modern thought by contrast has focussed on self-presence, thus giving rise to individualism where relationship to others becomes instrumental. The reaction of the post-modern is to underline the idea of the 'other', awaking conscience to more human traits, thus promoting a retrieval of a philosophical and theological tradition on friendship. In this way the idea of the 'other' finds itself enriched and Thomist reflection on charity as divine friendship becomes crucial. Lonergan adapts this tradition to explain the essence of the mystical body. Attention to concrete experience pushes us to extend our reflection to the level of education, where one cannot ignore the requirement for self-giving, on the example of Christ who lowered himself t~<br>

Abstract: Johann Georg Hamann saw the written word of God as the ultimate consequence of his incarnation. The biblical texts as well also carry the death of Christ in their essence as a figure of incarnation. Roland Barthes called the process of putting these texts into writing, by which the text gains autonomy in relation to the author, the "death of the author". In terms of the theology of the Holy Scriptures, this idea can be connected to the way people have been talking about the death of God in the modern age. One must however distinguish between the death of the author and the death of the text. This occurs when exegesis does not want to accept the death of the author. When however during reading there is a new understanding of biblical texts, this means to a certain extent their resurrection.<br>

Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23615377<br>

Author(s): YANG CHUNG FANG<br>
Abstract: As a major source of social values in East Asia, Confucianism assumes especial significance amidst the proliferation of instrumental rationality in modern societies. This study attempts to answer the question: how Confucian are contemporary Chinese? By way of constructing an ideal type of Confucian actors, which is then applied to a survey of three Chinese communities, this study tries to formulate a new perspective in depicting the character of modern Confucian actors, measured in terms of their dynamic proximity to the Confucian ideal type. Our approach marks a shift of emphasis, both empirically and methodologically, compared with previous work on this topic. On the empirical side, our study breaks with the long-standing, classical distinction between the 'gentleman' and the 'commoner' prevalent in Confucian discourse. Degrees of proximity to Confucian values are viewed in representational—i.e. non-evaluative—terms. In constructing the ideal type of Confucian actors, we distinguish between formal and substantive values in Confucianism. This analytical distinction allows our study to demonstrate the continued relevance of Confucianism. While substantive values change over time, the formal, analytical core that captures the essence of Confucianism continues to survive in the face of the vicissitudes of modernity and the spread of instrumental rationality.<br>

Abstract: Néanmoins l'analyse critique de la pensée de Hobbes par Léo Strauss est tout à fait per-
tinente. C'est avec l'auteur du Léviathan que s'effectuerait le grand tournant fondateur du libé-
ralisme. Poussés par la peur de la mort violente, les individus décident de passer entre eux un
contrat créateur d'un État pour mettre fin à la guerre civile. Ainsi, à partir de l'individualisme
libéral fondé sur le droit de l'homme à la vie (sans mention de devoir), Hobbes pense l'État
moderne dans son essence sécuritaire et né avec la police. Désormais, comme dit Strauss, le
droit (au sens de décision purement contractuelle) remplace la loi (cette dernière à entendre
dans sa majesté divine, à savoir comme une règle de vie s'imposant à l'homme comme venant de
plus haut que lui : ainsi le « Tu ne tueras pas »). Manifestement, le contrat selon Hobbes est
totalement étranger à la reconnaissance de cette autorité divine de la Loi. Là est la différence
fondamentale avec le contrat selon Rousseau et selon Kant, ce que semble en revanche nier ou
ignorer Strauss.<br>

Abstract: Voir Alain Badiou, Saint Paul. La fondation de l'universalisme, Paris, PUF, 1998. Dans
un tout autre registre, Levinas a formulé un soupçon sur la possibilité de traduire la croyance
monothéiste dans des termes humanistes : « La question de la divinité du Dieu-un peut-elle se
poser comme se pose la question de Vhumanité de Phomme? » (Autrement qu'être ou au-delà de
l'essence, Paris, rééd. Le Livre de poche, 1978, p. 155, je dois cette référence à Didier Franck).
Chez Levinas, ce soupçon ne mène pas à la critique de tout humanisme, mais à la recherche de
P« humanisme de l'autre homme ».<br>

Abstract: C'est le cas en particulier de ceux qui critiquent les notions de pluriparentalité et
d'identité narrative au nom d'une approche résolument dualiste de la personne (un moi proprié-
taire d'un corps) définissant l'identité comme l'essence du « moi ». Elle nourrit une idéologie de
l'égalité prônant une indifférenciation radicale des sexes par disparition de toute pertinence de
la référence au corps au nom de la primauté de la substance immatérielle des moi ou self dans
la définition identitaire des personnes. Voir en particulier la polémique assez vive menée contre
l'Association des parents et futurs parents gais et lesbiens (accusée de défendre à tort le droit
d'accès aux origines) par le juriste D. Borillo et le sociologue E. Fassin, dans A. Cadoret et al.

Abstract: Plus qu'une période de l'histoire européenne, les Lumières désignent un nouvel ethos. Ainsi que l'ont montré Foucault et Blumenberg, chacun à leur manière, les Lumières posent la question de la modernité comme manière singulière de se tenir dans son temps et d'en explorer l'essence. Désormais, le présent est valorisé comme rupture et nouveauté, au détriment du poids de la tradition et de l'autorité du passé. Quelles sont les attitudes subjectives liées à cette promotion de l'actuel ?<br>

Abstract: The appropriation of transnational cultural flows that occurs as a result of globalization is studied here through adaptations of Western narratives in manga and anime. This "Other" is integrated by exacerbating some of its features: The West is presented in Japanese works as conveyor of an excessive, unjust and potentially dangerous world, as the manifestation of Cartesianism taken to the extreme. Japaneseness, which is then defined by opposition to this incorporated otherness, brings out a supposedly specifically Japanese sensitivity, thus perpetuating a long intellectual tradition that sees in the feeling of things the very essence of Japaneseness by contrast to the rational Chinese and Western mind. Episodes from the life of Joan of Arc and Athena's divine interventions for instance then take on new meaning, which serves to promote Japaneseness and the essential values it conveys, such as the importance of social harmony and the close interdependence among members of the community.<br>

Abstract: The article comprises three parts. Part I contains an overview of the areas in the analysis of modern French philosophy that have been of the greatest relevance to Russian researchers over the last years. We conclude that numerous aspects of the French philosophical thought of the twentieth century are well represented in the research of Russian authors, who also point out the emerging trends in its development. Part II deals with the development of analytic philosophy in Russia within the framework of such areas as "critique of bourgeois philosophy", a purely ideological stand only nominally related to philosophy, logic, and the history of philosophy and theoretical research. Part III contains a periodization of the history of phenomenology in Russia, pointing out the most important achievements of the contemporary Russian scholars of phenomenology as well as their understanding of the essence, the problems, and the aims of phenomenological philosophy. We also indicate the tendencies within the development of the discipline in the Russian Federation.<br>

Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i27793826<br>
Date: 1 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Giulea Dragoş A.<br>
Abstract: In his second theological oration (Oratio 28,3), Gregory Nazianzen equates the divine glory (kabod) of the Holy of Holies with the divine essence and asserts their inaccessible character. An investigation into the meaning of these two terms unveils their origins in two distinct traditions, the former tracing its roots back to the ancient Semitic symbolisms of the forbidden divine glory and throne, the latter to the Hellenistic philosophical conception of an immaterial and incomprehensible divinity. The thesis advanced in this study is that these two different languages represent two semiotic forms of apophaticism, one expressed through the mysterium tremendum inspiring symbols and images of fire, dazzling glory and enigmatic heavenly creatures, guardians of the enthroned kabod, the other through negative philosophical terminologies. The identity of the two semiotic forms is established at the end of an investigation that concludes with the observation that Hellenistic theologians developed their apophatic discourses mostly in the context of interpreting biblical reports on the theophanies of the divine and unapproachable enthroned kabod. It was in this hermeneutical context that they "translated" the symbols of interdiction into philosophical negative concepts.<br>

Article Title: The methodological significance of scientific metaphor<br>
Publisher: Higher Education Press and Springer<br>
Issue: i27823295<br>
Date: 6 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Yiyu Liu<br>
Abstract: The essential significance of scientific metaphor lies in applying the general metaphorical theory to specific interpretations and elaborations of scientific theories to form a methodology of scientific explanation. It is a contextual grasp of objective reality. A given metaphorical context and its grasp of the essence of reality can only be valid when the context is continually restructured. Taking the context as a whole, the methodological characteristic of scientific metaphor lies in the unity of understanding and choice, experience and concepts, semantic structures and metaphorical domains, rationality and irrationality. As a form of thinking based on reasons, scientific metaphor plays an important role in invention, representation, explanation, evaluation, and communication. 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𰍀𦐒𶄶𤡇𠁁𢌒𤅸𣕘𙥨𳌤𰍀𸕄𡥇𩜂𵝰𤈒𩦒𠄐𱆅𣎘𩜂𵝰𰍀𠡕𠌇𵊙𷌢 𡙄𵠨𦄦𠀓, 𰀁𧒒𤐘𥄄𙥨𱆁𱆅𣎘𵊙𷌢𰍀𦁁𧡡𵝰𤘅𤠙. 𣐧𦅙𣕅𣑘𵉦𣑔𢌒𰍀𙥨𱆁𵠡𢙙𡉰 𥈦𥕩, 𡒂𦍷𵠡𢙙𰍀𙦁𦀩𷌥𦔀, 𥅥𳀡𲑳𣑐𸕄𡥇𵠡𢙙𰍀𣎄𢌒𡑐𠡔𥈦𥕩𣑔𢌒𦐒𶄶𰍀 𦍷𥤨𤘕. 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𰍀𦁁𧡡𵝰𩌅𤑉𴤠𩘖𠀦: 𩜂𵊙𙦂𶡳𥌡, 𲑣𹕤𙦂𧀐𤕥, 𵠡𠁁𲑧𦔀𙦂 𸕄𡥇𢒕, 𩜂𤘕𙦂𸝐𩜂𤘕𰍀𲑹𙥨. 𠌖𠀦𙥨𱆁𦍷𩜂𰀁𥔒𩜂𰍀𤘅𲔀𤐘𤌵, 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𠡕𦍷 𡑗𦄦, 𴤠𤑉, 𵠨𦄦, 𵞀𠈕𡑐𠄲𧥩𱕡𦁁𸝔𰍀𷌥𵈁𡅑𳀡.<br>

Abstract: El autor propugna que el conocimiento en el ámbito de las ciencias sociales no se puede comparar fácilmente con el conocimiento puramente filosófico o el conocimiento histórico ni reducirlo a uno u otro. De hecho, tiene sus raíces en la comunidad y, por lo tanto, da lugar a una empresa colectiva. En esencia, se basa en una interacción entre seres humanos y presupone una relación de confianza mutua entre el investigador y los miembros del grupo social que se va a investigar en una situación dada. Un enfoque cualitativo, que sitúe en un mismo plano al investigador y a los investigados, parece por tanto necesario. Cuesta creer que una persona pueda estar dispuesta a confesar sus experiencias (Erlebnisse) a una grabadora o a un cuestionario rígidamente precodificado. The Author's contention is that knowledge in social science cannot be easily compared and reduced either to purely philosophical knowledge or to historical knowledge. In fact, it is community grounded and therefore it results in a collective enterprise. In essence, it is based on an interaction among human beings and it presupposes a relation of mutual trust between the researcher and the members of the social group to be investigated in a given situation. Therefore, a qualitative approach whereby researcher and researched are in the same footing and involved in a face to face relationship seems to be necessary. It is hard to believe that somebody would willingly confess his/her Erlebnisse to a tape-recording machine or to a rigidly precodified questionnaire.<br>

Abstract: Cette assomption de la nécessité dans l'activité de travail enfin rendue à son essence débouche
chez Simone Weil sur la conception spirituelle ou spiritualiste de la « civilisation du travail » que
nous promet la mise en place d'une société libre (Berthoud [2002]). Ce point n'est pas ici l'objet
spécifique de notre discussion. En écho à la discussion du point 4.2, on peut se demander dans
quelle mesure cette « civilisation du travail » n'est finalement pas qu'un avatar communautaire de
la société communiste.<br>

Abstract: This essay deals with the relation between magic and the nature of words and things. On the one hand, it considers the ways that words confine and direct thought and desire; on the other hand it deals with how the undeniable essence of things provides both limits and reasons for the ways we think. Drawing on these properties of words and objects, magic can be appreciated as a creative and innovative feature of thinking more complex than earlier writers have claimed.<br>

Abstract: Margaret W. Ferguson observes: "Augustine is haunted by the parallel between the nature
of language and the nature of man 'lost in our present sad dispersal.' His analysis of language as a
sequence of parts is in many ways a forerunner of Derrida's discussions of language as a 'play of
differences' that necessarily ruptures any concept of truth as a totality. Unlike modern theorists, how-
ever, when faced with the contradictions between a philosophy of essence and a linguistics of difference,
Augustine chooses to relinquish language rather than God" (p. 845).<br>

Article Title: Shades of Orientalism: Paradoxes and Problems in Indian Historiography<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>

Author(s): Tagore Peter<br>
Abstract: In Orientalism, Edward Said attempts to show that all European discourse about the Orient is the same, and all European scholars of the Orient complicit in the aims of European imperialism. There may be "manifest" differences in discourse, but the underlying "latent" orientalism is "more or less constant." This does not do justice to the marked differences in approach, attitude, presentation, and conclusions found in the works of various orientalists. I distinguish six different styles of colonial and postcolonial discourse about India (heuristic categories, not essential types), and note the existence of numerous precolonial discourses. I then examine the multiple ways exponents of these styles interact with one another by focusing on the early-twentieth-century nationalist orientalist, Sri Aurobindo. Aurobindo's thought took form in a colonial framework and has been used in various ways by postcolonial writers. An anti-British nationalist, he was by no means complicit in British imperialism. Neither can it be said, as some Saidians do, that the nationalist style of orientalism was just an imitative indigenous reversal of European discourse, using terms like "Hinduism" that had been invented by Europeans. Five problems that Aurobindo dealt with are still of interest to historians: the significance of the Vedas, the date of the vedic texts, the Aryan invasion theory, the Aryan-Dravidian distinction, and the idea that spirituality is the essence of India. His views on these topics have been criticized by Leftist and Saidian orientalists, and appropriated by reactionary "Hindutva" writers. Such critics concentrate on that portion of Aurobindo's work which stands in opposition to or supports their own views. A more balanced approach to the nationalist orientalism of Aurobindo and others would take account of their religious and political assumptions, but view their project as an attempt to create an alternative language of discourse. Although in need of criticism in th~<br>

Abstract: Com este texto o autor procura uma resposta para a seguinte pergunta: "Que tipo de método poderá confirmar ou infirmar a hipótese segundo a qual o acto educativo é, no seu núcleo e na sua origem entitativa, confrontação violenta entre duas consciências?". Depois de esclarecer que esta hipótese inter-pretativa da educação tem em mira, não explicar ou descrever a realidade educacional na sua positividade, mas compreender o seu eidos ou essência constitutiva, o autor decide-se, na esteira de Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Duméry, Dufrenne, Levinas e Derrida, pelo método fenomenológico. Para efectuar a exploração filosófica que essa pergunta impõe, o método instituído por Husserl faculta, ao invés dos métodos positivistas e analíticos, uma visão global do fenómeno educativo numa intuição que se atinge depois de realizada uma redução eidética. Além disso, o método fenomenológico é entendido como o mais adequado para desvelar uma realidade cuja textura é tecida por relações intersubjectivas. Todo o texto desenvolve uma sequência argumentativa tendente a mostrar e a demonstrar quer a natureza, quer as potencialidades heurísticas do método fenomenológico aplicado à educação. Só este método poderá evidenciar a estrutura universal e necessária da educação: uma relação violenta entre duas consciências. /// Dans son texte l'auteur cherche une réponse pour la question suivante: "que type de méthode pourra confirmer ou infirmer l'hypothèse selon laquelle l'acte éducatif est en son centre et en son origine confrontation violente entre deux consciences"?

Abstract: Um filósofo com quem Paul Ricoeur manteve um interessante e fecundo relacionamento, durante mais de trinta anos, foi Gabriel Mareei, pensador de que se celebrou em 1989 o Centenário (7.121889 - 7.121989). Esta exposição procura evidenciar alguns aspectos filosóficos que Paul Ricoeur colhe na lição marceliana. Nesse sentido, a obra que serviu de fio condutor a esta reflexão foi publicada com o título "Entretiens Paul Ricoeur-Gabriel Marcel, que se constituiu como um diálogo discípulo-mestre, e isto a partir de algumas problemáticas que numa espécie de marceliano regard en arrière, surgem como correspondendo aos nós da filosofia de Gabriel Marcel. /// Un philosophe avec lequel Paul Ricoeur a maintenu durant plus de trente ans des rapports intéressants aussi bien que féconds est Gabriel Marcel, penseur dont on vient de célébrer en 1989 le Centenaire (7.121889–7.121989). Le présent exposé se fait dans le but de mettre en évidence certains aspects philosophiques que Paul Ricoeur emprunte de la leçon marcélienne. L'ouvrage servant de fil conducteur pour ces réflexions, qui a été publié sous le titre Entretiens Paul Ricoeur-Gabriel Marcel, assume la forme d'un dialogue disciple-maître, en partant de certaines problématiques qui, par une espèce de marcélien regard en arrière, correspondent à vrai dire aux noeuds de la philosophie de Gabriel Marcel. /// Gabriel Marcel is a philosopher with whom Paul Ricoeur and mantained one interesting relationship for more than thirty years. This article seeks to present those aspects of Ricoeur's philosophy which have Marcel as their source. The work that serves as a base for understanding this relationship is Entretiens Paul Rtcoeur-Gabriel Marcel in essence a dialogue between a disciple and his mentor. At the same time, this dialogue reveals the fundamental future of Gabriel Marcel's philosophy.<br>

Abstract: La literatura contemporánea asume una función que, en esencia, tiene un fundamento de índole religiosa: revela sentidos en el mundo, creando vínculos entre el receptor y su propia realidad. Esta función la lleva a cabo por medio de mecanismos del lenguaje metafórico, en procesos de desmitologización y mitificación discursivas. La literatura hispanoamericana relaciona esta función del lenguaje estético con el tema de la identidad cultural. La poética del dramaturgo mexicano Rodolfo Usigli expresa esta concepción del arte de modo ejemplar. Sobre la base de los conceptos anteriores, se analizará e interpretará la elaboración de imágenes metefóricas de la identidad hispanoamericana en las obras Corona de luz, de Rodolfo Usigli; Todos los gatos son pardos, de Carlos Fuentes; y Lautaro, de Isidora Aguirre. /// Contemporary literature has assumed a function which in essence, possesses a religious grounding: it releases meaning by creating links betiveen the received and his/her ozvn reality. This function is carried out by mechanism of metaphorical language in processes of discursive demythologizing as xuell as myth making. Spanish American literary unitingrelates this function of aesthetic language to the major theme of cultural identity. The poetics of the Mexican dramatist Rodolfo Usigli expresses this conception of art in an exemplary way. On the basis of the above concepts, this article analyzes and interprets the elaboration of metaphorical images in R. Usigli's "Corona de luz", Carlos Fuentes's "Todos los gatos son pardos" and Isidora Aguirre's "Lautaro".<br>

Through our intensive examination of the BPC initiative, we find that a number of issues suggested by ANT, such as errors in problematization, parallel translation, betrayal, and irreversible inscription of interests, contributed significantly to the failure. We provide nine abstraction statements capturing the essence of our findings in a concrete form. The larger implication of our study is that, for sociotechnical phenomena such as BPC with significant political components, an ANT-informed understanding can enable practitioners to better anticipate and cope with emergent complexities.<br>

Abstract: L'éthique de la situation (Situationsethik) est une tendance diffuse, qui s'infiltre dans les systèmes éthiques les plus divers, plutôt qu'une doctrine aux arêtes bien nettes. Il faut cependant qu'on détermine son idée et il semble que ses positions extrêmes se prêtent le mieux à une clarification de son contenu. Elle s'oppose à toute éthique normative abstraite et universelle. Par contraste apparaissent certaines lignes maîtresses, au moins négatives. Les systèmes principalement visés sont le rationalisme, qu'il soit formel ou à contenu matériel, l'éthique sociologique positiviste (Science des mœurs de Durkheim, Lévy-Bruhl...) et toute éthique de l'essence. L'abstraction et l'universalité, l'immutabilité et l'extrinsécisme des normes morales sont les caractères mis en question. Nous nous attachons à montrer que l'éthique de l'essence, telle que la conçoit la tradition chrétienne, ne comporte pas nécessairement les caractères incriminés au sens péjoratif ou la „Situationsethik” les entend. Nous croyons même qu'une éthique de l'essence de par son statut même - certaines formes historiques peuvent être des déviations - tient compte de la situation concrète et historique. Elle le fait de deux manières bien différentes, d'abord en ce qu'elle intègre dans ses impératifs universels les situations les plus diverses, et en second lieu en ce qu'elle pose comme principe obligatoire et universel que chacun doit se laisser conduire par certains impératifs moraux, que lui seul peut voir, du fait qu'ils tiennent à sa situation unique, non seulement de fait mais en principe. En effet, une éthique de l'essence transpose en impératifs moraux aussi bien ce qui appartient à la structure essentielle de l'homme (impératifs absolument universels), que ce qui relève de la contingence, telles les circonstances extérieures et intérieures, qui sont susceptible de se répéter, si pas de fait au moins de droit (impératifs relativementuniversels). La norme morale concrète, qui se dégage de la co~<br>

Abstract: 1. La problématique née en philosophie par le structuralisme, se cristallise dans une confrontation de la linguistique et de la philosophie du langage. Toutes les sciences humaines modernes s'inscrivent en effet dans le programme d'une sémiologie, science globale de la signification des signes et construite sur le modèle de la sémantique, discipline traitant la signification du signe linguistique. C'est à propos du récit, et en particulier du récit littéraire, que nous opposons l'analyse structurale, mouvement destructif qui réduit la plénitude du sens, à l'herméneutique, „interprétation comme récollection du sens” (P. Ricoeur). La critique littéraire connaissait déjà l'étude immanente du récit littéraire. C'est à l'intérieur de la critique immanente qu'il faut opposer un courant où l'œuvre est considérée comme sujet (p.e. G. Poulet) à la tendance formalisante (nous pensons particulièrement à L. Spitzer et au New Criticism). Mais ce n'est que l'analyse structurale qui pousse au bout cette objectivation puisque elle n'est pas seulement classificatoire mais aussi réductioniste. 2. Nous supposons l'homologie totale de la littérature et du langage : le récit est un discours linguistique. La possibilité d'une étude structurale du récit dépend donc de la possibilité de la sémantique. On connaît les difficultés que cette science linguistique de la signification rencontre dans l'élaboration de sa méthode : ni l'analyse distributionnelle (Z. Harris), ni l'analyse sémique (A. Greimas) ne se déroulent complètement à l'intérieur de la linguistique. Ce n'est que la grammaire generative de N. Chomsky, cette syntaxe créatrice qui décrit les structures qui rendent possible toute signification sémantique, qui fait entrevoir une solution au problème. Cette étude de l'activité dynamique du langage ou des conditions de possibilité de la signification affirme la primauté de la syntaxe sur la sémantique. Le récit, comme chaque discours, est, quant à sa structure, analogique et homologiqu~<br>

Abstract: L'accord entre psychanalyse et philosophie ne s'est toujours pas fait. Pourtant les psychanalystes s'intéressent à Heidegger et il y a des philosophes heideggeriens qui lisent Freud et Lacan. Les thèmes d'intérêt commun se situent tous autour de la problématique du langage : la découverte d'un décentrement, la „fin de la métaphysique” et un certain parallélisme entre l'impensé et l'inconscient. On ne peut pas expliquer le rapport entre philosophie et psychanalyse dans les termes de la problématique traditionnelle philosophie-science. La psychanalyse met en question aussi bien la philosophie que la science en les prenant comme un discours qui n'est pasessentiellement différent du discours du patient dans la cure analytique. Ce discours, c'est l'homme qui le tient pour un autre ; en parlant il veut faire passer l'image de soi-même et du monde qui leur donne objectivité et identité. Mais l'homme n'est pas maître de ce discours, il parle en fragments qui appartiennent à une légende déjà existante. Il ne revient pas à l'analyste de nier ou d'affirmer ce discours, il n'a d'égards que pour sa continuité. La philosophie aussi bien que la science, il les prend comme des discours qui n'ont un sens que dans la mesure où leur progression porte des fruits. En prétendant qu'aussi bien la philosophie spéculative que la phénoménologie se meuvent dans l'imaginaire, la psychanalyse mène inévitablement à la question du statut de la philosophie. S'agit-il là d'un système d'affirmations fondées ou plutôt d'une interrogation sans fin ? Mais la critique psychanalytique porte aussi sur cette interrogation en tant que celle-ci est un moment du discours philosophique. C'est en tant que discours que la philosophie heideggerienne se rapproche de la psychanalyse. Elle annonce la „fin de la philosophie”, de la philosophie comme fait historique qui a pris fin avec Hegel et la science moderne. Il y a eu des philosophes, mais leur activité philosophique a été dominée de part et d'autre par une inst~<br>

Abstract: The influence of Husserl on the Russian Formalism and the Structuralism of the Prague School of Linguistics is especially manifest in the work of Jakobson. A direct literary dependence is traceable in the so-called „antipsychological” tendency, in the program of a Universal Grammar and in several questions of the theory of meaning. Objective points of contact can be found in the theses of the intersubjective and the associative constitution of objects, but also concerning the central topics of Husserlian phenomenology, the analysis of essence (the elaboration of invariants and universals) and the phenomenological attitude (e.g. in phonology the priority of the perceptual level against the articulatory (physiological) and the acoustic (physical) level). A comparison of Jakobson and Husserl yields not only a mutual confirmation of fundamental aspects of their linguistic and philosophical thought. It opens also interesting ways for further research in both fields.<br>

Abstract: Husserlian phenomenology sets off as a fundamental rejection of those psychologisms and anthropologisms that deduce the structures of appearance from some preexisting essence of man. However, despite a clear rejection of all anthropological foundations of phenomenology, the examples of Husserl, Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty show that the question of man continues to haunt the phenomenological project and constitutes something likea 'blind spot'. Relating these unspoken tensions to another historical 'scene' (the debate between the Sophists and Aristotle), the article argues why phenomenology is to be seen as the endeavor of replying to the initial Protagorean provocation to thinking.<br>

Abstract: Si la personnalité philosophique de Michel Henry est saluée, son œuvre continue, quarante ans apres L'essence de la manifestation, à ne pas être reçue, ou à ne l'être que sur la base de malentendus. Pourquoi ? Les raisons alléguées peuvent sembler faibles (le ton absolu de Michel Henry, l'indifférence politique ou la sensibilité de droite qu'on lui prête, etc.), elles renvoient (la reconnaissance généralement faite de la « puissance » de sa pensée, ce qui est pressenti avec ce terme, plaident en ce sens) à une autre, plus décisive : la réception n'est pas la réception dans le monde mais la reception dans la vie, de la vie par elle-même – ce qui néanmoins serait la condition d'une politique pour notre temps. If Michel Henry's philosophical personality is indeed hailed, his work goes on, forty years after The Essence of Manifestation, not being received but on the basis of misunderstandings. Why ? The alleged reasons may seem rather weak (e.g. Michel Henry's absolute tone, his so-called political indifference, or his right-winged sensitiveness) ; they refer to another, more decisive, one (what is usually acknowledged as a potency of thought) : reception does not mean reception in this very world, but in life, which nonetheless would be the condition of a new politics of our time.<br>

Abstract: No encadeamento de oito temas analisam-se tensões e aporias (no sentido mais platónico que aristotélico) inerentes à compreensão filosófica da obra de arte. (1) Quem compreende melhor a essência da arte, o filósofo ou o artista? Noutros termos, qual o papel da razão na compreensão da arte? (2) A arte permanece na procura do belo ou rege-se hoje apenas pela busca de expressão do artista? (3) Mas então será o artista um ser de exceção? (4) Por sua vez, esta questão leva à distinção entre a forma e o conteúdo da obra de arte. (5) O "conteúdo" da obra remete para o problema da "finalidade" da obra. (6) Na linha da finalidade surge a função central da arte, isto é, a fruição pela "trans-figuração" do mundo. Na esteira desta função abrem-se tres problemas, brevemente evocados: (7) a dimensão social e política da arte; (8) os êxitos facéis e os fracassos da arte, assim como (9) o eventual esgotamento da arte na atitude estética. In lacing together eight themes, the article analyzes tensions and aporias (more in the Platonic sense than the Aristotelian) inherent in the philosophical understanding of a work of art. (1) Who best understands the essence of art, the philosopher or the artist? Otherwise said, what is the role of reason in the understanding of art? (2) Does art reside in the search of the beautiful, or does it orient itself today by the artists expression? (3) What makes an artist an exceptional human being? (4) This leads us to the distinction between form and content in a work of art. (5) The "content" of a work refers to its finality. (6) In the line of finality, the central function of art appears, i.e., the fruition through the "trans-figuration" of the world. In the wake of this function, three problems are briefly presented: (7) the social and political dimension of art; (8) the easy successes and failures of art, as well as (9) the eventual emptying of art in aesthetic attitude.<br>

Abstract: Le but de notre article est d'essayer de montrer en quoi l'expérience rédactionnelle et éditoriale de l'Histoire socialiste de la Révolution française fut pour Jaurès, hormis le prétexte pédagogique évident pour préparer les dirigeants à l'unité du mouvement socialiste encore divisé et pour éduquer politiquement les militants et le prolétariat, l'occasion d'affiner sa réflexion sur une future « méthode socialiste », à la veille de l'unité de 1905. Parce que « la Révolution française contient le socialisme tout entier », quels sont donc les événements que Jaurès juge les plus pertinents et les plus féconds pour l'avenir socialiste de la société et de l'État ? Rappelant le contexte et les conditions de cette grande entreprise, nous nous sommes attachés à retrouver ce qui fonde philosophiquement sa démarche et ses analyses historiques - spécialement au cours du « moment thermidorien » - à partir de sa méthode philosophique adossée à sa métaphysique de l'unité de l'être. Une esquisse, en somme, de l'analyse critique jaurésienne de la « dictature jacobine » et de l'esprit révolutionnaire de Robespierre conditionnant le socialisme réformiste gradualiste de Jaurès. The article attempts to show how the writing and editing of the Socialist History of the French Revolution was for Jaurès not merely a self-evident pretext to enlighten others, unify the still divided leaders of the socialist movement and educate politically the party faithful and the proletariat, but also an opportunity to finetune his reflections on a future « socialist methodology » on the eve of the union of 1905. Given that « the French Revolution contains socialism in its entirety », what then were the events that Jaurès thought most relevant and fruitful for the socialist future of society and state ? While recalling the context and conditions of this great venture, our aim has been to retrieve the philosophical essence of his historical approach and analysis, especially during the « moment of Thermidor »~<br>

Abstract: Através de urna abordagem metodológica centrada na reflexão dialética, o presente artigo tem como principal objetivo questionar urna suposta essencialidade natural ou cultural da natureza humana associada as experiencias religiosas e ao sagrado. Este tema constitui uma aporia, pois a religiosidade do ser humano pode ser concebida como fenómeno cultural e natural, humano e sobre-humano, social e individual. Além da indagação sobre a naturalidade ou culturalidade da religião no ser humano, algumas perguntas colocadas no artigo, designadamente na problematização, visam acirrar o pensamento critico sobre esta temática em torno da essencialidade da natureza humana, tais como: a religiosidade é um fenómeno humano, natural e atemporal ou é social, cultural e temporal? É um fenómeno racional ou consciente enquanto alimento da esperança? Tendo em conta que a religiosidade está associada a determinados valores, será racional porque os fins das práticas respondem as convicçôes e aos ditos valores e porque o sentido da experiencia religiosa está inscrito ñas formas de linguagem e de conduta, bem como nos valores que as motivam? Through a methodological approach centered on reflection and dialectics, the main purpose of this article is to inquiry a hypothetical natural or cultural essence of human nature, which is associated with religious experiences and the sacred. This theme is an aporia, because the religiosity of the human being can be conceived as a cultural and natural, human and superhuman, social and individual phenomenon. Besides the questioning about natural or cultural religion in human beings, some questions placed in the article, namely in the questioning part, aim to sharpen critical thinking on this subject around the essence of human nature, such as: Is the religiosity a human, natural and timeless phenomenon, or it is social, cultural and temporal? Is it a rational or conscious phenomenon to feed hope? Given that religiosity is associated with certain values, w~<br>

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Abstract: La dernière grande œuvre de Husserl — la Krisis —, en révélant ses difficultés intrinsèques, scelle le destin aporétique de la phénoménologie transcendantale. Il s'agit, pour échapper à celui-ci, de reconduire la phénoménologie à sa possibilité effective et d'amorcer ainsi sa mutation interne. Pour cette tâche, le hiatus impliqué dans le diagnostic de « crise » appliqué à la fois aux sciences et à l'humanité européennes peut paradoxalement servir de fil conducteur, pour autant qu'à une menace pesant en dernier ressort sur l'éthicitè de l'homme, Husserl n'oppose que l'enflure méthodologiste d'un discours tendant à l'auto-référence et achève ainsi, en méconnaissant l'essence de la crise, la réduction techniciste de la Personne. Le présent travail cherche in fine, en assumant la question cruciale de la motivation de l'èpoche phénoménologique, à restituer la dimension éthique du questionnement ontologique. The last important work of Husserl — the Krisis — seals up the aporetical fate of transcendental phenomenology. Phenomenology should be brought back to its actual possibilities. So will also be restored the ethical side of the ontological questioning.<br>

Abstract: Selon la philosophie moderne la pensée est une production de la subjectivité, la volonté est une auto-détermination et le temps est une auto-affection. Kierkegaard offre une autre compréhension de la vie volontaire en envisageant une volonté brisée par le prochain, par le temps et par Dieu. La patience n'est pas pour Kierkegaard un accident de notre caractère, mais la condition pour devenir une personne. Cela suppose de laisser de côté toute compréhension purement psychologique de la patience. La vraie persévérance s'oppose totalement à l'obsession de se blinder par rapport au monde. Entre l'endurance stoïcienne et la patience chrétienne comme patience dans l'espérance il n'y a pas d'essence commune. Kierkegaard montre que la patience de l'amour est une passivité qui est la voie du salut. For modem philosophy meaning is a product of subjectivity, will is a self-determination, and time is a self-affection. Kierkegaard gives us another meaning for a voluntary life by considering desire that is broken by the will of another man, time and God. Patience is not for Kierkegaard an accident of character but is the condition to becoming a person. It is necessary to ignore a purely psychological understanding of patience. True perseverance is radically opposed to an obsessive existence blinded to the world. Between the stoic conception of endurance and Christian patience there is no common essence. For Kierkegaard, the patience of love is a form of passivity that can save Mankind.<br>

Abstract: This contribution looks at the issue of how to present history by taking a look at one of the most cited countries for exemplifying a multicultural society. The author adopts a careful, even critical, stance when it comes to the pluralistic discourse and illustrates how, in the case of Canada, the problem of deciding whether to opt for a blanket discourse (a one-sided view of a country, stretching from one ocean to the next) or an atomising approach (allowing for as many historical interpretations as there are views) does not arise. The focus is more on establishing a factual as well as narrative discourse which allows for a representation of Canada in all its dissonances, changing equilibria, and stormy interdependence.The term "canadianité" would seem fitting, since it refers to the essence of how Canada has formed an historical identity. It could promote a way of relating history which offers an escape from the ostensibly dead-end situations found in the great narratives of Canada which are currently dominating our collective imaginations. Der Autor dieses Aufsatzes geht auf die Frage der Geschichtsschreibung in einem der als Beispiel für eine multikulturelle Gesellschaft meist zitierten Staaten ein. Er nimmt eine behutsame, ja kritische Position gegenüber dem pluralistischen Diskurs ein und zeigt auf, dass im Falle Kanadas das Dilemma nicht in der Entscheidung für einen unitaristischen Diskurs (einheitliche Sicht des Landes von einem Ozean zum anderen) oder einen atomisierenden (so viele Geschichten des Landes wie Sichtweisen) besteht. Vielmehr geht es darum, eine histori(ographi) sche Artikulationsebene faktischer und narrativer Art zu finden, die die Konzeptualisierung und Repräsentation Kanadas in all seinen Dissonanzen, wechselnden Gleichgewichten, stürmischen Interdependenzen ermöglicht. Hierzu könnte der Begriff der „ canadianité" beitragen, der auf den Kern der historischen Identitätsbildung Kanadas verweist. Er könnte Träger einer Geschichtserzählung sei~<br>

Abstract: Le prétendu antagonisme héréditaire entre la France et l'Allemagne se nourrit de sources multiples. La période qui a présidé le plus manifestement à l'élaboration de cette notion est celle des guerres révolutionnaires et napoléoniennes. A une époque où l'Allemagne, après l'effondrement du Saint Empire romain germanique, construit son identité nationale par opposition à la France, les œuvres d'écrivains ou publicistes comme Theodor Körner, Josef Görres, Heinrich von Kleist ou Ernst Moritz Arndt s'engagent dans ce sens. La Révolution française ayant, par sa prétention universaliste et son action missionnaire, idéologisé à outrance les guerres, ouvre la voie à une réaction allemande qui se pose face à l'irréligion et à l'athéisme français comme le rempart de l'Occident chrétien. Le pamphlet d'Arndt sur la haine entre le peuples (1813), où celle-ci est quasiment érigie en vertu cardinale, peut être considéré comme l'un des textes fondateurs, auquel répond, comme en écho, en 1871, Paul de Saint Victor avec Barbares et bandits. La Prusse et la Commune. La mémoire du refuge huguenot en Allemagne est instrumentalisée dans le sens anti-français. La 1ère Guerre mondiale est souvent présentée comme un affrontement entre une France catholique, et ce malgré la séparation radicale de 1905 et les laicisme et anticléricalisme militants, et une Allemagne par essence protestante. Après 1930 le travail d'information sur l'Allemagne nazie, et notamment sur le combat de l'Eglise confessante, entrepris par des périodiques protestants, ouvre le chemin à la solidarité dans la résistance et favorise après 1945 le travail de rapprochement et de réconciliation appuyé par les Eglises, afin de réintégrer le peuple allemand dans le concert des nations. Le convergences générales observables dans les sociétés française et allemande, surtout après 1960, y compris dans le domaine des attitudes et pratiques religieuses, favorisent l'œuvre de compréhension réciproque qui permet d'éliminer très largeme~<br>

Author(s): PAILLER Jean-Marie<br>
Abstract: L'âne des Métamorphoses d'Apulée est à la fois objet, vecteur et témoin de nombreuses activités commerciales de proximité. Le héros Lucius, avant sa transformation, est une figure représentative d'un autre commerce : celui qui s'exerce à grande échelle, fait appel au relais de manieurs d'argent, dépend de la prospérité de la navigation en Méditerranée. La structure d'ensemble du roman met en valeur la confrontation entre ces deux univers, mais aussi les relations qu'ils entretiennent. Apulée établit une série d'étroites correspondances, un véritable réseau métaphorique entre les déplacements et transformations qui sont de l'essence du commerce, d'une part, et d'autre part la série des métamorphoses qui forment l'objet avoué du récit. The donkey in Apuleius' Metamorphoses is at the same time the object, vector and witness to a number of short distance commercial activities. Lucius, the hero, before his transformation is a representative figure of another kind of commerce: a wide-scale operation calling on money changers as relays and depending on a thriving navigation in the Mediterranean. The overall structure of the novel sets into relief the confrontation between those two worlds but also the relationships they entertain. Apuleius set up a series of close correspondences, a real metaphorical network between the journeys and the transformations which are of the essence of commerce on one hand and on the other hand the series of metamorphoses which are the overt object of the narrative.<br>

Abstract: Le témoin n'est ni un spectateur, ni un propriétaire, ni un conservateur, ni un producteur, ni un juge, mais il est celui qui accueille ce qui se donne à lui et se reçoit de cette épreuve d'une altérité irréductible. La force des analyses de Kierkegaard est de montrer que l'élucidation de l'essence du témoignage, qui conduit à la substitution du témoin au je, ne peut être séparée d'une elucidation de l'essence de la vérité. La vérité n'étant pas ce que je produis, mais ce qui me touche et m'éclaire, le témoignage se donne comme une communication directe-indirecte qui consiste à dire la vérité tout en l'existant Exister c'est témoigner en faisant de sa vie une tâche dans la passion essentielle de la vérité. En cela seul le témoignage chrétien révèle véritablement l'essence du témoignage puisque seul il donne vraiment à voir le saut du témoignage, qui conduit à ne pas se contenter de persister dans l'être pour s'ouvrir à la possibilité de devenir tout autre en s'abandonnant à la vérité et en acceptant de souffrir pour elle dans le monde. Dans cette philosophie du témoignage, le témoin devient alors le vrai nom de la personne contre l'abstraction du sujet-substance. A witness is neither a spectator, a proprietor, a preservator, a producer nor a judge, he is the one that receives what is given to him and who, from this test of irreducible alterity, receives himself. The strength of Kierkegaard's analyses is in showing that the elucidation of the essence of witnessing, which leads to the witness being substituted to the "I-myself", is inseparable from the elucidation of the essence of truth. Truth being not what I make but what marks and enlightens me, witnessing is given to be a direct-indirect communication which consists of saying the truth while being it. To be is to give witness by making one's life a task in the essential passion of truth. For this, Christian witness alone truly reveals the essence of witnessing for it alone truly allows one to see the leap of witn~<br>

Abstract: En vue de se laisser enseigner par les lettres philosophiques, l'auteur s'applique à reconnaître, depuis Platon jusqu'à Nietzsche, l'insistance et l'existence des questions relatives au mal. La nature (quid), l'origine (unde) et la justification (cur) sollicitent toujours et autrement la pensée du mal. Au commencement, de Plotin à Leibniz, le moment ontologique retravaille la question de la nature à partir de la question de l'origine, mais pour résoudre le mal de la volonté dans le non-être du mal. Il faut que s'affirme avec Kant la préséance du vouloir sur l'être, l'auto-position de la volonté libre, pour que le moment éthique associe l'essence positive du mal à la recherche de son origine. Lorsqu'enfin dans la perspective de Nietzsche s'impose le moment généalogique, la question de la théodicée se transforme en question du langage. Là où se dit la justification de la volonté, c'est une volonté de justification qui parle. L'article se conclut en préparant une pensée du mal qui réunirait l'horizon de l'attente à celui de la genèse. The author, with the aim of being taught by philosophical letters, applies himself to acknowledge from Plato to Nietzsche the persistence and existence of the questions relating to evil. The nature (quid), the origin (unde) and the justification (cur) always and in different ways urge the thought of evil. In the beginning, from Plotin to Leibniz, the metaphysical instance works again at the question of nature starting from the question of origin, but in order to solve the evil of the will power in the non existing of evil. It will need Kant's assertion of the precedency of the will over the being, the auto-position of the free will in order that the ethical moment may associats the positive essence of evil to the search for its origin. When "in fine" the genealogical moment forces itself upon Nietzsche's prospect, the question of theodicy is transformed into one of language. Where the question is a justification of the will, it is the wil~<br>

Abstract: Basic to the entire procedure is the conception that what is in turn eclipsed and neutralized is not merely the human community of a given area and locality but the total corporate unit of all elements animate and inanimate alike, which together constitute its distinctive character and “atmosphere.” To this wider entity we may assign the name topocosm, formed (on the analogy microcosm and macrocosm) from the Greek,
            topos, “place” andcosmos, “world order.” The seasonal ceremonies are the economic regimen of this topocosm…. The essence of the topocosm is that it possesses a two-fold character, at once real and punctual, and ideal and durative, the former aspect being necessarily immerged in the latter, as a moment is immerged in time. It is bodied forth as a real and concrete organism in the present, it exists also as an ideal, timeless entity, embracing but transcending the here and now.

Abstract: I remember also being frustrated by Kierkegaard's tendency to reverse the modern idiom, so that he praises the power of “indirect” speech and elevates subjectivity over objectivity. Why, in a world full of objectivistic thinkers, should we start by voluntarily putting our bodies, our sense of what is important in life, and our shared social practices into ontological second place? Likewise, must we settle for Jaspers's mystification of
      ExistenzandTranscendenzby calling them the UNrepresentable? And do we really articulate better how it is to be in a world with others by following Sartre's famous reversal of essence and existence—as if an inverted Cartesianism comes closer to expressing lifeworld concerns than theMeditations on First Philosophy?<br>

Abstract: Here is a final evocation of the unique nonsortal essence, which implicitly, I believe, argues for a nonsortal sense of oneself, works against the temptation to see “I” as merely a numerical individuation comparable to two identical peas, and thus also suggests a filled significant or existential-moral meaning for the question of nonsortal individuality.
            
                  It perhaps is to be found first in Leibniz and then in the formulation in C. S. Pierce and John M. E. McTaggart, but I will share Roderick Chisholm's version of it with you.32
               
                  What is at stake here is not whether memory is essential for identifying by way of criteria oneself throughout time but, rather, whether there is a nonsortal loose and odd sense of oneself and one's identity that may be more basic and may persist in the absence of memory—as the basis for our proper strong sense of having an identifying knowledge of ourselves. We may consider that even prior to such a thought experiment as I here propose we are already perhaps familiar with the small child's ability to make first-person references without having an arsenal of identifying properties that the parent and others have, for example, regarding his physiognomy, voice timbre, kind, lineage, gender, kinship, ethnicity, nationality, and so on and so forth. And we are more or less familiar with real or imagined cases of the amnesiac who says “I” and yet does not know who in the world she is; that is, she is bereft of any identifying properties but still achieves “I” inerrantly.33<br>

Abstract: Or how about technologies predicted to become dominant that never materialize? The leading contender for a universal development of a technology pronounced in the
            New York Heraldin 1900 wascompressed air. Or take the age of steam power: the ship, train, and factory engines powered by steam are all but gone except as tourist attractions (ironically steam is retained for nuclear plants as hybrids of industrial and atomic technologies). Yes, Heidegger's “rustbelt” technologies still operate alongside the new technologies, but as alongside, this already means that they are but one style, region, or type of technology. His descriptors are not an “essence.” From my perspective to avoid looking, phenomenologically and empirically, at specific technologies, to seek a “one-size-fits-all” essence of technology overall, is both arrogant and irresponsible—and badly outdated.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: In some ways, a rejection of utopia would be a rejection of the humanist tradition of rhetoric, which is not propaganda but an art emphasizing reason, personal freedom in the audience, and the development of goodwill: in essence, the practical use of ideals and idealism rather than a pure materialism. In the liberal-humanist tradition, rhetoric and politics have worked toward ideals extracted from the people of the time. This idealism adds an inherently ethical stance in the arts of persuasion and statecraft. Here we are moving out of a limited view of utopia in terms of content and genre and toward a much broader, yet still liberal humanist view of the utopian impulse as a function of the human condition. Utopian studies has tended to rely on sociologists and political scientists for groundwork in this branch of their field, and most of these theorists are Marxist-influenced, although some seem to evolve from liberal humanism in their embracing of aesthetic ideals.<br>

Abstract: Joyce's vision of the world is based not upon certain faith but upon what Jean-Michel Rabaté has described as “the relativity of doubt”—“doubt oddly appears as the only firm ground on which the edifice of the work steadies and secures itself.”
         
               Indeed, doubt, according to Rabaté, “offers a key … because of the great suspension it affords, to the essence of Life.”108
            
               This sense of doubt is therefore not only deconstructive: it is both substantive and constructive. Irony and uncertainty are tonally and philosophically central to Joyce's work: this is what Herring dubbed109
            Joyce's Uncertainty Principle. His world is a pluralist, shifting, and ambiguous space—yet (orbecause) it remains an irreducibly real, historical, and material space, one that challenges its own idealization. It is the creation of an author who denied his own artistic apotheosis, an echo of the similarly discordant literary, political, and religious canonization of Thomas More. It is, after all, the work of a writer who argued that “a man is a martyr only for things of which he is not quite sure.”
               Insofar as the certainty of salvation might negate its weight of sacrifice, Jesus's death, for example, is therefore valorized, in Matthew 27:46, by his loss of absolute faith: “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” It is a similar rejection of total dependence upon external forces, be they divine or historical, that heroically shifts the Homeric epic toward Joycean humanism.110<br>
