  Abstract: In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson declared Flag Day an official nationwide day of celebration. As United States involvement in the First World War loomed, the holiday became a spectacular affair showcasing American history, the dedication of the citizenry, and the nation’s preparedness for international conflict. The event was concurrently deemed Preparedness Day, a moniker emphasizing home-front readiness. Over 150 cities took up Wilson’s call, organizing parades, pageants, and other commemorations. The revelry followed the Lincoln Highway (a route that spanned from New York to San Francisco, somewhat following today’s I-80). Towns on this course arranged festivities, including lectures on American<br>

  Abstract: The narrator of

The event he cites first is that fateful evening when his “mother abdicated her authority,” in the young Marcel’s bedroom at Combray; the second encompasses the many months during which the narrator observed the slow death of his grandmother.¹ The narrator is anguished: not only did he inflict pain on his mother when he “traced in her soul a first wrinkle and caused a first white hair to appear,” but also he wounded<br>

  Abstract: The year 1985 was a “before and after” year for me. It was one of those years when you experience a significant event or change, so you tend to remember and identify things in your life as before or after it. I first encountered Girard’s work in April 1985 when I was in Strasbourg, France, for three weeks. While there, I presented a paper to the professors of the Catholic and Protestant faculties of biblical studies of the University of Strasbourg in which I sketched patterns in the enemy brother stories of the book of Genesis and noted one striking<br>

  Abstract: In the late 1930s, Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead did pioneering ethnographic fieldwork in a Balinese village, using still and movie cameras to capture some of the “intangible aspects” of Balinese culture and everyday life, including trance, eating, gesture, mourning, family interactions, children’s play, art, and shadow-play puppets. In her introductory essay to their 1942 monograph, Mead speaks of a Balinese passion for being part of a noisy, festive crowd.

  Book Title: Lyric Apocalypse: Milton, Marvell, and the Nature of Events-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Netzley Ryan<br>
  Abstract: What's new about the apocalypse? Revelation does not allow us to look back after the end and enumerate pivotal turning points. It happens in an immediate encounter with the transformatively new. John Milton's and Andrew Marvell's lyrics attempt to render the experience of such an apocalyptic change in the present. In this respect they take seriously the Reformation's insistence that eschatology is a historical phenomenon. Yet these poets are also reacting to the Regicide, and, as a result, their works explore very modern questions about the nature of events, what it means for a significant historical occasion to happen. Lyric Apocalypse argues that Milton's and Marvell's lyrics challenge any retrospective understanding of events, including one built on a theory of revolution. Instead, these poems show that there is no "after" to the apocalypse, that if we are going to talk about change, we should do so in the present, when there is still time to do something about it. For both of these poets, lyric becomes a way to imagine an apocalyptic event that would be both hopeful and new.<br>

  Abstract: Can we conceive of the apocalypse as something other than an ultimate compensation for defeat, loss, or weakness, as an event valuable and desirable for reasons other than the promised triumph of the godly? This is a particularly pressing question for a poem that promises (and, in its 1645 version, celebrates) the fall of its enemies and a future world of new pastures, all in the process of commemorating a friend’s death.
                  Lycidas, instead of responding to loss with mourning, consolation, or revolution, imagines this temporal event as essentially apocalyptic, an immanently and immediately apprehensible revelation. Especially in its later,<br>

  Abstract: Effective folklore films provide a sense of involvement in the event for the audience by following the actual structure of the processes of narrating, singing, ceremony, dancing, playing, and similar events and conveying them as holistically as possible through myriad styles. How one chooses to present folklore shifts as a result of one’s growth as a filmmaker at the same time as one’s attitudes about film and technique shift.

And if Auschwitz, as Theodor Adorno suggests, is the central event of our age, this primal catastrophe, which ushers in the postwar era, separates and estranges the survivors of the Holocaust from the myths of the American nation.

  Book Title: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness traces the reflections of the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankelevitch on the conditions and temporality of forgiveness in relation to creation, history, and memory. The author demonstrates the influence of Jewish and Christian thought on Jankelevitch's philosophy and compares his ideas about the gift character of forgiveness, the role of retributive emotions in conceptions of justice, and the limits of reason with those of Aristotle, Butler, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Scheler, Arendt, Derrida, Levinas, and Ricoeur. The Shoah was the pivotal historical event in Jankelevitch's life. As this book shows, Jankelevitch's question "Is forgiveness possible as a response to evil?" remains a potent philosophical conundrum today. Paradoxically, for Jankelevitch, evil is both the impetus and the obstacle to forgiveness.<br>

  Abstract: The “Letter on Humanism” that Martin Heidegger published in 1946 at the culmination of an historical and biographic defeat seems to spell the end of the secular event of humanism. Despite the attempts to restore humanism to a spiritualist, Marxist, or existentialist form, the great humanist tradition could not withstand the dual trauma of Auschwitz and Hiroshima, in which the opposite of humanity laid waste to the very idea of humanity.¹ Regardless of the direct and even instrumental conditions that underpin the drafting of the “Letter,” the need of such an epistemological break is central to Heidegger’s text: a culture<br>

Whatever end we human beings currently represent as evolved metaphoric thinkers is already present and active in whatever beginning the Big Bang represents for our universe. The launching of the metaphoric initiative and the launching of the universe are one and the same event.

Although the Rising is now synonymous with republicanism, its ideological significance was less apparent at the time: many rebels fought for Irish freedom rather than a republic.

  Book Title: The Homebrewed Christianity Guide to Jesus-Lord, Liar, Lunatic…Or Awesome?<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): FULLER TRIPP<br>
  Abstract: Christology is crazy. It’s rather absurd to identify a first-century homeless Jew as God revealed, but a bunch of us do anyway. In this book, Tripp Fuller examines the historical Jesus, the development of the doctrine of Christ, the questions that drove christological innovations through church history, contemporary constructive proposals, and the predicament of belief for the church today. Recognizing that the battle over Jesus is no longer a public debate between the skeptic and believer but an internal struggle in the heart of many disciples, he argues that we continue to make christological claims about more than an “event" or simply the “Jesus of history." On the other hand, C. S. Lewis’s infamous “liar, lunatic, and Lord" scheme is no longer intellectually tenable. This may be a guide to Jesus, but for Christians, Fuller is guiding us toward a deeper understanding of God. He thinks it’s good news—good news about a God who is so invested in the world that God refuses to be God without us.<br>

To be on the right track here makes it impossible to be completely mistaken in the whole.”¹ This implies that Barth’s theological interpretation of the reconciliation in Christ is fundamental also for his ethics.

  Book Title: The Wisdom and Foolishness of God-First Corinthians 1-2 in Theological Exploration<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Askani Hans-Christoph<br>
  Abstract: The first two chapters of Paul’s first epistle to the Christians of Corinth, written in the fifth decade of the first century, have played a significant role in the history of Christian theology. Interpreting the central event in Christianity, namely the crucifixion of Jesus, Paul reflects on the wisdom and foolishness of God, which he opposes to the world’s wisdom. According to Paul, the “word of the cross," which is “foolishness" to some and “scandal" to others, leads to an upheaval in one’s way of thinking. For two millenia, theology has often turned to these passages in order to sustain its reflection. Many central questions emerge from Paul’s text on the meaning of a crucified Messiah, on God’s omnipotence, weakness, and suffering. This volume hopes to achieve two things by seeking to place exegetes, historians, philosophers, and theologians in conversation: to better understand Paul’s text and its reception and also to examine the ways in which it can nourish our theological reflection today.<br>

  Abstract: In 1 Cor. 1:23–24, Paul writes: “we proclaim Christ nailed to the cross; … he is the power of God and the wisdom of God,” before adding, in v. 25, that “the weakness of God is stronger than human strength” (reb). The link between the cross of Christ and the power of God is thus explicitly made by Paul. Consequently, one must ask whether it is possible, in a Christian theological perspective, to think about something we may call God’s “almightiness” from the event of the cross and, first, from the “word of the cross” around which the second<br>

  Abstract: The Counter-Reformation is a period in the history of the Roman Catholic Church during which the Church dealt with issues arising from the emergence of Protestantism. Though Catholic reform predated Martin Luther, nonetheless the challenges that he and other reformers presented led the Church to make serious and sustained changes. The focus of the Counter-Reformation was the Council of Trent (1545–63), an event that left few areas of Catholic life untouched. The Council issued broad dogmatic decrees on the sacraments, the scriptures, justification, and Church government, in addition to passing many ordinances on internal Church reform.

  Abstract: The fate of both Jesus and the temple is—at least in the eyes of some early Christians—clearly consolidated into one large-scale event. John 2:21 says that, when Jesus spoke of the coming destruction of the temple, he was speaking of his own body. Witnesses at his trial accused him of forecasting the end of the temple—which in fact occurred some forty years later. It seems reasonable to conclude that both the cross and the temple ruins after 70 CE were seen as a dual inauguration of a new and final chapter in Israel’s history. True, the accusation<br>

This alternative form of propaganda, deep and sustained, indoctrinated the general public over the long term.

  Abstract: The philosophical work of Jean-Luc Marion has opened new ways of speaking about religious convictions and experiences. In this exploration of Marion's philosophy and theology, Christina M. Gschwandtner presents a comprehensive and critical analysis of the ideas of saturated phenomena and the phenomenology of givenness. She claims that these phenomena do not always appear in the excessive mode that Marion describes and suggests instead that we consider degrees of saturation. Gschwandtner covers major themes in Marion's work-the historical event, art, nature, love, gift and sacrifice, prayer, and the Eucharist. She works within the phenomenology of givenness, but suggests that Marion himself has not considered important aspects of his philosophy.<br>

  Book Title: The Cruelest of All Mothers: Marie de l'Incarnation, Motherhood, and Christian Tradition-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dunn Mary<br>
  Abstract: In 1631, Marie Guyart stepped over the threshold of the Ursuline convent in Tours, leaving behind her eleven-year-old son, Claude, against the wishes of her family and her own misgivings. Marie concluded, "God was dearer to me than all that. Leaving him therefore in His hands, I bid adieu to him joyfully." Claude organized a band of schoolboys to storm the convent, begging for his mother's return. Eight years later, Marie made her way to Quebec, where over the course of the next thirty-three years she opened the first school for Native American girls, translated catechisms into indigenous languages, and served some eighteen years as superior of the first Ursuline convent in the New World. She would also maintain, over this same period, an extensive and intimate correspondence with the son she had abandoned to serve God. The Cruelest of All Mothers is, fundamentally, an explanation of Marie de l'Incarnation's decision to abandon Claude for religious life. Complicating Marie's own explication of the abandonment as a sacrifice carried out in imitation of Christ and in submission to God's will, the book situates the event against the background of early modern French family life, the marginalization of motherhood in the Christian tradition, and seventeenth-century French Catholic spirituality. Deeply grounded in a set of rich primary sources, The Cruelest of All Mothers offers a rich and complex analysis of the abandonment.<br>

  Book Title: Critical Trauma Studies-Understanding Violence, Conflict and Memory in Everyday Life<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Wertheimer Eric<br>
  Abstract: Trauma is a universal human experience. While each person responds differently to trauma, its presence in our lives nonetheless marks a continual thread through human history and prehistory. In
      Critical Trauma Studies, a diverse group of writers, activists, and scholars of sociology, anthropology, literature, and cultural studies reflects on the study of trauma and how multidisciplinary approaches lend richness and a sense of deeper understanding to this burgeoning field of inquiry. The original essays within this collection cover topics such as female suicide bombers from the Chechen Republic, singing prisoners in Iranian prison camps, sexual assault and survivor advocacy, and families facing the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. As it proceeds,Critical Trauma Studiesnever loses sight of the way those who study trauma as an academic field, and those who experience, narrate, and remediate trauma as a personal and embodied event, inform one another. Theoretically adventurous and deeply particular, this book aims to advance trauma studies as a discipline that transcends intellectual boundaries, to be mapped but also to be unmoored from conceptual and practical imperatives. Remaining embedded in lived experiences and material realities,Critical Trauma Studiesframes the field as both richly unbounded and yet clearly defined, historical, and evidence-based.<br>

  Book Title: Memory, Narrative and the Great War-Rifleman Patrick MacGill and the Construction of Wartime Experience<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Taylor David<br>
  Abstract: Memory, Narrative and the Great War provides a detailed examination of the varied and complex war writings of a relatively marginal figure, Patrick MacGill, within a general framework of our current pre-occupation with blood, mud and suffering. In particular, it seeks to explain how his interpretation of war shifted from the heroic wartime autobiographical trilogy, with its emphasis on 'the romance of the rifleman' to the pessimistic and guilt-ridden interpretations in his post-war novel, Fear!, and play, Suspense. Through an exploration of the way in which war-time experiences were remembered (and re-remembered) and retold in strikingly different narratives, and using insights from cognitive psychology, it is argued that there is no contradiction between these two seemingly opposing views. Instead it is argued that, given the present orientation and problem-solving nature of both memory and narrative, the different interpretations are both 'true' in the sense that they throw light on the ongoing way in which MacGill came to terms with his experiences of war. This in turn has implications for broader interpretations of the Great War, which has increasingly be seen in terms of futile suffering, not least because of the eloquent testimony of ex-Great War soldiers, reflecting on their experiences many years after the event. Without suggesting that such testimony is invalid, it is argued that this is one view but not the only view of the war. Rather wartime memory and narrative is more akin to an ever-changing kaleidoscope, in which pieces of memory take on different (but equally valid) shapes as they are shaken with the passing of time.<br>

  Abstract: This book explores how South Africa is negotiating its past in and through various modes of performance in contemporary theatre, public events and memorial spaces. It analyses the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a live event, as an archive, and in various theatrical engagements with it, asking throughout how the TRC has affected the definition of identity and memory in contemporary South Africa, including disavowed memories. Hutchison then considers how the SA-Mali Timbuktu Manuscript Project and the 2010 South African World Cup opening ceremony attempted to restage the nation in their own ways. She investigates how the Voortrekker Monument and Freedom Park embody issues related to memory in contemporary South Africa. She also analyses current renegotiations of popular repertoires, particularly songs and dances related to the Struggle, revivals of classic European and South African protest plays, new history plays and specific racial and ethnic histories and identities.<br>

In a concise and clear manner, Dalferth outlines the theological and philosophical approaches to hermeneutics in the modern era, in order to promote a convincing and defensible theology for the twenty-first century, critically carrying on Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Bultmann, without forgetting Karl Barth. The result of his reconstruction is a “radical theology" that neither glorifies premodern theology in an antimodern attitude nor seeks a mystical deepening of the secular, but argues for a radical change in theological perspective of the possible. In doing so, theology unfolds “limit concepts" that restrict the claims of science and philosophy critically, and develops “ideas of orientation" that illumine the ways in which human life is understood and lived in radically new ways in faith. From here, Dalferth unfolds the reality of revelation and the Christian sense of an unconditional hope that fundamentally transcends all beliefs based on mundane realities and orients the world on something beyond its own temporal horizon—its loving Creator.<br>

  Abstract: Thinking about theological topics such as sin and salvation makes use of the ordinary embodied cognitive processes we use every day. There is not a particular area of the brain or specific pattern of brain activity associated with religious experiences. Rather, as Brown and Strawn suggest: “there are a multitude of forms of body and brain activity that can mediate and embody religious experiences and the sense of the presence of God, but any particular brain-body event is experienced as religious or not based on the person’s expectations and ways of understanding their subjective experiences.”¹ The way we understand theology<br>

  Book Title: Ascent into Heaven in Luke-Acts-New Explorations of Luke's Narrative Hinge<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Pao David W.<br>
  Abstract: In comparison with other aspects of Jesus’ life and ministry, his ascent into heaven has often been overlooked within the history of the church. However, considering its placement at the end of the Gospel and the beginning of Acts—the only narrative depictions of the event in the New Testament—the importance of Jesus’ ascent into heaven is undeniable for Luke’s two-volume work. While select studies have focused on particular aspects of these accounts for Luke’s story, the importance of the ascension calls for renewed attention to the narratological and theological significance of these accounts within their historical and literary contexts. In this volume, leading scholars discuss the ascension narratives within the ancient contexts of biblical, Second Temple Jewish, and Greco-Roman literature; the literary contours of Luke-Acts; and questions of historical and theological significance in the wider milieu of New Testament theology and early Christian historiography. The volume sets out new positions and directions for the next generations of interpreters regarding one of the most important and unique elements of the Lukan writings.<br>

  Book Title: On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy-A Guide for the Unruly<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything,even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.<br>

  Abstract: Walking through Washington Square in New York City, I discovered this inscription cut into a monument: “The event is in the hand of God.” Though poetically articulated, this is of course an imprecise statement, because God, rather, is always in the hands of the event. That is to say, God is something other than the omnipresent demiurge who pronounced the words “fiat lux.” Perhaps what we call God is only the blink of an eye at the instant the voice resounded: Let there be light.

During that ceremony, an Indigenous elder from Greenland sang a healing song passed down from his great-great-grandmother. He sang it for the sculptor who hoped to create a healing garden for children on the site, which he envisioned as a medicine wheel of sculptures by Indigenous artists.

  Abstract: The schoolhouse episode is a staple event in African American narratives no doubt because it is remembered or imagined as a formative first scene of racial self-awareness.

The episode may involve a graduation exercise, with all the attendant questions regarding what, exactly, is commencing.

  Abstract: Narratives need time to tell their stories. In fact, without time, a narrative is not a narrative. This is because in order to tell a story, the storyteller must relay to the hearer or reader at least one process or event. For example, “Everett” is not a narrative. “Everett walks” is not much of a narrative, though the present tense “walks” in English implies a motion that occurs in time. A better narrative would be, “Everett drove the car to the store, picked up groceries, and came home.” This is the beginning of a “real” narrative because it entails multiple<br>

  Abstract: Like the first law of thermodynamics, literary fiction requires momentum. Fiction relies on propulsive devices: basic units of charge that power action, event, and consciousness, calibrated by laws of narrative motion and physical, material impressions of kinetic and potential energy transference. (These need not involve tales of actual motion or much, if any, movement—consider Beckett’s minimalism or the generic predicates for entropy in naturalist writing.) Fiction requires and is measured through potential—what fuels its psychosocial dynamics, the impetus of plot and character development, and its chronotopic ability to traverse multiple times and spaces.

  Abstract: My purpose in this essay is to critique the concept of narrative voice from the vantage point of a rhetorical model of fictive representation. In its core sense, narrative voice is concerned with the narrating instance, the various manifestations of which are usually categorized in terms of person and level. These distinctions provide for a typology of narrating instances which is conventionally understood within a communicative model of narration—a model in which the narrating instance is situated within the structure of narrative representation, as a literal communicative act (that is, as a discursive event that forms part of a<br>

  Abstract: Shaping and reshaping history is a retrospective art, performed after the event. Communal and individual interpretations of the vast and complex past are, however, perennially open to debate – which has spawned the intriguing thought of sending not merely the mind travelling to other epochs but living people to do likewise. If such voyages were to become feasible, then the shape of history could be viewed from both far away and close at hand. And epoch jumpers could not only witness past events to provide a trans-time commentary but they might even, so it is speculated, be able to change things<br>

  Book Title: The Event of Literature-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): EAGLETON TERRY<br>
  Abstract: In a highly unusual combination of critical theory and analytic philosophy, the author sees all literary work, from novels to poems, as a strategy to contain a reality that seeks to thwart that containment, and in doing so throws up new problems that the work tries to resolve. The "event" of literature, Eagleton argues, consists in this continual transformative encounter, unique and endlessly repeatable. Freewheeling through centuries of critical ideas, he sheds light on the place of literature in our culture, and in doing so reaffirms the value and validity of literary thought today.<br>

  Abstract: This collection of essays studies the encounter between allegedly ahistorical concepts of narratology and eighteenth-century literature. It questions whether the general concepts of narratology are as such applicable to historically specific fields, or whether they need further specification. Furthermore, at issue is the question whether the theoretical concepts actually are, despite their appearance of ahistorical generality, derived from the historical study of a particular period and type of literature. In the essays such concepts as genre, plot, character, event, tellability, perspective, temporality, description, reading, metadiegetic narration, and paratext are scrutinized in the context of eighteenth-century texts. The writers include some of the leading theorists of both narratology and eighteenth-century literature.<br>

  Abstract: Amonument may never lay claim to artistic autonomy from its social and historical context. It is necessarily a product and reflection of its time, derived from the initiative of an individual, group or state. The production and reception of monuments are determined by three diachronic historical moments. First, the moment of the historical event or figure which it represents or denotes. Second, the moment at which the monument was conceived and constructed. Third, the moment(s) of its reception, when subjected to interpretation or debate due to its renewed political relevance, a decision to renovate or demolish the monument, or even<br>

  Abstract: Is philosophy ready to take account of the sudden emergence and factuality of the event, which since Plato has been defined as a thought of the generality and invariance of essence? Such is the very general question with which I would like to begin. As Husserl recalls at the very beginning of his lectures on the phenomenology of internal time-consciousness, the question of time and its contingency has always constituted the most crucial challenge for philosophy, marking the limits of its enterprise to intellectually possess the world because, as the very stuff of things, time seems to escape radically from<br>

  Abstract: The year 2015 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the closure of the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II). The council, which broadly aimed at aligning the Church with the modern world, is considered the most significant event in the history of contemporary Roman Catholicism. The impact of the council on women religious, who engaged with the reforms with unprecedented enthusiasm, far exceeded the changes expected by the hierarchy of the Church. The decline of religious life is often blamed on the Second Vatican Council, but this book documents and demonstrates the greater complexity of the issues involved.<br>

  Book Title: Fundamental Theology-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Mansini Guy<br>
  Abstract: Fundamental Theologyexamines the light by which the mysteries of Christ and the Church, the Trinity and the Sacraments, are revealed to us. That light we call "revelation," and fundamental theology examines in the first place what this light shows about itself, and how it is sustained in the world. Or again, fundamental theology considers what the word of God has to say both about itself and what it has to say about where in the world it is to be heard. So, first it is a theology of Revelation (chapter 1), and second, a theology of the transmission of Revelation in Tradition, Scripture, and the Church (chapters 2, 3, and 4). Why must Revelation have the shape it does, and why must it be constituted by both word and event? Why is Tradition prior to Scripture, why must the word of God be written down, and why must Scripture come to us in two testaments? And why must the message conveyed in Tradition and Scripture have a living interpreter in the Church?Since no word is spoken unless it is heard, fundamental theology also investigates the conditions of hearing the word of God, the very hearing itself in the assent of faith, and a necessary consequence of this hearing. The remote conditions of hearing are also what theology calls our ability to come to the knowledge of thepreambula fidei- the things about God than can be known by the natural light (chapter 5). The immediate condition of hearing is the credibility of the word (chapter 6). Hearing is faith (chapter 7). And true hearing gives the hearer to recapitulate what is heard in his own wondering and thankful voice in theology (chapter 8). The introduction to theology in the last chapter is by way of considering the history of Catholic theology in the 20th century.<br>

  Abstract: The 1948 War is remembered in this special volume, including aspects of Israeli-Jewish memory and historical narratives of 1948 and representations of Israeli-Palestinian memory of that cataclysmic event and its consequences. The contributors map and analyze a range of perspectives of the 1948 War as represented in literature, historical museums, art, visual media, and landscape, as well as in competing official and societal narratives. They are examined especially against the backdrop of the Oslo process, which brought into relief tensions within and between both sides of the national divide concerning identity and legitimacy, justice, and righteousness of "self" and "other."<br>

  Abstract: Many Palestinian intellectuals have written about the harsh realities of their people following the

Literature on theNakbarepresents a salient effort to serve the Palestinian people’s struggle for their natural rights. While this focus on the injustices perpetrated against the Palestinians and the need for restitution is tempting, it leaves little room for critical reflection on the experience itself. As its point of reference is external, it dooms the writer to act out¹ the past.² In recent years<br>

  Book Title: After Representation?-The Holocaust, Literature, and Culture<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): EHRENREICH ROBERT M.<br>
  Abstract: After Representation?explores one of the major issues in Holocaust studiesùthe intersection of memory and ethics in artistic expression, particularly within literature.As experts in the study of literature and culture, the scholars in this collection examine the shifting cultural contexts for Holocaust representation and reveal how writersùwhether they write as witnesses to the Holocaust or at an imaginative distance from the Nazi genocideùarticulate the shadowy borderline between fact and fiction, between event and expression, and between the condition of life endured in atrocity and the hope of a meaningful existence. What imaginative literature brings to the study of the Holocaust is an ability to test the limits of language and its conventions.After Representation?moves beyond the suspicion of representation and explores the changing meaning of the Holocaust for different generations, audiences, and contexts.<br>

  Book Title: The Reparative in Narratives-Works of Mourning in Progress<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROSELLO MIREILLE<br>
  Abstract: The authors studied in this book can be visualized as the islands that constitute an unknown, fragile and trembling literary and cultural Francophone archipelago. The archipelago does not appear on any map, in the middle of an ocean whose name we already know. No Francophone anthology would put these authors together as a matter of course because what connects them is a narrative grammar rather than a national origin or even a language. Yet, their writing techniques and their apprehension of the real (the ways in which they know and name the world) both reflect and actively participate in our evolving perception of what Gayatri Spivak calls the “planet”. The Reparative in Narratives argues that argue that they repair trauma through writing. One description of these awe-inspiring, tender and sometimes horrifying tales is that their narrators are survivors who have experienced and sometimes inflicted unspeakable acts of violence. And yet, ultimately, despair, nihilism, cynicism or silence are never the consequences of their encounter with what some quickly call evil. The traumatic event has not killed them and has not killed their desire to write or perform, although the decidedly altered life that they live in the aftermath of the disaster forces them to become different types of storytellers. They are the first-person narrators of their story, and their narration reinvents them as speaking subjects. In turn, this requires that we accept new reading pacts. That pact is a temporal and geographical signature: the reparative narrative needs readers prepared to accept that healing belongs to the realm of possibilities and that exposure and denunciation do not exhaust the victim’s range of possibilities. Rosello contends that this context-specific yet repeating pattern constitutes a response to the contemporary figuration of both globalized and extremely localized types of traumatic memories.<br>

  Abstract: The singularity of a literary work, argues Derek Attridge, is best understood as an event in which the reader experiences both inventiveness and alterity. Each reading constitutes ‘an appreciation, a living-through, of the invention that makes the work not just different but a creative reimagination of cultural materials’.¹ My contention is that the singularity of Ciaran Carson’s writing rests upon his far-reaching imaginative engagements with ideas of space and place, and particularly urban spatiality in an Irish context. It is the purpose of this chapter to set out a critical framework for exploring these engagements in their widest manifestations. Carson’s<br>

  Book Title: Commemorating the Irish Famine-Memory and the Monument<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): MARK-FITZGERALD EMILY<br>
  Abstract: Commemorating the Irish Famine: Memory and the Monument presents for the first time a visual cultural history of the 1840s Irish Famine, tracing its representation and commemoration from the 19th century up to its 150th anniversary in the 1990s and beyond. As the watershed event of 19th century Ireland, the Famine’s political and social impacts profoundly shaped modern Ireland and the nations of its diaspora. Yet up until the 1990s, the memory of the Famine remained relatively muted and neglected, attracting little public attention. Thus the Famine commemorative boom of the mid-1990s was unprecedented in scale and output, with close to one hundred monuments newly constructed across Ireland, Britain, the United States, Canada and Australia. Drawing on an extensive global survey of recent community and national responses to the Famine’s anniversary, and by outlining why these memories matter and to whom, this book argues how the phenomenon of Famine commemoration may be understood in the context of a growing memorial culture worldwide. It offers an innovative look at a well-known migration history whilst exploring how a now-global ethnic community redefines itself through acts of public memory and representation.<br>

  Abstract: Holocaust memory, like all collective memory, is never constructed in a discursive vacuum but within the dominant discourses of a particular religious, national, ethnic, or social community. These discourses determine which aspects of a historical event will be collectively remembered and which forgotten. For example, detailed testimony of Holocaust survivors was virtually absent from the public sphere in both Israel and West Germany until the 1961 Eichmann trial in Jerusalem, when the dominant discourses in both countries changed dramatically (see Schlant; Segev; Wieviorka).

In his narrative about the development of his own intellectual heritage, Aristotle crowned Thales of Miletus as the first philosopher (

  Book Title: Fabricating History-English Writers on the French Revolution<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>

  Abstract: Barton Friedman demonstrates the ways in which English men of letters in the nineteenth century attempted to grasp the dynamics of history and to fashion order, however fragile, out of its apparent chaos. The authors he discusses--Blake, Scott, Hazlitt, Carlyle, Dickens, and Hardy--found in the French Revolution an event more compelling as a paradigm of history than their own "Glorious Revolution." To them the French Revolution seemed universally significant--a microcosm, in short. For these writers maintaining the distinction between "history" and "fiction" was less important than making sense of epochal historical events in symbolic terms. Their works on the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars occupy the boundary between history and fiction, and Fabricating History advances the current lively discussion of that boundary.<br>

However, the reconstruction of their

  Abstract: The two terms that form a contrasting pair are
                  effacement(forgetfulness) andconservation.Memory is, always and necessarily, an interaction between the two. The complete restitution of the past is terrifying and a clear impossibility (one, however, that Borges imagined in his story of ‘Funes, the Memorious’). Memory is essentially a selection: certain traits of an event are conserved, others immediately or progressively set aside and forgotten. Hence it is baffling that the ability Computers have to save information is termed memory, since they lack a basic feature of memory,<br>

  Author(s) Margry Peter Jan<br>
  Abstract: In societies that experience catastrophic events, numerous practices are aimed at endowing those events with meaning. The contingent nature of a catastrophe and the disorder it creates are inconsistent with the human sense of reason and provoke anxiety. To overcome the anxiety and limit the disorder, societies generally seek to reestablish order by explaining the catastrophe and by evaluating it, narrating it, commemorating it, and trying to prevent its repetition. All of these processes enable people to deal actively with the disorienting event and to convert disorder into order (Balandier 1988).<br>

  Abstract: The French creators of the Cannes International Film Festival had always envisioned the event functioning as a subtle assertion of patriotism. From the outset Cannes was conceived as a national-Republican response to Fascist Italy’s Venice festival (originating in 1932). However, as is often recounted, the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 brought a sudden halt to the first Cannes festival fortnight.¹ War in Europe meant that a competitive celebration of cinema was no longer a priority. Re-launched in 1946, a series of successful mountings of the festival eventually did bolster the myth of French cultural superiority. In Paris<br>

  Abstract: As we all know, French contemporary history followed a very peculiar path. From 1789 until at least 1945, the French nation was deeply divided over the implications of the founding event of French contemporary history, the Revolution.¹ From Robespierre to Napoleon III, Captain Dreyfus, Charles Maurras, Léon Blum, and Philippe Pétain, the cleavage over the legacy of the revolution—
                  les guerres franco-françaises—provides again and again the interpretational framework needed to understand French history. Not that 1945 was the end of it: the momentous changes of 1958, 1968, and 1981 served each time to underscore how, in some inscrutably French<br>

  Abstract: As we’ve often said in the past, historical research presents certain problems for the behavioural sciences. When we think about the history of education, can it, as the title of this book seems to suggest, be conceived of simply as a subdivision of educational research? And does the argumentative structure that is developed in this domain of knowledge automatically give rise to the construction of ‘one’, let alone, ‘the’ language of education? In our opinion, the history of education, if it wants to be valid, must in any event bear the stamp of what Michel de Certeau once called the<br>

He notes that the legend of Oedipus ‘seizes on a compulsion which everyone recognises because he feels its existence within himself’ (ibid).

Anglicanism historically also values proclamation, with Scripture and sermon integral to its liturgy; as Tracy points out, the Christian faith has historically held that “Jesus Christ is both the decisive word and the<br>

It is the concept of critical life events in particular that is a predictor of psychological anomalies. As a general rule, a critical life event condenses the experience and takes the affected person into a stadium of ‘relative imbalance’ (Filipp, 1981, p 24; Inglehart, 1991), therefore requiring the person to reorganise his or her behaviour and experience making<br>

As these three trajectories of art, politics and philosophy coalesce to transform themselves as in-between discourse, they emancipate the evanescent moment from being an ideational or mythic impossible utopia, opening out the possibility of a realizable utopia.

This event had heavily dislocating effects on Western political thought – no matter whether Marxist or not. As a reaction, Paul Ricœur published one of his best-known essays, ‘The Political Paradox’, in which he seeks to come to terms philosophically with the exigency of the Hungarian events (1965).

  Book Title: The Unexpected-Narrative Temporality and the Philosophy of Surprise<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Currie Mark<br>
  Abstract: This new study asks how stories affect the way we think about time and, in particular, how they condition thinking about the future. Focusing on surprise and the unforeseeable, the book argues that stories are mechanisms that reconcile what is taking place with what will have been. This relation between the present and the future perfect offers a grammatical formula quite different from our default notions of narrative as recollection or recapitulation. It promises new understandings of the reading process within the strange logic of a future that is already complete. It also points beyond that to some of the key temporal concepts of our epoch: prediction and unpredictability, uncertainty, the event, the untimely and the messianic. The argument is worked out in new readings of Sarah Waters’ Fingersmith, Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go and Julian Barnes’ The Sense of an Ending.Key Features: An original discussion of the relation of time and narrativeAn important intervention in narratologyA striking general argument about the workings of the mindProvides an overview of the question of surprise in philosophy and literature<br>

Prominent unexpected events, such as 9/11, the tsunami in the Indian Ocean in 2004, the financial meltdown of 2008, are moments that highlight our everyday reliance upon and expertise in prediction. Expert prediction is what we hold to account in the event of the unexpected. In moments of catastrophe, in cases of child abuse and murder, for<br>

  Book Title: Utopia in Performance-Finding Hope at the Theater<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Dolan Jill<br>
  Abstract: "Jill Dolan is the theatre's most astute critic, and this new book is perhaps her most important. Utopia in Performance argues with eloquence and insight how theatre makes a difference, and in the process demonstrates that scholarship matters, too. It is a book that readers will cherish and hold close as a personal favorite, and that scholars will cite for years to come."---David Román, University of Southern CaliforniaWhat is it about performance that draws people to sit and listen attentively in a theater, hoping to be moved and provoked, challenged and comforted? In
      Utopia in Performance, Jill Dolan traces the sense of visceral, emotional, and social connection that we experience at such times, connections that allow us to feel for a moment not what a better world might look like, but what it might feel like, and how that hopeful utopic sentiment might become motivation for social change.She traces these "utopian performatives" in a range of performances, including the solo performances of feminist artists Holly Hughes, Deb Margolin, and Peggy Shaw; multicharacter solo performances by Lily Tomlin, Danny Hoch, and Anna Deavere Smith; the slam poetry event Def Poetry Jam; The Laramie Project; Blanket, a performance by postmodern choreographer Ann Carlson; Metamorphoses by Mary Zimmerman; and Deborah Warner's production of Medea starring Fiona Shaw. While the book richly captures moments of "feeling utopia" found within specific performances, it also celebrates the broad potential that performance has to provide a forum for being human together; for feeling love, hope, and commonality in particular and historical (rather than universal and transcendent) ways.<br>

  Abstract: As we have seen, the patient brings to the clinical encounter a story, the history of Present Illness (HPI). As the physician listens and responds to this story, a special kind of relationship begins to develop between the patient and doctor. At its best, it is personal and professional at once. It is often charged with deeply felt emotion on the part of the patient—fear and anxiety, anger, sadness, or a combination of these feelings—and with empathetic and more or less calm attention on the part of the physician.

  Book Title: Microdramas-Crucibles for Theater and Time<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Muse John H.<br>
  Abstract: In
      Microdramas, John H. Muse argues that plays shorter than twenty minutes deserve sustained attention, and that brevity should be considered a distinct mode of theatrical practice. Focusing on artists for whom brevity became both a structural principle and a tool to investigate theater itself (August Strindberg, Maurice Maeterlinck, F. T. Marinetti, Samuel Beckett, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Caryl Churchill), the book explores four episodes in the history of very short theater, all characterized by the self-conscious embrace of brevity. The story moves from the birth of the modernist microdrama in French little theaters in the 1880s, to the explicit worship of speed in Italian Futurist synthetic theater, to Samuel Beckett's often-misunderstood short plays, and finally to a range of contemporary playwrights whose long compilations of shorts offer a new take on momentary theater.Subjecting short plays to extended scrutiny upends assumptions about brief or minimal art, and about theatrical experience. The book shows that short performances often demand greater attention from audiences than plays that unfold more predictably. Microdramas put pressure on preconceptions about which aspects of theater might be fundamental and about what might qualify as an event. In the process, they suggest answers to crucial questions about time, spectatorship, and significance.<br>

Such questions might be lamely disciplinary were it not for the symmetrically unimaginative, joint response they still receive.

  Abstract: With
      Flags of Our Fathers(2006) andLetters from Iwo Jima(2006), Clint Eastwood made a unique contribution to film history, being the first director to make two films about the same event. Eastwood's films examine the battle over Iwo Jima from two nations' perspectives, in two languages, and embody a passionate view on conflict, enemies, and heroes. Together these works tell the story behind one of history's most famous photographs, Leo Rosenthal's "Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima." In this volume, international scholars in political science and film, literary, and cultural studies undertake multifaceted investigations into how Eastwood's diptych reflects war today. Fifteen essays explore the intersection among war films, American history, and Japanese patriotism. They present global attitudes toward war memories, icons, and heroism while offering new perspectives on cinema, photography, journalism, ethics, propaganda, war strategy, leadership, and the war on terror.<br>

  Abstract: A certain repetition of the colonial event seems to haunt the very manner in which different portions of humanity have attempted, or indeed have been permitted, to engage with what has come to be called “the political.” This repetition can be visualized in terms of the revived function and reassigned place of the phenomenon called “religion”—more specifically, its recent return as “political religion,” or its seeming incompatibility with the demands of secular liberal democracy and multiculturalism. For South Asians the relationship between religion and repetition continues to be a vexed issue in their attempts to rethink the questions of<br>

  Abstract: THE SYSTEMATIC AND RADICAL EXTERMINATION OF THE Armenians of the Ottoman Empire during the years 1915–1916 is finally, or so it seems, on the current agenda. It has been eighty years since the event.¹ For the survivors and their descendants, it never ceased being current. Not for an instant. If it is so today, it is only for “civilized humanity” and for the duration of a trial and a judgment. The trial is that which brought before a French civil court the famous historian of the Islamic world and of the Ottoman Empire Bernard Lewis. He was summoned before<br>

  Abstract: The esoteric

Here Heidegger proposes that being takes place as "appropriation." Richard Polt's independent-minded account of theContributionsinterprets appropriation as an event of emergency that demands to be thought in a "future-subjunctive" mode. Polt explores the roots of appropriation in Heidegger's earlier philosophy; Heidegger's search for a way of thinking suited to appropriation; and the implications of appropriation for time, space, human existence, and beings as a whole. In his concluding chapter, Polt reflects critically on the difficulties of the radically antirationalist and antimodern thought of theContributions.<br>

Abstract: “On ne se détache pas du merveilleux, quand une fois on lui a donné sa créance, et pendant longtemps on s’acharne à rationaliser la merveille plutôt qu’à la réduire.”
         122Gaston Bachelard’s astute observation on the difficulty of dissolving wonder may sum up the history of attempts at naturalizing the resurrection. Yet the raising of the dead is a special case. It may be, if it ever happens, the wonder of wonders, but it also stands apart from the natural and preternatural marvels the Enlightenment sought to discredit and domesticate.123The criteria of testimony used to judge miracles or extraordinary phenomena can apply only indirectly to an event supposed to be outside time and space and one supposed to signal the end of nature and the universe. Although the intrinsic plausibility of resurrection could be questioned, belief in its probability or certainty did not count as the superstitious or “enthusiastic” product of a diseased imagination. The Enlightenment contributed to make the miraculous less prominent in theology and faith and to leave it behind as a silent and unsettled question on the edges of culture, ignored, like marvels, rather than debunked. In the process, the body was lost.<br>

Abstract: The fact that the clubs constantly held fundraisers for worthy causes may seem to challenge this interpretation. One might guess that participants treated the fundraisers as an implicit, affirming connection to institutions, without needing to verbalize it. To answer this possible objection, we need to look at how members treated the raffles and lotteries. The fundraising raffle at “Welcome Home the Troops” was typical of members’ distant, issue‐free, institution‐scorning approach. Two members complained about how useless some of the Navy’s raffle prizes were. Referring to the fluorescent pink windshield wiper blades and brown denim jackets that one said “look like UPS drivers’ uniforms,” one said to the other, “If I had known what the prizes were I never would have bought a ticket!” They did not treat the event as a fundraiser but as a chance to win something. That is, the referent for the act of giving money was not “the wider world” and its institutions in any active sense. Similarly, most Buffaloes never talked about the war, except as it impinged on their travel plans. They worried that they or their family members in the military might be harmed; some were very worried about the researcher, who boarded a plane that had been featured on the local news because of a bomb scare on the day the war began. They took the danger of the war very personally, but not politically (Bourdieu
               1977).<br>

Abstract: 3. Did I overlook possible points of continuity across paradigms?The answer to this question relates to criteria for establishing continuity. The use of the same term, for example, does not mean that its meaning (extensionally or intensionally) is the same. Thus, Darnells suggestion that we all share ethnography, for example, is appealing, but I am not sure that ethnography means the same for all of those engaged in it, especially as more and more students are encouraged to work in their own communities and engage in urban (or suburban) fieldwork that often forces them to live the contradictions of an alienated native self or of a privileged fieldworker on the way to acquiring a professional multiplepersonality disorder. CookGumperz and Gumperz mention narrative and narrativity. It is difficult for me to see the narratives recorded by Boas as the same thing as the narratives collected and analyzed by Ochs and Capps (2001). They are both texts, but they were produced, recorded, and analyzed in such different ways that their similarities rapidly vanish as we expand the notion of teller to include the work done by participants in the narrative event. Finally, Spitulnik brings up the socalled SapirWhorf hypothesis as a possible source of continuity across paradigms. This is the most challenging of the three proposals for a thematic link across paradigms because the SapirWhorf hypothesis has almost mythical proportions in the public imagination. Together with the evolution of language (a topic that most linguists tend to avoid), the SapirWhorf hypothesis is a must in anthropology textbooks and in introductory books on language and culture. But the semanticindeterminacy problem is here even more serious than for ethnography and narrative given that, as Spitulnik knows (see her use of the qualifier socalled), there never was a SapirWhorf hypothesis, unless we take for it Hoijers (1954:93) rarely quoted informal and very general definition: The central idea of the SapirWhor~<br>

Abstract: A frightening consequence thus imposes itself: to claim to define what a man is leads to or at least opens the possibility of leading to the elimination of that which does not correspond to this definition. Every political proscription, every racial extermination, every ethnic cleansing, every determination of that which does not merit life—all of these rest upon a claim to define (scientifically or ideologically) the humanity of man; without this claimed guarantee, no one could put such political programs into motion. Even the worst of modern tyrants needs reasons and concepts. Here we find a new
         experientia crucis: in order to kill a human being, it is necessary to have the permission to kill. But in order to have that, it is first necessary to be able to deny to such and such a human being (the well‐named “So and So”) his or her face and thus his or her humanity; and one gets there by defining and comprehending humanity through concepts, by fixing its limits and, in this way, discovering the one who cannot claim humanity, and thus can or ought to die. Here a metaphysical proposition in appearance perfectly neutral takes on the aspect of a silent threat: every determination is a negation, or more exactly (because in the event the issue is extension alone), “figura non aliud quam determinatio, et determinatio negatio est” (“figure is nothing but limitation, and limitation is negation”).23Determining amounts to denying (and not the inverse, for if determination is sufficient for denial, a negation does not always suffice to determine). Determining the humanity of man thus amounts to making an end of him.<br>

Abstract: The reader of the text is absent when the author is writing, but we can also speak of the absence of the writer at the event of reading. Ricoeur argues that a text replaces dialogue that would otherwise connect the voice of one to the hearing of another [
         21]. This semiautonomy is analogous to fixation by writing to the extent that Ricoeur argues that we can use “fixation” to encompass all comparable phenomena in the sphere of the transmission of discourse. As he shows, discourse is language as event or language as used, but discourse that is fixed in a manner analogous to writing signals the presence of text. In this way, Ricoeur extends the concept of “text” to include all document‐like objectifications [38]. Fixation is more to do with autonomy of the text than it is to do with what constitutes the text. So, it is apparent that a text is a semiautonomous achievement of discursive operations and that it is available to be read in another place and time by an audience. For Ricoeur, this is the semantic autonomy of the text. Appropriation by the reader as audience, which is discussed below, is the counterpart of the semantic autonomy of the text [39,40]. On the way toward appropriation, the reader interprets the text through the mediation of reading [14].<br>

Abstract: How can he possibly fathom the depth of divine providence that leaves no event to mere chance? Tesauro asks in the opening sentence of
      Sympathy.68“Today,” the divinity has formed a “problem” (problema) that the human mind cannot easily dismiss or solve. In the “solemn mausoleum” of Turin, divine providence has gathered the “Great Maurice” (Maurice of Savoy) and the holy shroud, but also the body of the martyr Maurice.69If the created world exists under the aegis of divine providence that controls the flight of every bird, the movement of every wave, and the falling of every branch from every tree, this “marvelous” occurrence must harbor a meaning.<br>

Issue: jr.2005.85.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Young III William W.<br>
Abstract: The dislocation of the turn to the subject, through the privileging of narrative, renders the subject’s “world of possibilities” secondary; however, it does not deny it. Frei is clear that such hermeneutical interpretation may occasionally be suitable
         withinthe literal sense. It is, however, the literal sense, and its practice of reading, that creates room for hermeneutics, rather than a second naïveté that makes room for narrative. This becomes clearest when one notes that for all of his criticism of the hermeneutical focus on parables, Frei turns to parables in the culminating section ofThe Identity of Jesus Christand suggests that through recognizing Jesus’s identity, one may learn to read historyasa parable. A properly narrative literal sense, whose ascriptive reading is never complete or final, ultimately may recognize its own parabolic nature: “This brings us to our second parable: Jesus Christ, precisely because he is not only an individual but an individual in a narrated story,serves as a parable.”23As narrated, Christ’s identity grows from the interaction between his character and the circumstances of his life; the reader cannot grasp it conceptually, in a clear and distinct Cartesian sense. This parabolic aspect of identity—the irreducible singularity of the conjunction between character and circumstances—prevents Christ from simply being a manifestation of a “savior‐myth,” a static, conceptual figure who is ultimately divorced from history.24His identity, within the narrative, is an event—unique and singular in its occurrence, contingent, and therefore not readily mapped onto other events.25Rather, it is only in undergoing the narrative by making ascriptive connections that the reader comes to understanding history in its contingency.<br>

Abstract: This research suggests that that uniting was temporary at best and illusory in all likelihood. Brooks’s proclamation of unity was based on his presumption that the two Americas experienced a shared national event on 9/11. Mrs. Barrett’s case implies, however, that even on the day of September 11, 2001, at least two Americas—not Red and Blue Americas, but theologically certain and humanistically questioning Americans—were making radically different meanings and constructing competing collective memories of that day alone, memories that were and continue to be entirely incommensurate.
         27While Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson’s initial understandings of 9/11 may have been extreme, they were not so outlandish as to be unrecognizable to the students and teachers at Eternal Grace school.28For them and the millions of Americans like them, like all other events in history, 9/11 is fundamentally religious.<br>

Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>

Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: Yet, since the Christian model of responsibility rests on a deepened interiority and is the gift of a self‐less other who remains inscrutable, this new model has a definite place for secrecy, for the
      mysterium, for the mystical, unlike the Greco‐Roman version, which is superseded so radically as to break entirely with its memory. Christian responsibility has its origin in a gift, in a “gift that is not a present,” and it is from the outset tied with secrecy for essential reasons. Indeed, as Derrida points out, “a gift that could be recognized as such in the light of day, a gift destined for recognition, would immediately annul itself. The gift is the secret itself.… Secrecy is the last word of the gift which is the last word of the secret” (GD,pp. 29–30). Originating in the elusive event of such a gift, even the transition from Platonism and neo‐Platonism to Christianity remains obscure; it cannot be simply accounted for in positive terms. But since the gift of responsibility is a gift from a self‐effacing Goodness (who holds the human being in its hands from within) to the individual in all his or her creatural singularity, it is “the gift of something that remains inaccessible, unpresentable, and as a consequence secret” (GD,p. 29). The donee is exclusively responsible to the donator, and hence, as Derrida’s discussion of the Abrahamic story of the sacrifice of Isaac in the second half ofThe Gift of Deathdemonstrates, he or she is relieved of the necessity of explaining his or her deeds to others. Indeed, being the unique addressee of the gift, the responsible individual must, at the limit, relate to others in an irresponsible fashion. How he responds to the divine Law remains secret—that is, unaccounted for—and ultimately secret to him‐ or herself as well, for such responsible decision making must, in principle, be unaccountable.<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: The surfacing of fundamentalisms in our time, echoing a long and often suppressed history of struggle, represents not so much a rupture from the received order of time but rather a repressed revenant. Its reappearance reminds us of a historical perspective joined to the present that has always provided the stage for a constant enactment of the past in the present. What the current conjunctures disclose is a configuration Edmund Husserl once thought of as a “‘thickened’ present,”
         8a present filled with traces of different moments and temporalities, weighted with sediments. He referred to the “comet’s tail” of retentions that manage to maintain their identity long after the inaugurating event has passed.9Husserl also used the example of how notes of a musical score are succeeded but still remain. It should be recalled that Husserl’s conception of time consciousness was yoked to the category of lifeworld; unlike the everyday, it does not take into consideration the empirical world and history so that one may examine a time such as it first appears to consciousness, “an immanent time in the course of consciousness,” what has been described as that which is most subjective in subjectivity.10Phenomenology, driven by its own scientific aspirations, aimed to avoid becoming simply a variant of introspection, as such. It sought, therefore, to steer clear from descriptions of lived time as it was given so as to clarify the essential character of a consciousness of time, reaching “finally the one infinite objective time in which all things and events—bodies and their physical properties, psyches and their psychic states—have their definite temporal positions, which we can determine by means of a chronometer” (PIC,p. 7;PIZ,p. 7). As for preobjective time, it is a “flow of the modifications of the past” and a continuing gushing forth of the now (PIC,p. 74;PIZ,pp. 71–72), a flux of lived experiences where originary impressions succeed each other, each constrained by its h~<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: Stories begin with a view to their end; just as types must take their bearings from antitypes. Both of these truisms meet in the Adamic myth’s orientation to a future that overcomes the breach occasioned by the fall and, for Christian readers, through one who will mediate a new covenant of salvation. Thus, unlike the Babylonian cosmogonic myth that was directed toward “cultural‐ritual re‐enactment” of a past event and the Greek tragic myth that explained the present “spectacle of Terror and Pity,” the Adamic myth was most essentially eschatological: it was oriented to the “man to come.”
         78This was for Christianity the “second‐man,” the offer of “so much more” in Jesus Christ. Intermediate types were offered by the biblical narrative, however: figures that represented the promise of overcoming the fall and of ideal fulfillment of human potential asimago dei. In the traditional narrative, Abraham is the first and most fully drawn of such figures.79In the character of Enoch, Smith found an earlier figure to suggest another measure of human potential: theurgy, or the right to access heavenly powers and even to influence future events related to salvation.<br>

Author(s): Scimeca Ross<br>
Abstract: What value does the correspondence theory of truth have for librarianship? There is no question that this theory is accepted by most people, be they scientists, social workers, or factory workers. Although the correspondence theory is essentially the common‐sense view of truth, there are three major problems that are of concern to librarianship. The first problem arises with regard to the notion of states of affairs. Since this notion pertains to the ontological verifiability in the actual world, what then of fictions? Consider the following sentence: “Hamlet was poisoned by Claudius.” This statement is true given that we have Shakespeare’s play describing such an event, but this is not a real state of affairs. It did not happen in history and cannot be verified in any historical chronicle. One way a correspondence theorist can eliminate this problem about fictions is through the notion of possible worlds. Within this framework, every literary work constitutes a determined possible world where both true and false statements can be made. This is metaphysically cumbersome. It would also cause a further problem. One would have no justification for making statements comparing two or more works of fiction. The practice of literary criticism would become very restrictive.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: To call the subsequent lexical effacement of the feminized hero in the final paragraph a displacement and condensation respectively—of maternal absence
         uponand thenwithinthe very identification of the marriageable male—is to begin suggesting, with the unconscious of Dickensian grammar caught out in this way, where attention itself might be caught up by such a disjuncture. Forunconsciousis just the word. One can only follow out the prose's diffusive lines of stress in and through the transferential recognitions of that analytic session called reading. By the invested give- and-take of such legibility, in this and many another fictional case, the psycholinguistic trace of elided desire is offered up to registration. It comes to us, as we bring our recognition to it, along the serial slippage between plot and its inscriptive medium, between the manifest propulsion of event and a subterranean impetus glimpsed on the run in the kinks of wording. Concerning the unrevealed mother, we can never be sure what Dickens meant to finesse or massage or avoid or foreclose or, alternately, what he himself as author may have entirely repressed in the psychodynamic of his narrative plotting inLittle Dorritfrom chapter plan to finished book. All we know is that hiswritingappears to be no more than half conscious of these operations—no more, but no less. It is this reciprocal remainder under the transferential analysis I am here calling narratography that keeps the legible textin playacross the more imperious s/pacings of plot.<br>

Abstract: In his notion of involuntary memory, Marcel corrects the Aristotelian principle that an object of the imagination that is imprinted in memory cannot coincide with the present experience of the object itself, because “there is no such thing as memory of the present.” Although he espouses the Aristotelian principle that “one can only imagine what is absent,” Marcel sees this principle as invalidated whenever the essential character of a presently experienced sensation coincides with that of a sensation imprinted in memory. In such an instance, one can enjoy the impression of the present sensation to the fullest; thanks to the intensifying “application” of one’s imagination of it, one enjoys, in other words, the impression that a sensation or event from the past is being concretely resuscitated in the here and now. This imaginative appreciation of the present throws one into the bliss of a dimension “emancipated from the order of time” (affranchie de l’ordre du temps) and makes one oblivious of or indifferent to the squalor of one’s “directly felt reality.” Aristotle, “On Memory,” in

Abstract: War typically arouses feelings of indignation and mourning—indignation at the injustices that surround one or both sides in war; mourning for the loss of life and goods associated with forming a common life. Doubtless for that reason Augustine described even a just war as marked by “heartfelt grief.”
         45Indignation and mourning are more complicated than “unpleasant” or “uncomfortable” sentiments alone; they express esteem for what has been lost or what has been unjustly put at risk: security, friendship, peace, freedom, community, natural habitat. Augustine makes a similar point about the emotions when he poignantly describes his feelings in response to his friend’s death in book 4 ofConfessionsand, later in that same work, when he grieves the death of his mother.46Augustine’s deep and anxious mourning tells him something about how he orders his loves—about whether they are virtuous or not.47Underlying that worry is the fact that, in Augustinian moral psychology, emotions are not merely raw feelings. They are moral responses, registering what we value through the passions. Our feelings thus presuppose norms that, properly recognized, prevent us from self‐indulgence or inordinate attachment to worldly objects. Augustine writes, “In general, as a man’s will is attracted to or repelled in accordance with the various character of different objects which are pursued or shunned, so it changes and turns into feelings of various kinds.”48Emotions themselves are not a problem for Augustine; they express an interpretation of an event, the embrace or loss of an objective good. Ideally, indignation or mourning are forms of properly ordered appreciation, for we would not feel a loss were we not previously attached to something genuinely valuable that has now ceased to be.<br>

Abstract: It is on this basis that Coleridge affirms special providence, but not in the sense of God’s being swayed to allow us to have certain things, “this or that particular petition … any single detached event or incident.” Instead, God’s effect is defined against “the
         whole Chainof the Events, Incidents, internal processes & changes, & external providences, of our Life” (N6474, fol. 9v)—that is, our whole being, the ultimate determination and horizon of which is God’s relation to it. This is why Coleridge claims on more than one occasion that the answer to the efficacy of prayer lies with the intuition ofdeitas diffusa, “the Godhead as present in and thro’ all things” (N5411, fol. 45).24God is with us, for Coleridge, “present to our inmost Being”; it is simply a matter of letting him make his claim on us, as Coleridge affirms in marginalia to the Book of Common Prayer: “As God, he must bepresent entireineverycreature; but he is said todwellin the regenerate; tocometo them who receive him by Faith in hisname.”25Once the presence and claim of God is acknowledged, the effect follows: “Prayer is a gift … that must be received in order to come into being.”26Human prayer is always answered because our acts of prayer are in themselves acts of opening us up to receive, from God, our most authentic identities and meanings, authenticity that glimmers to us from the wounded root of our being: “O grant me the aid of thy Spirit, that I may with a deeper faith, a more enkindled Love bless thee, who thro’ thy Son has privileged me to call thee Abba Father!”27<br>

Abstract: Aiding in this iconical reconfiguration were the microadjusting features of ritual performance. Procedures such as shaving, showering, praying, and blowing Quranic verses helped to heighten the register of the ritual event, and ultimately to instantiate an irreversible commitment to the end goal. Indeed, the entire ritual process might be seen as secondary to, or at least supportive of, the oath unto death in section 1. No differently than oaths in ancient war literature, the oath of the last instructions was a highly sanctified liturgical order that aimed to instantiate a commitment and to communicate binding intent.<br>

Abstract: A few days following the announcement of Israel's independence, Blanchot wrote to Lévinas to ask after his reaction given that Lévinas had in earlier discussions emphasized his position that Zionism did not seem to be in accordance with Judaism's destiny. Lévinas responds by explaining his current ambivalence, one that is punctuated, on the one side, by a sense of the miraculous and, on the other, by the feeling that such an event reduces Judaism to the level of the mundane, to the “thirst of ministers, ambassadors, functionaries, and military officers who will finally have their protocols” (Lévinas, “Lettre à Maurice Blanchot sur la création de l'État d'Israël,”
            La Règle du Jeu, no. 41 [Oct. 2009]: 249). See the English translation of this letter in this issue ofCritical Inquiry, p. XXX.<br>

Abstract: Demonstration of how this notion works in Dante becomes even clearer when we examine the animal similes in
         Paradiso. These overwhelmingly are bird images, with the major exception of the bee simile that occurs in canto 31. Unlike the bird similes inInferno5, where the birds as flocks are likened to the windblown lovers, the bird similes inParadisoinvariably describe the purposeful action of lone birds. Furthermore, in contrast to many similes and metaphors inParadisothat seem to attenuate the relationship between what is figured and the language to express it,63in the case of these similes, the vehicle—sign and signifier of the immanent action—makes the natural event itself an “opening” to the “fullness of being” of the animal world. For example, in describing the action of the iconographic Eagle (Paradiso19 and 20), Dante makes its movement parallel to both a circling stork in the wild who has just fed her chicks and simultaneously the just-fed chick who looks up at the mother. With the verbs in the eternal tense (the present), this image likens the maternal symbiosis with the chicks as eternal actions to the movement of the symbolic eagle, itself an allegory standing for imperial masculinity and divine justice. Together (vehicle and tenor), they are both animal and transfigured human, male and female, mother and child, abstract and concrete:<br>

Abstract: Interestingly, events in the final part of
            Adaptationfall into a clear pattern, gaining progressively in verisimilitude. The drugs, sex, and guns are of course ludicrous. But the tender scene in the swamp between Charlie and Donald is merely unlikely. The tender scene with Amelia is also merely unlikely and is given increased plausibility by Donald's death (after such an event, Charlie might well be a changed man). Charlie finishing his film is something easy to imagine. And the flowers at the end are not just realistic but, well, real. They would not look out of place in a Discovery Channel documentary.<br>

Abstract: A similar dynamic is implied by the biblical depiction of corpse impurity. In particular, Numbers 19:14–15 states that a corpse defiles objects found together with it in an enclosure (
         ʾohel,literally a “tent”): “This is the instruction: In the event a person dies inside a tent, anyone who enters the tent and anyone inside the tent shall be impure for seven days. Any open vessel that does not have a lid fastened around it is impure.” The underlying conception seems to have been that this defilement would spread like a gas.
               As B. A. Levine points out, this mode of pollution is particularly clear from the law of the open vessel in v. 15: “The operative principle is that the impurity present within the structure invades all of its interior air, or space, and only sealed vessels are protected.”67
            
               This conceptualization seems to have shaped, at least in part, the rabbinic elaboration of these laws. The conceptualization of corpse impurity as a gas is evident in various principles, including the assumption that corpse impurity spread in all directions inside a tent and the notion that it tended to escape through openings, that “it is the nature of impurity to exit and not to enter.”68
            
               Why did corpse impurity spread like a gas within an enclosure, unlike the forms of defilement described in Leviticus 15, which required contact? The answer is simple: the spread of this form of defilement was modeled after the dissemination of the stench of a decomposing corpse.69<br>

Abstract: In the South Asian cultural zone, a similar understanding of evil spirits primarily in the idiom of affliction and healing is evident in the study by Kakar (
         1982). Across Muslim, Hindu, and indigenous traditions, a variety of healers confront a broad repertoire of spirits and demons attacking from outside the individual with an effect that is described more as illness than as evil, and that can be understood in terms of psychodynamic conflict rather than morality. In the Sinhalese Buddhist setting, Kapferer (1991 [1983]) also examines ceremonies to exorcize demons as forms of ritual healing, where the demons are understood as fully integrated into the larger ritual system such that “deities and demons are inversions, refractions, or transformations of the possibility of each other” (162), and exorcism ceremonies are artistic forms applied to human problems. It is certainly the case that “To sign an event of illness and suffering as the work of demons is to invoke some of the most powerful Sinhalese metaphors of destruction and disorder, and to point to death and cosmic disruption as ultimate possibilities” (121). However, the effect of demons is completely independent of human agency, except in the case of the sorcery demon in which illness is “mediated by the malign thoughts of others towards the victim” (76). When Kapferer turns in a separate work to consider the major ceremony associated with this demon, his attention remains focused as much on its place in the overall religious system as on the problem of evil. He emphasizes an existential understanding of sorcery in its engagement with “fundamental processes by which human beings construct and transform their life situation … the humancentric forces of humanly created realities” (1997:xii) and the importance of both human intentionality and the contingency of human life. While sorcery is clearly regarded as immoral by Sinhalese, the burden of this immorality is partially displaced onto the “supramunda~<br>

Author(s): Lehnhof Kent R.<br>
Abstract: But if
      Lear’s emphasis on individual responsibility leaves us without a recognizable political system, it also leaves us without a recognizable ethical system. Though the play thrusts us into the realm of the ethical (l’éthique), this realm does not resolve into an ethics (une éthique).
            Or, to put it another way, the drama does not yield up or yield to a set of general rules capable of determining the proper course of action anterior to or outside of the event. Categorical imperatives cannot tell us what Cordelia ought to do when asked to profess her love, or what Lear ought to do when betrayed by his eldest daughters, or what Edgar ought to do when solicited by his suicidal father. Clearly, these characters must respond to the other, but the quality of their response remains rooted in the moment, deeply infixed in “ripeness” and “feeling” rather than in precepts and rules. With a few notable exceptions (e.g., the treachery of Edmund, the cruelty of Cornwall and Regan), the challenging emotional landscape of this play is not to be navigated by a priori ethical precepts—which is one of the many reasons it feels so Levinasian to me. Whereas someone like Kant envisions ethics as a matter of principle, such that uprightness consists of accepting and enacting impersonal, rational rules, Levinas believes it is unconscionably reductive to regard the other or my relation to him as universal instances or generic abstractions. The other is neither an instance nor an abstraction: he is who he is. Consequently, the ethical experience must be personal and particular, not principled.55
         
            Levinas argues—and I think56
         Learis in broad agreement—that one cannot resort to preconceived imperatives if one is to respond authentically. Rather, what one must do is resign oneself to a thoroughgoing passivity in which responsiveness is determined wholly in the moment, entirely by the other.<br>

Article Title: Milton’s “Unoriginal” Voice: Quotation Marks in<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673750<br>
Date: 08 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Hequembourg Stephen<br>
Abstract: Dictates or inspires—so much in Milton’s great poem depends on such little words as “or.” As Peter Herman rightly notes, “the Miltonic ‘Or’ inscribes incertitude at the heart of
      Paradise Lost.”
               In both40
            Destabilizing Milton(2005) andThe New Milton Criticism(2012), we find compelling arguments against the critical urge to find inParadise Losta coherence of design and a consistency of belief, to disregard, that is, the poet’s own vacillations and contradictions or to resolve them too readily into a higher unity.
               As I have argued, the question of quotation marks and of the source of satanic speech reveals many such “undecidable” moments—literary knots that cannot be undone by any amount of critical savvy. One of the most destabilizing aspects of41
            Paradise Lostis that one simply cannot know who speaks some of the poem’s most important and memorable passages. But in this particular case, we confront, I believe, something vaster than the incertitude of a single mind (even one as wily and well stored as Milton’s). The argument of the poem involves the poet in the impossible task of imposing onto a sudden and inexplicable theological event the logic of narrative, with all its linear causality, foreshadowing, and character development. A drama of the fall must begin with either a push from outside or an inclination from within, but choosing either would be a theological disaster. The blocking of a voice’s origin is a crucial part of Milton’s aesthetic repertoire because it allows him to tell the story of original sin without falling into either extreme. The phenomenon of the unoriginal voice illustrates just how exquisitely crafted uncertainty can be in Milton, how it manifests itself in such minute discriminations: Does Eve quote or create the dream voice? Does Raphael report or invent? Does Satan play the serpent as an instrument, or does he make him sing? The “New Milton critics” are right to recognize the fund~<br>

Author(s): Huth Kimberly<br>
Abstract: For at least one audience member of
      King Lear, however, viewing the play in the theater is itself a traumatic event that inhibits the interpretation necessary for assimilating the pain and violence into a unified tragic vision. In his lectures on Shakespeare’s tragedies, A. C. Bradley, perhaps in spite of himself and his sensibilities, is particularly interested in tragic pain—or, more precisely, he is interested in tragic suffering and the way the physical pain depicted on stage gets in the way of this more lofty ideal. Bradley repeatedly comments on the excessive or intolerable nature of the pain represented in Shakespeare’s plays, but there are methods of analysis that make some instances of pain more “bearable”: “if we fully imagine the inward tragedy in the souls of the persons as we read, the more obvious and almost physical sensations of pain or horror do not appear in their own likeness, and only serve to intensify the tragic feelings in which they are absorbed.”
            Here Bradley shifts the audience’s imaginative focus to the “inward” rather than the physical pain of the characters, espousing a classic view of tragedy that places bodily pain in service to something else—a different, purer sort of “tragic feeling.” The means of accessing the tragedy makes a significant difference to Bradley, as is abundantly clear in his analysis of40
         King Lear. This play, he states, “is imperfectly dramatic, and there is something in its very essence which is at war with the senses, and demands a purely imaginative realization.”
            Watching and listening to41
         King Learin the theater is, for Bradley, counterproductive; the realization of the characters and their actions on stage actually inhibits the stirring of “tragic feelings” he takes to be Shakespeare’s goal.<br>

Abstract: Peperzak’s account of philosophy as conversation emphasizes a few key themes. First, he defends the view that the history of philosophy is an integral part of the practice of philosophy. A tradition in his account is a living conversation in which philosophical sources are not simply transmitted but transformed in the process. Speaking to his fellow Catholic philosophers, Peperzak at once defends the legitimacy of appeal to the historical traditions of communities for citizens of the “Republic of philosophy” (176) and insists that tradition cannot simply canonize past thinkers but must become part of the ongoing conversation of the present. Second, Peperzak emphasizes more than most philosophers the significance of philosophical style. For him, style is the particularization of philosophical tradition and thematics in lived conversations. It marks my individual way of offering my voice to a philosophical companion—a unique event, even if what is Said may repeat inherited propositions (90–91).<br>

Article Title: Poetics of Conspiracy and Hermeneutics of Suspicion in Tacitus's<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: ca.2013.32.issue-1<br>
Date: 04 2013<br>
Abstract: This article argues that the end of Tacitus's
         Dialogus de Oratoribusis inconclusive in ways that draw attention to the difficulty of interpretation not onlyofthe dialogue, as by modern scholars, but alsointhe dialogue, as by its leading characters. The inconclusiveness is especially marked by a commonly noted, but little discussed, feature of the end: when the rest of the characters laugh at the point of departure, Tacitus himself does not. Arguing that this difference of affective response on the part of the characters prefigures differences in interpretive response on the part of readers, the article identifies different strains in recent scholarship: pessimistic and optimistic. Both forms of response entail an attribution of a “poetics of conspiracy” (Hinds) to the ultimate speaker of the dialogue, the author Tacitus, and a “hermeneutics of suspicion” (Ricoeur) to its reader. At the same time, the author's double-position, as character and author, between narrated event and narration of the event to the reader, suggests that the other characters in the dialogue may, like the author and reader, also exercise such poetics and hermeneutics on one another and themselves. The article ends with thecomparandumof the first satire of Tacitus's near contemporary, Juvenal, suggesting that, in the case of these works that can look with hindsight on the social and political past of the Early Empire, their modes of transmission and reception may be politically determined (e.g., as conspiratorial, suspicious) but may also demonstrate, within the restrictions of social and political determinations, a high degree of contingency, reflexivity, and autonomy. Such possibilities suggest that the text itself is part of a pragmatic and performative tradition of the kind enacted by its characters, in addition to a tradition of the production of (comparatively static and unfree) “literary” works.<br>

Abstract: A major bid to host a fair celebrating the opening of the Panama Canal came from the city of San Diego. While losing the bid for an international exposition, San Diego's representatives convinced the Congress to support a smaller event initially called the Panama-California Exposition. Because of its longer duration and because of World War I, which prevented the return of several European exhibits to their countries from San Francisco, San Diego's fairs ended up hosting a number of international pavilions. It led to changing its title to Panama-California International Exposition. See Matthew Bokovoy,

Publisher: Renaissance Society of America<br>
Issue: i253935<br>
Date: 4 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Weinberg Jodi<br>
Abstract: The development of the "contrapposto" pose in Renaissance art depends, as is well known, on ancient discussions of the rhetorical figure of antithesis. Such philological associations, however, have drawn attention to the pose as a motif of style, notable only for its gracefulness of form. This essay considers how the turning pose in Raphael's work, rather than merely referring to the rhetorical figure of antithesis, evokes the thematic and structural significance of the trope. The discussion focuses on the turning female in his "Transfiguration" as a figuration of the antithetical event of revelation, where the unknown becomes known.<br>

Author(s): Whitehead Madeleine<br>
Abstract: Creativity is seen as inherent in the developmental potential of the individual and of society as well. This "yen for becoming" is felt at all ages, and is in fact recognized as associated with the realization of the profoundest aspirations of man. Its origin is detected in early childhood. It is deeply rooted in the associative trend of thought and action, a trend which tends to perpetuate itself in the direction of unending abundance and novelty. The process assumes passage from awareness to memory, and even to the subconscious. The thought of the moment dips into the past, awakens memories, even those seemingly forgotten, reactivates all that is pertinent for the creation of new structures. It is believed that this tendency is essentially dynamic, endowed with energy which drives toward endless realizations. Nothing dies in the subconscious, as Freud pointed out. Each past experience is apt to return into consciousness and engage in a double process of homogenization and heterogenization, of convergent and divergent currents. Here the combinations, or commutations and permutations, are indefinite, an array which defies any computer. Creativity calls into play all energized experiences, present and stored, cognitive and affective, perceptual and conceptual, sensory and motoric, verbal and non-verbal, taxonomic and functional, real and symbolic; it constantly provokes new patterns. The richer the content of experience, the greater the possibility of innovation. The creative construction starts with the activation of readily available knowledge, the elements of which trigger related material in the memory and the subconscious. The movement is derived from active associations that continue to connect the units, and is oriented toward specific goals, leading to eventual syntheses, which may be expressed in either action or discourse. Here we face an unfurling, which coincides with interpretation, the unlocking of the new meaning built from the past upon the first mean~<br>

Article Title: Speech Acts and Written Texts: A Reading of a Seventeenth-Century Ottoman Historiographic Episode<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303098<br>
Date: 7 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): White Gabriel<br>
Abstract: The article draws on a doctoral dissertation which suggests a different approach to Ottoman historical texts. Its chief argument is that contrary to current scholarly assumptions, the seventeenth-century Tarih-i Al-i Osman works are not unstructured mines of information useful only for the reconstruction of extrinsic referents. Informed by the so-called linguistic or literary turn in some quarters of historical scholarship, the dissertation approaches the historical texts as a historiographic corpus that constitutes a narrative discourse containing a variety of interpretations, judgments, and meanings conveyed by various forms of language. The article itself is a reading of a historiographic story, the Haile-i Osmaniye (Ottoman tragedy), in the light of a twofold scholarly debate over (1) the author's intentions, and (2) the speech/writing polarity. The story covers the deposition and assassination of Osman II as well as the subsequent second reign of Mustafa I (May 1622-September 1623). After identifying the central historical account of the event, from which the entire historiographic story evolves, I propose a double reading of it: (1) the central text is interpreted as an oral address (i.e., a speech situation) delivered to and intended for a specific audience; (2) the central text is analyzed in terms of its use by seventeenth-century historians who integrated it into their histories and for whom this text represented a written artifact rather than a speech situation.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishing<br>

Date: 4 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Wait Eldon C.<br>
Abstract: Perhaps the greatest challenge to an existential phenomenological account of perception is that posed by the argument from illusions. Recent developments in research on the behaviour of subjects suffering from illusions together with some seminal ideas found in Merleau-Ponty's writings enable us to develop and corroborate an account of the phenomenon of illusions, one, which unlike the empiricist account, does not undermine our conviction that in perception we "reach the things themselves". The traditional argument from illusions derives its force from an uncritical assumption that the process of experience takes place in time conceived as an infinite series of distinct moments. Once this assumption has been bracketed we are able to recognise the paradoxical truth that in the disillusion something can become that which it has always been and can cease to be that which it has never been. Furthermore, through a reflection on our experience of others overcoming their illusions, and on psychological evidence, we are able to show that there is nothing to suggest that this description of the disillusion is a description of a private or subjective event.<br>

Article Title: A Principle of Text Coherence in Indonesian Languages<br>
Publisher: The Association for Asian Studies, Inc.<br>
Issue: i309685<br>
Date: 8 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Wurm Richard<br>
Abstract: The logic of Indonesian subjectless and tenseless expressions appears to have cultural implications, just as the use of tenses in English scientific writing entails much more than grammatical minutiae. A. L. Becker has pointed out that tense in English functions in a "coherence system" that pervades and transcends grammar. A parallel coherence system is suggested for Indonesian, based not on tense but on topic. Paul Ricoeur's distinction between LANGUAGE and DISCOURSE is the basis of the claim that Indonesian sentences cohere on the bond between grammatical subject and discourse topic. Examples are drawn from a number of contexts that call forth passive sentences in Indonesian. The article concludes on another suggestion by Becker. The Indonesian topic may be part of a larger deictic category of person, which may be related in discourse to orientation in space--both physical and social--of participants in the speech event. If this suggestion is correct, then the contrast between English and Indonesian coherence systems may be found in the opposition tense/time vs. person/space.<br>

Publisher: The Association for Asian Studies, Inc.<br>
Issue: i309685<br>
Date: 8 1, 1960<br>
Author(s): Van Gennep Susan<br>
Abstract: In Sumatra's Angkola Batak culture, rituals celebrating major kinship-related events such as marriage have many layers of social and symbolic meaning; they have political, kinship, musical, mythic, and philosophical dimensions as lengthy, oratory-filled ceremonies that unite wife-giving lineages with wife-receivers. This article examines several ways that the interpretive approach that is discussed in the introduction can help students of Indonesian ritual grasp diverse aspects of Batak marriage rituals such as their hidden symbolic organization and their practical political implications. The article deals with a short sequence of adat dance staged for anthropological research purposes. (Adat, once translated as customary law, roughly means Angkola ceremonial life, kinship norms, and political thought; adat is eminently flexible, redefined by each Batak generation.) The choreography of the dance (wife-receivers dancing with wife-givers), songs, clothing, the political biographies of the participants, and the fact that the event was staged render the ceremony open to both structural and social contextual inquiry.<br>

Abstract: El presente trabajo se centra en el acontecimiento traumático de la guerra, la posibilidad del sujeto de realizar una experiencia y sostenerse en cuanto tal, pese a la anulación que recae sobre él. El análisis se lleva a cabo en dos poemarios del poeta chileno Tomás Harris: "Encuentros al fin de la batalla" (de Encuentros con hombres oscuros) y "Balada del soldado de Oklahoma" (de Tridente). Ambos poemarios entran en diálogo y choque, puesto que uno aborda la Segunda Guerra Mundial y el segundo la guerra mediática del Golfo. La poesía pone a prueba sus propias posibilidades y nos muestra un sujeto que oscila entre el duelo y la melancolía y que se niega a ser reducido a un mero espectador pasivo. This article aims at exploring the possibility of surviving and realizing an experience from the traumatic event of war. The analysis is focused on two works by the Chilean poet Tomás Harris: "Encuentros al fin de la batalla" of Encuentros con hombres oscuros and "Balada del soldado de Oklahoma" of Tridente. Both poems are related to the issue of war trauma: in the first work, it approaches World War II and the second, the mediatic Gulf War. Thus, the poetry of Harris questions its own limits by means of a subject who oscillates between mourning and melancholy, and rejects to be reduced to a mere passive spectator.<br>

Abstract: At its most a typical sports narrative records what happens in space and time. Alongside this traditional history of events there has emerged a research approach that might be called structural sports history. Its methods move in the world under the surface of facts, explored by researchers in ways that resemble archaeology. The aim is to uncover the changed human relationships and new forms of presence in sport-figurations of corporeality, space and time. Where the event-history approach recounts and recapitulates, the new approach works towards interpretation and understanding. These two are joined by yet a third element, the most intimate aspect of sports narratives: microhistory and the routes that it opens to the interfaces between the public and the private and the general and the particular, where the reader-oriented focus of the experiencing and narrating subject is necessarily foregrounded and at this point surface such elements of narrativity as the "confessional", the "meditative" and the "fragmentary" (auto)biography. The article describes different levels of a sports narrative and their conventions in qualitative sports research.<br>

Abstract: Some literary theorists have suggested that the process of reading is a complex one and is central to the interpretation of texts. These theorists do not ignore the creation of texts or the authors' creative activities, but place special emphasis on the role of the reader. This approach has relevance for the study of the use of libraries. This paper offers an analogy between text and library and between reader and library user. The analogy is possible because both reader and user adopt intentional stances with regard to that which is to be interpreted and employ cognitive and affective means in interpretation. At the heart of this approach is a phenomenological-hermeneutical way of thinking that treats reading and library use as an event consisting of varying intention and interpretive possibilities.<br>

Abstract: The Clash's London Calling was released just at the moment when the British punk movement seemed to be imploding. From the earliest reviews, it was received as a musical masterpiece that drew on many styles while still managing to be `punk' in some sense. This article argues that London Calling normalized punk, allowing it to be more than an event: punk could henceforth be assimilated into traditional musical discourse and aesthetics. As a careful balancing act between punk street-cred and mainstream musical values, London Calling allowed a double reading. Punk fans could find in it what they sought: anti-establishment anger and at times a messy, disdainful approach to conventional musicianship. At the same time critics and listeners who had come since the late sixties to assimilate rock into a Romantic (or post-Romantic) system of `art' values could find in it what they sought: stylistic growth, organic coherence, originality, and even a `universal' narrative of struggle, triumph, and redemption played out across the album. It is possible to isolate not only a story, but musical connections between the songs (keys, recurrent motifs, and topoi) all laid out in a logical manner. However, unlike concept albums in the seventies' progressive rock style against which punk reacted, London Calling often calls attention away from its musical coherence, and even its textual coherence, rather than towards it—such as by the last-minute addition of a bonus track that disrupts the narrative and key schemes established earlier. The ease with which the album can be praised in established musical language should not completely obscure its potential (and the general potential of punk) to undercut and confront conventional musical discourse.<br>

Abstract: Jonathan Z. Smith's essay "Map Is Not Territory" was a watershed event in the academic study of religion, but, this author contends, for reasons yet to be adequately addressed by the discipline. Indeed, as argued in this essay, Smith's "Map" is best understood as a Romantic manifesto performed in a register indebted to Wordsworth and Wallace Stevens (following such precursors as Kant, Coleridge, and Ralph Waldo Emerson) as opposed to the Romantic register of Mircea Eliade (which was much indebted to the late German Romanticism of Hegel). Consequently, to practice the academic study of religion in a manner consistent with Smith's intervention involves a specifically Romantic mode of literary engagement with the textual remains by which one traces the careers of myth, ritual, and experiences of transformation among individuals and groups.<br>

Abstract: The aim is to show how formations of discourse can be seen as the subject matter for the historian of religions, drawing on structuralist and hermeneutic approaches. Although these may differ on important theoretical and methodological issues, I find the way in which they correspond, namely by pointing to the topic of discourse as their field of investigation, even more important. In this article a discourse is understood as a framework of communication, and the focus is laid upon religious discourse as a special kind of authorization. In ancient Greece, for example, "authors" such as Homer and Orpheus were the authorities of two different discursive traditions. The analysis of discourse can present us with a view of how certain frames of communication were interacting by means of contest, and how, eventually, it was the very strategy of authorization that was contested. Hence, what has often been seen as a paradigmatic shift from mythos to logos could more fruitfully be viewed from a discursive angle than from a perspective of different mentalities. Discourse analysis, as presented in this article, is a way of coming to terms with the process of transformation by regarding dynamic properties of communication, that is, as interrelated strategies on connected levels of system and event.<br>

Abstract: Parmi les historiens français les plus importants du XXe siècle, Alphonse Dupront (1905-1990) est sans aucun doute l'un des plus singuliers. Alors que l'historiographie française a fermement rejeté — sous l'influence des conceptions méthodologiques de Lucien Febvre et de Marc Bloch — les principes théoriques défendus par les historiens positivistes, Dupront, inspiré principalement par Charles Péguy (1873-1914) et le philosophe Henri Bergson (1859-1941), a essayé, dans Le mythe de croisade, de réhabiliter l'événement en élaborant une forme d'écriture historique antipositiviste, mais sans rapports, ou sinon indirects, avec les choix épistémologiques opérés par l'École des Annales. Among the most important French historians of the 20th Century, Alphonse Dupront (1905-1990) is, without any doubt, one of the most singular. While the French historiography strongly rejected — under the influence of Lucien Febvre's and Marc Bloch's methodological assumptions — the theoretical principles defended by the positivistic historians, Dupront, mostly influenced by Charles Péguy (1873-1914) and the philosopher Henri Bergson (1859-1941), tried to rehabilitate in his Mythe de croisade the event in a form of historical writing which wasn't positivistic but took also a different way from the Annales School.<br>

Abstract: En Palestine, chaque année au mois d'avril, a lieu le pèlerinage musulman de Moïse (mawsim al-Nabî Mûsâ). Située dans le désert, entre Jérusalem et Jéricho, la tombe du prophète rassemble autour d'elle des pèlerins venus de l'ensemble de la Cisjordanie. Ce lieu de mémoire collective fixe et rappelle un événement lointain rapporté par la tradition musulmane : la mort de Moïse. Dans le même temps, il suscite des questionnements en chaîne : le législateur des Hébreux est-il mort dans ce lieu? Ou, comme le stipule la Bible, dans un endroit inconnu des hommes? Estil d'ailleurs vraiment mort? Son corps est-il là? Etc. Ces questions, qui portent sur les circonstances et la réalité de l'événement, reviennent à s'interroger ici et maintenant sur la présence d'un intercesseur efficace entre les hommes et Dieu. Elles sont donc étroitement liées à une problématique plus large, celle de savoir comment construire l'accessibilité et le contact avec un « ailleurs invisible », ce Dieu transcendant et lointain que l'islam propose à l'instar du judaïsme et du christianisme. Dans cet article je propose d'explorer l'indécision qui est le corollaire de cette longue série de questionnements ne trouvant aucune réponse définitive. In Palestine every year in the month of April, the Muslim pilgrimage of Moses (mawsim al-Nabî Mûsâ) takes place. Located in the desert between Jerusalem and Jericho, the grave of the Prophet gathers pilgrims from the entire West Bank. This place of collective memory fixes and recalls a distant event reported by Muslim tradition: the death of Moses. At the same time, it raises questions: did the Hebrew legislator die there? Or, as stated in the Bible, in a place unknown to men? Is he really dead? Is his body there? Etc. These questions, which relate to the circumstances and the reality of the event amounts to question here and now the presence of an effective intercessor between man and God. They are closely related to a larger issue, that of how to build accessibi~<br>

Abstract: In this article, Levinas' ethical metaphysics is analyzed and his contribution to present-day philosophy is described. In his philosophy, ethics is not something that originates in the autonomous will, as Kant would have premised. It is, rather, the result of the traumatic rupturing of the I by the Other, a heteronomous event. The I's passivity in being opened by the Other is highlighted by Levinas in the words "substitution," "obsession," and "being elected." The I, in the critical Others' eyes, is guilty. The infinity in the Other's demand, regarding the I, is divine. It would be a fatal misunderstanding of Levinas to think that, with the insertion of the word "God," he becomes a theologian. In this article the relation between ethics and politics is discussed and their relation to God is pointed to. In this way, Levinas' discourse on God is demonstrated as being fitting for our time, after the crisis of humanism during the Holocaust. In the course of the article, the question of whether there "is" a God in the eyes of Levinas, and if man "needs" Him is answered. In other words, the logical status of the word "God" in Levinas' philosophy is defined.<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to examine the development of the notion of "The Other" and to trace the implications of its effect on the dialoguic Philosophy. In "I and Thou" this category was not developed, at best it was suggested only vaguely, for in this text Buber does not carry out any ontological explication of this category. But such an explication was necessary and was later formulated gradualy by Buber. The clearer the ontological explication, the sharper the category of "the Other" is delineated. It is this category which establishes the I-Thou relationship. This development is expressed in Buber's writings with great tension, and we analyze it in detail, for the category of "the Other" and the central position which it occupies undermine the significance of the I-Thou relationship as it is presented in the book "I and Thou". Together with an acceptance of the primacy of "the Other" in this relationship, we must also assert the primacy of the "I" as the subject of reflective action, of the recognition of the other in his otherness. In this situation it is not the relationship which comes first but the detachment and the aloneness which exist between the I and Thou. We now have to rewise the notion of the dialogue from that purety of an event without content to that of an action of mutual assertion between I and the Other, where each one asserts the other in his otherness, where at the same time each is conscious of being asserted by the Other.<br>

Abstract: L'apport de l'œuvre de Paul Ricœur est fondamental pour la pratique historienne d'aujourd'hui. Depuis la fin du XIXe siècle, les historiens s'étaient dotés, en se professionnalisant, d'une méthode. Grâce à Paul Ricœur, ils peuvent désormais accéder à une dimension épistémologqiue et mieux comprendre les catégories qui leur sont familières comme celle de temps, de vérité, de causalité ou de sujet. Cet article entend montrer en quoi notamment trois thématiques classiques de l'historien que sont l'événement, la mémoire et la biographie trouvent un éclairage particulièrement enrichissant chez Paul Ricœur et s'en trouvent très sensiblement renouvelées. Paul Ricœur's work has made a fundamental contribution to the contemporary practice of history. Since the end of the 19th century historians had become more professional and had defined an historical method. Thanks to Paul Ricœur, they are now able to achieve an epistemological dimension and to understand better familiar categories such as time, truth, causality or subject. This article seeks to show how three classic historical themes in particular, namely event, memory and biography, are illuminated in a singularly enriching fashion in the work of Paul Ricœur and are very perceptibly renewed by him. Auch für die heutige Geschichtswissenschaft erweist sich Paul Ricœurs philosophisches Œuvre als grundlegend. Im Zuge ihres Professionalisierungsprozesses hatte die historische Zunft gegen Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts nach einer einheitlichen Methode gestrebt. Über das Werk Paul Ricœurs findet sie nun Zugang zur wissenschaftstheoretischen Dimension. Ziel des Aufsatzes ist es, aufzuzeigen, wie drei für den Historiker entscheidende Fragen – nämlich die des Ereignisses, des Gedächtnisses und der Biographie – bei Ricœur einer neuen Behandlung unterzogen wurden.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo está orientado a precisar las relaciones entre experiencia corporal de las mujeres y testimonio. Un largo hábito de subalternidad ha expropiado a las mujeres de la posibilidad de tomar la palabra sobre sus experiencias corporales. Es por ello la importancia que tiene la singularidad de sus testimonios, que implica tomar la palabra en una situación de imposibilidad del lenguaje; es siempre el relato de un acontecimiento traumático del que se habla, pero del que también podría no hablarse. El sujeto/a que toma la palabra da cuenta de un conocimiento que - si bien es precario - constituye un saber del que antes no se tenía registro. Es que el testimonio pone en juego la relación entre la lengua y el archivo. Exige una subjetividad que atestigüe sobre la posibilidad misma de hablar, un/a sujeto capaz de pronunciar lo "inaudito", produciendo con su palabra una intervención ética. La autoridad del testimonio depende de una relación inmemorial entre lo indecible y lo decible, produce una palabra que nombra una experiencia singular. Las palabras de las mujeres que relatan experiencias corporales nombran una dimensión fundamental de nuestra experiencia, la de la diferencia sexual produciendo un dislocamiento en la presunta neutralidad de la lengua. Se trata de una reflexión que abre la posibilidad de poner palabras a lo innombrable. The aim of this article is to specify the relationships between corporal experiences of women and testimony. A long habit of subordination has expropriated the women of the possibility of speaking of their bodily experiences. Thus, the importance of the singularity of their testimonies, which implies beginning to speak in a situation of impossibility of the language. This is always the account of a traumatic event, but which could also not be spoken about. The individual who speaks shows an awareness that, even though insufficient, constitutes a knowledge that has not been registered before. The testimony brings into play the link b~<br>

Abstract: Concerning the modern discussion about the relation between event and narration and "Time and Narration" (Paul Ricœur) the author asks about the relation between entanglement and narration in Wilhelm Schapps philosophy of stories. The philosophy of stories does not approve a systematisation of the topic but does allow its discussion under various aspects. Among those, the author chooses the existence of narrations in the stories of the entangled, the silent speaking, the entanglement in a positive world and the relation between the story of one's life and poetry. The essay also is a contribution to basic questions of narrative ethics.<br>

Issue: i24595727<br>

Author(s): Burroughs Charles<br>
Abstract: Through the analysis of a major religious painting by Botticelli, this article builds on important recent work on Botticelli's sacred art to explore apparent responses on the part of an especially sophisticated artist to the gathering atmosphere of crisis in the city's political and religious life. The artist uses various devices of connection or separation between the viewer/worshiper and the holy image; these devices are not unique to the painting, but their combination is exceptional. First, Botticelli uses a hieratic gold ground to distinguish a scene set in heaven, the coronation of the Virgin, from a more earthly zone; here recent scruples about the representation of transcendence seem to be in play. Second, the figures beneath, four major saints, embody different ways of addressing the viewer and mediating between him/her and the heavenly event. Third, the latter appears to be treated as an apsidal image within an implied architectural setting, in other words, as a representation of a representation. By establishing modes of mediation, then, Botticelli confronts issues emerging as central to the representation of the sacred, in part on the basis of a critical understanding of Albertian picture theory.<br>

Author(s): Winograd William B.<br>
Abstract: This article draws on the philosophical concept of the hermeneutical circle to explore the cultural viewpoints that underlie the meanings expressed by consumers. Phenomenological interviews were conducted with adult female consumers. The interviews are interpreted first by the identification of an exemplary image or event that we describe as a symbolic metaphor. We show that these symbolic metaphors highlight key personal meanings that each participant ascribed to her consumer experiences. We then use a hermeneutic logic known as intertextual analysis to show that these personal meanings reflect more general cultural viewpoints that are implicitly conveyed in language. These intertextual interpretations offer insights into the sociocultural meanings that underlie skeptical, nostalgic, and pragmatic consumer orientations. A concluding discussion is given to key implications and areas for future research that follow from this hermeneutic approach.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>

Author(s): Louden Bruce<br>
Abstract: Some sixty times in the Iliad and Odyssey, the narrator describes a sequence of events with the climactic phrase, "And now X would have happened, had not Y intervened." Though some recent studies have begun to focus on this narrative technique, a fuller accounting of its properties remains desirable, as many of the passages where it is employed are quite significant to the overall construction of the plots. I have termed the phenomenon pivotal contrafactuals. The present study argues that the composer achieves three general narrative benefits by employing this device. First, it is a method for emphatically changing the direction of the plot (hence the adjective "pivotal"). Second, it allows the narrator to confer added emphases of various kinds upon the events he describes. Third, the narrator often uses the construction to make an editorial comment upon the character on whose behalf the intervention occurs. Intriguingly, Homer appears to link some pivotal contrafactuals together through various means. Some occur as equivalent elements in different multiforms of a common type scene. Some occur in different narratives describing the same event. These latter raise the possibility that divine intervention of which he is unaware occurs in Odysseus's narrative of his wanderings. Finally, I suggest that a passage at the beginning of the Catalogue of Ships, which has attracted various interpretations, is a modified pivotal contrafactual.<br>

Article Title: The New Annalistic: A Sketch of a Theory of History<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342990<br>
Date: 10 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Nipperdey Lucian<br>
Abstract: This article argues for the establishment of a new, "annalistic" model of history and historical investigation. This implies a new concept of historical event: instead of being seen as an element within a historical narrative, the historical event is defined as the common reference point of many narratives that can be told about it. The annalistic model also implies a new concept of historical change: instead of being defined as the change of an "object" within a set of given historical parameters, historical change has to be perceived as the change of parameters related to a given historical object. A new concept of history follows from the annalistic model: instead of history being a metaphysical unity of space and time (the destiny of mankind, the positivist's world of facts), in which everything is linked to everything, it is instead the product of historical judgment carried out by those who design stories about their own past, present, and future. To the "annalist" a world is imaginable in which no history has existed, exists, or will exist. The article analyzes three aspects of the concept of historical time: it demonstrates the huge variety of temporal structures in history; it argues for the foundation of the representation of historical time in linguistic concepts; and it discusses the relationship of fictionality and reality in historical discourse. Finally, the annalistic model is compared to the traditional concept of history established by historicism in the nineteenth century.<br>

Abstract: La réflexion offerte dans cet essai s'inscrit dans une entreprise d'approfondissement de la compréhension générale que nous avons de l'activité politique (parler, écrire, revendiquer, mettre en scène), et particulièrement de la relation que cette activité entretient avec l'idée de l'émancipation. Plus précisément, il s'agit de prendre pour objet d'exploration théorique le fait de parole, défini en termes d'articulation performative des espaces-temps humains, et d'en faire le paradigme de toute action politique. L'analyse de ce paradigme, au terme, permettra de pointer vers une matière utopique qui se qualifie à la fois comme événement et comme permanence du commun. /// In this article, the author seeks a better understanding of the modalities of political action (speaking, writing, claming, staging), and more specifically of the relation between political action and the idea of emancipation. To do so, the author proposes that the speech act, comprehended as the performed articulation of lived space/time, is to be taken as the paradigm of political action. Further analysis of this paradigm, as developed in the article, compels the manifestation of a philosophical object which qualifies both as event and as the manifestation of the perennially of the common.<br>

Abstract: The trial of Adolf Eichmann, in 1961, is generally considered a turning point in the history of Holocaust memory because it brought the Holocaust into the public sphere for the first time as a discrete event on an international scale. In the same year, Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin's film Chronicle of a Summer appeared in France. While absent from scholarship on memory of the Nazi genocide for over forty years, Chronicle of a Summer contains a scene of Holocaust testimony that suggests the need to look beyond the Eichmann trial for alternative articulations of public Holocaust remembrance. This essay considers the juxtaposition in Chronicle of a Summer of Holocaust memory and the history of decolonization in order to rethink the "unique" place that the Holocaust has come to hold in discourses on extreme violence. The essay argues that a discourse of truth and testimony arose in French resistance to the Algerian war that shaped and was shaped by memory of the Nazi genocide.<br>

Article Title: Photography after the Photograph: Event, Archive, and the Non-Symbolic<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i25650854<br>
Date: 1 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Roberts John<br>
Abstract: This article looks at the continuing social crisis of documentary image culture, in the light of both the political demise of a left-bloc of social forces, which historically has underwritten its critical ideals from the 1920s to the late 1980s, and the continued expansion of the 'non-symbolic' forces (Vilém Flusser) of mass culture — the de-politicization of the public sphere through the circulation of a range of narrow and circumscribed (generic) images. In this I take seriously the notion that documentary photography is subject to an increasing 'lateness' in its effects (that is, in terms of its effective representation of the social world and of access to distribution). However, this sense of documentary photography as existing after-the-event does not mean we should mourn the loss or photography's active relationship to the 'event'. This is because the documentary ideal of the 1920s and 1930s had no privileged access to 'photographic truth', just as it was in no greater position of autonomy within the political economy of photography than it is now. Rather, what distinguished documentary photography during its modernist heyday was a partisan political confidence in its ideals and aims. It is this that is missing today. Thus, once we look at the history of documentary practice as a set of subordinate practices culturally, we can than avoid all the historicist pitfalls of assuming this is the 'worst of all times' and begin to rethink the political and theoretical parameters of documentary practice. As such, this article addresses why, in this present period, we need an adequate politics of 'lateness'.<br>

Abstract: The memorialisation of the Partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947 through popular cinema is the theme of this paper. Both in India and Pakistan, cinema as a cultural production wields immense influence in the lives of the people and mainstream cinema has been deeply affected by Partition. By offering the potential for public mourning in a public space such as a theatre, cinema confronts the trauma of that cataclysmic event and Partition cinema in particular invests heavily in the private sphere of emotions and familial relations while also demonstrating that the private domain is already political.<br>

Abstract: Le mot « traduction » est à l'honneur: le philosophe Paul Ricœur l'érige en principe éthique, la « traductologie » se pose en nouvelle discipline littéraire et un courant de la sociologie des sciences le prend pour paradigme. Au-delà de ce dernier usage analogique, n'y a-t-il pas place pour une sociologie de la traduction qui ne soit pas seulement une sociographie des traducteurs amateurs ou professionnels, ni même une annexe fonctionnelle de la théorie des champs culturels et de leurs échanges inégaux? L'événement éditorial que constitue une nouvelle traduction littéraire de la Bible offre ainsi au sociologue matière à associer ses dimensions linguistiques, institutionnelles et relationnelles pour déterminer une « configuration traductive » exemplaire de la rencontre équivoque entre mondes littéraires, médiatiques et religieux en contexte de modernité avancée. The word « translation » has pride of place at the present time: the philosopher Paul Ricœur sets it up as an ethical principle, « translation studies » become a new international subject and the sociology of sciences takes it up as paradigm. Beyond this last figurative use, the question is how can we draw up a sociology of translation apart from studies of professional sets and transnational cultural exchanges? The New Bible Translation, a recent literary event in the French-speaking world, gives matter for combining linguistic, institutional and relational points of view. This translation case as a sociological configuration accounts for this ambiguous meeting point — at the crossroads between literature, religion and publishing — in advanced modernity.<br>

Abstract: In 'The Uncanny', Freud does not distinguish between psychotic pathologies and
narcissistic ones, seeming to regard them as one category. As Olsen and Koppe explain,
Freud 'found that most of the traits [of psychoses], that is, self-centeredness, lack of
libidinous object cathexis, the loss of the sense of reality, and domination of primary pro-
cesses, were related to their narcissistic mode'. They add that 'what in particular distin-
guishes the neuroses from the psychoses is their reliance on the defense mechanisms of
projection and denial in contrast to repression'. See O. Olsen and S. Koppe, Freud's
Theory of Psychoanalysis, trans. J.C. Delay and C. Pedersen (New York, 1988),
pp. 244-5. However, Freud's classification of psychic illnesses changed with the intro-
duction of the super-ego. In 'Neurosis and Psychosis' (1923), Freud argues that 'Trans-
ference neuroses correspond to a conflict between the ego and the id; narcissistic neuro-
ses [such as melancholia], to a conflict between the ego and the super-ego; and psycho-
ses, to one between the ego and the external world' (XIX, p. 152). This distinction is
problematic, since Freud claims that part of the demands of the external world is repre-
sented by the super-ego. In any event, in my discussion below I will continue to refer to
projection as a psychotic defence with narcissistic motivations.<br>

Abstract: This article seeks to integrate the roles of structure and human agency in a theory of historical causation, using the fall of the Weimar Republic and in particular Henry Turner's book Hitler's Thirty Days to Power as a case study. Drawing on analogies from chaos theory, it argues that crisis situations in history exhibit sensitive dependence on local conditions, which are always changing. This undermines the distinction between causes and conditions (including counterfactual conditions). It urges instead a distinction between empowering and constraining causes of specific human actions as a more fruitful model. The paper also discusses more briefly two other analogies to chaos theory: 1) similarity across differences in scale as applicable to different levels of individual (psychological) and collective events, which are seen as homologous; 2) a model of branching as applicable to the totality of causes of a given event.<br>

Abstract: Recent developments in historical sociology emphasize the centrality of temporality to analysis and explanation. Narrative uses temporal order to organize information about events and to foster their understanding but is insufficiently systematic to substitute for sociological explanation. This article illustrates a new interpretative heuristic for the computer- assisted analysis of qualitative narrative sequences, "event-structure analysis,"that infuses narrative with greater rigor and explicitness. Through the analysis of a lynching that took place in Mississippi in 1930, this article shows how event-structure analysis can be used to build replicable and generalizable causal interpretations of events.<br>

Abstract: Partant de l'analyse de la situation mémorielle actuelle, cet article diagnostique la question qu'elle fait naître pour la mémoire relative à l'esclavage dans les Antilles françaises, prise dans une frénésie qui renforce l'idée de mémoires soudainement inventées. Des mémoires de l'esclavage de l'ordre de la circulation intergénérationnelle sont-elles présentes? Cette question renvoie au débat anthropologique propre à ces sociétés où la mémoire collective relative à l'esclavage a longtemps été tenue pour être absente. À partir d'une recherche conduite sur un événement ancien qui reconduit le cadre du conflit originel entre maîtres et esclaves, à savoir l'insurrection de 1870 à la Martinique, l'article décrit les processus mémoriels qu'il a générés. Le recueil de témoignages auprès des descendants des insurgés rend compte de la présence de récits familiaux transmis jusqu'à aujourd'hui selon des modalités particulières liées aux conséquences de la répression de l'événement insurrectionnel. L'interprétation qui s'en dégage amène à revoir la question de la mémoire collective à la Martinique. Taking the analysis of the current memory situation as a starting point, this article analyses the question that it provokes about the memory of slavery in the French West Indies, subjected to a frenzy that reinforced the notion of spontaneously invented memories. Is there an inter-generational dissemination of slavery memory? This question refers to the anthropological debate in societies where collective memory about slavery has long been deemed absent. Using research carried out on an historical event that revives the framework of the original master/slave conflict, namely the 1870 insurrection in Martinique, we describe the memory processes this generated. The collection of accounts from descendentes of the rebels shows that family accounts have been transmitted until this day, using specific forms related to the consequences of the repression of the rebellion.

Abstract: From Aristotle to Roman Jakobson and beyond, metaphor's status as the pre-eminent literary trope has been accepted largely without question. If the characteristic force of metaphor lies in the way it widens the gap between language and event, it is possible that metaphor's 'rule' may be weakened when language and event collide. The article argues that it is in the light of such collisions, dislocations, and displacements rather than in the more measured figurings of the symbolic, that the work of the Vietnam novelist Tim O'Brien can best be read.<br>

Abstract: In Time, Narrative, and History, David Carr argues against the narrativist claim that our lived experience does not possess the formal attributes of a story; this conclusion can be reinforced from a semiotic perspective. Our experience is mediated through temporal signs that are used again in the construction of stories. Since signs are social entities from the start, this approach avoids a problem of individualism specific to phenomenology, one which Carr takes care to resolve. A semiotic framework is also explicit about a theme Carr handles implicitly: the status of representation. Representation is internal to signification, mediating our experience not just retrospectively but prospectively in the planning and execution of action. A model is presented in which the temporal organization of experience and action is formally coordinated with the temporal organization of narrative. The model is then applied to a historical event: John Batman's attempt in 1835 to purchase land from some Aboriginal tribes around what is now Melbourne. The meaning of this event is not located only in historical writing about it but in the semiotic constitution of the event itself. Changes of meaning emerge from relations between events as new events-in this case the Australian High Court's Mabo decision-align with old ones. Finally, a number of contrasts are indicated between this model and proposals made by Arthur C. Danto, Hayden White, F. R. Ankersmit, Fernand Braudel, and Paul Ricoeur.<br>

Abstract: A distinction is drawn between theatricality and dramaturgy as modes for interpreting social and religious life. By means of theatricality scholars tend to analyze life as "theater," as "playacting" or "role-playing." Theater is viewed as a metaphor for what "actually" occurs in life. By contrast, dramaturgists interpret life as essentially dramatic in its interpersonal and collective aspects, whether the drama is significant or trivial, good or poor, "genuine" or "theatrical." But there are certain elements and conditions which must be present in order to increase the possibility of the deeper levels of drama. Religious, social and moral life do not routinely achieve these levels, but when it happens the participants and persons in the active audience can recognize the moment as extraordinary, perhaps as an event of awesome significance. It is within these moments that new religious and moral paradigms may arise. At such time role-playing and theatricality are eclipsed but do not totally disappear.<br>

Abstract: N'y aurait-il que les philosophes à s'interroger sur le temps? Les historiens resteraient-ils positivistes au point de bouder toute réflexion sur cette catégorie qui gît pourtant au cœur de leur discipline? "L'ordre du temps," de K. Pomian, qui vient de paraître chez Gallimard, montre combien le temps des historiens a varié et à quels dangers ils s'exposent en n'y prenant pas garde. /// Should time be a philosophical question? In general, French historians seem to have neglected this essential problem concerning reflection on time. Both because of a positivist tradition which seeks the linearity of the event and of a mistrust of the philosophy of history, they have not wanted to come to grips with the question of temporality. And yet the very nature of history comes from this question. K. Pomian's recent book, "L'ordre du temps" (Gallimard) illustrates the richness of the philosophic thinking on the variation of the notion of time and its importance in understanding the various historical schools.<br>

Abstract: En quoi le western, ce genre cinématographique si typiquement américain, peut-il aider les historiens à réfléchir sur leurs propres méthodes? En comparant les œuvres de John Ford et de Michael Cimino, Christian Delage nous invite à revenir sur la question des temporalités et des représentations de la durée. /// The filmmaker reconstructs the past rather than reconstituting it, and thus meets the historian. The analysis of two major works by John Ford and Michael Cimino shows how the cinema historicizes a past event through the indirect agency of the narrative. In the fiction presented to the audience, the filmmaker, like the historian, faces representations inscribed in general history, while simultaneously modifying its meaning. American cinema carries on an almost ontological relation with duration and time; the question of its truthfulness presents the same methodological challenge as that driving contemporary historical research.<br>

Author(s): Conan Jean-Jacques<br>
Abstract: Faut-il vraiment doubler désormais chaque haut lieu de mémoire par un "équipement d'interprétation" et d'accueil où s'opèrerait un "rattrapage de la mémoire par l'histoire"? La question hante sans aucun doute les collectivités locales, soucieuses aussi bien de "devoir de mémoire" que de rentabilité touristique. Elle est toujours actuelle, par exemple à Colombey à propos du général de Gaulle. Elle a été posée avec une intensité particulière à Oradour de 1993 à 1999. En voici la version personnelle d'un chef de projet qui là-bas tenta de gérer l'impossible, avant d'être remercié. En 1993, le conseil général de la Haute-Vienne a décidé la construction d'un équipement culturel d'accueil et d'information destiné à recevoir les visiteurs des ruines du village d'Oradour-sur-Glane martyrisé par la division SS "Das Reich" en juin 1944. Ce "Centre de la mémoire" fut inauguré en 1999 par le président de la République. L'auteur, ancien chef du projet, décrit les difficultés de sa mise en œuvre, car la communauté d'Oradour, détentrice de la mémoire des victimes, s'opposa souvent aux initiatives publiques et, plus largement, à toute vision critique de l'événement dont une meilleure connaissance aurait pu, pourtant, hâter le travail du deuil. /// In 1993, the general council of the Haute-Vienne decided to build a welcome and information cultural center for the visitors to the ruins of Oradour-sur-Glane, martyr zed by the SS division "Das Reich" in June 1944.

The author, the former head of the project, describes the difficulties of its implementation, because the community of Oradour, the holder of the victims' memory, often took issue with the public initiatives and any critical vision of the event even though more knowledge of it could have hastened the period of mourning.<br>

Abstract: In this article, I examine the institutional, cultural, and discursive foundations of a historical event. I explicate global, transnational, national, intercultural, ethnic, regional, local, and personal realms of understanding as well as a range of discursive and pragmatic strategies as they came into play in a schoolroom meeting that led to the writing of a letter to the United Nations for help. The case presented is that of a group of people in a small, majority-indigenous village in Kamchatka in the Russian Far East, who, in 1993, after the collapse of the Soviet government and its support network, decided to turn to the United Nations for help.<br>

Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: As Kosky and Avram show, the work of Levinas represents a significant contribution because (1) he takes seriously the challenge posed by the decay of religious traditions and other inherited frameworks of meaning and (2) he insists on the unconditional character of the good. Nonetheless, critical questions about the adequacy of this contribution need to be pressed more forcefully. I suggest that from the point of view of theological ethics his work is problematic in three ways: (1) He can give little guidance concerning what values we ought to seek; (2) in indentifying the good with the event of encountering the completely other, he falsely in- flates moral demands at the same time that he devalues commonalities; and (3) he offers scant grounds for affirming the goodness of being.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000941<br>
Date: 4 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Rees Geoffrey<br>
Abstract: Widely regarded as the most influential proponent of the truth of original sin in the twentieth century, Reinhold Niebuhr worked hard to excise any "literalistic" element from his interpretation of the doctrine. In his attempt to "correct" the Augustinian tradition on original sin by purging it of all "literalistic errors," however, Niebuhr assumed as his starting point the most characteristically modern objection to the doctrine: that birth is a thoroughly natural, animal, and morally meaningless event. As a result, Niebuhr unnecessarily constrained his vision of the dimensions of human freedom, and hence his description of the dynamic of anxiety and freedom that energizes sin. Through a careful reading of Reinhold Niebuhr's writings on original sin, in light of the truth that the end of human life is inseparable from its origins, a reappraisal and recovery of the meaningfulness of the assertion of original sin as a literal inheritance is possible. The result of such a reappraisal and recovery is an amplified insight into the existential anxiety that Niebuhr otherwise described so convincingly.<br>

Publisher: University of Sydney<br>
Issue: i40014217<br>
Date: 6 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Telban Borut<br>
Abstract: By focusing on children involved in the ritual practices in Ambonwari village, East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea, this essay compares two types of ritual: that of healing and that of male initiation. Like other life crisis rituals both deal with two dimensions of the Ambonwari life-world, that is with the living and the dead and, in a broader sense, with people and spirits. Though both are based upon the same cosmology there are fundamental differences between them. First, healers in healing ceremonies treat uninitiated children as 'non-beings'. From the perspective of Ambonwari 'selves' or 'beings', children belong to this domain. They exist as extensions of their parents or carers, from whom they cannot be separated conceptually. Second, by examining the Ambonwari concepts of negation I show that healers do not approach the domain of cosmological non-existence: they are not concerned with the cosmogony of the Ambonwari life-world. The male initiation rituals do just the opposite, however. It is only in the male initiation ritual, seen as a cosmogonic event, that young boys are cut off from their parents and 'thrown' abruptly into a state of becoming. Unlike the healing rites, these rituals treat young boys as both Ambonwari beginnings and Ambonwari beings. I argue that Ambonwari initiation rituals are not concerned with symbolic death followed by rebirth, but with states of being. Initiation means that death becomes possible for a child. The initiated boy will now be able to die as an Ambonwari being.<br>

Abstract: O estudo visa apresentar os supostos teóricos e as tensões essenciais da tematização da ideia de Quinto Império na Defesa Perante o Tribunal do Santo Ofício, do P.e António Vieira. A visão profética de Vieira assume o contraste entre um tempo de inautenticidade na relação teândrica, subsidiário da Queda adâmica e objectivado na sucessão dos quatro impérios (cf. Daniel, 2, 27-45), e a novidade absoluta do acontecimento de Cristo, que se espera vir a manifestar-se na pacificação terrena do processo histórico e na constituição duma comunidade universal segundo o Espírito. A tese, que só um estudo ulterior poderá demonstrar, é a de que a perspectiva do Quinto Império, em Vieira, será, ainda subsidiária das categorias dominantes no tempo dos quatro impérios, em que a experiência escatológica se refracta antropocentricamente pelas finalidades, e relações de poder, político-civilizacionais. /// Cette étude presente les présupposés théoriques et les tensions essentielles de Ia thématisation de Tidée de Cinquième Empire dans Ia Défense Auprès du Tribunal du Saint-Office, du P.

Abstract: Partindo de alguns pressupostos que explicitam a questão nuclear da "instância do sujeito" na obra de Ricoeur (anteriores ou contemporâneos ao debate com o estruturalismo), e que tipificam a via filosófica ricoeuriana, e partindo também da articulação axial do pensamento de Lévi-Strauss (relacionada com esse debate), são depois propostos os tópicos dessa controvérsia. Tais tópicos, que se desenvolvem em torno dos elementos já considerados, gravitam à volta da inteligibilidade do sentido e do sentido da inteligibilidade, da complementaridade dos métodos, e dos níveis semiológico e semântico, este último estabelecido mediante a pregnância da frase na linguagem, e da palavra (mot) como operador entre a estrutura e o acontecimento. /// La présente analyse commence par mettre en relief quelques présupposés qui explicitent la question nucléaire de "l'instance du sajet" dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur (présupposés antérieurs ou contemporains du débat avec le structuralisme) et qui caractérisent le chemin philosophique de celui-ci; on prend également pour point de départ l'articulation centrale de la pensée de Lévi-Strauss relative à ce débat, afin de proposer ensuite les lignes mai-tresses de cette controverse.

Abstract: A partir de la conception de la biographie développée par A. L. Strauss et de la philosophie du temps de G. H. Mead, trois niveaux d'organisation du temps de l'expérience biographique sont mis au jour. D'abord en examinant comment s'articulent l'irréversibilité du temps et le caractère partiellement indéterminé du passé. Toute restitution rétrospective de l'expérience biographique s'inscrit dans ce cadre. Ensuite, ce temps biographique, constitué dans l'après-coup au sein d'interactions avec autrui, se structure principalement autour des événements marquants, lesquels forment le plus souvent un calendrier privé. Mais, avant cela, ces événements ont leur temporalité propre liée à leur parcours sémantique : la constitution du sens de l'événement est ellemême un processus temporel partiellement contingent - la réduction du tranchant de l'événement ne va pas de soi - et la stabilisation d'un sens appropriable par la personne est la condition pour que l'événement qui « a été » ne « soit plus », que Von puisse tourner la page. Out of the conception of biographical time as developed by A. L. Strauss and G. H. Mead's philosophy of time, three levels for organizing the time of biographical experiences come to light. First of all, any retrospective reconstruction of a biographical experience involves examining how time's irreversibility is linked to the partly indeterminate nature of the past. Next, this biographical time, reconstructed afterwards through interactions with others, mainly takes shape around significant events, which usually form a private calendar. Previously however, these events had their own temporality linked to their semantic itinerary : the construction of an event's meaning is itself a partly contingent temporal process — reducing the cutting edge of an event cannot be taken for granted — and the stabilization of a meaning that the person can appropriate is the condition for the event that « was » to be « no longer » , so that one can be able to make af~<br>

Abstract: S'inscrire dans une tendance historiographique nouvelle implique souvent que soit effectué un retour sur des définitions préalables. Tel est le cas pour l'histoire des sensibilités, dans sa double orientation d'anthropologie sensorielle et d'attention prêtée à la réception de l'événement, en termes d'affects, d'émotions et de passions déclenchées et vécues à des échelles diverses.D'autant que cette autre manière d'écrire l'histoire, en accordant un statut réel à des protagonistes oubliés de l'histoire, et plus précisément de l'histoire officielle, n'implique pas une rupture en termes d'histoire sociale et plus particulièrement par rapport aux genres précurseurs qu'ont été l'histoire des mentalités et, plus récemment, l'histoire des représentations. L'exemple latino-américain, et la vitalité de cette nouvelle manière d'écrire l'histoire, en attestent aisément, comme le montre cet essai. Insertarse en una tendencia historiográfica novedosa implica muy a menudo que, al mismo tiempo, se lleve a cabo una reconsideración de las definiciones previas. Tal es el caso para la historia de las sensibilidades, en su doble orientación, que apunta hacia la antropología de los sentidos, o privilegia la « recepción del acontecer histórico » desde el punto de vista de los afectos, de las emociones y pasiones desencadenadas en determinadas oportunidades y experimentadas en diversas escalas. Y más cuando esta nueva manera de escribir la historia, al concederles un estatuto de hecho a protagonistas olvidados de la historia y particularmente de la historia oficial, no trae consigo una ruptura en términos de historia social y más particularmente respecto a los géneros precursores que fueron la historia de las mentalidades y, más recientemente, la historia de las representaciones. El ejemplo latinoamericano, y la vitalidad propia de esta nueva manera de escribir la historia, lo atestiguan sobremanera, como lo pone de relieve este ensayo.

Abstract: Pre-colonial histories in Southeast Asia are generally dependent on a very limited number of written sources. Most information originates from the elites among dominant ethnic groups or Westerners. These centralized histories are frequently uncritically treated as the 'truth.' This is especially true in countries like Laos, where historical documents are rare. But different versions of widely accepted histories also exist, and these often-contested histories remain prominent in the minds of people from different ethnic groups. This paper demonstrates the contested nature of history in Laos and the importance of ethnicity in social memory, using a well-known historical event that occurred in southern Laos— the Ay Sa Rebellion of the early nineteenth century. Lao, Siamese, and Western versions of the history of this rebellion are reviewed, followed by oral histories obtained from ethnic Brao people who maintain memories of the events that transpired. I hope to demonstrate the importance of considering ethnicity in relation to histories, and to encourage others to investigate alternative versions of histories in Laos.<br>

Abstract: The article deals with constructivist versions of biographical research and its specific strengths and weaknesses. By switching its focus from what-and why-questions to how-questions, contructivism has been able to demonstrate how biographical accounts are staged and presented independently from their specific contents. Constructivism emphasises the irreconcilable difference between an event and the presentation of an event, as any account of biographical events is necessarily selective. The article wants to show, however, that making this difference for an absolute would make social research fundamentally impossible. It is in its central interests that biographical research clashes with the blindness for the historical formation of constructions and the leaving aside of their specific contents that are often typical of constructivist studies. Fritz Schuetz's 'Narrative Interview' and Ulrich Oevermann's 'Objective Hermeneutics' are suggested as two concepts of research that allow to reconstruct the selectivity of biographical accounts from the structural problems of acting in a specific biographical situation. Finally, the constructivist turn of the debate is illustrated by biographical accounts of conversion, and an alternative concept is suggested which adopts some constructivist elements but avoids their anti-realist consequences.<br>

Abstract: Différence, référence, communicabilité : trois mots-clés pour dessiner la structure originaire et élémentaire de la signifiance. Or, l'interrogation change de nature quand on la déplace du signifié vers le sens, puis vers la signifiance. Il ne s'agit ni d'une action, ni d'un événement, mais d'un processus. Trois conditions nécessaires : présence d'un matériel signifiant (sonore, graphique, électronique) ; aptitude à se référer à une réalité extérieure ; énonciateurs en relation binaire entre lesquels et pour lesquels les énoncés signifient. L'auteur examine les conséquences de leur considération groupée en philosophie du langage. Difference, reference and communicability are three key-words to outline the original and elementary structure of« signifying ». Now, the nature of philosophical interrogation changes when it shifts from the saussurian « signifié » towards the meaning, a fortiori towards signifying. It is neither an action nor an event but a process. Three conditions are necessary : the presence of specific material (whether acoustic, graphic or electronical) ; an aptitude to refer to an outside reality ; speakers standing in binary relationship. The writer examines the consequences of considering the constraints as gathered in a philosophy of language.<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'interroge sur le statut à la fois épistémologique et ontologique d'un passé qui « a été » et dont les individus comme les sociétés retiennent le souvenir, mais qui, comme le langage ordinaire l'exprime, « n'est plus » . Toute une tradition de réflexion sur la conservation du passé par la mémoire depuis Platon et Aristote a voulu ramener la mémoire à la métaphore de l'empreinte. En revanche, cet article tente de montrer que la mémoire à plusieurs dont dépend la connaissance historique n'est pas simplement assimilable à ce topos traditionnel. Ce qui caractérise la mémoire plurielle et publique qui alimente le travail de l'historien, c'est le statut privilégié du témoignage, la possibilité de confronter différents témoignages les uns aux autres, dont dépend la crédibilité du récit historique. C'est ainsi moins la problématique d'une ressemblance entre récit et événements racontés — problématique de la trace, héritée d'une tendance traditionnelle à identifier la mémoire avec l'empreinte — que la confrontation de témoignages dans leurs différents degrés de fiabilité qui nous fait assister à l'événement raconté. Cette réflexion sur le décalage entre mémoire et histoire ouvre, dans la deuxième partie de cet article, à une analyse approfondie de la temporalité propre au passé qui fait l'objet du souvenir et conduit à une confrontation avec privilège accordé, dans la synthèse des trois modes du temps, chez saint Augustin au présent et, chez Heidegger, au futur. De cette manière, l'article tente de rééquilibrer la synthèse des temps en lui restituant un autre rapport au passé, que l'on ne saurait atteindre à partir d'Augustin ou de Heidegger. Libérer l'histoire du paradigme de la trace, de la métaphore de la mémoire comme empreinte, revient précisément à la restitution de ce mode de temporalisation du passé jusqu'ici esquivé : cet autre rapport au passé vise, conjointement à la mise en évidence du témoignage propre au travail de l'historien, à souligner la dette~<br>

Abstract: En confrontant ses romans et ses livres ultérieurs, souvent constitués de recueils de notes, l'auteur montre que s'élabore chez Julien Gracq une véritable pensée de l'histoire. Il examine tout d'abord le goût de Gracq pour l'histoire et la place de son expérience historique dans son écriture, avant de constater, à la manière de Vincent Descombes avec Marcel Proust, que c'est peut-être dans son écriture romanesque plutôt que dans ses réflexions que se révèle la profondeur d'une réflexion sur l'histoire. À travers l'examen des figures de la temporalité et de son écriture du changement, il tente de mettre en évidence la manière dont les fictions de Gracq mettent en scène l'attente et l'événement, sur le mode paradoxal de la remémoration. Ce qui va arriver est toujours déjà connu: l'écriture est réflexion a posteriori, faisant de l'œuvre le laboratoire dans lequel l'auteur essaie de retrouver l'effet produit par la détermination de l'histoire sur les individus et les sociétés. En mettant en perspective les romans de Gracq par les débats des historiens de son époque sur l'événement, ainsi que par les réflexions sociologiques ou philosophiques sur le temps et sa perception, l'auteur essaie enfin de comprendre comment ses livres peuvent être considérés comme une contribution à la conception de l'histoire et de l'historicité. Novelist Julien Gracq constructed throughout his work an elaborate reflection on History, as confronting his fiction with his later writing shows. This article first examines Gracq's taste for History, and the place of historical experience in his writing. As Vincent Descombes suggested for Proust, it is in his novels, more than his theoretical musings, that Gracq exhibited the depth of his thinking: his use of figures of temporality and his writing of change underpinned, in his fiction, his staging of wait/expectancy, and events, paradoxically presented through recollection. What will happen is always already known: through writing, Gracq attempted to~<br>

Abstract: Entrepris depuis un quart de siècle, le démantèlement de l'industrie lourde lorraine (mines et sidérurgie) touche à sa fin. À partir de la comparaison entre le dernier événement en date, la fermeture spectaculaire de la dernière mine de charbon, et la mise en scène, une décennie plus tôt, de la dernière coulée d'une usine de la Lorraine sidérurgique, l'auteur s'interroge sur les finalités patrimoniales de telles célébrations. Présentant quelques moments du traitement culturel — patrimonial, mémoriel... — de la crise industrielle lorraine, depuis les symptômes photographiques d'une mémoire empêchée jusqu'au musée très « contrôlé » en passant par la monumentalisation controversée de restes industriels, il met l'accent sur la lutte des représentations qui se noue autour de la construction de la « Lorraine industrielle » en objet-frontière patrimonial. Cet article souhaite ainsi contribuer à une anthropologie politique de l'institution de la mémoire. The dismantling of the heavy industry in Lorraine that is under way since a quarter of century (mines and iron and steel industry) is nearing its end. When comparing the latest event — the spectacular closure of the last coalmine — with the staging of the last casting in an iron and steel factory of Lorraine ten years earlier the author questions about the patrimonial aims of such celebrations. He shows some sequences of the cultural treatment (patrimonial, memorial) of the industrial crisis in Lorraine, from the photographic « symptoms » of a hindered memory to the highly « controlled » museum and to the industrial remains turned into historic buildings, a largely controversial fact. In this context he stresses the conflicting representations of « industrial Lorraine » as a patrimonial Boundary Object (abstract or concrete, that several actors can appropriate as they like). This article is meant to contribute to a political anthropology of memory institution. Die Zerschlagung der lothringischen Schwerindustrie (Bergwerken ~<br>

Abstract: Le titre de « Juste parmi les Nations » est décerné depuis 1963 par l'État d'Israël afin d'honorer la mémoire des non-Juifs « qui ont risqué leur vie pour venir en aide à des Juifs » . Le « Juste » reçoit un diplôme et une médaille par un représentant de l'Etat hébreu lors d'une cérémonie publique où les individus « sauvés » et leurs « sauveteurs » , ou leurs descendants, sont réunis. Cet article étudie comment, à travers cette cérémonie, s'effectue un bricolage entre des « mémoires » véhiculées par des institutions et des individus, Juifs et non-Juifs, résidant en France et en Israël. Comment s'explique le recours à une seule et même pratique de rappel public du passé par des individus dont les récits des souvenirs peuvent diverger ? The title of « Righteous among the Nations » has been attributed since 1963 by the State of Israel to honor « the high-minded gentiles who risked their lives to save Jews » . Each nomination goes with the gift of a medal and a diploma to the nominee during an official ceremony. This public event gathers « rescued people » and « rescuers » and members of each family. In this article, the author studies how, through this ceremony, a « patchwork » between different and plural memories can take place. In a common place and time, the different actors crosses institutions, individuals, Jews and non-Jews, living in France or in Israël. How can we explain the use of a single common practice of remembrance by individuals whose social characteristics are different and whose narrations of the past diverge from each other ? Der Titel « Gerechte(r) unter den Nationen » wird seit 1963 vom Staat Israel verliehen, um an Nicht-Juden zu erinnern, « die ihr Leben riskiert haben um Juden zu helfen » .

Abstract: The proposition is that arts marketing should be conceived of as a dedicated field of endeavour so that consumers' immersion in the artistic experience occurs even in the case of a "difficult" art work. The focus is artistic experience-related phenomena. The authors introduce the concept of appropriation and then develop an appropriation cycle construct. Empirical research comprises introspective reports on consumer attendance at classical music concerts. The results show that the artistic experience is predicated on multiple rather than one-time immersion, and that full immersion may never occur. The authors conclude that those service elements that affect the way in which consumers experience an arts event should be managed throughout the appropriation process. Les auteurs proposent de concevoir le marketing des arts comme un domaine d'activité spécifique, afin que l'immersion des consommateurs dans l'expérience artistique soit possible même dans le cas d'une œuvre « difficile » . L'accent est mis sur les phénomènes liés à l'expérience artistique. Ils présentent le concept d'appropriation, puis développent un construit du cycle d'appropriation. Ils ont recours à la recherche empirique, soit les rapports d'analyse introspective des consommateurs ayant assisté à des concerts de musique classique. Les résultats indiquent que l'expérience artistique suppose de multiples immersions, non pas une seule, et que l'immersion totale risque de ne jamais se produire. Les auteurs concluent que les éléments du service qui influent sur l'expérience individuelle d'un événement artistique devraient être gérés tout au long du processus d'appropriation. Los autores proponen la idea de que el márketing de las artes debe concebirse como un emprendimiento en sí mismo, a fin de lograr la inmersión del consumidor en experiencia artística incluso en el caso de obras de arte "difíciles". El acento, entonces, está puesto en los fenómenos que se vinculan con la experiencia artística. Los auto~<br>

Abstract: Windelband, réputé comme chef de l'école néokantienne de Bade, s'oppose comme Bergson au relativisme et au positivisme. Pour lui, comprendre Kant, c'est le dépasser, et ce, dans la direction de Hegel ; lire Bergson, c'est retrouver le sens de l'événement dans une métaphysique de l'irrépétable, qui, en montrant l'insuffisance du criticisme, ouvre la porte aux sciences historiques. Cela est l'interprétation positive de Bergson. Mais la critique est qu'il faut séparer totalement la psychologie de la philosophie, contrairement à la tradition philosophique française, encore observée par Bergson. Mais le volontarisme bergsonien apparaît comme représentatif de l'esprit de la philosophie du tournant du XIXe au XXe siècle. Mieux encore, avec Bergson, la philosophie retrouve l'ambition (hégélienne) d'être une vision globale du monde. Windelband, well-known for being the leader of the Neo-Kantian School of Bade, together with Bergson, is opposed to both relativism and positivism. According to him, understanding Kant means going further than the latter and, more, in Hegel's direction. Reading Bergson means finding again the meaning of event within metaphysics of what may not be repeated which, by showing the insufficiency of criticism, opens a new way towards historical sciences. Such is the positivie interpretation of Bergson. But the criticism is such as one should imperatively separate psychology from philosophy, contrary to the French philosophical tradition, still observed by Bergson. But Bergsonian voluntarism appears as some kind of representative of the spirit of philosophy at the turn of the 19th-20th century. Better further, with Bergson philosophy recaptures its (Hegelian) ambition to become a global vision of the world.<br>

Abstract: À partir d'une enquête effectuée auprès d'élèves de Quatrième, Troisième, Seconde et Première, on propose un modèle intermédiaire d'appropriation de l'histoire. En utilisant les classificateurs expérimentés en sémantique cognitive, on peut ramener à deux grandes catégories cognitives, l'identification du texte de l'histoire : l'une de type événement-changement s'inscrit dans un schéma narratif, l'autre de type entité stable dans un intervalle temporel met en œuvre des processus de catégorisation. Les événements, concepts et entités de l'historien ne correspondent pas toujours aux modes de perception des élèves. Ces derniers procèdent par catégorisation naturelle en multipliant les analogies entre des périodes historiques différentes, en ancrant les informations nouvelles dans une pensée sociale. How do secondary school students get in contact with historical texts ? Examples drawn from an investigation are used to present identification processes as a change-event or as lasting entities in a time interval, analogical categorization processes and social thinking rooting.<br>

Abstract: L'attachement au pays d'origine est bien analysé pour les diasporas contemporaines afin de démontrer leur dimension transnationale et décrire leurs rapports avec l'État-nation. Pour les XVIe-XVIIIe siècles, en revanche, cette question pourtant fondamentale est minorée au profit des liens entre communautés. Souhaitant sortir des perspectives mono-confessionnelles qui limitent l'historiographie des diasporas modernes, ce travail s'appuie sur l'étude de quatre groupes dispersés : les séfarades, les catholiques britanniques, les huguenots et les morisques. La terre d'origine, qui grave son empreinte culturelle sur la diaspora, constitue un liant structurant fondamental : lieu de l'événement-déclencheur de dispersion et du martyre, elle apparaît comme le front de la résistance qui légitime l'existence de « l'arrière » , la diaspora. Territoire matriciel, souvent mythifié et mobilisé dans les visions messianiques, elle est indissociable de la notion de retour. The attachment to the country of origin is well analyzed for contemporary diasporas to demonstrate their transnational dimension and to describe their relationship with the nation-state. For the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, however, the historiography has emphasized the relationship between communities, overlooking this important issue. Putting aside mono-denominational perspectives, this article offers a new approach to early-modern diasporas by confronting four groups: the Sephardim, the British Catholics, the Huguenots and the Moriscos. The cultural imprint of the homeland was a core structure of diasporas. The locus of both martyrdom and the trigger-event of dispersion, the homeland appeared as the front line of resistance, legitimizing the existence of the "rear", i.e. the Diaspora. Often mythologized and mobilized in messianic visions, this crucial territory was inseparable from the notion of return.<br>

Abstract: The 2001 disarmament of kamajor combatants in Bo, Sierra Leone was an event marked by violence. This paper considers that violence, and by extension other violent events in Sierra Leone's recent war, as narrative blocs: configurations of agency, time, imagery and articulation. This formulation stands in contrast to the way vionent events are often treated, as exceptional moments of outburst or eruption resulting from abnormal circumstances but meaningless in themselves. The paper draws on ethnographic fieldwork with the kamajor militia movement in Sierra Leone to trace some of these blocs both within the disarmament center and through other locations in the "war-scape" of Sierra Leone.<br>

Soulignant combien le temps fut alors objet de luttes et de concurrences politiques, elle nous fait revivre l'intensité du présent, ce sentiment d'accélération tant individuel que collectif qu'éprouverent les protagonistes, la présence du passé, celui des révolutions, de la Commune ou des gréves de 1936, et un horizon qui s'ouvrait sur maints possibles. Cet article entend revisiter l'événement Mai-Juin 68 à l'aune de la conscience historique qu'en ont ses différents acteurs et du rapport aux temporalités imbriquées qu'ils entretiennent alors. Il évoque l'attention particulière prêtée au temps vécu comme un «temps de qualité», entre sentiment de l'urgence et impression de vivre un moment suspendu. Pour autant, ces temporalités elles-mêmes sont replacées dans la conscience que l'histoire est en train de se faire et qu'elle nécessite de réfléchir à cette condition historique, où le passé est un héritage pour mieux penser l'avenir. De fait, les références historiques mobilisées ici n'ont rien de figé; elles signent bien plutôt un rendez-vous de l'histoire et de l'événement, ce qui en fait un passé vivant. This article revisits May-June 1968 in terms of the various players' historical consciousness of the event and their relationship to the interwoven temporalities they had. It deals with the particular attention given to lived time as "quality time", between a feeling of urgency and the impression of living a suspended moment. Nevertheless, these very temporalities are part of the consciousness that history is going through, and it is necessary to think about this historical condition in which the past is an inheritance that makes thinking the future better. Indeed, the historical references used here are not cut and dried: they mark an appointment with history and with the event, which makes it a living past.<br>

Abstract: Le revival, qui se développa parmi les premiers disciples de Husserl, est un fait saisissant. Des documents, dont quelques uns sont encore inédits, servent à l'illustrer. Ce qui le fonde, c'est une étrange correspondance entre le projet de la première phénoménologie et les démarches subjectives de la conscience religieuse. La vraie philosophie, sainteté de la raison, n'est-elle pas aussi rectitude de la conscience jusqu'aux racines d'une expérience du sacré ou du divin ? The revival, which appeared among the first disciples of Ed. Husserl, is a well known fact. New documents are dedicated to illustrate such an event. They make clearer the existence of some mysterious bond linking the first phenomenological method and the basic disposition of natural religion. Genuine philosophy is indeed rightness of thought but also practical truth down to the very sources of a renovating feeling of the holy or the divine.<br>

Abstract: After demonstrating that scripture's truth has always to be negotiated in terms of changing contexts, and after demonstrating that this is precisely what the church has already done with regard to remarriage, this essay argues that the church's teaching on marriage as an event is an increasingly irrelevant Victorian construct, not the originary will of God; and is maintained only by disregard – disregard of the hermeneutical nature of scripture's teachings on marriage, disregard of the process–understanding of marriage which has always dominated Africa and which is increasingly dominating global culture as a whole, and disregard of the church's teachings, even by active and committed members of the church. The essay argues that the hermeneutical nature of the Bible's teaching on this subject, as well as the church's own approach to remarriage, gives the church the responsibility to frame a Christian process-understanding of marriage which will better enable people to build stable, lifelong unions.<br>

Abstract: Inquiry in the social sciences is based on theoretical assumptions that are not always clearly articulated in research reports. This article surveys some of the theoretical positions that underlie various qualitative research methods and discusses some of the methodological issues raised by those positions. The four themes that serve as anchor points for the discussion are contextualization, an approach to social-scientific observation that takes into account the environment in which the observational event takes place; understanding, an approach to the problem of knowledge and explanation that addresses the range of what can be learned from observation; pluralism, the proposition that not only social settings but the methods for explaining them resist reduction to a single model; and expression, the problem of conveying the results of research.<br>

Abstract: Cette contribution examine l'incertitude et le bouleversement des temps sociaux, à l'aune de l'unification des deux polices de Berlin, depuis la chute du mur, le 9 novembre 1989, jusqu'à l'unification allemande, au 3 octobre 1990. Berlin, à la fois communauté urbaine et Lana politico-administratif, a subitement vu deux polices sur son sol. Deux polices, deux histoires distinctes construites 40 ans durant, en opposition réciproque. Le temps fut décisif dans l'unification de ces deux polices, la seule qui ait contraint les agents à travailler effectivement ensemble, dans l'intimité des mêmes postes et des mêmes patrouilles. Le passé des institutions, appelé en résistance contre l'avenir, le présent des configurations politiques locales, mais aussi l'anticipation de l'avenir par les agents individuels et la temporalité propre de la police, son imbrication dans le quotidien, dans la routine de l'ordre public, toutes ces dimensions du temps ont absorbé la puissance de l'événement pour rendre l'impensable possible. This contribution examines the uncertainty and the social changes through the question of the Berlin two police forces'unification, from the fall of the Wall, November 9,1989, to the German unification at October 3, 1990. Berlin, at the same time urban community and political-administrative Land, suddenly saw two police forces on its ground. Two police forces : two distinct stories built 40 years during, in reciprocal opposition. Time was decisive in the unification of these two police forces, the only one which has constrained the agents to work indeed together, in the intimacy of the same stations and the same patrols. Past of the institutions, called in resistance against the future, present of the local political configurations, but also the anticipation of the future by the individual agents and the police force's own temporality, its overlap in the everyday life, the routine of the public order, all these dimensions of time absorbed the power of the event~<br>

Abstract: During the reign of Catherine the Great, the question of the origins of the Russian State and people ('the Varagian-Norman question') becomes a matter of wide discussion in Russia and in Europe. It has been a very controversial topic in the Russian Academy of Sciences and the occasion of a violent polemic between historians around 1749-50. It has long been kept secret because of the possible dangerous political consequences for the Monarchy and the national pride. The political power wanted by all means to give its subjects a glorious national history but at the same time to control the story of the origins, the ethnic aspects and possible liberal, parliamentary or democratic interpretations of the beginnings of the Russian State. While western historians (German, French and English) gave their accounts of this founding event to the Enlightened Europe, making this story widespread in the West, Catherine made ancient Russian history part of the new modern national education of the elites. She was writing plays herself and patronizing artists and printers, censuring them occasionally: she tried to orient collective memory and used it as an ideological tool to create a unified empire under her lead. В правление имератрицы Екатерины Великой (1762-1796 гг.) - как в России, так и в Европе - всё активнее обсуждается т н. «варяжско-норманский вопрос», т.е. вопрос происхождения Российского государства и народа. Еще в правление императрицы Елизаветы Петровны (1742-1761 гг.) внутри Российской Академии наук, и прежде всего в 1749-1750 гг., данный вопрос стал предметом острой полемики между историками. Между тем долго опасались огласки, т.к. было принято считать, что самый спор, пожалуй, может вызывать нежелательные политические последствия для Монархии и национальной гордости. Политическая власть стремилась к тому, чтобы в ее основание легла величественная национальная история. В свзи с этим она пыталась иметь контроль над повествованием о своем происхождении, и также об этниче~<br>

Abstract: A célebre afirmaçāo de Nietzsche acerca da morte de Deus corre, hoje em dia, o risco de se tornar num lugar comum incapaz de alcançar o seu profundo significado. No entanto, o evento anunciado pelo filósofo alemāo - de um mundo e de urna cultura sem Deus - começa a ser uma realidade nas sociedades ocidentais, ditas pós-modernas. De facto, como assinala Joseph Ratzinger, as sociedades hodiernas parecem organizar-se cada vez mais corno se Deus não existisse. Neste contexto, procurarei mostrar como o evento de um mundo sem Deus constituí urna oportunidade para o cristianismo ressurgir de um modo mais autêntico. Em primeiro lugar, irei analisar a afirmação nietzschiana Gott ist to" na complexidade da sua obra. De seguida, irei comparar a morte de Deus em Nietzsche com os conceitos de ateísmo crìstão e de crìstianismo num mundo adulto em Bonhoeffer, detectando semelhanças e contrastes entre ambos. Por firn, tentarei mostrar como a proposta bonhoefferiana se torna mais inteligível quando se procura realizar o moderno ideal de autenticidade, adoptando alguns argumentos de Charles Taylor. The well-known Nietzsche's statement about the death of God risks, nowadays, to become a common place whose deeply sense is difficult to grasp. Nevertheless, the event the German philosopher proclaimed - that is, a world and a culture without God - starts to have place in the contemporary Western societies, called post-modern. As Joseph Ratzinger argues, the contemporary societies seem to be organized more and more as if God did not exist. In this context, I will show how this event could be an opportunity for Christianity be lived in a more authentic way. First, I will analyse Nietzsche's affirmation Gott ist tot in the complexity of his work. Then, I will compare Nietzsche's death of God with Bonhoeffer s concepts of a Christian atheism and a Christianity in an adult world, highlighting similarities and differences between them. At the end, I will try to argue that the bonhoefferian prop~<br>

Publisher: Ecole de Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales<br>
Issue: i401008<br>
Date: 1 1, 1983<br>
Author(s): Veyne Achille<br>
Abstract: Ce texte analyse l'image comme écriture, non seulement parce que la caricature camerounaise est un parfait mélange de l'image et du mot, du mot et du son (donc de la parole), mais aussi parce qu'elle s'immisce constamment dans l'espace pictural pour y introduire le mouvement. Elle est aussi politiquement un métissage du local et du global par son français créole, par son insistance à mettre l'accent sur les mécanismes, situés dans l'espace politique global, qui agissent sur les événements locaux. La caricature semble s'identifier à une rumeur saisie sur le vif qui, pour ne pas devenir mot discipliné, a absolument besoin de l'image pour continuer à être un événement, pour échapper au risque de devenir le double de la vie qui se présente comme son portrait. L'esthétique de cette écriture, qui s'obstine à faire de l'indiscipline le fondement de sa pertinence, repose essentiellement sur l'audace de dire, de montrer, ce qui ne devrait être ni dit, ni montré publiquement. Toutes choses que la caricature peut se permettre puisque, comme la rumeur, elle ne prétend pas reproduire le monde de façon mimétique; elle n'en produit qu'un double dont l'éthique permet de montrer ce que tout le monde sait mais que personne n'ose dire. /// Cameroonian caricatures are analyzed as a form of writing that mixes images and words. Through French Creole, these caricatures politically mix local and general issues by insisting on how politics in general affects the image to become an event. The aesthetics of this form of writing, which obstinately insists on indiscipline as the basis of its relevance, mainly resides in the boldness to speak up about, and show, what should neither be said nor shown in public. Caricatures can do this because, like rumors, they do not claim to reproduce the world through mimesis. They only produce a double for showing what everyone knows but no one dares say.<br>

The elements are not an irrational chaos but provide a principle of indeterminacy that gives creation unprogrammability, risk, and the possibility of the event.<br>

Author(s): Foucault Ranabir<br>
Abstract: Can a historical event, such as Partition, be understood as an action that "resulted" from complex, wide forces of history or also as an event continually brought into being by the play of subject memories? A relationship of complementarity exists between the problems internal to history and the demands and desires of memory, so much so that together they form integral parts of a single operation, the historiographical operation. Yet memory sometimes appears the obverse of history making. Human action, as this article remonstrates, sometimes overcomes the bounds of passivity imposed by memory and this is also what determines history.<br>

Author(s): Harcourt Dipesh<br>
Abstract: To discuss the practice of memory and its relations to politics, social scientists rely on three kinds of practices - memorialising, memorising and the act of remembering/forgetting. The commemoration of "1857" is unique in that official celebrations of the event have been instituted even as 1857 continues to refigure in myths and endures as a symbol of popular resistance. The articles in this special issue address the seeming contradictions and complexities that "remembering" 1857 involves, and the tension that prevails between different kinds of recall.<br>

Publisher: SAGE<br>
Issue: i40178169<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Cloke Paul<br>
Abstract: This paper suggests that the vocabulary and meaningfulness of 'evil' can be re-articulated, and to some extent redeemed from the extremes of fundamentalism and relativism. It uses intellectual resources from Nigel Wright, Walter Wink and Rene Girard to reconstruct some foundations for a reworking of evil in human geography. It then presents an account of the reappearance of evil 'after postmodernism' in event, narrative and praxis, arguing that working through and acting against evil reveals its present nature in terms that defy the excesses of right-wing religious fundamentalism and the bland tolerance that can stem from an over-reliance on relativistic thinking. The paper considers how geographies of postsecular practice in areas such as homelessness emerge in response to discernment both of the spiritual interiorities and the exteriorities of landscapes of power, and of the ability of human action to influence these landscapes.<br>

Date: 12 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Cyprus News Agency Olga<br>
Abstract: This article is an ethnographic exploration of the process through which citizens come to conceptualize their identities as political subjects in rapidly changing contexts. The focus of the article is the lifting, in 2003, of a ban on crossing between the northern and southern parts of the island of Cyprus, which had been instituted in 1974. The article examines how this new political change affected state rhetoric, and concentrates on the reactions of Greek-Cypriot citizens to this shift. These data are related to the wider discussion on the political theory of subjectivity and the concept of 'event', where, it is argued, anthropology has a significant contribution to make. / Le présent article est une exploration ethnographique des processus par lequel les citoyens en viennent à conceptualiser leurs identités comme sujets politiques dans des contextes de changements rapides. Il est centré sur l'abolition, en 2003, de l'interdiction de passage imposée en 1974 entre les parties Nord et Sud de L'île de Chypre. L'auteur examine la manière dont ce nouveau changement politique a affecté la rhétorique étatique, et se concentre sur les réactions des Chypriotes Grecs à cette évolution. Ces données sont replacées dans un cadre de discussion plus large sur la théorie politique de la subjectivité et le concept « d'événement », auquel l'anthropologie peut, selon l'auteur, apporter une contribution importante.<br>

Author(s): Walens Michael<br>
Abstract: This paper outlines an approach to historical narratives that replaces the atomism of actor and event with a model that stresses the integration of event, narrative, and historical practice. The notion of contact as an event is addressed in the context of the Northwest Coast. A Heiltsuk English narrative dealing with contact is analyzed in the light of Heiltsuk cultural data. The analysis centers on Jakobson's distinction between metaphor and metonymy and leads to the conclusion that for the Heiltsuk, contact with Europeans resulted in the acquisition of a linear historicity. Finally, notions of temporality are examined with respect to historical practice and North American Indian cultures.<br>

Abstract: The flight of Voyager 1 past Saturn in 1981 provides an occasion for a semiotic comparison of reports in French newspapers (Le Monde and Libération), a popular science article (in, La Recherche), and specialized scientific articles in Nature. The texts differ in the distance supposed between reader and writer, in the treatment of human and nonhuman actors, in characterization of the event and assumptions about readers' interest in it, and in their narrative structure. The analysis shows that popularizations and specialized scientific articles are not related in a simple dichotomy or scale and cannot be explained by a notion of the "general public"; rather, the various types of texts must be considered in terms of more complex relations between what are called in semiotic terms the enunciator and the enunciatee.<br>

Abstract: This study presents an interpretation of the configuration of the poetic subject in the books of poems El Primer Libro (1985) and Albricia (1988) by Soledad Fariña (1943), which understand a self in a continuous process of gestation and birth. This process serves the purpose of recomposing a disarticulated subjectivity lost in the framework of the political and cultural conditions imposed by the military dictatorship that ruled Chile in the 1970s and 1980s. By using a metaphor of a journey and searching for a new language, the subject attempts to access a primitive stage andfind its maternal self in order to confront the dominant power, by codifying and configuring herself through an otherness in a feminine body-text. However, this process of maturation and discovery is intervened and left incomplete by the impulse of modernity, thereby creating a deformed, dissociated and off-centered self, which aims at growing opposed to logos. This conflict turns the upcoming of the new self into a painful event, like giving birth, that stems from the subject's wounded and fractured body, intending to re-establish de selffrom its fragments, traces and memories.<br>

Abstract: In his essay “The Style of Autobiography”, Jean Starobinski remarks, “One would hardly have sufficient motive to write an autobiography had not some radical change occurred […] conversion, entry into a new life, the operations of Grace”. From the beginning, the traumatic events of Keller's childhood — her loss of sight and hearing around age two — marked her not only as “outsider” and “other” but also as “autobiographer” even before she acquired language. “I can show so little visible proof of living”, Keller confessed. Perhaps for this reason she filled the “white darkness” she lived in with writing — first with finger spelling traced in the hand, then with Braille, and finally with type. While each medium seemed to bring her closer to the dream — her own and her century's — of transparent communication, so each text she produced threatened to turn into a “black box”, an instrument designed to collect and preserve data for analysis following a catastrophic event, but one that inevitably fails to illumine the inner world of Keller's deaf-blindness. This essay explores Keller's dreaming within the black box of writing, following her impossible desire for an “instrument which will show what takes place in the mind when we think”.<br>

Abstract: The long never-ending party, from the reader's perspective, is thus a result of narrative strategies. The vagueness of such an atemporal party facilitates possibilities of reader associations with their own biographical past and is therefore important in heightening the emotional content of the textual hyper-memory. The fact that these parties take place during the summer further encourages nostalgic identification since summer is often linked to our own nostalgic memories. One technique that serves to emphasize the feeling of a long, never-ending party (the party of a lifetime) is Fitzgerald's use of
         iterative frequency, or more specificallypseudo-iterative frequency. Iterative frequency involves referring to narrating events as if they occurred more than once. Instead of relating to an event as “happened,” Fitzgerald says, it “used to happen.” Pseudo-iterative frequency occurs when the detailed description of an event appears to be not completely truthfully presented.
               In chapters 1 and 2 the frequency is7
            singulativein that what is told once in the narrative also happens once in the story.
               However, in the beginning of the third chapter, Fitzgerald departs from this classic narrative strategy and starts telling once in the narrative what happens several times in story time.8
            
               There was not music from Gatsby's house once, but “through the summer nights” (39). Before Nick arrives at Gatsby's party, Nick briefly summarizes all parties of the summer. That passage is a cavalcade of events and experiences as these illustrative fragments show: “In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and champagne and the stars, … [o]n week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city, … [and e]very Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in ~<br>

Abstract: Remembering is a function of the meaning-making process after the emptiness of loss. Spelder and Strickland suggest that “grief is the emotional response to bereavement, to the event of loss” (as qtd. in DuBose, 368). The theologian Todd J. DuBose explains that “grief gazes at an ever-receding present as it moves further and further into the past. The immediate reaction often involves bargaining for a reversal of the loss, denial, anger, shock, anguish, distress, sadness” (368). These reactions are the body's means of trying to make sense of the world in the wake of the emptiness created by bereavement. Interpreting Drew Leder and Maurice Merleau-Ponty's notion of chiasmic structure of the body, DuBose explains that the body realizes its existence only in relation to other bodies. It touches because it is being touched. Other bodies make ours perceptible. The disappearance of these other bodies in death is, in tune with the chiasmic structure of bodily existence, the disappearance of our own bodies. We experience that disappearance as pain, grief, sorrow. These manifestations of pain are, indeed, the ways our bodies adjust to vacuum and fill it with meaning. For DuBose, “meaning-making processes, which
         appearto be immaterial processes, are embodied phenomena. Reflection, perception, feeling, language, even logic make sense only through the influx of the body's ‘reading’ of space, time, action, and sensation” (370).<br>

Abstract: Several factors were involved in the formation of European hegemony, not the least being the navigation of the Atlantic Ocean commencing with the voyages of Christopher Columbus at the end of the fifteenth century. This event forms the origin and context that enabled Europe to take on the prestige of a special and peculiar identity. Europe became a continent!
         
               Now it is clear that the landmass known as Europe is part and parcel of the larger landmass of Asia; geographically, Europe is a cape of Asia.6<br>

Abstract: In the event, SPEP did seem to be made up of oddballs and outsiders in those early years. In 1964 it was a bit larger than the twenty or thirty souls that Ed Casey describes in his paper, but not by much. The leadership was a diverse bunch: Aron Gurwitsch, gruff and insistent on rigor and clarity, the embodiment of the old-school European professor. His presence made me aware, for the first time, I think, of the existence of the New School for Social Research, that amazing institution where I would later teach and am teaching now. John Wild, with the fervor of the recent convert himself, was eager to convert others. According to one tale, possibly apocryphal, an undergraduate student reported that he kept talking about a place called “Lebensville” and saying we ought to go back there. Herbert Spiegelberg, sweetest of men, had earned the respect and gratitude of all for publishing his two-volume
      The Phenomenological Movement, which had appeared in 1960. George Schrader, slowly abandoning Kant for Heidegger. Bill Earle, a very smooth talker—that's all I remember. Erwin Straus, who in his old age exemplified, every time he stood up to speak, the epic struggle of our species to attain the upright posture. Dreyfus, Todes, Lingus, Schrag, and Edie were the Young Turks in that group. We graduate students, still looking on curiously from the sidelines at that point, slowly got a sense of the great learning and intellectual integrity of our elders and also eventually picked up the excitement of being an embattled minority struggling for survival and recognition.<br>

Abstract: In short, it is exposure to the experientially inspired and theoretically casual atmosphere of those early SPEP meetings—where neglected topics and unorthodox modes of thinking and speaking were encouraged in an undisciplined way—to which I owe the most. Of course, SPEP grew up. It has experienced its share of embarrassing upheavals, as the heavy presence of its own versions of the social and political prejudices in the larger culture became too obvious to ignore. But it is now a major event—the four-day anchor for a week-long convention that takes over hotels, runs multiple concurrent sessions, fosters satellite groups, and often follows established lines of discussion. Some even call it the alternative APA. Yet I am sure that as long as lifeworld experience continues to trump whatever it is currently fashionable to say about it, grown-up SPEP will retain enough of its original vitality and intellectual generosity so that another generation of aging academics will have cause to repeat our present thank-yous in another fifty years.<br>

Abstract: I want to thank the organizers for allowing us to go back to those halcyon days of yore when we were young, the world was ours, and we, the carriers of the coals, were unintentionally about to bring critical theory to the United States. No doubt I played a minor role in that process, and looking back there was no singular event that led to my association with critical theory but, rather, a curious set of happenings that led to encounters, friendships, and a richness of life that I could not have fathomed when I made a simple trip to Germany in 1971. At the time I considered myself to be a thoroughgoing phenomenologist and hermeneuticist. I had written my first book on Paul Ricoeur and was hired to teach philosophy of religion, having had the good fortune of having been a student directly of Mircea Eliade and indirectly of Paul Ricoeur. No doubt I would still be teaching and writing about the philosophy of religion had it not been for the events of the day. America was “all shook up” with the opposition to the Vietnam War, the dilemma of the draft and the reaction to it on college campuses, Kent State, the invasion of Cambodia, the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, and numerous other incidents. True, I had no particular qualifications to deal with those things; none of us did. But I was prone to try. I was equipped by sentiment if not by intellect.<br>

Abstract: If the thinkers I cite are right, remembering is both transformative of that in which it occurs and resistant to its own transformation. It is transformative in that the event of remembering strengthens living connections, patterns, and configurations of valences in the neural networks—or institution—in which it happens, and it does so at the expense of alternative connections, patterns, and configurations. It is resistant in the same instant and for the same reason. It resists mirroring its own surroundings, copying or projecting its immediate reality. It resists
         presentation and thus refuses to berepresentation. It both is and enables differing.<br>

Abstract: 1968. The first significant event marker, 1968 was the international year of student revolts. I was in Paris, along with many now retirement-cusp SPEP people, experiencing the “events of May.” Similar events reached from Tokyo to Berlin to Columbia and Kent State. Several academic but symptomatic results include the disappearance of tweed and ties but also titles—since then I am everywhere “Don” and rarely “Professor Ihde.” This was also the epitome of the organized protest march, become the standard to this day from Tiananmen Square to Tahrir Square, Egypt. The practices invented then have challenged and often enough, brought down regimes, and youthful democratization movements still repeat themselves.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: The account of the aspect in Husserlian phenomenology is well known. With his theory of adumbrations, Husserl described how the perceived object is given in a one-sided, partial manner. The perception of its actual profile or aspect is given against the horizon of a set of potential perceptions of its other sides. Together these actual and potential perceptions are unified to form the sense of the thing that is perceived. For Deleuze, though, Husserl's account operates on the level of aftereffects because it does not ever consider the genesis or coming into being of the aspect itself. It is this event—the genesis of the aspect as such—that Deleuze's work brings to the fore. The Deleuzian aspect is separated from every figure and context. Think of it as being like the smile of the Cheshire Cat, which wanders away from the cat's body. This is not simply an imaginary or hallucinatory appearance; instead it indicates the genesis of a sensation prior to the work of figuration or its placement within a context. Every figure or form is a secondary coagulation or solidification of this primary sensation. To the extent that the aspect disarticulates itself from every position or background field, it can rightly be called an in-visible. This is how a minimal phenomenology approaches the invisible. That is, it approaches this minimal threshold of sense—the threshold that gives rise to sensation and conscious experience.<br>

Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: There are several contemporary theorists who explore and offer significant insight into hyperbole, but they do not fully identify its specific rhetorical functions. They each offer important characteristics of hyperbole but do not demarcate both its global purpose and its figural limits. In this article, I have outlined two specific functions of hyperbole, and I have shown how they operate within discourse. I have also identified the metafunction of hyperbole and revealed that it may operate as a figure of thought beyond its traditional tropological limits. I have not abandoned these limitations but expanded on them by grounding hyperbole as a mode of thought within its specific stylistic formations. As such, hyperbole can be used to delve into the complexities and paradoxes of ethics and theo-philosophical argumentation—the intricacies of negative theology and ascetical theology, the problematic role of subjectivity, and the difficulty of representation. It can also be used discursively to read various philosophical texts—those of Friedrich Nietzsche, Slavoj Zizek, Søren Kierkegaard, Emmanuel Levinas, and Michel Foucault, for example—in ways other than they are typically read or to explicate concepts such as the “event,” the “spectacular,”

Abstract: Notably, Ricoeur's work also insists on the fact that texts have “real world” implications. But how do these implications transpire? What, exactly, happens after the text is read? How does an individual's response to a text produce action that continues the narration of human action across time? How does the seemingly closed circle of repetition and imitation become a progressive spiral of innovative action? Ricoeur rightly argues that “it is what comes after reading” that truly determines the transformative potential of a text (1985, 2:170). Although such statements gesture toward judgment and action, the “appropriation” about which Ricoeur speaks remains primarily a phenomenological experience of the reader rather than a public event: “By ‘appropriation,’ I understand this: that the interpretation of a text culminates in the self-interpretation of a subject who thenceforth understands himself better, understands himself differently, or simply begins to understand himself” (2007, 118). To move Ricoeur's “appropriation” outside the self and into the public world, I draw on the idea of “constitutive rhetoric,” first coined by Maurice Charland. This concept not only shifts appropriation into the public realm; it helps us to see how public memories can transform today's readers into tomorrow's agents. This transformation bridges the gap between mimesis
         3and mimesis1.<br>

            Beguiling a Victorian public obsessed with the pursuit of fitness, the International Health Exhibition opened in South Kensington in May 1884. Its expressed intent, to educate the public on a broad range of wellness topics, was greatly overshadowed by its dazzling display of proprietary medical commodities, salutary appliances, and faddish cures. While there were legitimate exhibits that dealt sincerely with issues of sanitation, hygiene, food, drink, and even child care, the event illuminated the extent to which personal and systemic therapeutic remedy and indeed health itself had become a lucrative industry. Less than three weeks before he joined the Fabian Society, the fledgling novelist Bernard Shaw visited one of the exhibition's prominent attractions, Francis Galton's Anthropometric Laboratory, to be quantified and measured. Chart 3655, created on 16 August 1884, contains the following collected data:His essential healthy-mindedness and peculiar buoyancy never allowed him to sink into [the fin de siècle writers'] bogs of glorified decay, [and] the very mention of his name seems to clear the poisoned air a little.

Abstract: To talk about hope is difficult without bringing faith into the conversation. The two terms often accompany one another in discourse and are frequently used interchangeably. Nevertheless, we can distinguish between them in ways that make a difference to thinking and that align them—as distinct concepts—more exactly with our day-to-day experience of living. From one angle, hope is a function of want and wish, and faith is a function of trust and conviction. The former expresses the yearning that our preferred outcomes come to be as events unfold, the latter the assurance that our longings will be realized in the fullness of time. Hope, then, dwells in the optative realm, faith in the declarative realm. Furthermore, faith implies hope, but not vice versa. If faith is a phenomenological presence in us at all, it necessarily reflects a subsidiary but related hopeful intentionality directed toward a desired future state of affairs. In this sense, faith entails hope. Conceptually, the two go together conjointly; it is hard to think faith without thinking hope. On the other hand, one can have hope without any correlative faith. The condemned criminal, for example, may desperately hope for a stay of execution but lack the abiding faith that the eleventh-hour phone call will come. Similarly, the terminally ill patient may passionately hope for a last-minute medical miracle but profoundly doubt that any such saving event will ever take place. Put simply, hope may exist absent faith, albeit passively and enfeebled, whereas if faith is present, hope will be too, in a kinetic form disposed toward energized, goal-directed behavior.<br>

Abstract: The concept of fabula, or its many near equivalents, has always been a staple of narrative theory, yet it is vulnerable to many theoretical objections. It is possible to justify a rhetorical view of the concept's pragmatic value, and so its particular relevance to fiction, but only once various flawed notions of fabula have been eliminated. Some of these relate back quite directly to its Russian Formalist roots, but others have arisen through Structuralist mediations of the concept (in the guise of such pairs as “story” and “discourse”). The inadequacies of these models are manifest in fabula's relationship to event, chronology, temporality, causality, perspective, medium, and the genesis of narrative. The concept remains valuable, however, in respect of its role in interpretation, especially in the case of fictional narrative. The rhetorical basis of this view of fabula and its relation to sujet effectively overturns the logical hierarchy of previous representational models.<br>

Abstract: Another way utopian rhetoric might be explained is by reference to the classical rhetorical concept of
      stasis—the stand a rhetor takes in order to form his or her perspective on an issue. This is a concept that implies both place (astatusor stand) and a pervasive act of critical thinking. This theory was introduced during the Roman Republic by Hermagoras and was widely used as a way of defining an issue for legal argumentation. Metaphorically, by viewing a staged event from different locations in the arena surrounding it, the orator may see the situation from multiple points of view and better apprehend the reality of what is at issue. Perhaps the broadest critical thought may be gained by seeking a theoretical stasis, which is metaphorically comparable to the highest ring of seats in the bleachers overlooking any given situation in human affairs. Utopia, then, might be defined as an ethically framed view of what a rhetor imagines or sees from those highest seats.<br>

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>

Abstract: The crossroads of the end of Utopia (apparently ensured by the fall of the Berlin Wall and Soviet Russia), the end of the world (apparently easier to imagine than an alternative to capitalism), and capitalism itself (which is apparently eternal) seems an apt place to turn toward the problem of degenerate Utopia and the city, which, after all, pretty much amount to the same thing in our time. Louis Marin's proposition is that “a degenerate utopia is ideology changed into the form of a myth.”
         
               Arguably, one such myth is capitalism. Another might be modernity or modernism, and a third could be the inevitability of the contemporary city as the concretization of capitalist realism. However, the cities that most of us inhabit could conceivably be construed as Utopias by neoliberals, as constituting the best of all possible worlds for the spread of free markets, or equally so by anti-utopians, who might see in the modern city Utopia realized, that is, dystopia. In any event, and whatever one's preconceived notion of Utopia might be, the contemporary city stands primarily as confirmation “of the impotence of corporate capital to generate a socially cohesive environment.”29
            
               As such, it is also arguably no Utopia, which persists as an open project to be imagined and realized, sometime and somewhere in the future, in the footsteps of present efforts to define Utopia for architecture and the city and to establish its spaces.30<br>
