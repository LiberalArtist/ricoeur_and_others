  Book Title: Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy-The Living Art of Michael C. Leff<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Henry David<br>
  Abstract: What distinguishes the study of rhetoric from other pursuits in the liberal arts? From what realms of human existence and expression, of human history, does such study draw its defining character? What, in the end, should be the purposes of rhetorical inquiry? And amid so many competing accounts of discourse, power, and judgment in the contemporary world, how might scholars achieve these purposes through the attitudes and strategies that animate their work?
      Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy: The Living Art of Michael C. Leffoffers answers to these questions by introducing the central insights of one of the most innovative and prolific rhetoricians of the twentieth century, Michael C. Leff. This volume charts Leff 's decades-long development as a scholar, revealing both the variety of topics and the approach that marked his oeuvre, as well as his long-standing critique of the disciplinary assumptions of classical, Hellenistic, renaissance, modern, and postmodern rhetoric.Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy includes a synoptic introduction to the evolution of Leff 's thought from his time as a graduate student in the late 1960s to his death in 2010, as well as specific commentary on twenty-four of his most illuminating essays and lectures.<br>

  Book Title: Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxes-  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Bubbio Paolo Diego<br>
  Abstract: Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxesis an account of Paolo Diego Bubbio's twenty-year intellectual journey through the twists and turns of Girard's mimetic theory. The author analyzes philosophy and religion as "enemy sisters" engaged in an endless competitive struggle and identifies the intellectual space where this rivalry can either be perpetuated or come to a paradoxical resolution. He goes on to explore topics ranging from arguments for the existence of God to mimetic theory's post-Kantian legacy, political implications, and capacity for identifying epochal phenomena, such as the crisis of the self, in popular culture. Bubbio concludes by advocating for an encounter between mimetic theory and contemporary philosophical hermeneutics-an encounter in which each approach benefits and is enriched by the resources of the other. The volume features a previously unpublished letter by René Girard on the relationship between philosophy and religion.<br>

  Abstract: My main aim in this essay is to show that Girard’s argument for Christ’s divinity hides a variation of the classic ontological argument for the existence of God.¹ In order to do so, it is first important to distinguish three distinct hermeneutical approaches to Girard’s mimetic theory:
                  internal and literal, internal nonliteral,andcritical. If we take an internal and literal approach, we find that Girard writes nothing about the ontological proof. If we take an internal and nonliteral approach to Girard, we can try to deduce what he might have thought about the ontological proof on the basis of<br>

  Abstract: AS A MODERN FIELD OF study, Ottoman historiography is unusual, primarily because of its ambivalent relation to that hegemon of hyper-reality, Europe—finding and placing itself both within and without. For much of its existence, the Ottoman Empire was dominated (demographically, economically, politically, ideologically) by its provinces in regions considered now geographically as part of Europe. This is something Ottoman authors oft en remarked upon when discussing the divisions of European geography, which the Well-Protected Domains straddled.<br>

  Book Title: Between One and One Another-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Jackson Michael<br>
  Abstract: Michael Jackson extends his path-breaking work in existential anthropology by focusing on the interplay between two modes of human existence: that of participating in other peoples’ lives and that of turning inward to one’s self. Grounding his discussion in the subtle shifts between being acted upon and taking action, Jackson shows how the historical complexities and particularities found in human interactions reveal the dilemmas, conflicts, cares, and concerns that shape all of our lives. Through portraits of individuals encountered in the course of his travels, including friends and family, and anthropological fieldwork pursued over many years in such places as Sierra Leone and Australia, Jackson explores variations on this theme. As he describes the ways we address and negotiate the vexed relationships between “I” and “we”—the one and the many—he is also led to consider the place of thought in human life.<br>

  Abstract: Our exploration of the complex relationship between literature and space began with a legendary account of the origin of Sanskrit literature and a literary-theoretical discourse on Sanskrit styles and their regional dimensions. Both perspectives are conditioned by a conceptual matrix fundamental to Sanskrit thought for ordering and explaining the diverse phenomena of culture and society as elements in a transregional network closely related to Sanskrit’s own nonlocalized mode of existence. But there are other, literary linkages between literature and space. Narrative has an internal spatial logic, a “semiotic domain around which a plot coalesces and self-organizes,” as one scholar puts<br>

  Book Title: Imagining Karma-Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): OBEYESEKERE GANANATH<br>
  Abstract: With
      Imagining Karma,Gananath Obeyesekere embarks on the very first comparison of rebirth concepts across a wide range of cultures. Exploring in rich detail the beliefs of small-scale societies of West Africa, Melanesia, traditional Siberia, Canada, and the northwest coast of North America, Obeyesekere compares their ideas with those of the ancient and modern Indic civilizations and with the Greek rebirth theories of Pythagoras, Empedocles, Pindar, and Plato. His groundbreaking and authoritative discussion decenters the popular notion that India was the origin and locus of ideas of rebirth. As Obeyesekere compares responses to the most fundamental questions of human existence, he challenges readers to reexamine accepted ideas about death, cosmology, morality, and eschatology. Obeyesekere's comprehensive inquiry shows that diverse societies have come through independent invention or borrowing to believe in reincarnation as an integral part of their larger cosmological systems. The author brings together into a coherent methodological framework the thought of such diverse thinkers as Weber, Wittgenstein, and Nietzsche. In a contemporary intellectual context that celebrates difference and cultural relativism, this book makes a case for disciplined comparison, a humane view of human nature, and a theoretical understanding of "family resemblances" and differences across great cultural divides.<br>

As Calvino puts it, the “fortress . . . grows around us, and the longer we remain shut in it the more it removes us from the outside.” Paradoxically, by working out the possibilities for escape, Dantes is compelled to mentally construct the perfect fortress from which there would be no departure.

  Abstract: Today, the study of sexuality brings together scholars from a wide variety of disciplines – history, politics, literature, religion, the arts, psychology, anthropology, medicine, and biology. At its best, this interdisciplinary work promotes critical self-reflection on disciplinary assumptions about sexuality and the data used to test those assumptions: Is there such a thing as a fixed sexuality and how would one prove its existence? Such questions have arisen ever since the emergence of the concept of ‘sexuality’ at the end of the eighteenth century.

  Book Title: Bruno Latour in Pieces: An Intellectual Biography-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Custance Gloria<br>
  Abstract: Bruno Latour stirs things up. Latour began as a lover of science and technology, co-founder of actor-network theory, and philosopher of a modernity that had "never been modern." In the meantime he is regarded not just as one of the most intelligent and also popular exponents of science studies but also as a major innovator of the social sciences, an exemplary wanderer who walks the line between the sciences and the humanities. This book provides the first comprehensive overview of the Latourian oeuvre, from his early anthropological studies in Abidjan (Ivory Coast), to influential books like Laboratory Life and Science in Action, and his most recent reflections on an empirical metaphysics of "modes of existence." In the course of this enquiry it becomes clear that the basic problem to which Latour's work responds is that of social tradition, the transmission of experience and knowledge. What this empirical philosopher constantly grapples with is the complex relationship of knowledge, time, and culture.<br>

  Book Title: Regard for the Other: Autothanatography in Rousseau, De Quincey, Baudelaire, and Wilde-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burt E. S.<br>
  Abstract: Although much has been written on autobiography, the same cannot be said of autothanatography, the writing of one's death. This study starts from the deconstructive premise that autobiography is aporetic, not or not only a matter of a subject strategizing with language to produce an exemplary identity but a matter also of its responding to an exorbitant call to write its death. The I-dominated representations of particular others and of the privileged other to whom a work is addressed, must therefore be set against an alterity plaguing the I from within or shadowing it from without. This alterity makes itself known in writing as the potential of the text to carry messages that remain secret to the confessing subject. Anticipation of the potential for the confessional text to say what Augustine calls the secret I do not know,the secret of death, engages the autothanatographical subject in a dynamic, inventive, and open-ended process of identification. The subject presented in these texts is not one that has already evolved an interior life that it seeks to reveal to others, but one that speaks to us as still in process. Through its exorbitant response, it gives intimations of an interiority and an ethical existence to come. Baudelaire emerges as a central figure for this understanding of autobiography as autothanatography through his critique of the narcissism of a certain Rousseau, his translation of De Quincey's confessions, with their vertiginously ungrounded subject-in-construction, his artistic practice of self-conscious, thorough-going doubleness, and his service to Wilde as model for an aporetic secrecy. The author discusses the interruption of narrative that must be central to the writing of one's death and addresses the I's dealings with the aporias of such structuring principles as secrecy, Levinasian hospitality, or interiorization as translation. The book makes a strong intervention in the debate over one of the most-read genres of our time.<br>

  Abstract: We hope to transport metaphor from its usual Aristotelian setting into a Platonic context where the Good, not Being, is supreme. If we are to displace being, what are we displacing? Aside from its vitalistic, durative, and fact-stating senses,
                  einai(to be) has a locative power, a presence in the present. We shunt these senses over to the matrix, which, though beyond being, gives each being life, duration, a place, a present, and that facticity of a there to a here. “Existence” is not one of the meanings ofeinai.

  Abstract: Throughout his works, Josiah Royce maintains that error is a crucially important philosophical issue. The existence of error provides us with proof that there is a reality outside of ourselves and establishes the need for us to come together to engage in communal inquiry. Error is also inevitable. As long as we remain finite, we will always err. However, when we come together and strive for a better understanding of the world around us with loyalty to inquiry and loyalty to loyalty itself we can often recognize error and do our best to eradicate it.

  Book Title: Committing the Future to Memory: History, Experience, Trauma-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clift Sarah<br>
  Abstract: Whereas historical determinacy conceives the past as a complex and unstable network of causalities, this book asks how history can be related to a more radical future. To pose that question, it does not reject determinacy outright but rather seeks to explore how it works. In examining what it means to be "determined" by history, it also asks what kind of openings there might be in our encounters with history for interruptions, re-readings, and re-writings. Engaging texts spanning multiple genres and several centuries from John Locke to Maurice Blanchot, from Hegel to Benjamin Clift looks at experiences of time that exceed the historical narration of experiences said to have occurred in time. She focuses on the co-existence of multiple temporalities and opens up the quintessentially modern notion of historical succession to other possibilities. The alternatives she draws out include the mediations of language and narration, temporal leaps, oscillations and blockages, and the role played by contingency in representation. She argues that such alternatives compel us to reassess the ways we understand history and identity in a traumatic, or indeed in a post-traumatic, age.<br>

  Book Title: The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER THOMAS M.<br>
  Abstract: The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence explores themes in classical American philosophy, primarily that of John Dewey, but also in the thought of Ralph Waldo Emerson, George Santayana, and Native American traditions. The primary claim is that human beings exist with a need for the experience of meaning and value, a "Human Eros." Our various cultures are symbolic environments or "spiritual ecologies" within which the Human Eros can thrive. This is how we inhabit the earth. Encircling and sustaining our cultural existence is nature. Western philosophy has not generally provided adequate conceptual models for thinking ecologically. Thus the idea of "eco-ontology" undertakes to explore ways in which this might be done beginning with the primacy of Nature over Being, but also including the recognition of possibility and potentiality as inherent aspects of existence. I argue for the centrality of Dewey for an effective ecological philosophy. Both "pragmatism" and "naturalism" need to be contextualized within an emergentist, relational, non-reductive view of nature and an aesthetic, imaginative, non-reductive view of intelligence.<br>

  Book Title: Restoring the Right Relationship-  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Brien Mark A<br>
  Abstract: A leading biblical scholar, Hans Heinrich Schmid, believes that righteousness, or the right order of the world, is 'the fundamental problem of our human existence'. It is a key theme in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament's theology of creation and salvation, along with associated themes such as justice, steadfast love/loyalty, truth/ fidelity, compassion/mercy, sin and disorder/chaos. A number of studies of righteousness have been undertaken but most have tended to focus on Israel's call to be righteous, as voiced in particular in the Prophetic Books and the Psalter. In contrast, this book focuses on divine righteousness as the basis for all other notions of righteousness, as this is outlined in the foundational teaching or revelation of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament— namely, the Torah or Pentateuch. It then undertakes a study of how righteousness in the Prophetic Books, the Psalter and the Book of Job relates to this foundational teaching.<br>

Perhaps constitutes a theology of what is to come and what we cannot see coming. Responding to current critics of continental philosophy, Caputo explores the materiality of perhaps and the promise of the world.

  Author(s) Pérez-Gómez Alberto<br>
  Abstract: Buildings serve many purposes. One might argue that their primary function is to provide shelter for the inhabitants and their possessions—a place to stay warm and dry, and to sleep without fear of predators or pathogens. Buildings also provide spaces to safely contain and facilitate social groups focused on learning, work, or play. And they provide for privacy, a space for solace and retreat from the social demands of human existence. These primary physical requirements, and their many subsidiaries, simply reflect the fact that we are biological creatures. In addition to building constraints dictated by site, materials, and budget,<br>

  Abstract: The relationship between public and private schools in France during the past century has been a persistent political dilemma of great complexity. Whether fighting for the legal existence of Church schools or pressing for state aid, the Church has been involved in this question as in no other political matter. The place which the school question occupies for the Church Hierarchy, the Catholic press, and Catholic Action groups has already been noted: it is the one political question on which all Catholic groups can take sides.<br>

  Book Title: Horror and Its Aftermath-Reconsidering Theology and Human Experience<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Stamper Sally<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology often brings psychology to bear on the contingent nature of human existence in relationship to God. In this volume, Sally Stamper articulates one modern trajectory of theological recourse to psychology (comprising Schleiermacher, Nietzsche, and Tillich) as the ground on which she brings clinical psychoanalytic theory and early childhood studies into conversation with fundamental questions about the relationship of God to human suffering and its remediation. She develops her argument from the assertions that human experience evolves within an awareness of human vulnerability to profound suffering and that insight into consequent human anxiety is a powerful resource for soteriology, eschatology, and theological anthropology. Stamper narrates this “normative anxiety" by integrating object relations theories of early childhood development and critical readings of literary texts for young children. She gestures toward a new eschatological vision that poses the radical otherness of a transcendent God as key to divine remediation of human suffering, in the process building on Marilyn McCord Adams’s soteriological response to human horror-participation and on Jonathan Lear’s assertion of radical hope in response to catastrophic collapse of cultural resources for making meaning.<br>

  Abstract: One of the most haunting theological questions, for believers and theologians alike, asks how we can account for a loving, omniscient, and omnipotent divine creator, given the evil and concomitant suffering that are contingencies of human existence. The broad form of the problem is reflected in a host of specific observations: What kind of God commands a faithful follower to sacrifice his son? How can just people reconcile their proclamation of a just and merciful God with the God who hardens Pharaoh’s heart, ultimately to the point of imposing the death of all firstborns as one of the plagues used<br>

  Abstract: The relationship between anthropology and history is one of inequality. This is no less so for the relationship between anthropology and microhistory. History, one of the noble disciplines in the “history” of Western thought, has as an emblem the muse, Clio. Anthropology has anyone who at times is everyone, at times someone, so often nameless and unvoiced. In their relationship, anthropology is the junior partner, a Johnny-come-lately to the professional telling of pastness within intellectual worlds whose denizens believe in the existence and importance of the time-depths of history, probably since these also are perceived as the sources of knowledge.<br>

This is the so-called ‘argument from evil’ – the term ‘evil’ being used here as shorthand for the existence of pain and suffering. We briefly referred to this argument in Chapter One: the indisputable fact that an innocent child dies of cancer is, so the atheist argues, incompatible with any notion of God as an omnipotent and benevolent being.¹ Any counter theistic attempt to resolve this alleged incompatibility is, to borrow a term from the German philosopher, Gottfried Leibniz (1648-1716), technically known as a<br>

Historically, how the experiences are named determined the types of treatment that were deemed to be appropriate.

  Book Title: The Atheist's Primer-  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Palmer Michael<br>
  Abstract: In The Atheist's Primer, a prominent philosopher, Dr Michael Palmer, reinstates the importance of philosophy in the debate about God's existence. The 'new atheism' of Richard Dawkins and others has been driven by largely Darwinian objections to God's existence, limiting the debate to within a principally scientific framework. This has obscured the philosophical tradition of atheism, in which the main intellectual landmarks in atheism's history are to be found. With an analysis of atheistic thought from the Ancient Greeks to the present day, Palmer explains and comments on the philosophical arguments warranting atheism, discussing issues such as evil, morality, miracles, and the motivations for belief. The emphasis placed on materialism and the limitations of our knowledge might seem disheartening to some; but Palmer concludes on a positive note, arguing – alongside Nietzsche, Marx and Freud and many others – that happiness and personal fulfilment are to be found in the very materialism that religious belief rejects. Michael Palmer first addressed these issues in his student-oriented edition, The Atheist's Creed, of which The Atheist's Primer is a revised abridgement for the general reader. Palmer has now stripped out the primary texts and expanded his commentaries into fluent and concise analyses of the arguments.

  An Atheistic Critique from:

  Author(s) Palmer Michael<br>
  Abstract: The existence of evil in the world is regarded by most atheists as the principal objection to the existence of God, called by the Roman Catholic theologian Hans Küng the ‘rock of atheism’. By ‘evil’ is meant the fact of pain and suffering and the ‘problem’ that it poses for religious belief is not hard to see. How can evil exist in a world created by an omnipotent and omni-benevolent God? For the positive atheist this question exposes an insuperable inconsistency within religious belief, thereby invalidating the claim that any God exists. Nor, I should add, is discussion confined to<br>

  Author(s) Bouma-Prediger Steven<br>
  Abstract: Previously, we have argued that all of creation, and humanity itself, is brought into being as a gift, its origins lying in the hospitable and ecstatic actions of the loving Triune God. However, distorted by our own desire to live
                     distantlyandseparatelyand therefore cut off from the life of this divinecommunion, humanity becomes fearful ofotherness. The Other is no longer perceived as one who comes offering joy, enrichment and mutual beneficence, but rather as a threat to our existence, one to be struggled against and overcome. Fear erupts into violence, hospitality gives way to hostility.<br>

  Abstract: “Metaphysics begins with the ancient Greeks as a philosophical doctrine of the one God.”¹ This sentence—assigning metaphysics and theology—is far from self-evident. The sentence, on the one hand, states that metaphysics and theology are neighborly disciplines and that theology necessarily needs metaphysics; on the other hand, the existence of metaphysics implies theology has been a valid enterprise for as long a time.
                  Postmodern thinking, however, is handling this compilation with caution. Dealing with metaphysics after the Enlightenment and the linguistic turn is a difficult affair. In this regard, one perspective for understanding metaphysics is to consider metaphysical structures<br>

Concerned that the paths pointed to by these questions will lead many back to the safety and security of an onto-theological approach, Boeve asserts that, notwithstanding the risks, we must follow where this methodology leads.

  Book Title: Ancestral Memory in Early China-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Brashier K. E.<br>
  Abstract: Ancestral ritual in early China was an orchestrated dance between what was present (the offerings and the living) and what was absent (the ancestors). The interconnections among the tangible elements of the sacrifice were overt and almost mechanical, but extending those connections to the invisible guests required a medium that was itself invisible. Thus in early China, ancestral sacrifice was associated with focused thinking about the ancestors, with a structured mental effort by the living to reach out to the absent forebears and to give them shape and existence. Thinking about the ancestors—about those who had become distant—required active deliberation and meditation, qualities that had to be nurtured and learned. This study is a history of the early Chinese ancestral cult, particularly its cognitive aspects. Its goals are to excavate the cult’s color and vitality and to quell assumptions that it was no more than a simplistic and uninspired exchange of food for longevity, of prayers for prosperity. Ancestor worship was not, the author contends, merely mechanical and thoughtless. Rather, it was an idea system that aroused serious debates about the nature of postmortem existence, served as the religious backbone to Confucianism, and may even have been the forerunner of Daoist and Buddhist meditation practices.<br>

  Author(s): GREFFE Xavier<br>
  Abstract: Le patrimoine culturel n’est pas qu’une simple trace du passé. Il est le lieu où se rencontrent et s’hybrident les expériences et les valeurs des uns et des autres ; il est rhizome. Au-delà de son existence en soi, il tire sa valeur des différents usages que l’on peut en faire, voire des liens qu’il permet de tisser entre les personnes et les communautés. Il ne s’agit plus seulement de l’identifier et de le préserver coûte que coûte, mais de le mettre en scène au bénéfice des objets comme des sujets. Examinant cette interdépendance croissante entre mémoires, pratiques et expériences, l’auteur analyse le fonctionnement du patrimoine culturel selon trois perspectives, soit la délimitation de son champ, ses représentations et les valeurs que l’on en retire. Exposant le flottement du patrimoine culturel entre devise d’identité et levier de développement, il montre l’équilibre qu’il faut rechercher entre un arrêt sur image qui pourrait déboucher sur la fétichisation de l’objet et une fuite en avant qui ­tarirait son potentiel en création.<br>

                  Royal Commentaries(1609) have enjoyed enormous acclaim from readers since their first appearance at the beginning of the seventeenth century.¹ The existence of numerous translations into most modern languages proves their success in Europe. Several factors explain this fact: the socioethnic background of the author, the literary quality of the work, the nature of the sources consulted for its composition, and the fact that until late into the nineteenth century it would remain the only published text solely dedicated to the topic of Incan history.

  Book Title: Indebted-Capitalism and Religion in the Writings of S. Y. Agnon<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Sagiv Yonatan<br>
  Abstract: This is the first book to examine the oeuvre of Shmuel Yosef Agnon, 1966 Nobel laureate in literature, through a reading that combines perspectives from economic theory, semiotics, psychoanalysis, narrative theory, and Jewish and religious studies. Sagiv outlines the vital role economy plays in the construction of religion, subjectivity, language, and thought in Agnon's work, and, accordingly, explores his literary use of images of debt, money, and economy to examine how these themes illuminate other focal points in the canonical author's work, excavating the economic infrastructure of discourses that are commonly considered to reside beyond the economic sphere.Sagiv's analysis of Agnon's work, renowned for its paradoxical articulation of the impact of modernity on traditional Jewish society, exposes an overarching distrust regarding the sustainability of any economic structure. The concrete and symbolic economies surveyed in this project are prone to cyclical crises. Under what Sagiv terms Agnon's "law of permanent debt," the stability and profitability of economies are always temporary. Agnon's literary economy, transgressing traditional closures, together with his profound irony, make it impossible to determine if these economic crises are indeed the product of the break with tradition or, alternatively, if this theodicy is but a fantasy, marking permanent debt as the inherent economic infrastructure of human existence.<br>

  Book Title: Transcendence and the Concrete-Selected Writings<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Moore Ian Alexander<br>
  Abstract: Jean Wahl (1888GÇô1974), once considered by the likes of Georges Bataille, Gilles Deleuze, Emmanuel Levinas, and Gabriel Marcel to be among the greatest French philosophers, has today nearly been forgotten outside France. Yet his influence on French philosophical thought can hardly be overestimated. Levinas wrote that GÇ£during over a half century of teaching and research, [Wahl] was the life force of the academic, extra-academic, and even, to a degree anti-academic philosophy necessary to a great culture.GÇ¥ And Deleuze, for his part, commented that GÇ£Apart from Sartre, who remained caught none the less in the trap of the verb to be, the most important philosopher in France was Jean Wahl.GÇ¥_x000D_ Besides engaging with the likes of Bataille, Bergson, Deleuze, Derrida, Levinas, Maritain, and Sartre, Wahl also played a significant role, in some cases almost singlehandedly, in introducing French philosophy to movements like existentialism, and American pragmatism and literature, and thinkers like Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Jaspers, and Heidegger. Yet Wahl was also an original philosopher and poet in his own right. This volume of selections from WahlGÇÖs philosophical writings makes a selection of his most important work available to the English-speaking philosophical community for the first time._x000D_ Jean Wahl was Professor of Philosophy at the Sorbonne from 1936 to 1967, save during World War II, which he spent in the United States, having escaped from the Drancy internment camp. His books to appear in English include The Pluralist Philosophies of England and America (Open Court, 1925), The Philosopher's Way (Oxford UP, 1948), A Short History of Existentialism (Philosophical Library, 1949), and Philosophies of Existence (Schocken, 1969).<br>

  Abstract: Saint Anselm is the only philosopher of the Middle Ages whom Hegel discusses seriously in his lectures on the history of philosophy and his lectures on the philosophy of religion.¹ There are two main reasons for Hegel’s interest:1. In contrast to those of his colleagues in theology and philosophy who proclaim at every turn that the human mind cannot know God, let alone prove his existence, Hegel agrees with Anselm that genuine faith not merely pennits but requires the believer to seek to understand what he believes. 2.

  Abstract: Archaeologists routinely consider artefacts in relation to other artefacts and use relationships of similarity and difference to create typologies and organise material culture into chronological or geographical entities (Jones 2007, 143). In this paper I propose instead to focus on the relationship between artefacts and people and ask whether different material assemblages reflect differently embodied lives in Early Bronze Age Cyprus (EBA hereafter) (on the existence of embodied individuals in prehistory and a review of the literature, see Knapp and van Dommelen 2008 and Knapp 2010).<br>

  Abstract: The enigma of the work of modern art is also the name for its constitutive character. The character of this self-contradicting existence is what makes the work of art into the occasion for a baffling and befuddling encounter. The complement to enigma in the work of art is its truth content. Key to engaging the work of art’s enigma and truth content is the mimetic relation between experience and the work of art. The misalignment between the work of art and human experience is an opportunity for encountering what exists as objective contradiction. The ongoing dance between the mimetic misalignments<br>

  Abstract: All scientific work starts with some simplification of basic concepts. Once these have been defined and established, we begin to pile up empirical variations. During this process, the simplifying notions are modified and, eventually, they may disappear. For example, economics assumes scarcity, and hence the need to rationalize and economize; politics presupposes the existence of struggles to maximize power; and sociology insists upon the necessity of social solidarity. Taking our cue from the etymology of socius , sociology is the science of companionship or friendship. For social science as a whole, civil society is the space in which these somewhat<br>

  Book Title: Placing Aesthetics-Reflections on the Philosophic Tradition<br>
  Publisher: Ohio University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wood Robert E.<br>
  Abstract: Examining select high points in the speculative tradition from Plato and Aristotle through the Middle Ages and German tradition to Dewey and Heidegger,
      Placing Aestheticsseeks to locate the aesthetic concern within the larger framework of each thinker's philosophy.In Professor Robert Wood's study, aesthetics is not peripheral but rather central to the speculative tradition and to human existence as such. In Dewey's terms, aesthetics is "experience in its integrity." Its personal ground is in "the heart," which is the dispositional ground formed by genetic, cultural , and personal historical factors by which we are spontaneously moved and, in turn, are inclined to move, both practically and theoretically, in certain directions.Prepared for use by the student as well as the philosopher,Placing Aestheticsaims to recover the fullness of humanness within a sense of the fullness of encompassing Being. It attempts to overcome the splitting of thought, even in philosophy, into exclusive specializations and the fracturing of life itself into theoretical, practical, and emotive dimensions.<br>

  Abstract: The first full-length monograph to address the impact that Celtic-Tiger immigration has exerted on the poetry, drama and fiction of contemporary Irish writersNow available in paperback, this pioneering collection of essays deals with the topic of how Irish literature responds to the presence of non-Irish immigrants in Celtic-Tiger and post-Celtic-Tiger Ireland. The book assembles an international group of 18 leading and prestigious academics in the field of Irish studies from both sides of the Atlantic, including Declan Kiberd, Anne Fogarty and Maureen T. Reddy, amongst others. Key areas of discussion are: what does it mean to be ‘multicultural’ and what are the implications of this condition for contemporary Irish writers? How has literature in Ireland responded to inward migration? Have Irish writers reflected in their work (either explicitly or implicitly) the existence of migrant communities in Ireland? If so, are elements of Irish traditional culture and community maintained or transformed? What is the social and political efficacy of these intercultural artistic visions?<br>

As such, his work has spawned an enormous literature. Among theologians, however, he is best known for his classic work

  Book Title: Agitations-Essays on Life and Literature<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Krystal Arthur<br>
  Abstract: We disagree. From small questions of taste to large questions concerning the nature of existence, intellectual debate takes up much of our time. In this book the respected literary critic Arthur Krystal examines what most commentators ignore: the role of temperament and taste in the forming of aesthetic and ideological opinions. In provocative essays about reading and writing, about the relation between life and literature, about knowledge and certainty, about God and death, and about his own gradual disaffection with the literary scene, Krystal demonstrates that opposing points of view are based more on innate predilections than on disinterested thought or analysis.Not beholden to any fashionable theory or political agenda, Krystal interrogates the usual suspects in the cultural wars from an independent, though not impartial, vantage point. Clearly personal and unabashedly belletrist, his essays ask important questions. What makes culture one thing and not another? What inspires aesthetic values? What drives us to make comparisons? And how does a bias for one kind of evidence as opposed to another contribute to the form and content of intellectual argument?<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nq906">Agitations</a><br>
  Abstract: Writers are different from other people. Not all writers—not those who write only for wages—but the poets, novelists, and essayists who believe they have no choice in the matter, who feel no less compelled to write than to think, and who therefore receive the continuing news of their existence as potential lines on a page. For them, what happens happens in order to be turned into verse or prose. And so literature itself may be understood as sheer ego channeled into print, undertaken with the perfect conviction that experience is concluded only upon being written down.<br>

  Book Title: The God of All Flesh-and Other Essays<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hanson K.C.<br>
  Abstract: Biblical faith is passionately and relentlessly material in its emphasis. This claim is rooted in the conviction that the creator God loves the creation and summons creation to be in sync with the will of the creator God. This collection of essays is focussed on the bodily life of the world as it ordered in all of its problematic political and economic forms. The phrase of the title “all flesh" in the flood narrative of Genesis 9 refers to all living creatures who are in covenant with God – human beings, animals, birds, and fish – as recipients of God’s grace, as dependent upon God’s generosity, and as destined for praise and obedience to God. The insistence on the materiality of life as the subject of the Bible means that the difficult issues of economics and the demanding questions of politics are front and centre in the text. So the Pentateuch pivots around the Exodus narrative and the emancipation from an unbearable context of abusive labour practices. In a similar manner, the prophets endlessly address such questions of social policy and the wisdom teachers reflect on how to manage the material things of life and social relationships for the well-being of the community. This emphasis, pervasive in these essays, is a powerful alternative and a strong resistance against all of the contemporary efforts to transcend (escape!) the material into some form of the “spiritual". All around us are efforts to find an easier, more harmonious faith. This may be evoked simply because of a desire to shield economic, political advantage from the inescapable critique of biblical faith. Such a temptation is a serious misreading of the Bible and a critical misjudgment about the nature of human existence. Thus the Bible addressed the most urgent issues of our day, and refuses the “religious temptation" that avoids lived reality where the power of God is a work.<br>

  Author(s) Brueggemann Walter<br>
  Abstract: Old Testament traditions are, of course, dominated by the self-conscious, intentional self-presentation of Israel as a peculiar people in the midst of many other peoples, the existence of which is also acknowledged. That self-presentation as a peculiar people is said to have a theological grounding as the chosen people of Yahweh (as in Deut 7:6–7; 9:4–5; 14:2), an affirmation variously articulated but assumed and traded upon widely in the tradition. That theological claim, moreover, is at the same time to be understood as an instrument of social construction, no doubt fostered and enhanced through intentional social practice.¹<br>

For Jaspers’Psychology, the main emphasis lies on the individual’s spiritual counter-reaction to the experience of limit situations, which leaves the overall status of the situations unclear.

Such critics have also taken for granted Vynnychenko’s orientation towards Ukraine, focusing on hardships of his displacement. They have referred to his time abroad as “difficult” (Doroshkevych, 219), as a “miserable existence” (Richytsky, 11) and, in the Soviet time in a more ideological vein, as part of an “emigrant rubbish heap” (Shabliovsky, 48).

However, such a distinctive definition of eroticism seems to be compromised by the concept of pornography, which, at least over the last fifteen years, is increasingly thought to circumscribe the same semantic space.¹ This confirms that the concept of eroticism is highly subjective as it depends on a moral judgment, which, by virtue of its very existence, makes the theoretical use of the former concept unstable.

Or on the contrary have recent gains in human life expectancy been instead a prolongation of decrepitude, frailty, and a meaningless existence? No topic seems less promising for productive public debate than a discussion about the “meaning of life.” Talk about “meaning” is notoriously difficult and divisive.

  Publisher: University Press of Colorado<br>
  Author(s): Jiménez Gabina Aurora Pérez<br>
  Abstract: The Mixtec, or the people of Savi ("Nation of the Rain God"), one of the major civilizations of ancient Mesoamerica, made their home in the highlands of Oaxaca, where they resisted both Aztec military expansion and the Spanish conquest. This book presents and interprets the sacred histories narrated in the Mixtec codices, the largest surviving collection of pre-Columbian manuscripts in existence. In these screenfold books, ancient painter-historians chronicled the politics of the Mixtec from approximately a.d. 900 to 1521, portraying the royal families, rituals, wars, alliances, and ideology of the times. By analyzing and cross-referencing the codices, which have been fragmented and dispersed in far-flung archives, the authors attempt to reconstruct Mixtec history. Adding useful interpretation and commentary, Jansen and Perez Jimenez synthesize the large body of surviving documents into the first unified narrative of Mixtec sacred history.<br>

  Abstract: Any glance at the contemporary history of the world shows that the problem of evil is a central concern for people everywhere. In the last few years, terrorist attacks, suicide bombings, and ethnic and religious wars have only emphasized humanity's seemingly insatiable capacity for violence. In Feminist Philosophy and the Problem of Evil, Robin May Schott brings an international group of contemporary feminist philosophers into debates on evil and terrorism. The invaluable essays collected here consider gender-specific evils such as the Salem witch trials, women's suffering during the Holocaust, mass rape in Bosnia, and repression under the Taliban, as well as more generalized acts of violence such as the 9/11 bombings, the Madrid train station bombings, and violence against political prisoners. Readers of this sobering volume will find resources for understanding the vulnerability of human existence and what is at stake in the problem of evil.<br>

  Abstract: Like Martin Heidegger, like many of us, Calvin Schrag has had a theological point of departure. His earliest work,
                  Existence and Freedom, published some forty years ago, undertook one of the first important confrontations of Heidegger and Kierkegaard in English. 1 Schrag understood that a great deal of Continental philosophy originated in the decision made by Kierkegaard to expose philosophy to biblical categories, on the premise that if the categories of Greek philosophy are all we have, then the poor existing individual is lost. It was in no small part from that decision that Heidegger’sBeing and Timeemerged, and<br>

  Abstract: Mythic reality is a strange and ethereal one, one of those few places in the human social universe unconstrained by the limits of time. Whether we embrace the functionalism of the Polish British fieldworker Bronislaw Malinowski or the structuralism of the great French theorist Claude Lévi-Strauss, myth is eternal, as it is designed to be. Its source and its power are both attributable to that particular, enduring capacity of myth to transcend time: mythic narrative creates, sustains, and maneuvers the very origin of our existence.

  Abstract: The Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY) came to power in 1945 but, after a short period of close cooperation with the USSR, Yugoslavia was expelled from the Soviet bloc in 1948. This event conditioned much of the development of Yugoslav society over the following decades. In its cultural policy, the relationship between the CPY’s proclaimed socialist ideals and allowing for flexibility and change remained ambiguous throughout the years of the existence of the state. This chapter is specifically concerned with examining official policy towards literature in Yugoslavia, the kind of political and social engagement that was required of literature and<br>

  Abstract: Although many anthropologists would not even accept the existence of a deep unconscious such as outlined by psychoanalytic theory of various persuasions, the ethnographic data often provide examples of cultural constructs that seem such vivid realisations of themes described in psychoanalytic practice that one can only stand amazed. If there is no ʹunconsciousʹ, from whence do these extraordinary visions emerge and how is it they have such constancy across cultures? In this chapter, I employ Melanie Kleinʹs work on gender, fantasy and psychosocial development as a framework for comparing Balinese and Ilahita imaginings of the feminine and the maternal.<br>

The anthropological turn of modernity, for the sake of pursuing more pressing matters or more deceivingly fundamental issues, presumed that severing the question of God from the inquiry into the human being’s own identity would give wings to the quest for knowledge. Instead, as postmodernity witnesses, this too-often rated “successful” revolution has yielded a radical dissolution of any unifying principle and thus, of man himself.<br>

  Book Title: In Search of the Good Life-A Pedogogy for Troubled Times<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): DALLMAYR FRED<br>
  Abstract: The great German novelist Thomas Mann implored readers to resist the persistent and growing militarism of the mid-twentieth century. To whom should we turn for guidance during this current era of global violence, political corruption, economic inequality, and environmental degradation? For more than two millennia, the world's great thinkers have held that the ethically "good life" is the highest purpose of human existence. Renowned political philosopher Fred Dallmayr traces the development of this notion, finding surprising connections among Aristotelian ethics, Abrahamic and Eastern religious traditions, German idealism, and postindustrial social criticism. In Search of the Good Life does not offer a blueprint but rather invites readers on a cross-cultural quest. Along the way, the author discusses the teachings of Aristotle, Confucius, Nicolaus of Cusa, Leibniz, and Schiller, in addition invoking more recent writings of Gadamer and Ricoeur, as guideposts and sources of hope during our troubled times. Among contemporary themes Dallmayr discusses are the role of the classics in education, proper and improper ways of spreading democracy globally, the possibility of transnational citizenship, the problem of politicized evil, and the role of religion in our predominantly secular culture. Dallmayr restores the notion of the good life as a hallmark of personal conduct, civic virtue, and political engagement, and as the road map to enduring peace. In Search of the Good Life seeks to arouse complacent and dispirited citizens, guiding them out of the distractions of shallow amusements and perilous resentments in the direction of mutual learning and civic pedagogy -- a direction that will enable them to impose accountability on political leaders who stray from fundamental ethical standards.<br>

After identifying the need for a legitimate philosophical approach to Israelite religion, the volume traces the history of interdisciplinary relations and shows how descriptive varieties of philosophy of religion can aid the clarification of the Hebrew Bible’s own metaphysical, epistemological, and moral assumptions. Two new interpretative methodologies are developed and subsequently applied through an introduction to what the biblical texts took for granted about the nature of religious language, the concept of deity, the properties of Yhwh, the existence of gods, religious epistemology, and the relation between religion and morality.<br>

  Book Title: Shattered Voices-Language, Violence, and the Work of Truth Commissions<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Phelps Teresa Godwin<br>
  Abstract: Following periods of mass atrocity and oppression, states are faced with a question of critical importance in the transition to democracy: how to offer redress to victims of the old regime without perpetuating cycles of revenge. Traditionally, balance has been restored through arrests, trials, and punishment, but in the last three decades, more than twenty countries have opted to have a truth commission investigate the crimes of the prior regime and publish a report about the investigation, often incorporating accounts from victims. Although many praise the work of truth commissions for empowering and healing through words rather than violence, some condemn the practice as a poor substitute for traditional justice, achieved through trials and punishment. There has been until now little analysis of the unarticulated claim that underlies the truth commissions' very existence: that language-in this case narrative stories-can substitute for violence. Acknowledging revenge as a real and deep human need,
      Shattered Voicesexplores the benefits and problems inherent when a fragile country seeks to heal its victims without risking its own future. In developing a theory about the role of language in retribution, Teresa Godwin Phelps takes an interdisciplinary approach, delving into sources from Greek tragedy toHamlet, from Kant to contemporary theories about retribution, from the Babylonian law codes to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Report. She argues that, given the historical and psychological evidence about revenge, starting afresh by drawing a bright line between past crimes and a new government is both unrealistic and unwise. When grievous harm happens, a rebalancing is bound to occur, whether it is orderly and lawful or disorderly and unlawful.Shattered Voicescontends that language is requisite to any adequate balancing, and that a solution is viable only if it provides an atmosphere in which storytelling and subsequent dialogue can flourish.

  Book Title: Dreams of Fiery Stars-The Transformations of Native American Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Rainwater Catherine<br>
  Abstract: Selected by
      Choicemagazine as an Outstanding Academic Book for 1999 Since the 1968 publication of N. Scott Momaday'sHouse Made of Dawn, a new generation of Native American storytellers has chosen writing over oral traditions. While their works have found an audience by observing many of the conventions of the mainstream novel, Native American written narrative has emerged as something distinct from the postmodern novel with which it is often compared. InDreams of Fiery Stars, Catherine Rainwater examines the novels of writers such as Momaday, Linda Hogan, Leslie Marmon Silko, Gerald Vizenor, and Louise Erdrich and contends that the very act of writing narrative imposes constraints upon these authors that are foreign to Native American tradition. Their works amount to a break with-and a transformation of-American Indian storytelling. The book focuses on the agenda of social and cultural regeneration encoded in contemporary Native American narrative, and addresses key questions about how these works achieve their overtly stated political and revisionary aims. Rainwater explores the ways in which the writers "create" readers who understand the connection between storytelling and personal and social transformation; considers how contemporary Native American narrative rewrites Western notions of space and time; examines the existence of intertextual connections between Native American works; and looks at the vital role of Native American literature in mainstream society today.<br>

  Book Title: The Archaeology of Class War-The Colorado Coalfield Strike of 1913-1914<br>
  Publisher: University Press of Colorado<br>
  Author(s): McGuire Randall H.<br>
  Abstract: The Archaeology of the Colorado Coalfield War Project has conducted archaeological investigations at the site of the Ludlow Massacre in Ludlow, Colorado, since 1996. With the help of the United Mine Workers of America and funds from the Colorado State Historical Society and the Colorado Endowment for the Humanities, the scholars involved have integrated archaeological finds with archival evidence to show how the everyday experiences of miners and their families shaped the strike and its outcome.The Archaeology of Class War weaves together material culture, documents, oral histories, landscapes, and photographs to reveal aspects of the strike and life in early twentieth-century Colorado coalfields unlike any standard documentary history. Excavations at the site of the massacre and the nearby town of Berwind exposed tent platforms, latrines, trash dumps, and the cellars in which families huddled during the attack. Myriad artifacts—from canning jars to a doll’s head—reveal the details of daily existence and bring the community to life.The Archaeology of Class War will be of interest to archaeologists, historians, and general readers interested in mining and labor history.<br>

  Book Title: Moral Evil-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Flescher Andrew Michael<br>
  Abstract: The idea of moral evil has always held a special place in philosophy and theology because the existence of evil has implications for the dignity of the human and the limits of human action. Andrew M. Flescher proposes four interpretations of evil, drawing on philosophical and theological sources and using them to trace through history the moral traditions that are associated with them.The first model, evil as the presence of badness, offers a traditional dualistic model represented by Manicheanism. The second, evil leading to goodness through suffering, presents a theological interpretation known as theodicy. Absence of badness-that is, evil as a social construction-is the third model. The fourth, evil as the absence of goodness, describes when evil exists in lieu of the good-the "privation" thesis staked out nearly two millennia ago by Christian theologian St. Augustine. Flescher extends this fourth model-evil as privation-into a fifth, which incorporates a virtue ethic. Drawing original connections between Augustine and Aristotle, Flescher's fifth model emphasizes the formation of altruistic habits that can lead us to better moral choices throughout our lives.Flescher eschews the temptation to think of human agents who commit evil as outside the norm of human experience. Instead, through the honing of moral skills and the practice of attending to the needs of others to a greater degree than we currently do, Flescher offers a plausible and hopeful approach to the reality of moral evil.<br>

  Abstract: The idea of moral evil has always held a special place in philosophical and theological systems of thought because the existence of evil has implications for the dignity with which and the limits within which we act. Moral culpability is made possible by our ability to choose to do terrible things or to refrain from doing good things. Philosophically, the categories of moral praiseworthiness and blameworthiness depend on the prospect of our being able to act or not act one way when we have the capacity to act otherwise. Theologically, the whole point to being humans made in God’s image<br>

  Book Title: Theorizing Scriptures-New Critical Orientations to a Cultural Phenomenon<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): WIMBUSH VINCENT L.<br>
  Abstract: Historically, religious scriptures are defined as holy texts that are considered to be beyond the abilities of the layperson to interpret. Their content is most frequently analyzed by clerics who do not question the underlying political or social implications of the text, but use the writing to convey messages to their congregations about how to live a holy existence. In Western society, moreover, what counts as scripture is generally confined to the Judeo-Christian Bible, leaving the voices of minorities, as well as the holy texts of faiths from Africa and Asia, for example, unheard. In this innovative collection of essays that aims to turn the traditional bible-study definition of scriptures on its head, Vincent L. Wimbush leads an in-depth look at the social, cultural, and racial meanings invested in these texts. Contributors hail from a wide array of academic fields and geographic locations and include such noted academics as Susan Harding, Elisabeth Shnssler Fiorenza, and William L. Andrews. Purposefully transgressing disciplinary boundaries, this ambitious book opens the door to different interpretations and critical orientations, and in doing so, allows an ultimately humanist definition of scriptures to emerge.<br>

  Abstract: After Representation?explores one of the major issues in Holocaust studiesùthe intersection of memory and ethics in artistic expression, particularly within literature.As experts in the study of literature and culture, the scholars in this collection examine the shifting cultural contexts for Holocaust representation and reveal how writersùwhether they write as witnesses to the Holocaust or at an imaginative distance from the Nazi genocideùarticulate the shadowy borderline between fact and fiction, between event and expression, and between the condition of life endured in atrocity and the hope of a meaningful existence. What imaginative literature brings to the study of the Holocaust is an ability to test the limits of language and its conventions.After Representation?moves beyond the suspicion of representation and explores the changing meaning of the Holocaust for different generations, audiences, and contexts.<br>

  Abstract: Le premier défi de la démocratie est de donner le «goût de l'avenir» (Alexis de Tocqueville), de générer l'enthousiasme qui poussera les jeunes d'esprit à progresser d'eux-mêmes vers de nouvelles quêtes de sens et de savoir, à renouveler peut-être surtout, dans le contexte des nouvelles connaissances et d'une prise de conscience accrue des richesses des différentes cultures, les questions que l'on appelle «ultimes et les plus hautes», pour citer Husserl, celles que la science exclut par principe et qui sont pourtant «les questions les plus brûlantes», portant «sur le sens ou sur l'absence de sens de toute cette existence humaine». Le simple mot

Une éducation qui exclurait, comme tranchées d'avance, ces questions ultimes, ne serait nullement à la hauteur de l'humain. Les essais composant ce livre explorent six d'entre elles, à savoir la dignité humaine, l'intelligence, la liberté, le bonheur, la mort et la beauté.<br>

Epistemology, another fundamental branch of philosophy, is intimately tied to metaphysics because it deals with the nature of knowledge: to talk about what is, one must speak of knowing what is, just as one cannot know something is without also positing that it is. The central questions of metaphysics are, What is it? and How is it? and they necessarily involve, How do I know this? or Can I know that?

  Book Title: Dark Writing-Geography, Performance, Design<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Carter Paul<br>
  Abstract: We do not see empty figures and outlines; we do not move in straight lines. Everywhere we are surrounded by dapple; the geometry of our embodied lives is curviform, meandering, bi-pedal. Our personal worlds are timed, inter-positional, and contingent. But nowhere in the language of cartography and design do these ordinary experiences appear. This, Dark Writing argues, is a serious omission because they are designs on the world: architects and colonizers use their lines to construct the places where we will live. But the rectilinear streets, squares, and public spaces produced in this way leave out people and the entire environmental history of their coming together. How, this book asks, can we explain the omission of bodies from maps and plans? And how can we redraw the lines maps and plans use so that the qualitative world of shadows, footprints, comings and goings, and occasions—all essential qualities of places that incubate sociality—can be registered? In short, Dark Writing asks why we represent the world as static when our experience of it is mobile. It traces this bias in Enlightenment cartography, in inductive logic, and in contemporary place design. This is the negative critique. Its positive argument is that, when we look closely at these designs on the world, we find traces of a repressed movement form. Even the ideal lines of geometrical figures turn out to contain traces of earlier passages; and there are many forms of graphic design that do engage with the dark environment that surrounds the light of reason. How can this "dark writing"—so important to reconfiguring our world as a place of meeting, of co-existence and sustaining diversity—be represented? And how, therefore, can our representations of the world embody more sensuously the mobile histories that have produced it? Dark Writing answers these questions using case studies: the exemplary case of the beginnings of the now world-famous Papunya Tula Painting Movement (Central Australia) and three h~<br>

  Abstract: Considerations of center and periphery in Heian Japan involve at the highest level the relationship between the central political apparatus and the hinterlands, the sixty-six provinces and two islands (Iki and Tsushima) that constituted the conceptualized polity. Indeed, the very existence of a state presupposes control over the human and material resources of the space thought to constitute the geographical area of that conceptualized state. This was never an easy task for Japanese rulers, despite the insular character of Japan that seems to lend itself to simple mapping of a discrete geopolitical entity.

The terms of the subject matter are themselves contested. To begin with, why ʺsurvivanceʺ rather than ʺsurvivalʺ? While ʺsurvivalʺ conjures images of a stark minimalist clinging at the edge of existence, survivance goes beyond mere survival to acknowledge the dynamic and creative nature of Indigenous rhetoric. But ʺsurvivanceʺ is the easiest of the three terms to explain. For what is meant by ʺrhetoricʺ? Are there multiple rhetorics?

For instance, Edward Casey’s comprehensive study of the philosophical history of place,The Fate of Place, gives precedence to place over space, suggesting that “to be at all—to exist in any way—is to be somewhere, and to be somewhere is to be in some kind of place” (ix). Because it is so central to our existence, place is often taken for granted and subsumed by the more dominant categories of space and time.

  Abstract: The term “liberalism” has always enjoyed a separate existence away from the constricting, formal, and austere world of political concepts and theories. To be liberal evokes generosity, tolerance, compassion, being fired up with the promise of open, unbounded spaces within which the free play of personality can be aired. Yet the clues to liberalism’s political nature are not hard to detect. Generosity suggests the dispensing of bounties beyond the call of duty—to prioritise justice as the first liberal virtue is unnecessarily reductionist. Tolerance suggests a flexibility, a movement, a diversity—of ideas, of language, and of conceptual content—that<br>

                  monism, or dualism.ʺ¹ Accordingly, the phrase ʺethical pluralismʺ might designate the simple existence of a diversity or plurality of ethical positions, or it might refer to a doctrine holding that ethics, as the systematic evaluation of human action, isin its natureincapable<br>

  Abstract: Philosophers are at a serious disadvantage when it comes to understanding politics, and it is a disadvantage that results from the very peculiarity of their special vocation and training. From almost the very beginning of its existence as a distinct activity, Western philosophy has been committed to certain principles of at least minimal self-awareness, clarity, coherence, and consistency of thought, speech, valuation, and action. Socrates, who notoriously took no part in city politics beyond what was strictly required of him by his obligations as a citizen, also started philosophy down the path of exhortation to

Yet the precedence of lived values over verbal ones need not destroy all hopes for a more humanistic society. It is conceivable that a different class might exist whose incarnated values are not inherently self-serving. A class might exist that in its very existence stands a chance at actualizing the as yet only ideal claims of the liberal tradition. The symmetrical solution to the problem of a class<br>

  Book Title: The Sense of the Universe-Philosophical Explication of Theological Commitment in Modern Cosmology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Nesteruk Alexei V.<br>
  Abstract: The Sense of the Universe deals with existential and phenomenological reflection upon modern cosmology with the aim to reveal hidden theological commitments in cosmology related to the mystery of human existence. The book proposes a new approach to the dialogue between science and theology based in a thorough philosophical analysis of acting forms of subjectivity involved in the study of the world and in religious experience. The uniqueness of this book is that it uses recent advances in phenomenological philosophy and philosophical theology in order to accentuate the existential meaning of cosmology as the discourse that ultimately explicates the human condition. The objective of the book is not to make a comparative analysis of the cosmological scientific narrative and that of the Bible, or the Fathers of the Church (in what concerns the structure of the universe), but to reveal the presence of a hidden theological dimension in cosmology originating in the God-given ability of humanity to discern and disclose the sense of creation. The book contributes to the synthesis of appropriation and incorporation of modern philosophical ideas in Christian theology, in particular its Eastern Orthodox form.<br>

As is often argued in current discussions on the theme, the adequate theological appropriation of the scientific approach to the study of the natural universe is possible only if nature and the universe are treated not as an “environment” for physical and biological existence, but as creation. This implies not only a dispassionate study of the universe which is contingent upon God,<br>

  Author(s) Mascall E. L.<br>
  Abstract: All the existentialists are united in their opposition to idealist philosophies which ignore space and time as necessary conditions of the human existence. In no way is the finiteness of the human creature more evident than in the fact that he must live an earthly existence, and, since things in time have a beginning and an end, that he must be subject to the mysteries of birth and death. Ignoring these fundamental facts, the idealists sought to transcend the time process by rational system and they imposed a rational pattern upon the course of historical events. In other words, they<br>

  Abstract: In his afterword to

First there is the type we can associate with one of the main subjects ofEither/Or, the aesthete known as A: an agent on some level aware of, and likely compelled by, the claims of the ethical existence-sphere, but who ultimately manages to avoid them through various devices of self-deception. According to MacIntyre, this ‘aesthete [. . .] is a divided self, on the surface [. . .] unable to move beyond immediacy, but in his unacknowledged secret depths already engaged with the ethical’ (2001: 348).<br>

  Abstract: A properly critical medical humanities is also a historically grounded medical humanities. Such historical grounding requires taking a long cultural perspective, going beyond traditional medical history – typically the history of disease, treatment and practice – to trace the origins and development of the ideas that underpin medicine in its broadest sense – ideas concerning the most fundamental aspects of human existence: health and illness, body and mind, gender and family, care and community.¹ Historical sources can only go so far in illuminating such topics; we must also look to other cultural texts, and in particular literary texts, which, through their imaginative worlds,<br>

  Abstract: Nietzsche’s simple definition of the reversal of Platonism is well-known. To reverse Platonism means that we value this world in itself, immanently, and no longer value it in relation to transcendent forms such as the Platonic idea of the good. In other words, the revaluation of existence means that existence is measured neither in terms of an origin from which existence might be said to have fallen nor in terms of an end toward which existence might be said to be advancing. More precisely, we must say that the reversal of Platonism means that the duration of existence has no<br>

  Abstract: Analytical philosophers in the twentieth century have produced a rich literature that includes the philosophy of religious language and practice, analyses of divine attributes, arguments for and against the existence of God, and arguments over the significance of religious diversity, religious experience, and religious values. Theists, atheists, agnostics, and adherents to both Christian and nonChristian religions have engaged in a fruitful exchange on these topics with all the hallmarks of analytical philosophy: an emphasis on conceptual clarity, the use of analyses with examples and counter-examples, concentrated arguments about whether concepts of what exists (God, the soul, the afterlife) may be<br>

  Abstract: In the period before CE 400, ancient India was home to a variety of self-governing polities using quasi-democratic institutions comparable with those of the Greek city-states of the same era. Indeed, Greek and Roman historians, relying on the reports of Greek visitors, did not hesitate to say that the India they knew was largely democratic. But although the evidence has been carefully analysed and the existence of a multitude of republics has long been established, these republics and the political culture that they represent are little known to anyone but specialists.

  Author(s) Boucher David<br>
  Abstract: Constructivism in political theory is opposed to both scepticism and foundationalism. Against the sceptic the constructivist hopes to defend the objectivity of at least some political principles. Against the foundationalist the constructivist hopes to show that the defence of objectivity need not appeal to any account of the necessary and unchanging foundations for moral reasoning. Evil has traditionally been seen in foundationalist terms, as a theological concept depending on the existence of God or as depending on some alternative scheme of absolute moral judgement, in order to mark out a special sort of wrongness.

That only leaves the present. But as long as the present has duration, any duration at all, it can be divided into the bits of it that have been, and so are not, and the bits of it that are to be, and so are not yet, so that the very duration of its existence consigns it to non-existence.

  Abstract: Mid-nineteenth-century portraits of Jesus were not as controversial in fiction as they were in realist painting. Whereas John Everett Millais, Nikolai Ge, and Édouard Manet broke with long-standing iconographic traditions, portraits of Jesus in fiction from the same time period were innovative, in large part, by the fact of their existence. Extended literary portraits are not a common feature of premodern imaginative retellings of gospel narrative. The life of Jesus, as the canonical gospels suggest, need not accommodate descriptions of the Christ image. In the 1830s and 1840s, authors of fiction began hesitantly to describe the body of Jesus thanks<br>

  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): Shaikh Saʿdiyya<br>
  Abstract: Thirteenth-century Sufi poet, mystic, and legal scholar Muhyi al-Din ibn al-'Arabi gave deep and sustained attention to gender as integral to questions of human existence and moral personhood. Reading his works through a critical feminist lens, Sa'diyya Shaikh opens fertile spaces in which new and creative encounters with gender justice in Islam can take place. Grounding her work in Islamic epistemology, Shaikh attends to the ways in which Sufi metaphysics and theology might allow for fundamental shifts in Islamic gender ethics and legal formulations, addressing wide-ranging contemporary challenges including questions of women's rights in marriage and divorce, the politics of veiling, and women's leadership of ritual prayer.Shaikh deftly deconstructs traditional binaries between the spiritual and the political, private conceptions of spiritual development and public notions of social justice, and the realms of inner refinement and those of communal virtue. Drawing on the treasured works of Sufism, Shaikh raises a number of critical questions about the nature of selfhood, subjectivity, spirituality, and society to contribute richly to the prospects of Islamic feminism as well as feminist ethics more broadly.<br>

  Abstract: An omnivoyant eye, a power from above, capable of encompassing by its constant gaze all life on earth and of simultaneously controlling and regulating with a most detailed perfection the existence of individuals, animals, plants, machines, institutions placed under its inspection: the myth of an omnivoyant and omnipotent center of surveillance has persisted, from Christian mystics of the late Middle Ages to nineteenth-century liberal utilitarians, from technocratic fictions (Orwell’s
                  1984) to some of the most recent global governance and planetary sustainability utopias (late-twentieth-century environmentalism). Jeremy Bentham first formulated¹ the myth and, later, Michel Foucault theorized it as a panoptic society.²<br>

  Abstract: Derrida’s short second chapter follows Husserl as he attempts to demonstrate that indication is not essential to expression. Indication must be “set aside, abstracted, and ’reduced’ ” (
                     SP, 28/29). Indication involves a unity of motivation, which Husserl defines as including logical demonstration as well as indication in the strict sense. This general account employs concepts (Sein, Bestand) broader than those appropriate to indication in the strict sense (Existenz, Dasein, Realität). The latter is distinguished from logical demonstration, which concerns not reality or real existence but idealities and ideal necessities.<br>

  Abstract: Evoking the hot, dust-filled Harmattan winds that blow from the Sahara to the Gulf of Guinea, this book creatively explores what it means to be buffeted by the unforeseen and the unknown. Celebrating the life-giving potential of people, places, and powers that lie beyond our established worlds,
      Harmattanconnects existential vitality to the act of resisting prescribed customs and questioning received notions of truth. At the book's heart is the fictional story of Tom Lannon, a graduate student from Cambridge University, who remains ambivalent about pursuing a conventional life. After traveling to Sierra Leone in the aftermath of its devastating civil war, Tom meets a writer who helps him explore the possibilities of renewal. Illustrating the fact that certain aspects of human existence are common to all people regardless of culture and history,Harmattanremakes the distinction between home and world and the relationship between knowledge and life.<br>

  Abstract: Onfray attacks Platonic idealism and its manifestation in Judaic, Christian, and Islamic belief. He warns of the lure of attachment to the purportedly eternal, immutable truths of idealism, which detracts from the immediacy of the world and our bodily existence. Insisting that philosophy is a practice that operates in a real, material space, Onfray enlists Epicurus and Democritus to undermine idealist and theological metaphysics; Nietzsche, Bentham, and Mill to dismantle idealist ethics; and Palante and Bourdieu to collapse crypto-fascist neoliberalism. In their place, he constructs a positive, hedonistic ethics that enlarges on the work of the New Atheists to promote a joyful approach to our lives in this, our only, world.<br>

  Author(s): Fernández María<br>
  Abstract: Since the colonial era, Mexican art has emerged from an ongoing process of negotiation between the local and the global, which frequently involves invention, synthesis, and transformation of diverse discursive and artistic traditions. In this pathfinding book, María Fernández uses the concept of cosmopolitanism to explore this important aspect of Mexican art, in which visual culture and power relations unite the local and the global, the national and the international, the universal and the particular. She argues that in Mexico, as in other colonized regions, colonization constructed power dynamics and forms of violence that persisted in the independent nation-state. Accordingly, Fernández presents not only the visual qualities of objects, but also the discourses, ideas, desires, and practices that are fundamental to the very existence of visual objects.<br>

  Book Title: Wicked Cinema-Sex and Religion on Screen<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): Cutrara Daniel S.<br>
  Abstract: From struggles over identity politics in the 1990s to current concerns about a clash of civilizations between Islam and Christianity, culture wars play a prominent role in the twenty-first century. Movies help to define and drive these conflicts by both reflecting and shaping cultural norms, as well as showing what violates those norms. In this pathfinding book, Daniel S. Cutrara employs queer theory, cultural studies, theological studies, and film studies to investigate how cinema represents and often denigrates religion and religious believers—an issue that has received little attention in film studies, despite the fact that faith in its varied manifestations is at the heart of so many cultural conflicts today.Wicked Cinema examines films from the United States, Europe, and the Middle East, including Crimes and Misdemeanors, The Circle, Breaking the Waves, Closed Doors, Agnes of God, Priest, The Last Temptation of Christ, and Dogma. Central to all of the films is their protagonists' struggles with sexual transgression and traditional belief systems within Christianity, Judaism, or Islam—a struggle, Cutrara argues, that positions believers as the Other and magnifies the abuses of religion while ignoring its positive aspects. Uncovering a hazardous web of ideological assumptions informed by patriarchy, the spirit/flesh dichotomy, and heteronormativity, Cutrara demonstrates that ultimately these films emphasize the "Otherness" of the faithful through a variety of strategies commonly used to denigrate the queer, from erasing their existence, to using feminization to make them appear weak, to presenting them as dangerous fanatics.<br>

  Abstract: The esoteric

Here Heidegger proposes that being takes place as "appropriation." Richard Polt's independent-minded account of theContributionsinterprets appropriation as an event of emergency that demands to be thought in a "future-subjunctive" mode. Polt explores the roots of appropriation in Heidegger's earlier philosophy; Heidegger's search for a way of thinking suited to appropriation; and the implications of appropriation for time, space, human existence, and beings as a whole. In his concluding chapter, Polt reflects critically on the difficulties of the radically antirationalist and antimodern thought of theContributions.<br>

Blumenberg argues for the existence of "absolute metaphors" that cannot be translated back into conceptual language. These metaphors answer the supposedly naïve, theoretically unanswerable questions whose relevance lies quite simply in the fact that they cannot be brushed aside, since we do not pose them ourselves but find them already posed in the ground of our existence. They leap into a void that concepts are unable to fill.<br>

Any such formalization of the judgment of happiness into a habitual practice, not arising from the initiative of the community but from the obligation of social custom, always risks undermining the very responsibility it seeks to instill, because it requires the performance of an action that is responsible only insofar as it is not compelled.

  Abstract: The analytical significance of time has long been recognized in the natural science writings of Galileo, Newton, and Einstein and in the philosophical tracts of Heidegger, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche, among others. Indeed an awareness of a past, a present, and a future, and of the finiteness of life are central features of human existence (Berger and Luckmann 1967). Human beings find meaning and identity in the temporal character of existence (Urry 1991, Collinson 2003). Yet it is only relatively recently that the importance of time has been acknowledged in theories of society (Giddens 1979, 1984, 1987; Adam 1990; Harvey 1990;<br>

  Book Title: Serbian Orthodox Fundamentals-The Quest for an Eternal Identity<br>

  Abstract: This book is a comprehensive exposition of the interaction of a national (the Serbian people) and a religiou (the Orthodox Christian faith) content, in the formation of a distinctive national identity and a mode of being. Its interdisciplinary approach, drawing on sociology, social anthropology, theology, political theory, Balkan historiography, and Serbian folklore, is deployed to provide a powerful and original analysis of how Serbian Orthodoxy has resulted in the sacralisation of the Serbian nation by framing the parameters of its existence. Addresses the following questions: what 'makes' a Serb? Are meaningful assumptions possible by introducing Serbian Orthodoxy as the primal point of reference? Why does religion appear to have an especially strong appeal?<br>

  Book Title: Imperfection and Defeat-The Role of Aesthetic Imagination in Human Society<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nemoianu Virgil<br>
  Abstract: Literature is defined in a challenging way as the "science" of imperfection and defeat, or else as a type of discourse that deals with defeat, loss, uncertainty in social life, by contrast with virtually all disciplines (hard sciences or social sciences) that affirm certainties and wish to convince us of truths. If in real history most constructive attempts end up in failure, it follows that we ought to have also a field of research that examines this diversity of failures and disappointments, as well as the alternative options to historical evolution and progress. Thus literature serves an indispensable role: that of gleaning the abundance of past existence, the gratuitous and the rejected being placed here on an equal level with the useful and the successful. This provocative and unusual approach is illustrated in chapters that deal with the dialectics between literary writing and such fields as historical writing, or religious discourses, and is also illustrated by the socio-historical development of East-Central Europe.<br>

Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: This latest book by France’s preeminent sociologist provides a compact presentation of his concerns, methods, and leading concepts. The book, first, engages in a sustained critique of the illusions that philosophy falls into when it ignores the historical, social, and economic conditions of its objects and its own existence. He is particularly concerned with the errors that arise from collapsing practical, embodied, everyday ways of knowing into theoretical models of knowledge, though he also criticizes forms of false universalism in morality and aesthetics, which ignore the empirical realities of differential distributions of economic and cultural capital and of access to the requisite dispositions and interests required for political and cultural participation. Second, the book provides a critique of current social‐scientific methodologies, while promoting Bourdieu’s preferred “reflexive realism,” intended to avoid both objectivism and relativism through a radical historicization of social‐scientific reason itself. Unfortunately, this section lacks the sustained, careful argumentation that philosophers of social science might wish for. Third, the last three—and strongest—chapters present Bourdieu’s leading concepts and basic social analyses: “habitus” as an agent’s embodied, affectively conditioned practical knowledge and dispositions; social space as differentiated into fields of symbolic struggle over cultural capital; the reproduction of social order through dialectical attunement between objective structures and habitus; and the symbolic violence arising from differential access to the means and sites for defining the categories and stakes of symbolic fields. The book will be an excellent introduction to Bourdieu’s fruitful thought for philosophers and social theorists.<br>

Author(s): Vidal Fernando<br>
Abstract: A second lesson might be called inspirational. The idea of resurrection participated in the political functions of hell.
         136Whether it is best considered, with Freud, as a symptom of a universal neurosis or, with Jankélévitch, as a form of the “hopeless optative,” it has played, for those who believe in it, an important existential role.137But political and psychological functions do not exhaust its historical meaning. Two millennia after its initial formulation, the Christian doctrine of the resurrection has a potential to question and to move that is more powerful and profound than considerations of wandering little fingers or hypothetical brain transplants. Resurrection discourses differ fundamentally from philosophical thought experiments.138Indeed, they were not seen as concerning fantastical situations from which apparently relevant conclusions could be extracted but as meaningful matters of momentous real consequences. One of them was the certainty that bodies are essential to humanity and that a disembodied self does not rank as a human being. Thus, while the neuropsychological eschatologies science and philosophy produced since the seventeenth century moved us away from the Middle Ages, our era’s questions and dilemmas about self and body take us back. In its own way, the Christian romance of the resurrection, with its assertion of the ontologically crucial place of body for identity and of community for human existence, may still be an inspiring story for those who, against the neurological reduction of self, would rather live with body, desire, history, and the other than inhabit the solitude of isolated brains.<br>

Abstract: Focusing on group style directs us to watch how people draw boundaries in everyday life, and in particular, highlights the boundaries that people draw between different group settings. The symbolic boundaries school could find fuel for new research in the situational boundaries we describe—boundaries between backstage and frontstage, or between groups—such as ACES and their urban protestor allies—that mark the boundaries precisely by enacting different group styles, for example. We argue that individuals might draw evaluative boundaries between people differently in different settings. By following these differences from setting to setting, a researcher might better understand where and how gatekeepers—college admissions staff‐persons, job recruitment personnel, talent scouts—draw the boundaries when they are at
         work, where they matter most for social inequality, even while the same gatekeepers might privately abhor the existence of those boundaries when they are athome. For example, it would help us understand why even the most well‐meaning guidance counselors might consistently steer promising minority students away from good colleges (Mehan1978; Erickson and Schulz1982). Lamont says that her interviewees noticed some boundaries and ignored others; she notes that the absences are as noteworthy as the presences (Lamont1992, p. 4). We agree, adding that people can speak about some boundaries in some settings and not in others, and they can speak about boundaries differently in different settings; here, too, the silences are as noteworthy as the speech.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: ca.2003.44.issue-3<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Duranti identifies three paradigms for the study of language in relation to culture as consecutive but coexisting within contemporary American anthropology, although his preference for the 1990s paradigm shift to social constructionism is never in doubt. My own experience confirms the existence of these paradigms, but I assess their consequences somewhat differently. As a graduate student in the late 1960s I suffered considerable guilt over my lack of interest in the descriptivelinguistics agenda, embracing a more theoretical model of language as symbolic form instantiated in social action. I agree with Duranti that the ethnography of communication of my professional generation sought autonomy from both anthropology and linguistics, but for me the line between his second and third paradigms remains blurred. From the beginning, I assumed that our attention to language would produce better sociocultural research and theory. As a teacher of anthropology and the sole linguist in my department, I opted for language and culture rather than descriptive linguistics in the single required semester course. My students assumed that all languages were written down and that someone would speak English anywhere they might carry out fieldwork. Language as handmaiden to ethnology had to earn its keep as a way of getting at the nature of social order rather than as a tool for dealing with linguistic diversity in the field.<br>

Abstract: “Art is merely one of society’s functional systems,” states Niklas Luhmann in
      Art as a social System, and therein lies the tale his book tells. “We are not offering a helpful theory of art. … Art becomes a topic in the first place because of the assumption that a social theory claiming universality cannot ignore the existence of art” (p. 3). Luchmann’s clearly stated objective, then, is not to provide us with a theory of art, but to assimilate what he calls the “system of art” into his well‐known theoretical edifice, a theory predicated upon what he calls “evolutionary differentiation.”<br>

Issue: ci.2003.29.issue-4<br>

Abstract: By unfolding itself and making itself visible through the machine, Hawking’s flesh‐and‐blood body calls into question that which constitutes the primacy of the body itself, distinguishing it definitively from other objects. The body can’t be “a mere object of which he is conscious as he is of every other ‘thing’ in the world.” If so, he would have “embraced the position of the ‘pure subject’ who is a
         spectatorbefore the world and also before his own body which he considers as part of the world of objects.”55Because “in so far as it sees or touches the world, my body can therefore be neither seen nor touched. What prevents its ever being an object, ever being ‘completely constituted’ is that it is that by which there are objects. It is neither tangible nor visible in so far as it is that which sees and touches.”56Indeed, “I am not in front of my body, I am in it, or rather I am it.”57In other words, the perceiving body is always behind the perceived object, which is why my body “offers itself obstinately ‘from the same side’ without my being able to go around it.”58In a way we can say that Hawking’s flesh‐and‐blood body is registering in the same text as his speech; they both appear on the screen in front of him. Without this work of objectification of the body, Hawking cannot be his body. The body is felt but also represented as an exterior thing before it can do anything. With him the distinction between body‐object and body‐subject disappears. The human body conceived as a body‐object, that is, which “allows between its parts or between itself and other objects only external or mechanical relations” has become his own body or the body‐subject, that is, “‘his’ body as the center of ‘his’ existence, as the power both to act and to perceive and as a means for the subject to be part of the world.”59We thus see the movement of a certain form of absence‐presence that characterizes the body as Leder described it, but in another form. For Leder, the body is alway~<br>

Abstract: Despite this, metaphysics has indeed replied (whether it should be allowed to or not) to the question concerning man’s definition of himself. And we know well that the Cartesian
         cogitohas no other importance than to assure theegoits comprehension of itself and thus to impose itself as the first principle of every other science. Nevertheless, it would be more fitting to doubt this vulgate of Cartesianism, because the texts of Descartes so often contradict it. Contradiction occurs first of all because theego’s very performance of its existence unfolds within a space that is, from the outset, dialogical (with theDeus qui potest omnia, with thegenius aliquis malignius).43Next, contradiction occurs because theegoof thecogitorecognizes that its finite thought culminates in a faculty of will that is paradoxically infinite, “ratione cujus imaginem quandam et similitudinem Dei me refere intelligo” (“in virtue of [which] … I understand myself to bear in some way the image and likeness of God”); and above all the common understanding of the comprehensibility of theegois contradicted because theegoidentifies its faculty of thinking of itself with the image and likeness of God within it, to the point that the faculty of self‐knowing is simply one with the faculty of knowing God: “ex hoc uno quod Deus me creavit, valde credibile est me quodammodo ad imaginem et similitudinem ejus factum esse, illamque similitudinem, in qua Dei idea continetur, a me precipi per eandem facultatem, per quam ego ipse a me percipior” (“but the mere fact that God created me is a very strong basis for believing that I am somehow made in his image and likeness and that I perceive that likeness, which includes the idea of God, by the same faculty which enables me to perceive myself”).44Let us consider this extraordinary text: founding the thinking of self upon my thinking of God, to the point of merging them within the space opened by the image of and likeness to God.

Abstract: Memory and reciprocity between author and reader, in the way a good teacher connects with students, is also part of Braudel’s earliest writing of
         La Méditerranée; this is a third approach to the question of readers’ responses. In the preface to the first edition Braudel invites the reader to participate in the book’s image‐ and memory‐making: “The reader who approaches this book in the spirit I would wish will do well to bring with him his own memories, his own vision of the Mediterranean to add colour to the text and to help me conjure up this vast presence, as I have done my best to do.” And in this same spirit of memory and reciprocity, Braudel in turn returns to his own student days to remember the “unwavering conviction” imparted by his teachers: “if I have retained nothing else from the geographers who taught me at the Sorbonne,” it was that the “sea itself, the one we see and love, is the greatest document of its past existence.”79Thus it is not by chance that Braudel’s 1969 manuscript on the Mediterranean in prehistory and antiquity (“la très longue durée”), not published until 1998, is calledMemory and the Mediterranean,and its opening paragraph, with the heading “Seeing the Sea,” eloquently explains how memory reconstitutes reality for Braudel: “This is a sea that patiently recreates for us scenes from the past, breathing new life into them, locating them under a sky and in a landscape that we can see with our own eyes, a landscape and sky like those of long ago. A moment’s concentration or daydreaming, and that past comes back to life.”80The Braudelian metaphor is resuscitation and re‐creation. There is not the slightest hint of spiritualist resurrection; Braudel invokes instead the dynamism of waves. “Mediterranean civilization spreads far beyond its shores in great waves that are balanced by continual returns. What leaves the sea comes back and then departs once more.”81And even though these waves can turn into metaphors of precision instrument~<br>

Abstract: That the official doctrines whose function is to express the distinctiveness of the community vis‐à‐vis others have a basis in preexisting attitudes, orientations, and practices should not prevent us from acknowledging the real changes that a tradition undergoes in defining itself. The formulation of doctrines in response to a theological challenge does not leave the underlying social reality of the religious community unchanged. Inasmuch as the very existence of a social group includes a subjective element—that is, a social group fully comes into being only when it is aware of itself as such—the doctrines that communicate a community’s sense of identity to itself (and others) exercise a genuinely creative function. Out of a diffuse and inchoate sense of belonging to a tradition, one often shared by others, a religious community forges through its doctrines a sense of itself as a distinctive religious body. Religious doctrine shares with political speech the power to establish—to call into existence—a social group.

Abstract: It is at this level of “text” that we are able to speak of a unit of meaning as having a semiautonomous existence. A text is to some extent detached from the conditions of its production, but it is not completely autonomous. Rather, it is mediation in three dimensions: between man and world, between man and man, and between man and himself. According to Ricoeur, the first mediation is referentiality, the second is communicability, and the third is self‐understanding [
         31]. He shows how hermeneutics describes, as well as the interpretation of texts, the whole activity at the point of intersection of the (internal) configuration of the work and the (external) refiguration of life [18].<br>

Abstract: To trouble the categories of biological kinship, Haraway draws on the figure of the vampire. The vampire “both promises and threatens racial and sexual mixing” and “feeds off the normalized human” (
         1997b, 214). Suggestive of violence, pollution, and mixing, the vampire is a figure for the alien, the immigrant, and the cosmopolitan and is embroiled in racism, sexism, and homophobia. The figure of the vampire clearly facilitates Haraway’s inquiry into leakages among kinship categories. Yet like the cyborg, the figure also tends to become, like whiteness, everything and nothing at once. Haraway asks, in response toTimemagazine’s 1993 cover of a morphed portrait of a woman’s face created by a computer mixing of different races, a figure she labels SimEve, “Nothing here is scary, so why am I trembling?” (1997b, 264). In a similar manner, I ask about the figure of the vampire: Everything is so messy, so why am I so suspicious? My suspicion arises from the ease with which Haraway’s use of the vampire allows us to be on the other side of kinship and the dramas of identity and reproduction. As Haraway concludes in her chapter, “I believe that there will be no racial or sexual peace, no livable nature, until we learn to produce humanity through something more and less than kinship. I think I am on the side of the vampires, or at least some of them” (1997b, 265). But where and how, within the specific matrices of racial and gendered/sexual oppression, can vampirism be a choice? I suggest that like the postmodern figure of the cyborg, the vampire, recuperated metaphorically for illegitimacy and racial crossing, can function to metaphorize the specificities of race and sex out of existence and once again make room for universalizing analogy.<br>

Abstract: While the phenomenological description of mutual recognition found in the
            Encyclopediabelongs to the philosophy of subjective spirit and is therefore about individuals within a community, the account in thePhenomenologycould be read as referring to either singular subjectivity or universal subjectivity. Also, as Hegel argues in hisPhilosophy of Right, the sovereignty of a nation‐state as an individual becomes actual only in being recognized by other nation‐states (Elements of the Philosophy of Right, ed. Allen W. Wood, trans. H. B. Nisbet [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991], §§331–36). But unlike interpersonal recognition, international recognition is predicated not on the mere existence of nation‐states but on the level of internal sovereignty and freedom they have attained, as reflected in their constitutions (or “internal principles of legitimacy,” to quote Williams [Hegel's Ethics, 350]). Nation‐states with constitutions based on “natural” forms of ethical life, such as those that have patriarchal social structures, practice slavery, and regard their social order as sanctioned by nature or some arbitrary divine power, have not attained the internal level of freedom and autonomy necessary for them to be recognized as free individuals. In other words, international recognition for Hegel presupposes comparable levels of cultural development and convergence of values, especially freedom, as R. R. Williams points out (349–54). This gives rise to the problem of cross‐cultural recognition, especially one between peoples with fundamentally different convictions concerning freedom. What if a culture or nation subordinates freedom to “natural” or divinely ordained inequalities, i.e., to master‐slave relations, both in its internal organization and in its external relations? According to Williams, Hegel adopts a historical approach to mediate the differences between cultures via a concept of developmental stages in the consciousness of freedom, which ~<br>

Abstract: We have seen that the shroud is the Word’s “symbol” and the relics are its “agents.” We glean a clearer understanding of this rhetorical and linguistic connection if we read it in the light of Renaissance notions of emblematic expression. In an earlier section of this essay, I explained Tesauro’s innovative theories. I pointed out that Tesauro believes in the existence of visual hybrids, some sorts of emblematic
      imprese, at once “heroic” and personal messages expressed through general visual statements. Contradicting a tenet of the Renaissance concept of emblem, in theTelescopeTesauro contends that “the [impresa] is a miraculous composition whose soul is outside of the body.”121For Tesauro, the “miracle” of animpresalies in the fact that its message turns into a personal, nonvisible insight. The “soul” of the shroud‐impresais the marvel brought about in the “mirror” of our intellect.<br>

Abstract: It should be said, moreover, that seeing narrative reading as a form of discipleship may help us to understand the somewhat puzzling shift in Frei’s work. Early in his work, as mentioned above, he draws heavily on New Criticism, treating figural reading as a formal aspect of the text itself. Later, as mentioned above (see n. 8), Frei shifts to speaking of the literal sense as how the community reads the text. This may have been because Frei became suspicious that narrative was being co‐opted as a new hermeneutical category; as Stanley Hauerwas writes, “He rightly fears that the theological construal of scripture as a narrative of God’s work in behalf of his creation might be qualified by claims of the narrative quality of existence or the self.”
         52Such a theory of narrative would occlude the ascriptive narrative reading of Christianity, patterned after Christ’s reading. The shift to speaking of the literal sense as “how the community understands the text” thus serves as a corrective to such generalizations. However, it is possible that these stages of his work reflect two dimensions of the literal sense that remain in constant tension: Christian communal reading always follows at a distance, and only in a veiled and partial way, the reading of the one in whom we live and move and have our being.<br>

Abstract: Whether or not this reader’s reaction was warranted, he was relying on a fundamental function of the humanities footnote: it allows us a means of evaluating the level of scholarship of an essay. As Grafton points out, before the academic footnote came into existence, the authority of the author, his or her moral and intellectual stature, were inherent in what he or she said, not in his or her sources.
      6Thucydides and Joinville did not footnote; they didn’t need to. It seems our anonymous, theory‐driven author who incited one reader’s anger was writing for a different century. Today, footnotes in a scholarly essay are not uniformly marginal, minor, or digressive. They can be, but much more often they are a humanist’s lab report, our empirical data. In a general sense, footnotes are the mark of the author’s status as a professional. Because, as Grafton notes, footnotes persuade, we look to them for proof that the author has sufficiently covered the field, that enough evidence has been marshalled, that the status of the evidence has been sufficiently questioned. The profession requires not only the traditional recognition of the work of like‐minded scholars but also a consciousness of their place in the field, one’s own place in the field, and the field’s status as a field of study. The footnote is written by an individual whose own voice has been rendered into a collective voice of similarly educated authors. That is, in the footnote the individual author purposefully loses his or her writerly voice to become part of this professional collective.<br>

Abstract: The act of the destroyers was based on a somewhat passé theory of memory. It presumed that by erasing the artifact, recall is prevented because there is no direct image—except, of course, for the generation where the image has left a trace. But the recall, as new research demonstrates, need not be produced by a literal trace; recall itself, prompted by a context—a book, a discussion, a thought—can produce an image.
         106What is even more essential is the emotional component. In the absence of specific imagery, it is feelings that become essential in reliving the past. “So, while memory does not consist in a memory image, the existence of a complex interplay of image and affect in the processes of recall is important to the cluster of ideas brought together under memory.”107<br>

Abstract: Kearney helpfully suggests that this poetic moral capability is therefore ultimately “religious” in the sense that it stretches human moral understanding beyond its own visible boundaries and limits. “Human existence is always hovering about those frontiers that mark the passage between self and other, real and imaginary, known and unknown. Indelibly marked by finitude, the human self has never ceased to ponder its boundaries or to imagine what lies beyond.”
         30Taking his cue from Emmanuel Levinas, and to a certain extent the later work of Jacques Derrida, Kearney claims that ethics involves a responsibility to “the other” that must ultimately appear radically “impossible.” The deepest passivity of moral life is not the self’s tradition‐constituted historicity but its responsibility constantly to renew itself before each other as a face of the Wholly Other. According to Kearney, however, it is only through the open‐endedness of narration that one can hope finally to give this trace of the Wholly Other the kind of radically self‐disrupting response it ultimately demands in this world. (We need not enter here into the phenomenological debate about the possibility/impossibility of “giving.”) Only in this poetic mode is the impossible Other not just a disorienting shock but also an “impossible made possible” through the self’s endless practice of its own moral world’s narrative self‐transformation.31<br>

Abstract: The concept of the good may apply particularly pointedly to professional codes of ethics. The codes are aimed at the positive right of free speech and also at professional responsibility. They attempt to articulate practical and normative standards of ethics. Both the ALA Code of Ethics and the American Society for Information Science and Technology Professional Guidelines speak in terms of responsibility to communities, to the profession, and to society as a whole. Public pronouncement of the codes does serve to affirm the existence of libraries as just institutions in a democracy. Related to the second scenario above, accuracy does fit with the good since it is in people’s interest to obtain accurate information that they can employ for their own well‐being. Advocacy is certainly not always and everywhere prohibited, but it is secondary to people’s right to information that is as accurate as it is possible to provide. Accuracy also embraces a commitment to truth, which recognizes a fundamental inequality of some information (the true and the false; refer again to the first scenario). It is generally taken to be responsible professionalism to check information sources against one another to corroborate information. This action, as Lynch observes, is not a substitute for truth; it is a means to truth (in the weak sense) [
         19, p. 81]. Toward the end of accuracy and truth, there are some closely related matters. For one thing, there have been some persistent challenges related to government information and its accessibility versus its effective suppression. This is an area in which advocacy and accuracy merge, with the common aim of presenting library users with the most authoritative information possible. Also, libraries’ access mechanisms, including subject headings, can benefit from advocacy directed toward language that encompasses the culture, linguistic distinctions, and other facets of the people who will search for information.<br>

Abstract: It is important to recognize that the historical present as a global unity already marks the coevality and immanence of the noncontemporaneous contemporary moment. A historical present filled with mixed temporalities has always been a condition of capitalist modernization, even as its copresent uncanniness was suppressed by both the authority of the future perfect and the expectations of progress that vowed to raise all societies to the same level. The effect was to displace the uncanny temporal figure to the world outside of Euro‐America and put its societies under the sign of underdevelopment, which announced comparative lack. The force of the collective singular lay in singularizing all plural histories capital encountered along its way and in assimilating them to its exemplar. This return to a perspective of the historical present might allow us to rewind the narrative of acculturation that has reinforced the externality of clock and calendar time to disclose the texture of the uncanniness of mixed temporalities it had smoothed out and straightened.
         21What seems promising about the opening supplied by the present is the specularity of unevenness, which both constitutes its sign and defines its relationship to the industrial societies of Euro‐America, and its capacity to now become the mirror of our own nature. Specifically, this experience among so‐called late developers actually made available to the “enfeebled center” of Euro‐America both the recognition of the temporal immanence of the marginally uneven and the spectacle of its existence in our own backyard.22<br>

Abstract: While in Mormon theology there is no existence without agency, the agency that operates in this world is conditioned by the gift of the atonement of Jesus Christ. The Book of Mormon, at 2 Nephi 2:26–27, provides: “because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day. … Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient.”<br>

Abstract: Drawing in particular on the analogy between the demigod carrying the world on his shoulders and the storyteller holding up her fictional world, Winterson’s self‐mythologizing as Atlas—her retelling of the mythical adventures of the Titan in the first person—extends the relevance of
         Weightbeyond authorial metafiction. The storyteller, indeed, is not just the writer of fictions; she is also the teller of the story of her own life, and in this sense, rewriting retains its existential drive to project human existence narratively. Winterson’s narrative rests upon the simile of the book of nature. “The strata of sedimentary rock are like the pages of a book, each with a record of contemporary life written on it,” she writes, using black and red lettering and varying letter size to highlight the materiality and mediality of writing (Winterson2005, ix; cf. Hayles2002). Proceeding to retell the beginning of the world—“In the beginning there was nothing” (Winterson2005, 3), we read in a reformulation of Genesis 1:1–2, which might be Winterson’s or Atlas’s—the narrator, rejecting the notion that all “the rest is history” (5), explains: “All the stories are here, silt‐packed and fossil‐stored. The book of the world opens anywhere, chronology is one method only and not the best” (6).<br>

Abstract: From the standpoint of the historicist theory of truth, it is interesting to note that someone who was an obscure occultist in the sixteenth century and who was laughed at by the humanists and condemned by the clergy became a legend in later centuries, inspiring not only great literature but also becoming a psychological archetype in the nineteenth century for the philosophical explication of the various stages of human existence. Had the historical records of the humanists and the clergy been destroyed, this particular continuum of knowledge would have ceased to exist.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: But, no, when the opportunity comes, she never says a word. She takes up that other unidentified book instead, reading aloud in prison just to kill time from some irrelevancy not even named or summarized. But what will Boz's own reader think, or those who listen to his book read aloud? What is that Little Amy doing? Why give a stay of execution to the false mother's reputation when it means denying the true mother's existence? Who could believe any of this? It's worse than if the old woman were still paying Amy wages to buy her off. And there's something more intolerable yet. Without telling him what the papers are, Amy asks Arthur himself to destroy the will, to burn it up—of all places!—in their last cozy prison fire on the eve of their wedding. What kind of prenuptial vow is this unspoken vow of silence? That incinerated legal document is the one written paper that actually mentions my name in writing. Boz must have noted it down, my name, after drinking with Flintwinch, but seems to have lost track of it as much as I have tried to. So, thanks now to that Little Dorrit, I am to go once and for all unspoken, untold. And, hardest to bear, it is Arthur who gives me over to my cremation. No need for Amy to tell him what it is that he burns, who I am, that I am, what I became. Perhaps she doesn't want him to feel bad about the denial of money to her, about the secret disinheritance.<br>

Abstract: Jean Santeuil personifies a self‐denying subject who, inattentive to life, engages in forms of contemplation that, fueled by involuntary memory, channel him toward a Schopenhauerian form of existence “out of time” (hors du temps).
         58The exercise of involuntary memory is the solution that “tears [Jean] away from the condition of slavery to present time and pervades him with the impression of a permanent life,”59bestowing on him a condition of Schopenhauerian “asceticism.”60However, it is well known that inÀ la recherche du temps perduinvoluntary memory is no longer the “panacea,” as Joshua Landy has aptly pointed out, that solves the problems of Proust’s protagonist.61When Marcel tries to bridge the gap separating time lost from time regained, he must look beyond the expedients of a mnemonic technique. When it comes to involuntary memory, one could say that Marcel inÀ la recherche du temps perduoperates in agreement with Augustine’s moral paradigm; he uses involuntary memory as an instrument (uti utendis) in order to attain a higher and more delectable good (frui fruendis), namely, the amorous altruism of his better self.<br>

Abstract: Rather than simply reading Ricoeur’s work in chronological sequence to make this case, Hall aims for what he calls a “critical constructive interpretation” that will yield something like a “situated reading” of Ricoeur’s thought (4), one that will better demonstrate this thesis than Ricoeur’s own words do. Basically, the structure of the argument Hall proposes begins from what Ricoeur has to say about the idea of agency in relation to the understanding of selfhood. Hall then moves on to consider the narrative configuration of a meaningful existence that follows from this understanding. He then takes up questions that can arise regarding our practical experience and moral concerns from this perspective. It is the testimony of conscience that comes in at this latter level that brings in the theological perspective. It does so through a discussion of what Ricoeur has to say about the Golden Rule in relation to the love commandment and in relation to what Ricoeur calls a logic of superabundance, one that goes beyond any logic of equivalence. It is this idea of a possible logic of superabundance that leads in turn to a discussion of what Hall calls the economy of the gift and the poetic imperative that Hall sees in Ricoeur’s concept of a theonomy that stands over against Kant’s call for an autonomy that all too easily isolates people from one another. It is love that drives this poetic imperative, and what love calls for is something more than, not less than, justice.<br>

Abstract: However, a revision is needed for our global times. It is not life qua life that is the norm, the good, for responsible existence. That conception would merely replace one centrism for another: biocentrism for anthropocentrism or theocentrism. It is, rather, the integration of many dimensions of life, the integrity of life, which must orient individuals and social action in our global times. This idea—the integrity of life—is a complex one. Within the work of theological ethics it enables critical reflection across an array of domains of existence and the goods proposed or entailed. It also provides orientation for responsible action. That is to say, the idea of the “integrity of life” articulates a multidimensional conception of the good but also a norm or measure for responsible actions and relations.
         39Responsible existence is a life of integrity formed, personally and socially, through an enduring dedication to the integrity of life. The integrity of life provides the norms for humanizing religion in the full sense of the idea. It moves beyond a merely humanistic or theistic conceptuality or even the deconstruction of that dyad in order to articulate a good that resonates with religious and moral depths in the remembrance of death and the love of life. Keeping our attention on humanizing religion is thus meant to save us from a reduction in a conception of the moral good, to insist on the complexity of goodness. From diverse strands of our cultural legacy—Hellenistic, biblical, modern—there arise the resources to render productive, rather than destructive, the tension between the limit of death and the love of life, a sense of responsibility and the proper object of responsible action, the integrity of life.<br>

Abstract: Without trying any further to distinguish Bazin from his disciples, or
         Cahiers du cinémafrom other Parisian film groups, or even French film culture from that of other nations, in Florent Kirsch's characterization offilmologiewe can recognize the two nearly irreconcilable attitudes toward cinema and its study that have remained in tension in the academy. A few individuals have managed to bridge this opposition. Bazin should have been one of them, given his ENS education and his evident training in disciplines like geology, geography, entomology, botany, philosophy, rhetoric, theology, and psychology. Yet cinephilia won out in him, or rather films themselves won out as centers of attraction whose existence and value it was the duty and pleasure of the “disciplined” critic to articulate. Other polymaths who could bridge these approaches were Jean Mitry and Edgar Morin, both of whom were more closely allied to university life while always having been avid filmgoers, indeed occasional filmmakers. Mitry had assisted Abel Gance and had run ciné‐clubs in the 1920s and 1930s. He is listed as one of the founders of the Cinémathèque Française in 1935. After the war he taught at the brand new state‐sponsored film school, Institut des hautes études cinématographiques (IDHEC), largely because he had modest experience in production as an editor and assistant director. Later he would manage to teach classes in a university setting. Most tellingly, his massive publications (the two‐volumeEsthétique et psychologie du cinémaand the five‐volumeHistoire du cinéma) were published in the 1960s by Presses Univérsitaires de Paris, just as Cohen‐Séat's book had been. Mitry felt himself a legitimate rival offilmologie, and superior for having lived an entire life in the midst of the medium.24The tables of contents to his theoretical volumes presume the comprehensive and progressive exploration of a genuine discipline, as does the immense bibliography that draws on every sort of scie~<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur,  Paul<br>
Abstract: In providing clarification of previous works,
   Reflections on the Justis exceptionally helpful. Of particular interest in this volume is the paradoxical nature of authority—What is authority? How is it legitimated? Is it claimed or granted?—the existence of vulnerability and passivity within autonomy and initiative, and the relationship between moral ideals and historical manifestation, questions that exist more on the margins ofOneself as Another. Those interested in Ricoeur’s religious thought will find little of direct interest here. Those who see a deep connection between his moral philosophy and his philosophy of religion will find some confirmation, but there are other places where the connections are more explicitly manifest.Reflections on the Justis best approached as a companion volume to earlier philosophical works, certainlyThe Justbut perhaps more importantlyOneself as Another. As such, it holds an important place in Ricoeur’s oeuvre.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: For Coleridge, I have argued, answering God’s claim is always a struggle. Prayer is the phenomenological concentration on being‐for‐God, “a conscious will‐effected sense of his presence” (N6155), as it is put in 1829. However, as we saw in the second section of this article (“
         Prayer and the Improper: Kant, Coleridge, and Kierkegaard”), such presence is, strictly speaking, unthinkable for the fallen “I.” As such, the thought of being‐for‐God is always cut against the grain of one’s being, will, and understanding. To respond, therefore, is to struggle with oneself, a struggle implicating one’s speech: prayer is also cut across the grain of language. As David Haney notes, there is a sense in which wordless prayer alone could be pure surrender.68Derrida is correct insofar as all the codes and words of prayer bear traces of predication, which, for Coleridge, are fatally intertwined with the understanding of an “I” separate from God. As Luther suggests, prayer “is a constant violent action of the spirit as it is lifted up to God. … We must all practice violence.”69Calling—replying—to God becomes a kind of violence practiced against oneself and one’s language, as is apparent in Coleridge’s description of God as an “Idea [that] worked in you, like the Memory of a Name which we cannot recollect and yet feel that we have, and which reveals its existence in the mind only by a restless anticipation and proves its prior actuality by the almost explosive instantaneity with which it is welcomed & recognized on its re‐emersion” (N4816).<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: Franke first defines apocalyptic discourse as “the unveiling of an ultimate, absolute and transcendent destiny or dimension of existence” (3). As a legacy of the Enlightenment, traditionally understood, we have grown accustomed to rejecting or avoiding such discourse as rationally intractable, and critical theory exposes absolutist discourse as idolatrous, exclusionary, and all too human. It is idolatrous to presume that we can represent the transcendent, and all too often absolutist discourse functions as a will to power that marginalizes or subjugates others in an imperialistic manner. However, Franke insists that apocalypse is not the problem but the solution to this dilemma because apocalyptic discourse paradoxically reveals a transcendent dimension that no language can ever express. Therefore, apocalypse is always both an unveiling and a reveiling that humbles us, deconstructs our idols, and opens us toward a new and different future. If we call this mystery God, then we first discover that we are not God, thereby enabling a self‐transcendence that is the precondition of any meaningful dialogue with others.<br>

Author(s): Kitts Margo<br>
Abstract: Oaths are a perfect example also of the second feature of Rappaport’s liturgical orders, which is that they instantiate conventions by their very performance. That is, as a ritual act the oath does more than just communicate; it actually brings a convention into existence by its performance, and compels recognition of the authority of the convention it instantiates. Rappaport uses the example of dancing the Kaiko among the Maring: dancing the Kaiko brings into effect a commitment to fight beside one’s host in the next war. The dance is more commissive than just saying one will fight, because, unlike words, which are retractable, ephemeral, and potentially ambiguous, dancing the oath is substantial and visceral—a public act that permits little ambiguity, because the Maring know precisely the convention it establishes. The oath is not reversible: its commitment holds regardless of any personal ambivalence or internal infelicity on the part of the dancer. Because it establishes a commitment by its very performance, the oath‐making ritual is considered a metaperformative act. It instantiates the oath at the same time that it commits its performer to upholding it.

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: More important, how a promise is exchanged differentiates it from other forms of the gift along with its doubling and extension. Where the ordinary gift consists of the exchange that leaves the recipient in the debt of the donor, the promise dispossesses itself and inverts the order of debt. The proper worry about gifts is that they inflict debt on their recipients. Mauss indicated that gifts must be returned. Divine gifts in this mode would carry with them a servitude that cannot be escaped. What creature of finite resources can repay a divine gift? A promise reverses this order of debt since the donor has not given anything yet, just a token or word. The donor, not the recipient, assumes the obligation to give in this exchange. This reversal of obligation dispossesses the donor by a radical act of assuming debt rather than issuing it, an act that will allow this reformulation of Tillich’s prophetic critique to address the problem of potency and sovereignty. While the potency Agamben described gives actuality to itself, it indebts or obligates actuality to potency; this means that the existence that actuality possesses always can be returned to pure potential or nothingness. The sovereign may always undo his or her subjects, taking away their actuality or existence.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: This notion of literature develops from Blanchot's reading of Mallarmé as well as his encounter with the Hegelian description of comprehension. Drawing from Kojève's seminars, Blanchot begins with the notion that language involves the absence (the annihilation or death) of the object, such that for one to possess the idea of cat, one must annihilate the uniquely real cat in its existence.
         35“Common language,” Blanchot writes, recognizes this operation as unproblematic or at least productive. For in killing the real cat, I have gained something much more secure, the idea of cat, which cannot die. Literary language differs from common language not in the act itself, for by the very fact that it is language it must also enact a negation of the object. “But literary language,” Blanchot suggests, “is made of uneasiness” (“L,” p. 315; “LRD,” p. 325). Literary language draws attention back to the negativity of the operation, focusing on the fact that the word expresses the nonexistence of the cat and that what it has given us as a replacement is a word. Literature dramatizes the operation of replacement by offering “an endless sliding of ‘turns of phrase' which do not lead anywhere. Thus is born,” Blanchot writes, “the image that does not designate the thing but, rather, what the thing is not” (“L,” p. 315; “LRD,” p. 326). The mark of the literary is the mark of the trope, a turn. A figure of speech is a turn that multiplies the absence between the object and the word, for now what we have is a word that refers not to the object but to another word.<br>

Abstract: Setting aside the numerous references to falcons and falconry that have long been recognized as suggesting Dante's acquaintance with the birds, with hunting, and possibly with Frederick the Second's
         De arte venandi cum avibus,52let us look at the metaphors and similes in which he shows his knowledge of creatures. Through poetry, in contrast to philosophy—and even if this were not his purpose—Dante can potentially think his “way into the existence of a bat or a chimpanzee or an oyster, any being,” as J. M. Coetzee describes the power of poets inElizabeth Costello(80). Poetry, in other words, is a means whereby the subject can radically transcend itself in relation to the world of creatures.53This argument, of course, rests on the precise status or function of these similes or analogies in the poem.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 656725<br>
Date: 01 01, 2011<br>
Author(s): Pranger Burcht<br>
Abstract: Here, we come a bit closer to the seductive nature of Augustinian rhetoric. Deprived of clock time, the “since the day I learnt of you” turns into the magic of memory and oblivion. A-causally and counterintuitively it is a world turned upside down. Memory and time (
      ex quo) function asle marteau sans maître, the “hammer of existence,”esse solum, that is ordered as well as given and is incapable of not being confessed and lived, the song that cannot be silenced and cannot disappear from memory and expectation. Oblivion is the silent performance of precisely that: the loss of sound, as a means of survival—in sinful forgetfulness—vis-à-vis that “beauty so old and so new” contained in the ultimate expression of time as present: the temporality of thesero te amavi. But what exactly is being expressed in thesero te amavi? Moreover, if this simultaneity of memory and oblivion is expressed, that is still not the same as the divine voice sounding on its own account. Here, we touch upon the ultimate enigma ofConfessions: the hammer of existence, “Da quod iube, iube quod vis”/“Grant what you command and command what you will.”
            Who is able to withstand the lure—and violence—of that song that, as far as sonority is concerned, cannot be distinguished from the “beauty so old and so new”? One is reminded of Kafka here—the hammer of existence—and his story of the Sirens' song:22
         
            It would be little respectful to Kafka and Augustine to make one-to-one comparisons between this passage and the AugustinianProof that inadequate, even childish measures may come to the rescue.
            To protect himself from the Sirens, Ulysses put wax in his ears and had himself chained to the mast of his ship. Of course, all travelers before him could have done the same, except those whom the Sirens had already allured from afar, but it was known to all the world that such things were of no help whatever. The song of the Sirens could penetrate everything, and th~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 659348<br>
Date: 4 2011<br>
Author(s): Landy Joshua<br>
Abstract: Neither—to return to the earlier objection—has Kaufman quite yielded to the narrativity brigades by agreeing to tell that time-honored story, “Charlie becomes a writer.”
         36To be sure, the fictional character Charlie “grows” and “adapts” and “learns” and “overcomes obstacles to succeed in the end.” But above and behind Charlie, we sense the existence of an entity who doesnotgrow and adapt and learn, an entity who may well feel, with Susan, that “for a person, adapting is almost shameful; it's like running away,” an entity who has been more or less the same since the days ofBeing John Malkovitch. Here is where the distinction between Charlie and Kaufman, which might seem like a technical issue, actually becomes of prime importance (figs. 5–6). In the movie, one might say, Charlie becomes Donald. But, in real life, there is no Donald; in real life, there is only Kaufman, someone who is, we assume, an amalgam of Charlie and Donald, at once, enduringly, with an inexorable combat being unchangingly waged in his head, that marvellous, mysterious head into which Valerie Thomas, in the opening scene, expresses a desire to climb. From this point of view, the film is a spurious diachrony concealing a genuine synchrony; only superficially the story of how Charlie became Donald,Adaptationis, at a deeper level, the entirely nonnarrative portrait of a never-changing Kaufman.37<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: Even to consider these questions, let alone to feel stirred or moved by them, is, it seems, to begin to doubt the goodness of God.
      38And to doubt the goodness of God, even if you still believe in his existence, is to slide into what was generally understood in the period as atheism.39Perhaps that is why Prynne accused acting companies of “prophanely” playing the history of Faustus despite the fact that the play stages the orthodoxy of the unrepentant magician's damnation. Or perhaps something else was at stake in Prynne's sense that the play was profane. Insofar as Faustus is compelling as a tragic character, his play will reveal the inexorable negativity at the heart of Protestant Christianity; it will lay bare not that damnation is predestined but that salvation itself entails self-obliteration into the absolute otherness of an inscrutable God. From a humanist perspective such Christianity is fundamentally tragic because the life that it offers universalizes all sensuous particularity, all subjectivity signified or even felt in the material embodiment of persons and texts. But the ultimate effect of Marlowe's play is not simply for the audience to doubt whether they should continue to desire God and salvation; rather, it is for the audience terrifyingly to feel that God is watching them doubt and, bending down his “ireful brows,” judging their thoughts and feelings and condemning them to the damnation that they are compelled to contemplate. And in a context where magic was a theatrical show created by the devil but permitted by God so he could see whether his subjects would, as Perkins put it, cleave to him or to the devil and his wicked instruments, to cleave in compassion to Faustus was to sense yourself entering into alliance with the devil, alienated from the inscrutable source of your immortal soul.<br>

Author(s): Regan Ethna<br>
Abstract: Not content to engage the discourses of theology and human rights by way of definition and description, Regan constructively engages both discourses, building on the work of Karl Rahner, Johann Baptist Metz, and Paul Ricoeur. The heart of the text is this constructive mode. Regan develops a theological anthropology that sees human flourishing, the aim of human being, in a “generosity of existence” (15), which is grounded in and flows from a capacity for God (76). Generosity of existence is the idea that life consists in both giving and receiving toward greater flourishing of oneself, others, and a community of being (112). The notion of generosity of existence includes a capacity for self-determination and is therefore protected by a human rights discourse that seeks to defend a zone of individual human autonomy. But this theological anthropology is not exhausted by individual autonomy. Rather, it links an individual capacity for self-determination to a responsibility for “making oneself” in response both to God and to the embeddedness of human life (82). In this sense, human rights ought to be taken seriously by any theologian who believes human beings ought to orient their lives to God, because violations of human rights severely impair this capacity and impede the possibility of responding to a divine call. She attributes the revelation of a mystical dimension to human rights activism to the insights of liberation theology, which highlights a divine element embedded in the struggle for human rights. But Regan also sees liberation theology as contributing several insights to secular liberal human rights discourse, including an awareness and acknowledgment of the systematic and structural constraints that limit the capacities of the poor of the world to flourish, and highlighting the importance of basic sociocultural rights.<br>

Abstract: This straight-forward reading of the passage has been obscured by interpreters, ancient and modern, who interpret מחניהם as referring to “their camps” (plural) and thus assert the existence of a requirement to maintain purity in all cities. For a coherent understanding of the syntax and content of this passage, it is necessary to understand the form as singular (“their camp”). Note the form מחניך alongside מחנך in Deut. 23:15, both meaning “your camp” (singular). Among the moderns, the fact that מחניהם in our verse is singular has been noted by J. Licht (
         A Commentary on the Book of Numbers, vol. 1 [Jerusalem, 1985], 59–60 [Heb.]), and Levine (Numbers 1–20, 182, 186), and it is assumed by the JPS translation. I plan on elaborating on these points in a study in progress, “The Wilderness Camp Paradigm in the Holiness Source and the Temple Scroll: From Purity Laws to Cult Politics.”<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: Csordas’s claim for the privileged place of witchcraft holds to the extent that a people does identify witches as the unambiguously human inversion of normal morality that we call evil. But insofar as spirits and other nonhuman manifestations may sometimes be cited as part of a discourse on human culpability (nonhumans, like spirits, being an extension of humans), then the question of the centrality of witchcraft becomes an ontological question of what the boundaries of humanity and of human witches are. Witches are people, but are they wholly so, especially when they take on nonhuman forms? And what about evil agents, such as spirits, who take on human form? In fieldwork it has been explained to me that “spirits are people” but that spirits are also different from people and more akin to animals. We can interpret both claims as metaphorical (spirits are like people or spirits are like animals). But that glosses over the fact that these may also be regarded as literal statements, true at the time of their enunciation, in the same way that some Christians assert that Christ was both human and divine at given points in his existence. So, taken together with the alternating attributions of evil to both nonhuman and human agents of evil, I suggest that we take ethnographic account in particular cases of fuzziness in the identification of human and nonhuman, and of human and nonhuman evil. Witches, like zombies, are or were human but sometimes take nonhuman form and so constitute an ambivalence that straddles the two dimensions. That said, Csordas provides the most sophisticated critique and agenda regarding the current anthropological interest in morality to appear in years.<br>

Abstract: Learappears to answer in the negative, seemingly because politics—as imagined in the play—would put limits on responsibilities that are limitless. Even though Lear’s regime instills within its subjects a sense of exorbitant duty, the expression of this duty (whether sincere or not) is too narrow. All devotion is directed at the king, who is officially enthroned as the singular other, the one whose plenipotent voice drowns out every other summons. By restricting responsiveness to the royal court, the monarchial structure ofLearwould elide the existence and ignore the neediness of the non-regal other. Moreover, by channeling altruism into the well-defined and well-worn conventions of courtly service, the play’s political system would distance its subjects from the unpredictable passivity that is the essence of the ethical. Court forms are too rigid, insisting upon choreographed behaviors and chivalric displays instead of openness and sincerity.<br>

Article Title: Historicizing Religion: Varro’s<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 674410<br>
Date: 02 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Rüpke Jörg<br>
Abstract: The fully fledged Varronian history of religion, dimly visible through the scattered two-hundred sixty fragments of the
         Antiquitates rerum divinarum, tries to construct not a Roman, but a universal history of religion, apt for a Roman polity extended all over Italy, certainly into Greece and beyond, an incipientImperium Romanum. Varro and his dedicatee, Caesar, share a perspective in this regard. This was no unilinear development. New gods were to arrive, who demanded stories about the shrinking of diversity, about resistance to unity and about differentiation judged secondary. In such narratives, conspirators like Sextus Tarquinius and Judas replaced Numa and Fulvius Nobilior.
               Ultimately, histories of “religions” instead of “religion” were written. The concept of the “church of the martyrs,” construing the survivors as legitimate successors to those killed, is put forward by religious historiographers.71
            
               These sharply defined identities are proffered in contradiction to the ambiguity and ambivalences, which obtain in the field of religion. The production of boundaries by historiographers and group leaders must not be allowed to completely obscure the existence and historical significance of the vast array of shared practices in daily life. In areas of the world where multiple (or indistinct) religious identities were the norm, many functions and forms of religious practices and beliefs occurred on a shared field between and above the boundaries invoked by distinct groups.72<br>

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Badiou’s attempt to “extract a formal, wholly secularized conception of grace”
         
               from the Pauline texts and to exploit their political potential while disregarding Paul’s theological commitments stems, basically, from his rejection of transcendence as such. Bonhoeffer’s nonreligious interpretation aimed to redefine God’s transcendence understood in a sense of other-worldliness so that it could be found in immanence (“God is beyond even in the middle of our lives”187
            
               ), that is to say, in the “neighbor who is within reach in any given situation.”188
            
               The God of Bonhoeffer is, in a sense, an absent God, a God who in the midst of the world remains invisible and silent until Christians make God present and visible by their participation in Jesus’s being for others. While Bonhoeffer radically reinterprets the traditional Christian notion of transcendence, Badiou simply does away with it. In this regard, he represents “a shared new determination to grapple with the legacy of the death of God in a deeper way than ever before, re-making philosophy from the ground up as a thinking ‘without God.’”189
            
               When Badiou speaks of the “death of God,” what he means by “God” is not only the metaphysical God with whose death Nietzsche and Heidegger were concerned (the end of onto-theology) and whose death enables the return of a “more divine” God. In light of his ontology, all three meanings of the word “God” that he distinguishes, that is, the living God of religion, the conceptual God of metaphysics, and the God of the poets, become superfluous.190
            
               As a consequence, even a theological understanding of religion—as, for instance, “a personal communion between God and human beings”191
            
               —that could be accepted by Bonhoeffer cannot stand in the face of Badiou’s radical dismissal of transcendence. However, when we look at the reality~<br>

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: Peperzak is concerned with the relation between philosophy and faith, more than any other topic, however. Following his phenomenology of philosophical conversation, he claims, “The encounter with God is somewhat comparable to a face-to-face relationship that stretches me when I look up to a human person who loves me. Since God is infinite, however, faith and love toward God encompass the universe of all that exists. … Faith thus mobilizes and orients the entirety of one’s existence from top to bottom” (120–21). Peperzak regards faith as a fundamental Desire that orients us in an encounter with the absolute. As such, there is no clean separation of faith and philosophy. All thinking emerges from some sort of faith, and while philosophy has a universality that can engender conversation across differences of faith orientation, its autonomy is a relative and limited one. Moreover, Peperzak associates the infinity of God encountered as Other with the Platonic Good that illuminates all thinking and being, while itself escaping thematization: “the
      phila(love) ofphilosophiareaches out toward a wisdom (sophia) that implies … a sense of the difference between this cosmos and the ultimately desired but ungiven Good. … By longing, Eros reaches further than any theory” (159).<br>

Abstract: For Aristotle, chance is a cause, similar to nature as a cause. Natural motions operate both for a purpose and in accordance with necessity. They are purposive since the sequences of natural processes are not at random. Having set forth the principles, causes, and kinds of motions, Aristotle proceeds in the third and fourth books of his
      Physicsto determine the nature of motion and to examine fundamental concepts, such as infinity, place, void, and time, associated with motion. It is at the end of the fourth book of thePhysics, Mooij maintains, that Aristotle posits the principle, “there can be no time without the rational mind, that mind is only required to measure something that in other respects has full existence independently of the mind” (p. 77).<br>

Abstract: Analogy or proportion is when the second term is to the first as the fourth to the third. We may then use the fourth for the second, or the second for the fourth. Sometimes too we qualify the metaphor by adding the term to which the proper word is relative. Thus the cup is to Dionysus as the shield to Ares. The cup may, therefore, be called “the shield of Dionysus”, and the shield “the cup of Ares”. Or, again, as old age is to life, so is evening to day. Evening may therefore be called, “the old age of the day” and old age, “the evening of life”, or, in the phrase of Empedocles, “life’s setting sun”. For some of the terms of the proportion there is at times no word in existence; still the metaphor may be used. For instance, to scatter seed is called sowing: but the action of the sun in scattering his rays is nameless. Still this process bears to the sun the same relation as sowing to the seed. Hence the expression of the poet “sowing the god-created light”. There is another way in which this kind of metaphor may be employed. We may apply an alien term, and then deny of that term one of its proper attributes; as if we were to call the shield, not “the cup of Ares” but “the wineless cup”. (

Article Title: 'Getting out and Getting Away': Women's Narratives of Class Mobility<br>
Publisher: Taylor & Francis Group<br>
Issue: i260667<br>
Date: 10 1, 1931<br>
Author(s): Woolf Steph<br>
Abstract: This article is concerned with the ways in which women narrate a move from a 'working-class' position to a position marked (in however fragmentary and complex a way) as 'middle class'. While such a move might be seen in terms of a straightforward escape from a disadvantaged social position, I argue here that what has to be analysed is the pain and the sense of estrangement associated with this class movement. Drawing on the class narratives of a group of seven white British women, the article uses Bourdieu's concepts of symbolic capital and habitus to explore the cultural and symbolic configurations of class. These configurations may be inscribed into the self, so that the self, itself, is class marked. Since working-class selves are frequently marked in pathological terms, this raises particular difficulties for the idea of an 'escape' from such a position. Class in this sense is embedded in people's history and so cannot be so easily 'escaped'. The usual conventions of life-narratives - in which the self remains the same entity from birth to death and later events are a culmination of earlier ones - are also disrupted in this case. But if a working-class position is marked as pathological, so too is taking on the markers of middle-class existence. to do so is not only to risk 'getting it wrong', but it is also to risk the scorn attached to 'pretentiousness'. There is a particular jeopardy here for women, since it is women who have been especially associated with desires for artefacts associated with bourgeois existence. The article argues for a focus for classed desires and class envy, not in pathological terms, but in terms of a coherent response to political and social exclusions.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263715<br>
Date: 3 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Windisch William A.<br>
Abstract: Considered rhetorically, or by phenomenological-literary analysis, the saying about finding one's life by losing it intends to break up the continuity of existence of the hearer to the extent that he or she is left without a frame of reference. Considered from a historical-literary point of view, however, the saying occurs in an environment and presupposes a context which gives meaning to the response. A Whiteheadian or process perspective of interpretation offers an approach which can relate these two types of understanding of the saying, and can also cast light on contemporary styles of interpretation with their ontological presuppositions, either to set the saying in a framework of "rightness" or in one of "creativity."<br>

Article Title: The Self beyond Itself: Hermeneutics and Transpersonal Experience<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263716<br>
Date: 6 1, 1930<br>
Author(s): Underhill David R.<br>
Abstract: This essay examines, from the point of view of an existential hermeneutics, five accounts of transpersonal experience: Robert Monroe's Journeys Out of the Body, Paul's experience in the third heaven in II Corinthians 12, a description of rapture by Teresa of Avila, a disembodied vision of guardian spirits by John Lilly from The Center of the Cyclone, and the vision of the assault of the Lords of the Dead from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Through a consideration of world, embodiment, death, care and other existential categories, the discussion in each case focuses on a central ambiguity about the personal identity of the narrator. The question of authenticity, in a Heideggerian sense, is posed to these materials, and the central ambiguity is shown to strike so deeply as to undercut the assumption of autonomy as the criterion of authenticity. Being-toward-death is relativized in such experiences, but relativized by an even more radical threat to individual existence. In conclusion, some generalized principles are offered as heuristic criteria for interpreting transpersonal experience in general.<br>

Author(s): Stevenson Walter J.<br>
Abstract: Recent study of the nature of textuality as such opens new insights for the study of the Bible. Although individual parts of the Bible have oral antecedents, the Bible as a whole has existed only as a text, and a unique kind of text, folded back on itself out of communal memory as no other book has been. A text is a monument. Textuality establishes a special relationship between discourse and death. Spoken words are exchanges between living persons. The text presents its message as well if its author is dead as it does if he or she is alive. Print is even more bound to death than writing is. In comparison with oral performance-delivery of an oration, song-a text physically has certain special alliances with past time. All texts come out of the past. Literature as text is psychologically retrospective: its effects typically include an element of nostalgia. Because of its future orientation, culminating in the closing words of Revelation, "Come, Lord Jesus" (as against typical narrative closes such as "They lived happily ever after"), the Bible has an unusual relationship to textuality: it is not literature in the way other texts are. Typical narrative plot structures existence retrospectively: the story is organized back from the conclusion. This retrospective organization is maximized by writing, which tightens plot and makes more of re-cognition, a kind of return to the beginning (the past) and hence a cyclic pattern. In addition to being related intimately to death, writing and print are also limitlessly fecund, the central forces in the evolution of consciousness, once they appear. The fecundity of writing and print, like other fecundity in human existence, is achieved by passage through death. "Unless the grain of wheat dies." The Word of God in the Person of Jesus Christ is conceived of by analogy with the spoken word. The Father speaks the Word, the Son (eo verbum quo filius); he does not write the Word, who would then by biblical attestation be not life but d~<br>

Issue: i272292<br>
Date: 1 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Llosa Roberto<br>
Abstract: Notre analyse repose sur deux hypothèses générales complémentaires. La première hypothèse affirme l'existence non pas d'une crise de la pensée politique mais de trois situations critiques auxquelles doit faire face le pensée politique et qui déterminent des formes d'incertitude spécifiques, irréductibles les unes aux autres. La deuxième hypothèse affirme que l'intelligibilité des crises que connaît la pensée politique passe par celle des conditions politiques dans lesquelles s'exerce cette pensée. Pour préciser ces deux hypothèses nous faisons appel à un modèle construit à partir de la structure d'une action. Trois formes d'incertitude sont ainsi repérées: une incertitude concernant les valeurs, une incertitude concernant l'état des choses et une incertitude portant sur les voies d'action. Transposées sur le plan ou la dimension de la structure sociale, ces trois formes d'incertitude sont à saisir et à examiner respectivement comme crise au niveau du système de légitimation et de motivation, comme crise au niveau du système organisationnel ou des institutions et comme crise au niveau des stratégies ou système "opérationnel". Nous localisons la première forme de crise dans les sociétés du capitalisme "central", la deuxième dans les formations sociales socialistes et la troisième dans les sociétés du capitalisme "périphérique". A partir d'une analyse des conditions politiques qui ont rendu possible l'émergence de ces formes spécifiques de crise nous essayons de déterminer au moins certaines conditions nécessaires--mais non pas suffisantes--de leur dépassement. /// Two general complementary hypotheses underlie this analysis. The first contends that, although political science does not confront a crisis, it faces three critical challenges giving rise to uncertainty in the discipline. The second hypothesis asserts that to understand the present challenges testing political theory, it is necessary to relate the latter to the prevailing political context. To clarify the tw~<br>

Author(s): Papastephanou Marianna<br>
Abstract: Rawls's recent modification of his theory of justice claims that political liberalism is free-standing and "falls under the category of the political. It works entirely within that domain and does not rely on anything outside it." In this article I pursue the metatheoretical goal of obtaining insight into the anthropological assumptions that have remained so far unacknowledged by Rawls and critics alike. My argument is that political liberalism has a dependence on comprehensive liberalism and its conception of a self-serving subjectivity that is far more binding as well as undesirable than it has been so far acknowledged. I proceed with a heuristic approach that introduces us to the possibility that political liberalism presupposes tacitly the Occidental metanarrative of reason harnessing rampant self-interest and subordinating it to a higher-order interest. As the presuppositions of political liberalism emerge, I draw from the debate between Rawls and Habermas in order to illustrate my argument for the existence of a dependence on these presuppositions. I outline some implications of the anthropological basis of political liberalism and conclude by exemplifying them with reference to Rawls's comments on the division of a cake.<br>

Abstract: Puritanism and Confucianism have little in common in terms of their substantive teachings, but they do share an emphasis on bounded, authoritative, localized human arrangements, and this profoundly challenges the dominant presumptions of contemporary globalization. It is not enough to say that these worldviews are "communitarian" alternatives to globalism, for that defines away what needs to be explained. This article compares the ontology of certain elements of the Puritan and Confucian worldviews, and, by focusing on the role of both authority and activity in these systems, assesses (with the assistance of Max Weber) the theories of harmony that each invoke. It concludes by identifying the distinct options that these two modes of human existence suggest for those who wish to defend the relevance of boundedness and authority, and thus the very possibility of a human-scaled politics, in today's world.<br>

Abstract: «[...] a small number of what I consider to be particularly important emblems, inserted in
key positions, bring the reader up with a jolt. These pivotal emblems are often those
which are visually most striking and most memorable, the ones in which the image itself
serves to deliver a vicious attack on the Roman Catholic church (18,32,35,37)», op. cit.,
p. 146; pour l'analyse de la structure générale, voir les pages 123 à 143.
La question posée au moins implicitement par A. Adams est celle de l'existence d'une
structure mnémotechnique. Cette hypothèse est clairement rejetée par Christophe Chaza-
lon en ce qui concerne les Icones, où « les cadres sont utilisés de façon totalement aléa-
toire » alors que « les portraits sont indifféremment de profil ou de 3/4, gauche ou droit, en
fonction des portraits qui ont servi de modèle.» (op. cit., p. 21, n. 62). D'une manière
générale, une utilisation consciente et systématique des principes de l'art de la mémoire
paraît peu probable lorsqu'on sait que les humanistes aussi bien catholiques que protes-
tants, s'inscrivant dans la tradition de Quintilien, ont adopté une attitude pour le moins
sceptique à l'égard de la mémoire artificielle. Frances A. Yates rappelle entre autres la
position de Melanchthon qui « interdit aux étudiants de recourir au moindre expédient
mnémotechnique, et [qui] les invite à apprendre par c ur de la façon normale, en voyant
là le seul art de la mémoire» (L'Art de la mémoire, Gallimard, 1975, p. 142).<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i20849541<br>

Author(s): Bouton Christophe<br>
Abstract: Cette étude se propose de poser la question de la source ou de l'origine du temps. Son fil conducteur est la célèbre définition heideggérienne de la temporalité dans le § 65 d'Être et temps: la temporalité, c'est-à-dire le temps originaire, est « l"ἐϰστατιϰόν sans réserves ». Il s'agit, dès lors: 1 / d'expliciter les significations de la notion d'ekstase à l'aide d'autres concepts qui lui sont liés (échappée, transport, projet, saut, élan, existence, etc.); et 2 / de confronter l'ekstase de la temporalité avec l"ἐϰστατιϰόν du temps physique chez Aristote, qui avait employé dans sa Physique (IV, 13, 222 b) le même terme mais en un sens opposé. De l'opposition entre temps destructeur de la nature et temporalité authentique du Dasein découle une nouvelle conception de la liberté humaine, comprise comme alternative entre ces deux figures du temps. En vertu de cette liberté, on peut dire que l'homme se tient à la source du temps, sans être lui-même la source du temps. Diese Studie versucht die Frage nach der Quelle bzw. dem Ursprung der Zeit zu stellen. Ihre Leitfaden ist Heideggers berühmte Definition der Zeitlichkeit in Sein und Zeit (§ 65): die Zeitlichkeit, d. h. die ursprüngliche Zeit, ist « das ἐϰστατιϰόν schlechthin ». So handelt es sich um 1 / die Bedeutungen des Begriffs « Ekstase » vermittels anderer verwandten Begriffe (Entrückung, Entwurf, Wurf, Sprung, Schwung, Eksistenz, usw.) zu erläutern; und 2 / die Ekstase der Zeitlichkeit mit dem ἐϰστατιϰόν der physischen Zeit bei Aristoteles zu vergleichen, der in der Physik (IV, 13, 222 b) das selbe Wort aber mit einem entgegengesetzten Sinn verwendet hatte. Aus dem Gegensatz zwischen der zerstörenden Zeit der Natur und der eigentlichen Zeitlichkeit des Daseins ergibt sich eine neue Auffassung der menschlichen Freiheit, als Alternative zwischen diesen beiden Gestalten der Zeit verstanden. Kraft dieser Freiheit kann man behaupten, daß der Mensch an der Quelle der Zeit steht, ohne die Quelle der Zeit selbst zu sein.<br>

Abstract: The works of Tiryakian, Bruyn and Douglas are examined as representative of "phenomenological sociology." Radical problems are discovered in their use of key concepts in phenomenology: intention, reduction, phenomenon and essence. These problems are shown to arise out of a failure to grasp the nature of the phenomenological enterprise and its relationship to sociology. Turning back to the original formulation of this relationship by Husserl, we discover problems of transcendental intersubjectivity, of type and essence, and of objectivism. We then point out the existence of sociologies which do not share the shortcomings of what is called phenomenological sociology, yet which make use of the perspective and approach of phenomenology. We then focus on one of these sociologies, ethnomethodology in its relation to phenomenology. We find parallels in their methodology and domains of inquiry, and divergency in their approaches to intersubjectivity.<br>

Abstract: When analysing the concept of social relationship, the link between a person and an individual, who from a sociological perspective do not have the same semantic value, needs to be reconsidered as whole. As an individual is typically enclosed in a social dimension, it cannot have a self-referential character. Instead, it tends to half-reveal the authentic foundation of the civil society on the basis of a range of values which, after leading to the recognition of the self, activate relationships with the social other and the rest of the world including the transcendental one. In fact, within the opening relationship it's possible to find the conscience of own existence, to purchase the awareness of own identities and to become responsible of own world of life. Considering the aspects of sociological compromise and moral quality of the afore-going, it is clear that socio-cultural exchanges — where relationship skills come clearly into play — are the heuristic foundation of the complex relationship between individuals and society. Consequently, such exchanges become social dynamics through which affective similarities and legitimate differences interact to build an ethical balance for society as well as support a differentiated development of social bonds.<br>

Author(s): Sahlins Marshall<br>
Abstract: A modest proposal for solving the 150-year-old problem of what kinship is, its specific quality, viz. mutuality of being: persons who are members of one another, who participate intrinsically in each other's existence. `Mutuality of being' applies as well to the constitution of kinship by social construction as by procreation, even as it accounts for `the mysterious effectiveness of relationality' (Viveiros de Castro), how it is that relatives live each other's lives and die each other's deaths. Involving such transpersonal relations of being and experience, kinship takes its place in the same ontological regime as magic, gift exchange, sorcery, and witchcraft. Une modeste proposition pour résoudre l'équation, vieille de 150 ans, de ce qu'est la parenté, sa spécificité, à savoir la mutualité d'existence: des personnes qui sont membres les unes des autres, qui participent à l'existence les unes des autres. La « mutualité d'existence » vaut aussi pour la constitution de lien de parenté par la construction sociale et la procréation, bien qu'elle tienne compte de « la mystérieuse efficacité de la relationalité » (Viveiros de Castro), de la manière dont les parents vivent les vies et meurent les morts des uns et des autres. La parenté, en mettant en jeu ces relations transpersonnelles d'existence et d'expérience, s'inscrit dans le même ordre ontologique que la magie, l'échange de cadeaux, la sorcellerie et la magie noire.<br>

Abstract: Social scientific explanations of the role of European law associations in the making of a new European legal order argue that they were critical in empowering the European Court of Justice and defining the results of European legal integration. However, these approaches fail to highlight the complex context in which these associations evolved. By exploring the history of the French Association des juristes européens from 1951 to 1970 on the basis of comprehensive archival material, this paper provides a more contextualised understanding of what appears as a struggle with limited impact on the French reception of European law. La recherche en sciences sociales sur le rôle d'associations nationales de juristes et de leur fédération dans l'élaboration d'un nouvel ordre juridique européen soutient qu'elles contribuèrent fortement à l'essor d'un droit spécifiquement européen. Néanmoins, cette recherche échoue à mettre en évidence la complexité du contexte dans lequel ces associations se sont développées. Fondé sur une documentation d'archives très complètes sur les premières années d'existence de l'Association française des juristes européens, cet article permet de mieux saisir les difficultés d'une lutte à l'effet limité sur la réception en France d'un droit fondamentalement européen entre 1951 et 1970. Sozialwissenschaftliche Erklärungen zur Rolle europäischer juristischer Vereinigungen beim Aufbau einer neuen europäischen Rechtsordnung argumentieren, dass sie beim Ermächtigen des Europäischen Gerichtshofs und Definieren der Ergebnisse der europäischen Rechtsintegration entscheidend gewesen seien.

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mank~<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: La très remarquable définition de la poésie envoyée par Mallarmé à Léo d'Orfer, directeur de La Vogue, et parue dans cette revue en avril 1886: "La Poésie est l'expression, par le langage humain ramené à son rythme essentiel, du sens mystérieux des aspects de l'existence: elle doue ainsi d'authenticité notre séjour et constitue la seule tâche spirituelle", peut servir de viatique pour se faire une idée relativement complète de la pensée de Mallarmé théoricien du langage comme de la pratique poétiques. Il apparaît ainsi que ses conceptions anticipent des courants philosophiques qui trouveront leur pleine expression à notre époque. Toutefois le théoricien ne fait pas ombrage au poète: une lecture du célèbre Sonnet en -yx montrant à l'œuvre les principes dégagés de la définition permet de révéler que le poème précède la théorie dont il est le creuset plutôt qu'il n'en découle.<br>

Abstract: Une fine analyse de la convergence des conceptions du Christ qu'a Origène et de l'Ecriture, met en scène non seulement la consistance interne et le fondement théorique de son exégèse christologique, mais nous présente également le récit que fait Origène de l'histoire du sens chrétien. Selon ce récit, le sens a premièrement une structure trinitaire: le Dieu unique en trois personnes, incorporel, est la source, le fondement et l'épanouissement de l'intelligibilité et de l'existence intellectuelle. Il a deuxièmement une structure christologique: le Fils est le sens ultime, en tant qu'à la fois, contenu objectif ou structure de sens (comme la Sagesse) et agent principal dans le processus subjectif de l'appropriation et de la communication du sens (comme la Parole). Cette simultanéité determine la conception qu'a Origène de la convergence du Christ et de l'Ecriture. Ainsi, le Logos est à la fois la source et le contenu du sens scripturaire, de même que le communicateur principal ou "exégète" de ce sens, cette dernière fonction étant remplie de la manière la plus remarquable dans l'Incarnation, qui est l'indice herméneutique central de l'Ecriture. De manière pratique, cela veut dire que le sens ultime, qui coïncide avec le sens "spirituel" de l'Ecriture est contenu objectivement dans la référence au Christ et subjectivement atteint en ayant "la pensée du Christ"; son accomplissement réside dans la rencontre du lecteur ou exégète avec le Christ.<br>

Abstract: Abordaremos a autobiografia de Malcolm X (1925-1965) sob o prisma de uma hermenêutica do testemunho: ao aplicar a hermenêutica do testemunho na referida autobiografia, identificaremos as duas profundas transformações psicológicas e espirituais sofridas por Malcolm X, transformações indissociáveis de uma mudança na sua relação com a transcendência, o Islamismo e a comunidade afro-americana do seu tempo. Trata-se, em última análise, de percorrer a evolução de uma consciência humana que se cumpre e se manifesta na religiosidade (não-violência) e no testemunho. Neste estudo, o rito aparecerá como "passagem" no contexto da (re-)integração e (re)educação segundo o modelo da adoração (Mestre/discípulo), mediada pelo desejo mimético, cuja função é purgativa e fundacional porque reorientadora da existência do discípulo. O rito será visto ainda como "sinal da aceitação do testemunho". No contexto de testemunho, extrairemos ainda uma noção de coragem, integrante de noções contemporâneas. We will approach the autobiography of Malcolm X (1925-1965) from the point of view of a hermeneutics of testimony: on applying the hermeneutics of testimony in the said autobiography, we will identify the two deep psychological and spiritual transformations suffered by Malcolm X, transformations that can't be separated from a change in his relationship with the transcendence; the Islamism and the African American community of his time, being, ultimately, the go through of the evolution of human consciousness that meets and manifests itself in religion (non-violence) and witness. In this study, the rite will appear as "passage" in the context of (re-) integration and (re-)education according to the model of worship (master/disciple), taking part in the mimetic desire, whose function is purgative and functional because reorienting the existence of the disciple, the rite is still seen as "a sign of acceptance of the witness." Even in the context of testimony, we will demonstrate a sense of courag~<br>

Abstract: The myth of Śunaḥśepa (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 7.13-18) constitutes a primary acknowledgment by brahmanic tradition of the existence of peoples living outside of the varṇa system. The principal themes of this account served as the grounds for a socio-religious ideology that continued to develop throughout the history of brahmanic literature. This ideology established an opposition between the center—authority, sacrifice and cows of the brahmin Vasiṣtḥa; and the periphery—antinomian power and asceticism of the non-brahmin Viśvāmitra, and haunt of marginals and their dogs. This ideology breaks down in late variants of this myth, in which the expanded universe of bhakti can even encompass the excluded. Le mythe de Śunaḥśepa (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, 7.13-18) constitue un premier constat par la tradition brahmanique de l'existence de peuples hors du système des varṇa. A partir des éléments principaux de ce récit, une idéologie socioreligieuse ne cessera de s'élaborer à travers l'histoire de la littérature hindoue. Cette idéologie opposera au centre, à l'autorité et au sacrifice du brahmane Vasiṣtḥa vivant par ses vaches, la périphérie : « chaos » dominé par le pouvoir antinomien de l'ascète non brahmane Viśvāmitra, où les exclus vivent par leurs chiens. Dans des variantes tardives de ce mythe, il y a un effritement de cette idéologie, du fait que l'univers élargi de la bhakti englobe même les exclus.<br>

Author(s): Cerar Miro<br>
Abstract: The law is, on the one hand, always to some extent an expression of the dominant political power and ideology, while on the other hand it is relatively autonomous towards politics and other value-normative social phenomena, such as morality, customs, and religion. Despite the fact that from the deepest ontological perspective the separate existence of law and politics is an illusion, this separation must be acknowledged and maintained in our social life. The more autonomous the law, the more it develops its specific ideology. The latter can either serve as an appropriate counterbalance to the excessive tendencies of politics, or it can be abused for different political purposes. In the first case, we can speak about the constructive role of the law vs. politics, while in the second case its role is (self)destructive. In the first case different checks and balances between law and politics serve democratic society, while in the second case the differences between both phenomena are blurred, which leads to authoritarianism or totalitarianism.<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i23730893<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Scuccimarra Luca<br>
Abstract: Moving from Koselleck's most recent essays on Historik, the author explores the role played by historiography in the constitution of historicity as a peculiar experiential dimension of human existence. The essay focuses on the complex link between difference and repetition which, according to Koselleck's theory of experience, constitutes a "specific historical temporality" and its inner articulation. Actually, it is by exploring the "formal temporal structures" which constitute the horizon of historical intelligibility that Koselleck brings to light the decisive role that the point of view of historiography has for the constitution of man as the subject of historical knowledge and action. It is difficult to ignore the importance of this theory of historical temporalization in an age in which the End of History rhetoric tends to transform itself in a sort of media gospel.<br>

Abstract: This article takes a close look at the iconographic construction of the so-called "otherness" in Spain between 1936 and 1945. During this three year period of civil unrest, the Franco regime set out to cast the defeated half of the war as an inimical "other." In this process of building an impression of the "other," the "New State," created after April 1, 1939, played an important role, since in many ways the existence of this enemy "other" could favour unity between the rest, or "us." The State used mandatory education as an efficient socialization tool in this process. The text looks at the different ways in which the image of the "other" was used in books that taught History, Civic Education and Patriotic Education in primary school.<br>

Abstract: Au Japon où se côtoient et s'imbriquent deux religions, le bouddhisme dont on connaît la richesse iconographique et le shintô, aniconique, l'identification très systématique des dieux et des bouddhas atteste de la porosité des catégories d'existants visibles ou invisibles. Si, pour certains, les bouddhas sont les formes originelles des dieux locaux, pour d'autres, ils n'en sont que les émanations. Cette incertitude théologique rend sujette à débats la présence des entités vénérées aussi bien que la nature de leur figuration, à la fois corps, représentation et substitut. Les spectacles populaires de marionnettes, des objets animés bons à brouiller les catégories du vivant et de l'inerte, laissent accroire qu'une forme de ruse rituelle, le simulacre, permet d'animer une statue inauthentique ou de transformer un corps d'homme vulgaire en un dieu vivant. La croyance en l'existence d'êtres surhumains se forge dans le rituel où substitué et substituant sont soigneusement confondus grâce à des mises en scène humaines ou divines qui dévoilent un monde où les possibilités de transformations seraient autres qu'ici-bas. In Japan, where two religions coexist and overlap, Buddhism known for its iconographic wealth and Shinto, aniconic, the very systematic identification of gods and Buddhas attests to the porosity of the categories of visible or invisible existing entities. If for some Buddhas are the original forms of local gods, for others they are just manifestations. This theological uncertainty allows us to debate the presence of worshiped entities as well as the nature of their representation, both body, representation and substitute. Popular puppet shows, animated objects blurring the categories of living and inert entities, let people believe that some form of ritual ruse, the simulacrum, can animate an inauthentic statue or transform a common man's body into a living god. Belief in the existence of supernatural beings is forged in the ritual in which the substituted and ~<br>

Abstract: Language and judicial activities are both signs of the existence of a society. There is, therefore, good reason for a dialogue between the science of language and the science of law. This article applies a linguistic theory of the Paris School (semiotics) to the examination of a legal text, namely a contract. The author points to some elements shared by legal and other texts, and demonstrates how a semiotic interpretation can provide interesting and unexpected insights into the deeper levels of a legal text. He concludes that a similar approach could fruitfully be used with other types of legal text.<br>

Abstract: Albert Camus's interrogation of the ethical and spiritual vacuity of the twentieth century convinced him that authentic political existence requires a vision that embraces while transcending the human condition. He found his ethical model in art. The work of the artist can be analogous to that of the just political actor. The principal components of ethical political being are all present in Camus's aesthetics: a vision of life in human community (lucidity), a grounded sense of justice subject to the limitations of human existence (beauty), a need to redress the defects of political reality (the urge to create), and an understanding that any structural solution is of necessity temporary (the need to rearticulate the initial vision). Camus's vision requires him to reject our positive political categories in the name of creative, grounded human being.<br>

Abstract: Rav H̱isday Crescas (1340-1410/11), Rabbi of Aragonese Jewry in Christian Spain and a major figure in medieval Jewish philosophy, is unique in positing an all-embracing thesis of Love. This thesis permeates his theories of cosmogony, metaphysics and theology and generates far-reaching didactic implications. This article examines Crescas' rather bold description of Love as a positive Divine attribute, an anthropopathism meant to convey ontological meaning about the Divine Nature via an analogous construct. Themes such as Infinite Goodness, Joy and Kindness enable Rav H̱isday to structure a new conception of the Creator and Providence. After postulating Divine Love as the Cosmic Force sustaining creation, Crescas explains the purpose of Torah and mitzvot in terms of evoking love for God thus drawing the soul to link up to the Divine Overflow of Love. Even spiritual existence after death is explicated in terms of the soul's love for its Divine Source. To understand Crescas' unique theory of Love, we compare it with the views of his predecessors and analyze his use of philosophic sources such as the 5th century BCE pre-Socratic scientist-mystic Empedocles. We examine educational aspects of Crescas' teachings on love and view them in context of the mass conversions to Christianity resulting from the 1391 riots. Finally, Crescas' ideas are read as pedagogical messages relevant to both Jews and conversos in the twenty traumatic years after 1391 when he served as chief rabbi and political leader in Saragossa.<br>

Abstract: In this introduction to HSR Supplement 26, the findings of the journal Historical Social Research from 2004 to 2014 are presented. With the journal being in its 40th year of existence, one could split the journal's history into three phases: First, the constitutional period (1976-1988), then, second, the establishing period (1988-2000). The third period consists of the last 10-14 years. It may be characterized by processes of focusing, digitalization and internationalization, and it is this third period which is the subject of this article. In a short overview, some developments with respect to the contents are highlighted. Afterward, some structural changes in HSR publication formats and journal management are given. Finally, the article presents some bibliometric analyses, particularly concerning download and citation statistics.<br>

Abstract: Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855) prepared the ground for individual fighters on philosophical-literary topics in the twentieth Century. In his writings he chooses the most varying problems as a starting point for his assessment of the existing relations between the Church and the World. As Kierkegaard fights for the individual, he criticizes the power of the masses over the quality of life of the individual citizen. He also criticizes the moralizing attempts of the "paid" clergy to make their demands on the individual believer. Following Theodor W. Adorno, Kierkegaard is to be read with a permanent considération for Kierkegaard himself. Autobiographical notices make it clear, that he is caught up in a constant struggle with himself. His both happy and tragical relationship with Regine Olson, which ended when he broke off their engagement, was the décisive impulse for him to become a "religious writer". It is to his former fiancée and his father that he dedicates his life's work, in which mostly Pseudonyms – as an indirect way of communication – express his existence. Kierkegaard mentions three essential levels or stages of life: the aesthetical outlook on life and the ethical, both of which are "catégories", finally, the religious outlook, which is more an "atmosphère". These stages can both follow each other, and also pervade one another. They are accompanied by the borderline catégories of irony and humour. These three phases do not simply depict a mode of abstract thinking, but also deal with concrète situations in life, as are those involved in passion, fear, misery and despair.<br>

Author(s): d'Allonnes Myriam Revault<br>
Abstract: Il faut souligner que l'autorité éducative ou pédagogique ne se décline pas de la même
manière que l'autorité institutionnelle ou politique. La dissymétrie générationnelle qui, dans la
famille ou les institutions éducatives, justifie ou légitime la « supériorité » de celui à qui on
reconnaît l'autorité n'est pas immédiatement transposable au rapport politique sauf à identifier
ce dernier à l'organisation patriarcale ou domestique, ce que la philosophie politique récuse
depuis Aristote. Le rapport politique qui s'exerce entre égaux n'est ni le pouvoir du maître d'es-
claves sur sa maisonnée ni celui du chef de famille sur ses enfants. En matière éducative, l'au-
torité des adultes s'exerce sur des êtres humains en devenir. Lorsqu'on parle d'éducation à la
citoyenneté, celle-ci doit s'opérer dans des lieux institutionnels censés préparer à l'existence
dans le monde. Mais en aucun cas la politique ne se propose d'« éduquer » les adultes comme
s'il s'agissait de les faire accéder à la « maturité » sauf précisément à instaurer une conception
« autoritaire » (infantilisante) du rapport politique. La dissymétrie générationnelle dans
laquelle s'enracine l'autorité éducative a partie liée avec la générativité de la durée publique
mais elles ne se confondent pas. À cet égard, le noyau de l'autorité politique reste bien plus
opaque que celui de l'autorité pédagogique ou parentale.<br>

Abstract: On a désigné par « École du droit naturel » tout ce courant de penseurs attachés à
défendre, comme 1'Antigone de Sophocle, la « loi non-écrite » présente au plus profond de nos
cœurs (par opposition aux lois écrites de la Cité). Ainsi Cicéron, dans l'esprit de l'universalisme
religieux stoïcien, écrit dans le De legibus (I, 5-6) que la nature du droit doit être recherchée
dans la nature même de l'homme comme la « règle suprême immanente » à celle-ci (De répub.
III, 22. Le Pro Milone évoque une « loi non-écrite, mais innée » : non scripta sed nata lex). Mais
il faut attendre la réflexion des théologiens du Moyen Âge pour tirer toutes les conséquences de
l'idée d'une liberté avec sa « destinée » affranchie par le christianisme de la loi du Destin
antique. Ainsi, comme rappelé déjà plus haut, un saint Thomas d'Aquin fait de la lex naturalis
ce que les hommes peuvent comprendre par leur seule raison de la loi divine révélée (lex
aeterno), notamment le Décalogue, et en la distinguant de la lex humana (créée par l'homme).
Au XVIe siècle qui voit « l'essor de la philosophie politique », cette tradition scolastique va trou-
ver un développement tout à fait remarquable à travers un double courant catholique et protes-
tant. Bellarmin, Molina, Suarez, Vitoria, Théodore de Bèze (successeur de Calvin à Genève) font
référence explicite au « droit naturel » pour fonder et limiter la souveraineté politique, pour
reconnaître un droit de résistance au tyran, pour affirmer enfin l'existence d'un droit internatio-
nal et défendre en particulier, comme le fit Bartolomi Las Casas, les Indiens contre les colonisa-
teurs espagnols. Assurément, c'est sur le terreau de cette riche et noble tradition où a soufflé
l'esprit du parfait humanisme chrétien illustré par un Érasme et un Thomas More que germèrent
les idées généreuses qui devaient éclore au grand jour avec une portée universelle en 1789.
Au XVIIe siècle, avec des juristes comme Grotius et Pufendorf, on assiste à la sécularisation

pas en avoir. Cette conquête de la psychologie était indispensable pour intégrer des faits, des
méthodes et des résultats; mais elle est inacceptable comme telle par le philosophe qui doit
tenter de dire ce qu'est dans le sujet même le mode d'existence dont l'inconscient freudien n'est
que l'équivalent objectif. »<br>

Abstract: Comme l'indique par exemple Jeanne Hersch, elle ne trouve son caractère d'impératif
qu'en s'arrachant aux conditions temporelles d'existence et en «s'érigeant dans l'absolu». En
même temps, elle n'a de sens que pour un être temporel et dans une situation temporelle. Le
problème moral se pose toujours « en termes temporels concrets : circonstances léguées par le
passé, conséquences probables, possibilités d'interventions efficaces », voir « L'exigence morale
aux prises avec le temps », Revue de métaphysique et de morale, n° 4, 1955, p. 413.<br>

Abstract: Que signifie, pour le christianisme, l'existence du judaïsme en son cœur même? Peut-on parler, et en quel sens, d'une nouveauté chrétienne, et si oui, moyennant quelle fidélité et quelle « trahison » par rapport au judaïsme de l'Ancien Testament? En conférant aux « nations » l'héritage juif, les chrétiens ne l'ont-ils pas radicalement tronqué, faussé peut-être? En tout cas il apparaît que les « malheurs » du christianisme reposent souvent sur l'oubli de sa racine juive.<br>

Abstract: Après l'évocation de la longue gestation du MiR, l'auteure passe en revue la collection permanente et ses multiples aménagements depuis l'ouverture de ce lieu muséal en 2005, primé en 2007 par le Conseil de l'Europe. Elle aborde ensuite les questions essentielles engendrées par l'existence de ce lieu: celle des conditions d'exposition du patrimoine immatériel, celle des deux écueils fondamentaux liés à la démarche muséale – l'identité et la mémoire – et enfin celle du sens même d'un musée protestant. After summarizing the long gestation of the International Reformation Museum, the author describes the permanent collection and its numerous modifications since the opening in 2005 of the museum, which was awarded the prize of the Council of Europe in 2007. She then discusses some essential questions stemming from the existence of this centre: how to present an exhibition of a non-physical heritage; how to avoid the two basic problems inherent in any museum project – identity and memory; finally the very meaning of a Protestant museum. Nach einem Überblick über die lange Entstehungsgeschichte des Internationale Reformationsmuseum stellt die Verfasserin die Dauerausstellung mit ihren wiederholten Umgestaltungen seit der Eröffnung des Museums im Jahre 2005 und seiner 2007 erfolgten Auszeichnung durch den Europarat vor. Anschließend geht sie den grundlegenden Fragen nach, die sich aus der Existenz einer solchen Einrichtung ergeben: der Frage nach den Sachzwängen einer Austellung immateriellen Kulturerbes, der Frage nach den zwei hauptsächlichen Schwierigkeiten, die jedes museale Projekt meistern muß, nämlich Identität und Erinnerung in Einklang zu bringen, und schließlich der Frage nach dem eigentlichen Sinn und Zweck eines protestantischen Museums.<br>

Publisher: McGill<br>
Issue: i24352116<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Gaillard Emilie<br>
Abstract: Faire appel à la notion de crimes contre les générations futures est assurément la marque de la progression d'une nouvelle conscience de responsabilité envers l'avenir, la condition humaine future, les autres espèces vivantes et l'environnement. Elle contribue à un changement de paradigme temporel déjà en marche aussi spécifique que nécessaire à notre temps. Reflet d'un nouvel imaginaire international, le projet de formalisation de crimes contre les générations futures recèle des potentialités de transformations inédites et puissantes sur le champ juridique. En prenant appui sur les théories éthiques de la responsabilité transgénérationnelle, il est permis de fournir un éclairage spécifique de la notion de crimes contre les générations futures. Des affinements théoriques peuvent s'avérer nécessaires en considération du contexte de connaissances. C'est une véritable conversion intellectuelle qui se profile avec l'admission d'un principe de non-discrimination temporelle en vertu duquel l'absence d'existence temporelle ne serait plus synonyme d'absence de droits ni de garantie juridique. Une complexification des logiques juridiques pour la mise en œuvre des crimes contre les générations futures est alors imaginable. Formuler des crimes contre les générations futures est également maïeutique en ce qu'ils appellent dans leur sillage la consécration d'un principe de dignité des générations futures. Un tel principe insufflerait une dynamique de recomposition du droit des droits de l'homme en l'ouvrant à la perspective transgénérationnelle. Des perspectives prospectives pour la notion de crimes contre les générations futures sont ouvertes avec l'idée d'intégrer également la protection de la condition humaine future. Quelques mises en garde prospectives sont formulées. Evoking the notion of crimes against future generations is certainly an indication of the development of a new awareness regarding accountability for the future of human, other living species and the environme~<br>

l'accident étant, du fait de son extériorité par rapport au plan de la génération
et de la puissance (E 2, 1027a7), qualifié de « voisin du non-être » (έγγύς τι

Abstract: Concerning the modern discussion about the relation between event and narration and "Time and Narration" (Paul Ricœur) the author asks about the relation between entanglement and narration in Wilhelm Schapps philosophy of stories. The philosophy of stories does not approve a systematisation of the topic but does allow its discussion under various aspects. Among those, the author chooses the existence of narrations in the stories of the entangled, the silent speaking, the entanglement in a positive world and the relation between the story of one's life and poetry. The essay also is a contribution to basic questions of narrative ethics.<br>

Publisher: FELIX MEINER VERLAG<br>
Issue: i24358589<br>

Author(s): Bonnemann Jens<br>
Abstract: In ethics, when discussing problems of justice and a just social existence one question arises obviously: What is the normal case of the relation between I and you we start from? In moral philosophy, each position includes basic socio–anthropological convictions in that we understand the other, for example, primarily as competitor in the fight for essential resources or as a partner in communication. Thus, it is not the human being as isolated individual, or as specimen of the human species or socialised member of a historical society what needs to be understood. Instead, the individual in its relation to the other or others has been studied in phenomenology and the philosophy of dialogue of the twentieth century. In the following essay I focus on Martin Buber's and Jean–Paul Sartre's theories of intersubjectivity which I use in order to explore the meaning of recognition and disrespect for an individual. They offer a valuable contribution to questions of practical philosophy and the socio–philosophical diagnosis of our time.<br>

Article Title: THE HEIDEGGERIAN BIAS TOWARD DEATH: A CRITIQUE OF THE ROLE OF BEING-TOWARDS-DEATH IN THE DISCLOSURE OF HUMAN FINITUDE<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>

Date: 4 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): MacAVOY LESLIE<br>
Abstract: In this paper I take issue with Heidegger's use of the concept of death as a means of disclosing human finitude. I argue that Being-towards-death is inadequate to the disclosure of Dasein's thrownness which is necessary for the kind of authentic historizing that Heidegger describes and furthermore leads to a reading of authenticity which is preclusive of Being-with-Others. I suggest that this difficulty may be alleviated through increased attention to the opposite boundary of Dasein's existence, namely its birth. Although I do not pursue the project here of conducting a phenomenology of birth, I suggest some directions for proceeding with that task, and I illustrate that a greater emphasis on Dasein's beginning will increase the richness of our understanding of our Being-with-Others.<br>

Abstract: All humans by nature desire to know and humans are distinguished from the rest of creation by the miracle of knowledge. If all cultures have developed their own forms of knowledge, the spectacular success of a certain form of knowledge, science, notably in the west, has frequently led to its being exclusively attributed to the west. Yet science remains only one of many forms of knowledge and the west only one of its producers. The success of the west has tended to marginalize other forms of knowledge and other contributions to knowledge and, thus to impoverish an otherwise potentially rich and complex world knowledge landscape. It has tended to inhibit or even prevent the development of a really universal, human-knowledge project. Its very success, due essentially to its sustained application to technology, has enabled the development of a false superiority over other forms of knowledge and a real power hegemony of the west over other peoples. The future of lasting peaceful co-existence in the world may depend, in part, on the emancipation of other knowledge modes and forms. De par leur nature, tous les êtres humains éprouvent le désir de savoir, et les humains se distinguent des autres êtres de la Création par le miracle de la connaissance. Bien que toutes les cultures aient développé leurs propres formes de connaissance, le succès spectaculaire, notamment en Europe, d'une forme particulière de la connaissance, la science, a fait que cette dernière a été exclusivement attribuée à l'Occident. Pourtant, la science ne représente qu'une des nombreuses formes de la connaissance et l'Occident n'est qu'un producteur de celle-ci, parmi tant d'autres. Le succès de l'Occident a contribué à marginaliser les autres formes de connaissance et autres contributions à la connaissance, et ainsi, a fini par appauvrir le paysage international de la connaissance, qui autrement, aurait pu être extrêmement riche et diversifié. Ce succès de l'Occident a fini par inhiber, voire empêcher le~<br>

Abstract: This article explores the narrative representation of the desert in Leslie Silko's Ceremony and Ibrahim Al-Koni's The Bleeding of the Stone. In both novels, the physical is transformed into an existential realm, through which questions about human existence are raised. The desert is a microcosm that allows for a re-enactment of the story of creation. It is also the catalyst in the protagonists' initiation processes and the loci for the ceremonies necessary for restoring balance in the universe. But whereas Silko's novel celebrates desert myths as the infallible source of wisdom, Al-Koni's text regards the desert as a stimulus for Sufi quest. يلفتنا في كثير من روايات إبراهيم الكوني النظر إلى الصحراء بوصفها وسيله إلى فهم الحياه نفسها، حيث تبدو مركز العالم، وما سواها هو الهامش وأهله الأغيار، كما أن حقيقة الإنسان هي حقيقة الصحراء. ونجد أنفسنا في روايات ليزلي مارمون سيلكو بإزاء نصوص تستحضر الأرض بحيث تدمج بين الزمني والفضائي، وتبني الأسطورة الضاربة في عمق الزمن واللاوعي، وذلك في اﻵني والمعيش وفضاء الشخصيات المتفاعلة. تحاول المقالة استكشاف التمثيل السردﻱ للصحراء على مستوى الرؤية والتقنيات في رواية نزيف الحجر للكوني والطقوس لسيلكو، ملقية الضوء على نقاط الالتقاء والاختلاف بين عالميهما، وصولاﹰ إلى تأويل علاقة النص بالصحراء والعالم .<br>

Abstract: El texto busca mostrar cómo Pío IX y su más conocido documento, el Syllabus errorum, publicado en 1864, participan del fin de una era multisecular en la historia del catolicismo, caracterizada por la existencia de un dominio temporal pontificio, por un vínculo afectivo de la Iglesia católica con la monarquía como forma de gobierno y por la concepción de la fe católica como única vía para la salvación. Fin de una era, no solo desde la perspectiva de la vigencia de las instituciones, sino de las representaciones que las acompañan. La demostración se apoya en un análisis de los tiempos en que el pontífice y su documento se enmarcan, desde la perspectiva braudeliana de los tiempos históricos, así como en las categorías propuestas por R. Koselleck para el estudio de la experiencia del tiempo. This article aims to show how Pius X and his most famous document, the Syllabus of Errors, published in 1864, participated in the end of a centuries-old era in the history of Catholicism that was characterized by the existence of the temporal dominion of the Popes, close ties between the Catholic Church and monarchism as a form of government and the conception of the Catholic faith as the only road to salvation. This was the end of an era, not just from the perspective of the power of institutions, but also in terms of the representations that accompanied them. The article is supported by a Braudelian analysis of the times in which the Pope and his document belonged and makes use of the categories proposed by R. Koselleck for the study of the experience of time.<br>

Author(s): Marder Michael<br>
Abstract: The goal of "Phenomenology of Distraction" is to explore the imbrication of attention and distraction within existential spatiality and temporality. First, I juxtapose the Heideggerian dispersion of concern (which includes, among other things, the attentive comportment) in everyday life, conceived as a way to get distracted from one's impending mortality, to Fernando Pessoa's embracing of the inauthentic, superficial, and restless existence, where attention necessarily reverts into distraction. Second, I consider the philosophical confessions of St. Augustine and Jean-Jacques Rousseau as evidence for the proto-phenomenological temporal synthesis that hinges upon distraction and dispersion, despite the confessors' best efforts to pay attention to their inner life and to concentrate it in the eternal present. The paper concludes with an assessment of the ethical effects of mutual distraction, outlining a model of "distracted intersubjectivity."<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i24659515<br>
Date: 1 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Kearney Richard<br>
Abstract: This essay discusses the anatheist option of returning to God after the atheistic critique of the traditional God of ontotheology. It begins by reviewing the contributions that Levinas and Derrida have made toward this position and the atheistic criticisms of Freud and Nietzsche. The work of Paul Ricoeur is then discussed, showing how the atheist critique is a necessary moment in the development of genuine faith that involves a renunciation of fear and dependency as well as a reaffirmation of life and a return to existence. Kearney goes on to discuss how this return to God is possible, considering the ethical position that makes it possible, the reinterpretations of biblical traditions that it entails, the relationship between the anatheist philosopher and the theologian, and revival of God as an enabling God.<br>

Abstract: The fact that the generation of both soul (supra-temporally) and body (temporally) derive
from the pre-existence of the already created whole man, understood as entirely contained in
the heart or soul as the radical religious root of personality, underscores the claims of those
who, following Vollenhoven's problem-historical method, find some sort of "priority theme"
or "monarchian" element in Dooyeweerd's thinking, along with some variety of "instru-
mentalism" and "impetus theory" (see, e.g., Vollenhoven's "De consequent probleem-
historische méthode," Philosophia reformata 26 (1961), 19-22, cited in Steen, Structure, p. 43, n.
5; cf. Steen, Ibid., pp. 57-74,102-104, and Fernhout, op.cit. (see above n. 7), pp. 7, 72-109).<br>

others, real orimagined.<br>

Issue: i24709683<br>
Date: 1 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Glas Gerrit<br>
Abstract: In the passage at issue Cooper quotes Dooyeweerd via the English translation of Ber-
kouwer (1957). Berkouwer in turn quoted Dooyeweerd's (1940, 181) article on the problem of
time, which does contain the passage about the human soul which "naar het getuigenis van de
Schrift door den tijdelijlten dood niet getroffen wordt, maar ook na de aflegging van het
"lichaam", d.i. van heel den tijdelijken in individualiteits-structuur besloten beslaansvorm, blijft
voortbestaan." But the translation is incorrect! The translators of Berkouwer's book rendered
the passage as follows: "The soul. Scripture shows, is not affected by temporal death, but after
the end of the body (i.e. of all the temporal aspects of man), it continues as a form of existence
with an individuality structure" (Cooper 1989, 251). The Dutch text, Berkouwer (1957, 285,
note 148), quotes Dooyeweerd correctly. In Dooyeweerd the term 'individuality structure'
refers to the body; the translators related it, wrongly, to the soul. It is likely that this has
occasioned Cooper's misunderstanding. The passage should read: "As Scripture testifies, [the
human soul] is not touched by temporal death, but continues to exist even after the shedding
of the 'body', i.e. [the shedding] of the entire temporal, individuality-structure-enclosed form of
existence."<br>

Abstract: This paper argues against the all too common dichotomy of globalization into a process of homogenization or a process of significant diversification. The paper seeks to bridge this dichotomy by arguing for the relative autonomy of culture with respect to global political-economy, for the plurality of voices that constitute ongoing social interaction, and for a vision of actors operating in fields of power that position human agents differentially. The essay makes use of world systems theory to illustrate the merits and problems of global analysis while focussing on the ethnographic examples of French and Michigan wine growers. /// L'article s'inscrit en faux contre la vision dichotomique et récurrente de la mondialisation selon laquelle il s'agit soit d'un processus d'homogénéisation, soit d'un profond processus de diversification. L'article cherche à surmonter cette dichotomie en soutenant l'existence d'une autonomie relative des cultures face à l'économie politique mondiale, d'une pluralité des voix qui constituent les interactions sociales en cours et d'une vision qui situe les acteurs au sein de cercles de pouvoir qui leur imposent des positions différentielles. L'essai se sert de la théorie des systèmes-monde pour illustrer le bien-fondé et les défauts des analyses de niveau mondial. Il met l'accent sur des exemples ethnographiques de viticulteurs de la France et du Michigan.<br>

Abstract: Social scientists who study peasant groups in Brazil have come across some unfamiliar expressions. In searching for an explanatory analogical key which would make a translation possible, economic and political referents have commonly been used. The author argues that one must take seriously the existence of a 'biblical culture' that cannot be simply reduced to other codes. This is illustrated by the notion of captivity which has usually been taken as refering to authoritarianism, capitalism, expropriation, proletarianization, etc. The author suggests that although contextually all this may be true, the main reference has to do with what Paul Ricoeur has termed the symbolism of evil. Empirical material drawn from his own and other social scientists' researches in the Amazon is used to illustrate this possibility, which seems to bear significant theoretical and political consequences. Symbolism, the notion of text as regards the relation between cultural phenomenon and social conditions, the relation between autonomy and dependence, different notions of time and history are some of the themes that come up either as new perspectives regarding old issues or as subproducts of this line of reasoning. Los científicos sociales que estudian grupos campesinos en Brasil han descubierto expresiones poco usuales para ellos. Buscando una clave explicativa analógica que hiciera posible una traducción, se han usado generalmente ciertos referentes de naturaleza económica y política. El autor argumenta que es necesario tomar en serio la existencia de una 'cultura bíblica,' que no puede ser simplemente reducida a otro código. Eso se ilustra con la noción de cautiverio, que normalmente se entiende como referencia al autoritarismo, al capitalismo, a la expropiación, a la proletarización, etc. El autor sugiere que, aunque todo eso pueda ser verdad contextualmente, la referencia principal tiene que ver con lo que Paul Ricoeur denominara simbolismo del mal, lo que a su vez se articula con ~<br>

Abstract: When prehistoric archaeologists write accounts of the Epi-palaeolithic or Neolithic of southwest Asia, they resort to an archaic narrative style of culture-history that was formulated by Gordon Childe in the first half of the last century. These narratives frame their account of events within the format of a succession of archaeological cultures. In addition, the received form of the narrative is founded within a core-area of the Levant, the Mediterranean corridor zone; it is assumed that all the important social and economic innovations of the Epi-palaeolithic and early Neolithic occurred within that corridor, from where the cultures and their innovations spread through diffusionary processes to dominate wider parts of the region. The first part of this paper is a critique of the unwarranted assumption of the existence of archaeological cultures, and of the Levantine primacy hypothesis. The second part proposes an alternative to the notion of the archaeological culture. First, we review the evidence for wide-area cultural networking through the exchange of goods and materials and the sharing of cultural behaviours that characterises the Neolithic. We can view the Epi-palaeolithic and early Neolithic periods as a time when new cultural processes were being employed to build and maintain novel sedentary, permanently co-resident communities of unprecedented scale. At a higher level, we see communities engaged in the construction and maintenance of more and more extensive networks of communities, in a form similar to, but not identical with, the peer polity interaction sphere model first described by Colin Renfrew in a different context.<br>

Abstract: La traduction de servus par 'esclave' pour la période tardo-médiévale au cours de
laquelle écrit Buridan ne va pas de soi et exige quelques précisions. 11 est vrai que le terme
'esclavage' n'apparaît qu'au XVIe siècle avec l'avènement de la traite vers le Nouveau Monde et
que les médiévaux n'ont de conscience des réalités de l'esclavage antique qu'à travers leur
connaissance des auteurs classiques, dont Sénèque. Lorsqu'ils emploient 'servus', leur perspec-
tive n'est pas historique: le terme désigne communément dans le latin médiéval le 'serf et la
pratique du servage. Pourtant, en choisissant de traduire servus par 'esclave', nous entendons
ancrer les réflexions des théoriciens dans le contexte de la sémantique aristotélicienne autant
que dans le substrat de culture classique et de référence latine qui structure leurs argumenta-
tions; par endroit, nous traduisons servus par 'serviteur' pour une plus grande justesse selon
le contexte de la discussion. Quoi qu'il en soit des choix de traductions, nous ne sommes
donc pas dupes de la distance entre le langage scolastique ainsi influencé par la tradition clas-
sique et les complexités juridiques des diverses servitudes médiévales. Sur ce point, voir D.
Barthélémy, « Postface», de M. Bloch, Rois et serß. Un chapitre d'histoire capétienne et autres
écrits sur le servage, Pairs, rééd. 1996, p. 331 : «Il faut mesurer les écarts entre l'idée juridique
(esclavage antique, servage médiéval) et la complexité concrète des servitudes». Si le terme
reste issu du latin classique et renvoie aux réalités sociopolitiques des communautés antiques,
au Moyen Age cependant, il peut recouvrer indistinctement toutes les formes de dépendan-

Abstract: According to recent analyses, we are said to be witnessing in the West a « naturalisation » of filiation. The present article challenges this hypothesis, based on anthropological and historical analyses of old “parallel” kinships and the new forms of family configurations. It recalls the longstanding reference to nature in the representations and uses of kinship and the existence of a metaphorical and symbolic world characterised both in the past and today by the plurality of meanings given to kinship relations.<br>

Abstract: From the perspective of Gabriel Marcel’s juvenile writings, most notably
         Fragments Philosophiques(1909-1914) andJournal Métaphysique(1914-1923), this study discuss the first theoretical statute of the experience of God. This reflexive movement, strictly speaking, phenomenological-existential is based (as background) on the critique of absolute knowledge (modern idealism and scientism) which, according to Marcel, is an unavoidable contradiction: at the same time, it affirms the being, it denies the being. What draws attention is the fact that such explanatory model is transposed and, therefore, applied using the classical formulation of the so-called problem of the existence of God, of which theodicy has one of the most eloquent and emblematic metaphysical discourses. For the young French thinker, God cannot be verified or justified as an ontological proof: God is the Inverifiable Absolute, since it has to be experienced in the act of faith, in the expression of love and grace.<br>

Abstract: Dans un article d'un récent numéro
de Sociologie de l'art consacré aux objets,
Nathalie Heinich s'interroge sur les façons
dont «les objets peuvent être des
personnes» et distingue l'objet-fétiche qui
agit comme une personne, l'objet-relique
qui a appartenu à une personne et l'objet
d'art qui est traité comme une personne
(«Les objets-personnes : fétiches, reliques
et œuvres d'art», Sociologie de l'Art,
n° 23,1993, p. 27). L'objet-relique étant
caractérisé par son lien à un nom propre,
et l'objet d'art par un état civil qui
l'identifierait en particulier, l'explication
principale du rapprochement entre choses
et personnes réside donc dans une
commune individuation, un caractère
«insubstituable». En outre, comme le
montrent l'article de Marika Moisseeff
dans ce numéro et la citation d'Augé
infra, il n'est pas sûr que l'agence
attribuée aux fétiches soit leur mode
d'existence et d'intervention, puisse être
confondue avec celle de l'acteur, dans le
format de l'action.<br>

Abstract: I argue that meaning or significance per se, along with the capacity to be conscious thereof, and the values, motives and aspirations, etc. central to the constitution of our intrinsic personal identities, arise, as indeed do our extrinsic social identities, and our very self-consciousness as such, from socio-cultural structures and relations to others. However, so far from our identities and behavior therefore being determined, I argue that the capacity for critical reflection and evaluation emerge from these same structural relations, the more complex and quintessentially human aspects of our behavior being explained not in terms of responses to stimuli but as choices reflecting our evaluation of meaningful or significant alternatives. Finally I provide theoretical grounds for accepting the existence of other subjects and give a holistic, as opposed to a dialectical, account of the way individuals may challenge and change the very socio-cultural ways of relating to and interacting with others so central to constituting their capacities and identities.<br>

Abstract: This essay is a reflection on the sense of trust, based on Niklas Luhman's pioneering work, and on the sense of history making, based on personal reflections as well as those from other authors, such as Nietzsche, Nadin, Ortega y Gasset, Castells and Fernández-Martorell. The central proposition is that trusting may be considered as synonymous with history making, as both acts are possible only thanks to the existence of a future, the only time really at our disposal, and both are based on past experiences. Besides, the text also examines historical periodization and the importance of the present digital revolution.<br>

Abstract: « Le temps présent est devenu éphémère, irréversible et insaisissable »,
dit A. Y. Gourevitch. Il est aussi homogène et orienté. L'historien sovié-
tique ajoute : « Pour la première fois, l'homme a constaté que le temps dont
il ne décelait le cours qu'à travers les événements, ne s'arrête pas, même en
l'absence d'événement. » A. Y. Gourevitch réintroduit ici une acception
métaphysique du temps, s'il entend bien par événements des phénomènes,
alors que dans le reste de sa contribution, il paraît convaincu de la maté-
rialité du temps. La preuve expérimentale de l'existence du temps hors des
phénomènes n'a pas été fournie et ne peut l'être. Les temps dans lesquels
nous vivons, sont celui de notre existence même, celui de notre société, celui
des mouvements des astres, etc. L'homme ne « constate » donc pas que le
temps ne s'arrête pas même en l'absence d'événement, ces événements lui
sont cachés par l'usage d'un temps quantitatif qui se réfère à l'un d'entre
eux exprimé par les horloges, devenu la référence unique, apparemment
« dématérialisé » par son omnipotence et occultant l'existence des autres
temps.<br>

multiples toujours divergents, souvent contradictoires » (p. 1). « On ne peut
analyser aucune société sans la replacer dans le temps dans lequel elle vit »
(p. 2). Pour cet auteur, les structures sociales « se meuvent toujours dans
des échelles de temps spécifiques qu'elles engendrent » (Avant-propos). Ainsi,
pour G. Gurvitch aussi, le temps serait un contenant. Mais propre à chaque
société. Pour nous, les temps sont la principale expression de tout phéno-

Abstract: Sociocultural anthropology and evolutionary biology have reached the point at which it is possible to give a coherent and synthetic account of the origins of human cultural variability. From a sociocultural perspective what must be explained is not just the fact of varying cultures and societies, but also the human capacity to create, maintain and alter social forms over time. From a biological perspective we have to ask, what is the selective advantage of such variability? The answer lies in human sociality. Sociality consists in a package of social intellectual capacities-higher order intentionality, pedagogy, narrativity, crativity, speech-which made possible an increasing division of labour. But as these capacities grew, they gave rise to distinctively human (rather than Darwinian) history, that is to the forms of social, political, economic and cultural causation which create ever new variations on the theme of social existence.<br>

Abstract: Before World War II the intellectual climate of American sociology was congenial to the growth of a sociology of knowledge akin to Mannheim's. Yet in the postwar period American sociologists committed themselves to ahistorical theory, positivist methodology, and team research; their "scientistic" sociology did not permit the historicism, relativism, and holism necessary to Mannheimian analysis. Currently, however, convergent trends in a number of disciplines--not only sociology but also philosophy, anthropology, literary criticism, and the histories of ideas, science, and art--favor a revival of the Mannheimian program. Analysts of culture now seek to integrate the sociological goals of "explanation" and "understanding"--the formulation of quasi-laws of behavior, based on identification of the social structural elements of culture production, and the interpretation of the subjective meaning of culture, based on recovery of actors' intentions. Their research program requires investigation of the peculiar sociohistorical circumstances that condition actors' perceptions, necessitating attention to the cognitive content of culture. This article surveys both the theoretical justifications for such a research program and recent exemplifications of it, focusing on anlyses of what Mannheim termed "objective culture"--such symbolic vehicles for conceptions as religion, the arts, science, and political thought that acquire independent existence, becoming subject to diverse interpretations.<br>

Abstract: En marge de la liturgie des saints anges et de la figure anonyme de l'ange gardien que le catholicisme affecte à la protection de chaque fidèle, existe aujourd'hui une angélologie postulant l'existence de soixante-douze anges gardiens nommés et spécialisés, assignés à l'humanité entière en fonction de la date de naissance de l'individu. À travers l'étude des ouvrages concernant ces anges et de quelques entretiens, cet article analyse la construction de cette figure de l'ange, différente de celle que reconnaît l'Église. Cette production syncrétique reprend certains éléments de la conception catholique moderne de l'ange tutélaire et du saint, mais s'inspire aussi des spéculations théologiques des premiers siècles sur les anges, des doctrines kabbalistiques de la Remaissance, de l'occultisme du XIXe siècle et de l'astrologie zodiacale moderne. /// At the frontiers of the liturgy of the Holy Angels and the nameless figure of the guardian angel that catholicism assigns to protect each of the faithful, an angelology has now emerged, proposing the existence of seventy-two guardian angels each with their own name and specialized role, assigned to all humanity according to each person's date of birth. Studying published works on these angels and in the course of a number of interviews, the present article analyses the construction of this figure of the angel, an image that differs from the one recognized by the Catholic Church. This syncretic production takes up certain elements of the modern catholic conception of the angel as guardian and of the saints, but bases itself also on the theoretical speculations on the angels during the first centuries, on the kabbalistic doctrines of the Renaissance, on 19th century occultism and the modern astrology of the zodiac. /// Al margen de la liturgia de los santos ángeles y de la figura anónima del ángel custodio que el catolicismo destina a la protección de cada fiel, existen hoy especulaciones postulando la existencia de setenta y d~<br>

Author(s): Zumbach Steven W.<br>
Abstract: A formal claim was made in the mid-20th century that the goal of art conservation is to present the artwork as the artist intended it to be seen. Dispute over this claim among conservators and art historians involved differences of perspective on the relative roles of science and art history in the interpretation of artist's intent. A separate but concurrent debate among philosophers, art critics, and literary critics was sparked by publication of "The Intentional Fallacy," a scholarly article discrediting appeals to the intentions of artists and authors in art and literary criticism. In this separate debate, difficulty in the evaluation and application of artist's intent was traced to ambiguity of the term "intent." The author discusses 11 variations of its meaning and puts the issues surrounding artist's intent together in the contexts of art conservation. He also presents more recent viewpoints in the social sciences that associate issues of artist's intent with the role of the artist in the continued existence of the artwork. The writings of contemporary philosophers contribute useful perspectives on the essential nature of art and the autonomy of artworks from their creators. The author finds that the interpretation and application of artist's intent is an interdisciplinary task and that its evaluation in conservation contexts is limited to consideration of distinctive stylistic characteristics that demonstrate the correlated individuality of artists and their work. /// [French] Au milieu du 20e siècle, on prétendait que l'objectif de la restauration était de rendre aux oeuvres d'art l'aspect que l'artiste avait voulu leur donner. La controverse qui s'en suivit parmi les restaurateurs et les historiens d'art suscita des différences de considération sur les rôles relatifs de la science et de l'histoire de l'art dans l'interprétation de l'intention de l'artiste.

Issue: i362155<br>
Date: 3 1, 1962<br>
Author(s): Opitz Ellis<br>
Abstract: Eric Voegelin's master work is Order and History, published over a period of three decades with the fifth and final volume appearing posthumously in 1987. The focus of attention here is on the first of these volumes, Israel and Revelation (1956), which may be regarded as intellectually the sequel of volumes two and three, since the writing of those volumes (published in 1957) antedates composition of the study of Israel. From the outset, Voegelin makes clear that his concern is with a philosophy of order historically grounded as the primary means of combating the contemporary crisis of human existence, which he identifies with pervasive deformation of consciousness by ideology and the threat of civilization's extinction through totalitarian mass movements. Thus the task is to regain reality through a recovery of the principal experiences upon which man's historical existence is dependent, with both diagnostic and therapeutic intentions. The attention to the historical record is a means of anamnetically overcoming the social amnesia that threatens to extinguish human existence as it has emerged over millennia back to the Stone Age. Diagnosis and therapy are intended to go hand in hand, since the eclipse of reality, and especially of its highest and hegemonic dimension, the divine Ground of being, in favour of various substitute grounds, is the principal danger to be understood and addressed. The enduring experience of open existence in history is glimpsed, in man's continual Exodus in loving partnership with God, in tension toward the mystery symbolized in eschatological fulfillment. /// L'oeuvre maîtresse d'Eric Voegelin est intitulé Order and History.

Author(s): Tagore Peter<br>
Abstract: In Orientalism, Edward Said attempts to show that all European discourse about the Orient is the same, and all European scholars of the Orient complicit in the aims of European imperialism. There may be "manifest" differences in discourse, but the underlying "latent" orientalism is "more or less constant." This does not do justice to the marked differences in approach, attitude, presentation, and conclusions found in the works of various orientalists. I distinguish six different styles of colonial and postcolonial discourse about India (heuristic categories, not essential types), and note the existence of numerous precolonial discourses. I then examine the multiple ways exponents of these styles interact with one another by focusing on the early-twentieth-century nationalist orientalist, Sri Aurobindo. Aurobindo's thought took form in a colonial framework and has been used in various ways by postcolonial writers. An anti-British nationalist, he was by no means complicit in British imperialism. Neither can it be said, as some Saidians do, that the nationalist style of orientalism was just an imitative indigenous reversal of European discourse, using terms like "Hinduism" that had been invented by Europeans. Five problems that Aurobindo dealt with are still of interest to historians: the significance of the Vedas, the date of the vedic texts, the Aryan invasion theory, the Aryan-Dravidian distinction, and the idea that spirituality is the essence of India. His views on these topics have been criticized by Leftist and Saidian orientalists, and appropriated by reactionary "Hindutva" writers. Such critics concentrate on that portion of Aurobindo's work which stands in opposition to or supports their own views. A more balanced approach to the nationalist orientalism of Aurobindo and others would take account of their religious and political assumptions, but view their project as an attempt to create an alternative language of discourse. Although in need of criticism in th~<br>

Abstract: "Aucune existence du présent sans présence du passé, et donc aucune ludicité du présent sans conscience du passé. Dans la vie du temps, le passé est à coup sûr la présence la plus lourde, donc possiblement la plus riche, celle en tout cas dont il faut à la fois se nourrir et se distinguer." La réflexion de Michel de Certeau sur l'histoire est parente de celle à laquelle invitait, en ces termes, Alphonse Dupront, le 22 février 1964. Et la fécondité qu'elle conserve, en notre temps si préoccupé des rapports entre histoire et mémoire, explique une actualité éditoriale dont François Dosse nous aide à apprécier l'importance. L'article vise à éclairer l'actualité de la pensée et de l'œuvre de Michel de Certeau, attestée par la réédition en 2002 de ses livres les plus importants. Sa définition de "l'opération historiographique" reste précieuse en ce qu'elle conçoit celle-ci comme le produit d'un lieu social déterminé, comme une pratique et une écriture. Il récuse avec Paul Ricœur la fausse alternative entre l'histoire-science et l'histoire-récit. Sa lecture de Freud aide à penser le lien entre histoire et mémoire, qu'elle entend protéger contre le ressassement du passé. Par delà son apport à une "anthropologie du croire", Michel de Certeau invite les historiens à assumer, dans la recherche de chemins à travers les temporalités, tout à la fois l'humilité et l'esprit braconnier. /// This article provides an update on the thinking and works of Michel de Certeau. A new edition of his most important books came out in 2002. His definition of a "historiographic operation" remains very useful as it considers this operation as the product of a defined social place, a practice and a style. Like Paul Ricœur, he rejects the false alternative between history as science and history as narrative. His reading of Freud helps to make the link between history and memory, this same memory that has to be protected against the regrets of the past. Beyond his contribution to an "anthropology of ~<br>

Abstract: Aun cuando el pormenor de este ensayo se centra principalmente en los cambios de acento que experimenta la obra de Karl Mannheim en los años veinte, cuando éste se consagró resueltamente a la sociología, el autor quiere contribuir a explicitar las razones que justifican la plena actualidad de su figura intelectual y de su obra. Sostiene que la obra de Mannheim está vertebrada con inequívoca unidad de intención y procura fijar el sentido preciso de la misma. Mannheim fue un pensador del cambio y del conflicto que consagró toda su energía intelectual a interpretar y a afrontar la crisis de orientación y participación que mina la organización de las sociedades de nuestro tiempo. Concebía la sociología como la ciencia de integración necesaria para orientar la convivencia humana en una situación cultural disgregada y altamente polarizada y compleja. Su visión de la misma apela con claridad a la condición interdependiente e intersubjetiva de la existencia y es congruente con el empeño de quienes, para superar la crisis de la ciencia de la sociedad, tratan de armonizar la sociología equilibrando los excesos estructuralistas con un adecuado tratamiento de la dimensión comunicativa de la vida social. /// Althought this essay focuses mainly on the variations in emphasis suffered by Karl Mannheim's works 1920's, when he devoted himself determinaly to Sociology, it is the author's propose to help highlight the reasons justifying the absolute topicality of both his intellectual dimention and thought.

Author(s): Foster Gary<br>
Abstract: Harry Frankfurt characterizes love as "a disinterested concern for the existence of what is loved, and for what is good for it." As such, he views romantic love as an inauthentic paradigm for love since such love desires reciprocation, sexual gratification and so on. I argue that Frankfurt's conception of love is (a) too general—he does not distinguish between the type of love one has for one's partner, one's country, a moral ideal, etc., (b) it overemphasizes the role of bestowal at the expense of the part played by appraisal and (c) it is insufficiently social. Certain forms of love, romantic love and friendship for instance, are defined largely in terms of reciprocation. For Frankfurt, reciprocation is somewhat of an accidental feature of love. This deficiency in Frankfurt's conception of love can be traced to a problem in his conception of selfhood which I argue is insufficiently social in nature.<br>

Author(s): Telban Borut<br>
Abstract: By focusing on children involved in the ritual practices in Ambonwari village, East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea, this essay compares two types of ritual: that of healing and that of male initiation. Like other life crisis rituals both deal with two dimensions of the Ambonwari life-world, that is with the living and the dead and, in a broader sense, with people and spirits. Though both are based upon the same cosmology there are fundamental differences between them. First, healers in healing ceremonies treat uninitiated children as 'non-beings'. From the perspective of Ambonwari 'selves' or 'beings', children belong to this domain. They exist as extensions of their parents or carers, from whom they cannot be separated conceptually. Second, by examining the Ambonwari concepts of negation I show that healers do not approach the domain of cosmological non-existence: they are not concerned with the cosmogony of the Ambonwari life-world. The male initiation rituals do just the opposite, however. It is only in the male initiation ritual, seen as a cosmogonic event, that young boys are cut off from their parents and 'thrown' abruptly into a state of becoming. Unlike the healing rites, these rituals treat young boys as both Ambonwari beginnings and Ambonwari beings. I argue that Ambonwari initiation rituals are not concerned with symbolic death followed by rebirth, but with states of being. Initiation means that death becomes possible for a child. The initiated boy will now be able to die as an Ambonwari being.<br>

Abstract: Este texto procura encontrar um princípio hermenêutico que dê acesso a uma leitura de unidade da obra de Ricoeur. Nesse contexto, experimenta a tese de que a filosofia ricoeuriana se deixa interpretar como um caso no interior do pensamento crítico de herança kantiana, como uma filosofia dos limites da razão, não no sentido originário, de investigação sobre as condições de possibilidade do conhecimento objectivo, mas por poder ser lida como uma pesquisa sistematica para encontrar as condições em que é possível ao pensar, à discursividade, dizer, num saber constituído, a existência. Assim, tratar-se-á do significado "crítico" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire que, sendo a primeira obra do projecto da Filosofia da Vontade. lhe determina as condição de possibilidade, ao propor os princípios teóricos fundantes da constituição de um discurso unitário sobre o humano enquanto expressão de uma existência histórica e livre. /// Ce texte veut trouver un principe herméneutique qui donne accès à une lecture unitaire de l'oeuvre de Ricoeur. C'est dans ce contexte que l'on avance la thèse selon laquelle la philosophie ricoeurienne doit être interprétée comme un cas à l'intérieur de la pensée critique d'héritage kantien, comme une philosophie des limites de la raison, non pas dans le sens d'investigation des conditions de possibilité de la connaissance objective, mais parce que cette philosophie peut être lue comme une recherche systématique en vue de trouver les conditions dans lesquelles le penser, le discours, peut, en un savoir constitué, dire l'existence. On s'occupera donc du sens "critique" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire qui, comme première oeuvre du projet de la Philosophie de la l'olonté, assigne à celle-ci ses conditions de possibilité en proposant les principes théoriques qui fondent la constitution d'un discours unitaire à propos de l'humain en tant qu'expression d'une existence historique et libre. /// This text seeks to find a hermeneutical principle which permit~<br>

Author(s): Lourenço Menuel<br>
Abstract: It is here proposed the elimination of the concept of truth in analytical construction by substituting for it the concept of terminal evidence of an assertion. Terminal evidence is in turn explained in terms of anschauliche non-deterministic sequences and portions of finitist logic generated by these sequences are sketched both for statements without quantifiers and statements with first order quantifiers. Emphasis is given to the nature of negation and existence in the proposed elimination. /// Es wird vorgeschlagen, die Eliminierung des Wahrheitsbegriffes in der analytischen Konstruktion durch die Einsetzung des Begriffes der endgultigen Evidenz einer Aussage durchzufuhren. Bei der Einfuhrung von anschaulichen akausalen Folgen lasst sich der Begriff der endgultigen Evidenz erklaren und Teile der finiten Logik, die solche Folgen erzeugen, werden skizziert sowohl fur Aussagen ohne Quantoren als auch fur solche, bei denen nur Quantoren der ersten Stufe vorkommen. Die Natur der Negation und des Existenz-Begriffes ist insbesondere hervorgehoben. /// É proposto efectuar-se a eliminação do conceito de verdade na construção analitica pela introdução do conceito da evidência terminal de uma asserção. Com a introdução de sucessões não-deterministas é elucidado o conceito de evidência terminal e os fragmentos de lógica finitista que estas sucessões originam são esboçados quer para o caso de asserçães sem quantores quer para aquelas asserções em que só ocorrem quantores de 1.a ordem. A natureza da negação e do conceito da existência são especialmente destacados.<br>

Issue: i40014917<br>

Author(s): Nauta Rein<br>
Abstract: Augustine's conversion is considered exemplary for its Christian testimony. However, the psychological aspects are also relevant, for Augustine's conversion to Christianity was as much inspired by personal and cultural ambitions as by religious convictions. For Augustine, the conversion to the Christian faith spelled a life of asceticism— a life of celibacy, a virtuous and chaste existence, which also offered him a means of escape from the threatening ambiguity of parental relations and a chance to realize the cultural ideal of the civilized philosopher who has subjugated the passions of the flesh. In this paper we explore the psychological dynamics of the absent father, the suffering mother and the prodigal son and the role they played in Augustine's conversion to Christianity.<br>

Article Title: Mysticism and Sprachkritik: Martin Buber's Rendering of the Mystical Metaphor 'ahizat' enayim<br>
Publisher: Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40019046<br>
Date: 12 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Urban Martina<br>
Abstract: In his early interpretation and representation of the oral teachings of the Hasidic masters, Martin Buber engaged in issues pertinent to the critique of language (Sprachkritik,) of the fin-de-siècle. Associated pre-eminently with Fritz Mauthner and his circle, the critique of language (Sprachkritik) questioned the epistemological status of language, wedded as it is to the divisive Erfahrungswelt. By drawing attention to ecstatic speech, which paradoxically gives expression to the experience (Erlebnis) of the ineffable unity of existence, Buber adumbrates a solution to the cognitive limitations of language. Refracted through Lebensphilosophie, he distinguishes between language as bound to Erfahrung and speech as nurtured by Erlebnis. Whereas language is propelled by conceptual and propositional forms of cognition, speech, principally sustained by metaphors evoked by an experience of the noumenal. Through an examination of his interpretive translation of a well-known Hasidic parable, this article explores how he amplifies this distinction by means of a semantic transformation of the key mystical metaphor of 'ahizat ' enayim (lit. seizing the eyes). Discerning the hermeneutical layers of Buber's rendition of the parable, we argue that his own ambiguous propositional casting of the metaphor entraps him into the very problem he sought to overcome. /// O presente artigo tem como ponto de partida o facto de que na interpretação e representação que dos mestres do Hasidismo fez logo na primeira fase da sua actividade como intelectual, Martin Buber assumiu como próprias questões especialmente pertinentes para uma crítica da linguagem (Sprachkritik) típica da época fin-de-siècle. Associada de modo particular a Fritz Mauthner e ao seu círculo, a Sprachkritik interrogava-se sobretudo acerca do estatuto epistemológico da linguagem, conectada como ela estava com uma Erfahrungswelt que era, desde logo, fonte de divisão. Nesse sentido, a autora do artigo defende que ao chamar a aten~<br>

Abstract: No centro do presente artigo está a problemática kierkegaardiana do possível e do impossível, ou seja, a coexistência dos opostos como explicitação do paradoxo, uma das figuras matriciais do Absurdo. Para Kierkegaard, o homem singular vê-se confrontado com o Paradoxo precisamente na medida em que a sua existência não cai sob o domínio da metafísica e do estético. Por outras palavras, o paradoxo invade a existência humana no momento em que se trata do paradoxo absoluto, escândalo para o Judeu, loucura para o Grego, absurdo para a Razão. O artigo mostra, contudo, que antes de se confrontar com o Paradoxo, o existente precisa de aprender a esperar, malgrado o absurdo, na certeza de que tudo é possível a Deus. Porém, a experiência do Paradoxo implica percorrer um caminho prévio. Por outras palavras, é necessário aprender a experimentar a "condensação do possível", seja sob a forma de melancolia seja sob a forma do escrúpulo, de modo a poder desesperar da ideia do possível. Mostra-se assim a capacidade inovadora de Kierkegaard, mesmo sabendo nós que o desespero constitui um tema filosófico clássico já deste a Antiguidade. O que Kierkegaard faz, porém, é colocar em movimento uma dialéctica em que o jogo dos opostos se organiza em diversas figuras precárias, sempre incertas e fluentes e que se escalonam segundo degraus múltiplos de intensidade. Ora é precisamente graças a este jogo de oposições que no pensamento do Solitário de Copenhaga se articulam, ainda que de forma frágil, o finito e o infinito, o temporal e o eterno, a possibilidade e a necessidade. /// At the center of the present article is the kierhegaardian approach to the dialectic of the possible and the impossible, whose co-existence gives evidence to the Paradox, one of the figures of the Absurd. For Kierkegaard, the singular human being finds herself confronted with the Paradox precisely in the measure in which her existence does not fall under the dominion of metaphysics and of the aesthetical.

Abstract: Si certaines formes-sonate ou certains Andante de Mozart et Beethoven ont la réputation d'être « dramatiques » et de porter une expression fondée sur l'opposition entre tension et détente, est-il possible d'y détecter des règles narratives ? C'est la question à laquelle l'article tente de répondre, en se servant du modèle taxinomique proposé par A. J. Greimas. L'articulation des signifiés à l'intérieur d'un micro-univers sémantique est décrite au travers de la représentation de certains types de passion et de caractères musicaux (topiques, topoï, affects, etc.) détectés dans les œuvres de Mozart par Jozsef Ujfalussy. L'analyse de « la forme du contenu » , c'est-à-dire de la structure des signifiés dans un mouvement de symphonie de Mozart (le premier mouvement de la Symphonie en ut majeur, KV 338) ou de sonate de Beethoven (le deuxième mouvement de la Sonate op. 2 n°3) à l'aide du vocabulaire expressif codifié de l'époque, permet de démontrer la présence quasi « littérale » des rapports de contradiction, contrariété et de présupposition décrits par le fameux « carré sémiotique » de Greimas. On y découvre l'existence symbolique, dans ces mouvements d'œuvres instrumentales, des deux grandes classes de récit de la Sémantique structurale de Greimas, en fonction du maintien ou du refus de la situation de départ. If some sonata forms or some Andantes by Mozart or Beethoven can be described as « dramatic » , and cany an expression based on tension and relaxation, is it possible to detect in them narrative rules ? This is the question which the present article tries to answer, on the basis of the taxinomic model proposed by A. J. Greimas. The articulation of signified within a semantic micro-universe is described through the representation of types of passion and of musical characters detected in Mozart's works by Jozsef Ujfalussy. The analysis of the « content forms » , i.e. of the structure of signified in a Symphony movement by Mozart (KV 338, first movement) or in a sona~<br>

Author(s): Joos Maxime<br>
Abstract: Le concept d' « œuvre ouverte » , tel qu'Umberto Eco décrit, doit son existence aux collaborations avec Luciano Berio, notamment dans le cadre de la gestation d'Opera à partir de 1956. L'ouverture, dans Opera, tient notamment à la multiplicité de signification et à la complexité des références internes et externes, à « l'intégration de différents niveaux de perception » . Passaggio, créé en 1963, réalise le principe brechtien de l'abolition de la limite entre scène et public ; c'est une « action musicale », où le spectateur est pris à partie. Mais parce qu'il se libère de toute cohérence narrative, l'espace musical et dramaturgique élaboré par Berio semble ne dévoiler qu'une ouverture introspective, comme pour mieux rendre à l'écoute sa fonction primordiale. The concept of "open work", as described by Umberto Eco, owes its existence to collaborations with Luciano Berio, among others during the conception of Opera, from 1956. The openness, in Opera, consists among others in the multiplicity of meanings and in the complexity of internal and external references, in the "integration of numerous levels of perception". Passaggio, premiered in 1963, realises the Brechtian principle of the abolition of the border between scene and audience. It is a "musical action" in which the auditor has a share. However, freeing itself from any narrative coherence, the musical and dramatic space elaborated by Berio appears to unveil but an introspective openness, as if to restore hearing's primordial function.<br>

Author(s): Martuccelli Danilo<br>
Abstract: En partant de quelques transformations sodétales majeures, et en s'appuyant sur la fiction romanesque française, l'article dessine deux grandes constellations imaginaires de la mobilité dans la modernité. La première associe le but du déplacement, l'existence d'un ailleurs, le goût de l'aventure, l'attitude de départ actif et le rôle de la mobilité comme logique de pouvoir. La deuxième, souvent en résonance avec les items précédents, souligne plutôt l'exigence de la mobilité pour la mobilité, la fin de l'idée de dehors, l'impératif de la fuite, la prolifération de l'expérience du départ passif, enfin, la centralité croissante de la mobilité dans le saisissement de la domination. Au terme de ce parcours, l'imaginaire de la mobilité apparaît comme une boussole privilégiée pour cerner les transformations de la modernité. The article tracks two major imaginary constellations of modem mobility, through the analysis of important social transformations, illustrated by certain French novels. The first joins the goal of mobility, the existence of an « elsewhere » , the taste for adventure, an active departure, and the role of mobility as a logic of power. The second, frequently in relationship with the precedent, emphasizes the idea of mobility for itself, the end of elsewhere Utopia, the need to run away, the multiplication of experiences of passive departure, and finally the growing link between mobility and domination. The mobility imaginary appears at last as a privileged compass to surround the transformations of modernity.<br>

Abstract: L'attitude philosophique s'oppose à l'attitude spontanée et naturelle de l'esprit humain ; d'après la parole bien connue de Platon, elle implique une « conversion » , un retour sur soi où l'homme se découvre comme étant la subjectivité par laquelle l'être accède à la conscience. La philosophie est en même temps une réflexion critique sur les consceptions préphilosophiques : depuis les débuts de la philosophie grecque les penseurs ont essayé d'écarter de leurs doctrines les éléments mythologiques et irrationnels, afin d'arriver à une explication purement rationnelle de l'être en totalité. Cette explication exige bien souvent qu'on ne reste pas rivé au monde de l'expérience sensible, mais qu'on fasse appel à des principes suprasensibles. La philosophie se présente de la sorte comme une totale prise de conscience de la subjectivité humaine comme ouverture sur le monde. La philosophie a nécessairement des adversaires, ceux qui refusent de renoncer à l'attitude spontanée de l'esprit humain et aux conceptions préphilosophiques. Elle laisse sceptiques et indifférents, ceux qui sont déroutés par la variété des systèmes philosophiques à travers l'histoire et qui rejettent la possibilité d'atteindre un monde suprasensible. En face de ces critiques, la philosophie ne peut se justifier que par une prise de conscience plus claire de ce qu'elle est et de ce qu'elle signifie. Elle nous révèle tout d'abord une dimension propre et originale de l'existence humaine : l'homme est un être qui fait de la philosophie, c'est-à-dire un être qui pose des questions transcendentales, des questions sur l'être en totalité et même des questions ultimes, au delà desquelles il n'y en a plus d'autres. La philosophie nous enseigne également la sagesse socratique, qui consiste à connaître les limites de notre savoir, ce qui signifie par ailleurs un certain dépassement de ces limites, car pour connaître les limites, il faut les dépasser. La philosophie peut nous aider à comprendre l'histoire. si toute ~<br>

Abstract: Pour que la raison humaine puisse vraiment parvenir à une authentique conscience de soi, elle a besoin d'un autre que la raison. C'est la vie du chrétien, qui se déroule à côté des impératifs de la raison, et surtout l'accusation de l'épître aux Corinthiens „La sagesse du monde est folie devant Dieu” (I Cor. 3, 19) , qui viennent briser le monologue perpétuel de la raison avec soi-même et la libérer ainsi de son ignorance de soi. En effet cette accusation, qui ne s'impose pas avec des arguments contraignants, met la raison globalement en question sans en exclure aucun procédé. Ainsi la raison n'a plus d'armes en main pour se défendre et se trouve à découvert. Tout d'un coup elle entrevoit que son exercice se fondait jusque là sur des évidences non établies. Des questions nouvelles se posent : quelle est la signification de la rationalité de la raison ? quel est le sens du sens ? En méditant sur ces questions, la raison se rend compte qu'elle ne peut même pas comprendre leur sens. Elle se trouve devant un autre langage qu'elle ne peut pas assimiler. Son egocentrisme fondamental est brisé. La raison se voit d'un oeil nouveau dans ce rapport avec cet autre, qui ne fonde plus la raison comme le faisait Dieu dans les philosophies précédentes. Cet autre ne lui ouvre pas la porte du ciel, mais la renvoie vers une conscience plus aiguë de soi, une conscience qui ne connaît plus son propre fondement. Ainsi la raison devient une raison en condition, elle participe maintenant intégralement à la condition incertaine de l'homme entier. Elle coïncide avec l'homme. Toutes ces considérations pourraient être la réflexion d'un incroyant qui, par hasard, se bute contre cet épître de S. Paul. Mais Thévenaz, en croyant authentique, accepte le rôle prépondérant de Dieu dans sa vie, même dans sa vie de philosophe. N'importe quelle activité humaine doit être une réponse à l'appel de Dieu, qui met en cause toutes les valeurs humaines en les déclarant insuffisantes pour Le trouver. Comment d~<br>

Abstract: What emerges as the overarching theme in the extensive work of the Dutch philosopher Cornelis Verhoeven (1928-2001) is our relationship to reality. Being appealed to by thousands of things in our existence makes us realize that we cannot avoid reality. The most meaningful forms of reality are symbols, which lead us, through radical astonishment and contemplation to the metaphysical insight that something exists rather than nothing. This renders Verhoeven sceptical as the weakness of our ability to know and understand hampers our vision of hard reality, and also ironical because so many forms of speaking and writing display a reality which is being taken for granted. Thinking symbolically, metaphysical reflection and scepsis towards thoughdess assumptions are the instruments of a contemplation which, in Verhoeven's work, leave room for the lyrical prevalence of reality. In his later writings he gradually and more insistently draws attention to the theme of truth, while at the same time not denying our epistemological incapacity towards understanding and explaining reality.<br>

Abstract: The short novel, Will-o'-the-Wisp ('Het dwaallicht') by the Antwerpian (Belgian) author Willem Elsschot, narrates how one night Laarmans, a somewhat tired middle-aged husband and father, accompanies three Afghan seamen on a search for a woman, Maria Van Dam. The search leads them through the harbouring city, and ultimately fails. The work is enigmatic and invites the reader to engage with it creatively, adventurously and not without commitment. The reader discovers in this way not only what it means to interpret, but also that by questioning one's own contribution in the understanding of being, interpretation serves as a challenge to clarify one's existence. The enigma of Will-o'-the-Wisp is never solved, but the search for understanding what happened during that nightly search provides a model for every practical methodology of hermeneutics, and can therefore be considered a parable about the nature of interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Le thème de la communication exprime le conflit entre deux expériences fondamentales de la condition humaine : comprendre le monde et se soucier d'autrui. Le conflit apparaît d'abord sur le plan de la société. On peut retrouver ce conflit au niveau de l'existence sous forme d'une contradiction entre l'intérêt pour le langage et l'intérêt pour l'Autre, ou entre l'herméneutique et l'éthique. Si cette contradiction nest pas insurmontable, comme i'essaye de le montrer, même la contradiction sur le plan social pourrait être résolue. There exists a conflict between two fundamental experiences of the human condition : that of understanding the world and taking heed of the Other. In the first place the conflict manifests istelf on the social level. The conflict is also to be found on the existential level in the form of a contradiction between hermeneutics and ethics. However, if this contradiction is not insurmountable, as this paper attempts to show, it should oho be possible to resolve the contradiction on the social level.<br>

Abstract: À partir d'une définition de l'éducation comme « relation dissymétrique, nécessaire et provisoire, visant à l'émergence d'un sujet », la pédagogie est proposée comme effort pour penser cette activité dans des situations données. Refusant une posture philosophique qui décrète l'existence du sujet pour le faire advenir, comme une attitude inspirée des sciences humaines qui abolit le sujet en réduisant ses actes à la résultante des forces qui s'exercent sur lui, la pédagogie peut se définir comme « anticipation contextualisée ». Dans cette perspective, elle requiert un discours qui exprime la singularité des sujets en situation et la mette en perspective d'universalité. Le récit peut avoir cette fonction et « faire théorie » sans, pour autant, s'abstraire des situations particulières qu'il décrit. La pédagogie comme « récits d'éducation » a alors pour fonction de favoriser la prise de décision éducative. Education being defined as "a dissymetric, necessary and temporary relation focusing on the emergence of a subject", pedagogy is considered as an endeavour to think this activity in given situations. If we refuse a philosophical position which decides the existence of a subject to make it turn into a reality - as an attitude inspired by human sciences which reduces the subject's acts to the resultant of forces exerced on him - pedagogy may be defined as a "contextualized anticipation". In this perspective, we must display the uniqueness of subjects in a specific situation and set it in a universal perspective. Narratives may have this function without neglecting the specificity of situations. Pedagogy as "narratives on education" is able to facilitate educational decision making.<br>

Abstract: La tentative de rapprochement entre littérature et éducation est en train de trouver — et pas seulement en France — de nouveaux adhérents. Cela semble signaler l'émergence d'un nouveau logos pédagogique qui essaye, peut-être, de dépasser les frontières de réflexion imposés par les sciences de l'éducation. Quelques-unes de ces tentatives, cependant, non seulement présentent certaines (et compréhensibles) limites, comme l'absence d'une « théorie de la réception » des textes fictionnels, mals elles ont aussi, dans d'autres cas, l'ambition de révolutionner le discours pédagogique à travers la littérature, où la pédagogie elle-même se transforme en projet d' « esthétisation de l'existence » . En prenant Philippe Meirieu et Jorge Larrosa comme illustrations des « limites » et de l' « ambition révolutionnaire » , respectivement, l'article cherche à montrer comment romantisme et nietzscheisme essayent de constituer un nouveau discours qui prétend, encore une fois, nous sauver de la « société administrée » . The attempt to approximate literature and education is beginning to find, not only in France, numerous supporters. This may indicate the emergence of a new pedagogical logos, which tries, little by little, to overcome the limits of thought set up by the Educational Sciences. Some of these attempts, however, not only show some (understandable) insufficiencies (such as the absence of a "reception theory" for fictional texts), but also, in other cases, the ambition of a complete revolution of the pedagogical discourse through literature (where pedagogy itself becomes a "self-stylistics" or aims at the "aesthetization of existence"). Taking Philippe Meirieu and Jorge Larrosa as respective examples of "insufficiencies" and "revolutionary ambition", the article tries to show how romanticism and Nietzscheanism can constitute a new pedagogical discourse that pretends, once again, to save us from "administerea society".<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'intéresse aux Béni-Boudouane, population qui fut le vivier du recrutement des harkis du bachaga Boualem pendant la guerre d'indépendance. À partir d'archives coloniales et d'une enquête ethnographique au Mas Thibert, en Provence, où ils se sont installés à l'indépendance, il s'agit d'interroger la nature, l'ampleur et la forme des contacts coloniaux dans une région d'où les Français étaient physiquement absents. La colonisation s'y manifesta essentiellement par la formalisation de l'existence des Béni-Boudouane en tant que tribu et par l'application restreinte des lois forestières les dépossédant. Les Béni-Boudouanais vécurent à l'écart de l'Algérie des Français, dont l'irruption fut tardive, au moment de la guerre. Jusque-là, les quelques auxiliaires locaux de l'administration française étaient l'incarnation de l'Algérie coloniale, perçue toutefois par la mémoire collective comme une réalité quotidienne et normalisée. This article deals with the Beni-Boudouane, a population which formed the breeding ground for the recruitment of bachaga Boualems harkis during the Algerian war for independence. Through archival and ethnographic research in Mas Thibert, Provence, where this population settled after independence, this study tries to understand the nature, importance and form of colonial contacts in a region where the French were physically absent. There colonization appeared through the formalization of the Beni-Boudouane s existence as a tribe and through the application of forest laws which served to deprive the population of property. The Beni-Boudouane lived apart from French Algeria until the war. Until then, a few local auxiliaries of the French administration embodied colonial Algeria. In collective memory, this government was perceived as an everyday, normalized reality.<br>

Abstract: Alors même qu'ils ne constituent qu'une petite minorité au sein du monde ouvrier et artisanal, les compagnons du Tour de France sont sur-représentés si on les considère du point de vue de la production autobiographique. À partir de ce constat cet article se propose d'examiner les conditions de formation de cette capacité singulière. L'examen de la dizaine d'autobiographies compagnonniques produites depuis le XVIIIe siècle permet ainsi de mettre en relief le fait que le compagnonnage, de par sa formule particulière, met en valeur parmi ses membres ceux qui savent conter, ceux qui savent écrire et ceux qui produisent des chansons. Ces trois types de mises en ordre de la vie et du monde invitent ainsi les compagnons qui en sont les maîtres à penser leur propre existence et, pour quelques-uns, à la mettre en texte. Although forming a tiny minority of workers and craftsmen, the Tour-de-France journeymen are overrepresented in the production of autobiographies. This observation serves as the starting point for examining the conditions underlying this peculiarity. The ten or so autobiographies written since the 18th century are used to show that this apprenticeship, given its specific form, valued those journeymen who knew how to tell stories, write songs or simply write. These three ways of setting life and the world in order led those who master them to conceive of their own existence and, for a few of them, to set it down in writing.<br>

Abstract: L'attachement au pays d'origine est bien analysé pour les diasporas contemporaines afin de démontrer leur dimension transnationale et décrire leurs rapports avec l'État-nation. Pour les XVIe-XVIIIe siècles, en revanche, cette question pourtant fondamentale est minorée au profit des liens entre communautés. Souhaitant sortir des perspectives mono-confessionnelles qui limitent l'historiographie des diasporas modernes, ce travail s'appuie sur l'étude de quatre groupes dispersés : les séfarades, les catholiques britanniques, les huguenots et les morisques. La terre d'origine, qui grave son empreinte culturelle sur la diaspora, constitue un liant structurant fondamental : lieu de l'événement-déclencheur de dispersion et du martyre, elle apparaît comme le front de la résistance qui légitime l'existence de « l'arrière » , la diaspora. Territoire matriciel, souvent mythifié et mobilisé dans les visions messianiques, elle est indissociable de la notion de retour. The attachment to the country of origin is well analyzed for contemporary diasporas to demonstrate their transnational dimension and to describe their relationship with the nation-state. For the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, however, the historiography has emphasized the relationship between communities, overlooking this important issue. Putting aside mono-denominational perspectives, this article offers a new approach to early-modern diasporas by confronting four groups: the Sephardim, the British Catholics, the Huguenots and the Moriscos. The cultural imprint of the homeland was a core structure of diasporas. The locus of both martyrdom and the trigger-event of dispersion, the homeland appeared as the front line of resistance, legitimizing the existence of the "rear", i.e. the Diaspora. Often mythologized and mobilized in messianic visions, this crucial territory was inseparable from the notion of return.<br>

Abstract: Can the act of creation itself be considered like an infinite forgiveness that God turns to the earth and to those who live there after having preferred the waters as his place of first existence? The conference "In the beginning it was the forgiveness" held in L'Aquila in the occasion of a pluriconfessional meeting, suggests some hypothesis starting even from some biblical episodes like: the universal deluge, the Amalek's remembering, Giuseppe and his brothers, Isaac's sacrifice, and furthermore with Moses' death, to end with the forgiveness from the original sin through the entrance in the promise land. A suggestive analysis of the forgiveness in the Hebraism, seen too often as a pure religion of the contraposition law to the forgiveness given from the religion of love. The forgiveness in this way is dealt with the inter-religious point of view, and also with the human one that in the relationship between God and man has its top and beginning in the solemnity of Kippur.<br>

Abstract: This paper attempts to compare two lives, that of Ramana Maharshi, the beloved cereberal sage of South India, and Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis. Much has been written on both these individuals, so what this paper does is to focus on affliction as a source of insight about life, detachment, pain, existentialism and coping. By taking narratives which delineate a historical plane on which illness can be coded, I try to understand the anthromorphic nature of suffering and its consequences in these two great lives. Individuals reflect the culture of which they are a part, so what we receive through the narratives which tell us about them is significant in terms of their similarities and their differences. Who authors narratives which we analyse is of utmost significance, and both feminism and narrative analyses looks at social anthropology as benefiting from the question of the writing subject. The Nirvana principle works in Ramana Maharshi's case to create a comfort zone for helping us to think of death as dream, in Freud it works as a comfort zone to cope with existence. Human beings work with ideas in order to evaluate the nature of life and survival, or with death as an attribute which too is natural and part of the order of reality. Paul Ricoeur's work helps me to build a bridge between the two thinkers, Ramana Maharshi and Freud, in terms of the application of the concepts of Eros, Thanatos and Ananke.<br>

Author(s): Zollmann Mary Ann<br>
Abstract: This article explores the thesis that educators are called to define and describe truth morefoundationally than we have ever done before if tve are to facilitate existence that is right, just, correct on both a personal and communal level. This thesis is sourced in ever-deepening attentiveness to, appreciation for, and affirmation of this statement of Adrian van Kaam: "The work of reformation starts in the heart by means of the human spirit; it is the reclamation of the soul, via the spirit, of its innermost form direction. " Suggesting that education which would be truly correctional must, therefore, reach into the very heart of being, the author describes the current paradigm shift from the Newtonian model of what it means to be human with its positivistic approaches to learning to a more Einsteinian or fullfield understanding of human being and its requirement of more formative learning processes. In consonance with the truth of being as full-field, formative correctional education is reflective and experiential, dialogical, narrative in form, and globally inclusive. In her discussion of each of these methodologies, the author illustrates how each one draws us deeper into the truth of who we are and inspires us to be the unique presence that we are in the world. Through such methods and processes, individuals are formed, reformed, and transformed not only in self-appreciation and openness to their own possibilities, but in appreciation for the meaning and value of their existence with others in the world.<br>

Abstract: Deux tendances radicalement différentes semblent se partager la production historiographique médiévale. L'une, inaugurée par l'Histoire ecclésiastique d'Eusèbe et dominée par les réflexions que lui a consacrées saint Augustin (et de loin la plus importante), s'attache à retracer le destin des hommes appelés à se rassembler au sein de l'Église afin d'être portés vers un avenir qui doit leur permettre de sortir de l'histoire et de se retrouver à la fin des temps au sein de la Cité de Dieu. L'autre, renouant avec la tradition antique rejetée par l'historiographie chrétienne, se consacre à une communauté définie qu'elle pourvoit d'une origine et d'un passé qui fondent son identité et son existence présente, mais qui semblent en même temps constamment menacées par la fiction. Après avoir rappelé le point de vue de saint Augustin, et afin de mettre en lumière cette double orientation, cette étude s'appuie principalement sur l'historiographie des îles britanniques : à l'Histoire ecclésiastique du peuple anglais de Bède répond en effet l'Histoire des rois de Bretagne de Geoffroy de Monmouth. La critique adressée à ce dernier par Guillaume de Newburgh au seuil de son Histoire des choses anglaises, s'en prenant au caractère fictif des événements attribués au roi Arthur et aux prophéties de Merlin, éclaire de manière exemplaire le sens de l'opposition entre une histoire devant aboutir au ciel et celle qui trouve son assise sur la terre. Two conceptions, radically different, seem to share the medieval historiography. The first (and far most important) one, initiated by Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History and dominated by the reflections saint Augustine has devoted to it, recalls the destiny of human beings who should put themselves together under the conduct of the Church, in the expectation of a future which will allow them to get out of History and find themselves at the End of Times inside the City of God. The other one, linked to the tradition produced in Antiquity but rejecte~<br>

Abstract: The aim of this essay is to examine and go beyond the Freudian, psychoanalytical approach to the work of art. The author specifically considers the case of the musical work through the notion of 'repetition', a notion upon which the relationship of the unconscious with time is founded. After analyzing the ambiguity of the Freudian stance, he points out Freud's error regarding the meaning that can be attributed to repetition: according to Freud, repetition is only a negative phenomenon, which indicates the failure of desire fulfillment. The author instead posits that repetition, basic to all music, is the fundamental structure of a time-based art that is closely connected with the imaginary and the unconscious. Repetition and variation are the two fundamental aspects of the organization of time for the human psyche. The most ancient figure of repetition-variation in the unconscious is that of the echo. The author analyzes this notion through the concepts of 'sound-container of the Self' and 'transitional time' as defined by Anzieu and Winnicott. Several musical examples show how this figure lies at the root of the first experiences of musical time in Western culture. The echo can be considered as the basis of other musico-temporal figures such as 'dead time', the 'empty container', and the 'pseudo-connection'. These are the figures that constitute the temporal narrative of late nineteenth-century music, and of the passage to contemporary music, its fundamental discontinuity and non-linearity. Finally, the author returns to the initial topic: a psychoanalysis of a musical work can only be a psychoanalytic reading of the figures of its creation, it cannot be a psychoanalysis of the creating artist. More generally, what the work designates remains inaccessible - or rather, cannot be perceived except in a lack that returns us to the listener's emptiness. The work finds its place in the listener, bringing along an absence, a non-existence which is projected outwards, whic~<br>

Abstract: L'article présente une note inédite de Bolzano, qui recense les principales difficultés de l'infini. Cette note, qui date de 1813-1814, est extraite de son journal, Miscellanea mathematica. La question de savoir si de l'existence d'une bijection entre deux ensembles, on peut conclure à leur équipotence, aboutit à une impasse : quelle que soit la réponse donnée, ses conséquences sont absurdes. This paper presents an unpublished note by Bolzano, which surveys the various difficulties linked to the notion of infinity. This note, written in 1813-1814, is an excerpt from his mathematical diaries, Miscellanea mathematica. Raising the question whether one may deduce the equivalence of two sets from the existence of a bijective correlation between them, ends in a blind alley : from every possible answer, absurd consequences follow.<br>

Abstract: Le rapport de l'œuvre de Paul Ricœur à la modernité ne va pas de soi. Imprégnée profondément par le testament judéo-chrétien, méfiante à l'égard des ruptures brutales, soucieuse d'incarner le cogito dans l'existence, sa philosophie pourrait aisément s'inscrire dans une tendance néo-traditionaliste. Cette dimension anti-moderne se renforce en raison de la place majeure que la pensée de Ricœur accorde aux mouvances post-modernes, qu'elles soient d'inspiration vitaliste, structuraliste ou post-structuraliste. Pourtant, jamais le philosophe n'a abandonné ni le projet émancipateur, ni la conquête reflexive du cogito portés par la modernité. La dialectique subtile et originale dans son œuvre de ces trois paradigmes philosophiques se traduit donc sous la forme d'un modernisme paradoxal qui se comprend mieux lorsqu'on le replace dans le cadre d'un réformisme moral et politique, à l'opposé aussi bien d'un éloge de la tradition que des emportements révolutionnaires. The links Paul Ricœur's works maintain with modernity cannot be taken for granted. Being deeply immersed in the Judeo-Christian Legacy, wary of abrupt brenks, concerned about embodying the Cogito in existence, his philosophy could be easily associated with a neo-traditionalist trend. This anti-modern dimension is strengthened because of the chief place that Ricœur attaches in his philosophy to the post-modern ways of thinking, whatever inspiration they come from: vitalist, structuralist or post-structuralist. However, the philosopher abandoned neither the emancipatory project, nor the reflexive practice of the Cogito carried by modernity. Therefore, in his works, the subtle and original dialectics of these three philosophical paradigms expresses itself in the way of a paradoxical modernism which can be better understood when it is considered within a political and ethical reformism. Such a point of view is opposed to a praise of tradition as well as to revolutionary outbursts.<br>

Abstract: Cet article offre une vision globale de l'œuvre de Ricœur, l'auteur proposant d'y lire une logique de développement en spirale, parce que dans les ouvrages les plus tardifs du philosophe nous trouvons un retour de la recherche sur la volonté — inscrite dans le cadre d'une anthropologie philosophique — qui avait inspiré son projet de jeunesse. Mouvement en spirale, et non retour circulaire aux origines, car entre le début et la fin il n'y a pas coïncidence mais enrichissement après un long détour à travers l'univers du langage. Ce détour — selon l'hypothèse de travail de l'auteur — progresse à travers trois paradigmes: symbole, texte et traduction. Dans la traduction travaillent le propre et l'étranger, le soi et l'autre, l'autre que nous retrouvons en nous et qui ne se réduit pas à l'altérité de l'autre homme. Un concept pluriel d'humanité — qui est pourtant une — y est à l'oeuvre. Le travail jamais accompli de la traduction suggère enfin l'idée d'une herméneutique de l'inachèvement. This article offers a global vision of Ricœur's work, in which the author suggests the existence of a spiral development, insofar as in the most recent works we find a return to the same research on the will — within the context of a philosophical anthropology — that inspired the project of Ricœur's youthful years. Spiral movement and not circular return to the origin, because the beginning and the end do not coincide but rather enrich one another, after a long detour of many decades through the universe of language. This detour — according to author's working hypothesis — has progressively developed through three paradigms: symbol, text and translation. In translation, what is at work is the familiar and the foreign, the self and the other, the other that we find in ourselves and that cannot be reduced to the otherness of the other man. In translation we find a plural concept of humanity, which is nevertheless one. The never complete work of translation suggests ultimately the idea of ~<br>

Abstract: Since the Kantian revolution, metaphysical knowledge has been articulated by influential theologians in the language of analogy. In accordance with this tradition, the metaphor found in Luke-Acts, that God does live in houses, but not houses built by men, is explored by studying it as a root metaphor. A root metaphor in the theological sense can be defined as the most basic assumption we can make about man's existence and experience. In this article John H Elliott's proposal that 'temple' and 'household' in Luke-Acts articulate a contrast in social institutions is debated. I wish to argue that this 'contrast' does not really articulate a shift in social institutions, but rather a broadening of an existing social institution as the result of a changed symbolic universe. This shift in symbolic universe is studied against the backdrop of a tendency to broaden the temple as a theological symbol which had already started and which intensified during the Second temple period. It is shown that the temple, its sacrificial offerings and purifying rituals, were closely associated with the household, its meals and purifying ceremonies. Jesus also advocated the broadening of the concept temple/household. His view is reportedly conveyed by Stephen, Peter, James, and Paul.<br>

Abstract: En liant, à partir d'une approche phénoménologique, travail, individu et vie, Michel Henry propose un magistral éclairage de toute l'oeuvre de Marx en tant qu'elle est essentiellement une critique de l'économie et une ontologie sociale. La radicalité d'une telle philosophie économique n'est que très peu soulignée par la pensée marxiste contemporaine, qui n'a sans doute pas donné à l'interprétation Michel Henry l'importance qui est la sienne. Pour autant, sa notion d'individus vivants, ainsi hypostasiés de leurs conditions objectives d'existence, conduit Michel Henry à déformer l'anthropologie de Marx et à en affaiblir la dimension politique. The aim of this article is to show the full critical power of the subjective philosophy of living-labour which Michel Henry develops out of Marx. The radicality of such an economic philosophy was only underlined very little by the contemporary thought Marxist which, one knows it, does not give to the interpretation of Michel Henry the major importance which should be his. For all that, his notion of alive individuals, so taked out from their objective conditions of existence, leads Michel Henry to deform the anthropology of Marx and to weaken the political dimension.<br>

Abstract: Tout groupe fonde son existence consciente dans un grand récit au sein duquel il se définit, établit les faits de son histoire et commémore sa destinée. Cet article entreprend de pénétrer au cœur de l'un des « chapitres » du grand récit collectif des Québécois, chapitre intitulé « Le Québec moderne », en tâchant de faire ressortir comment, en écrivant ce nouveau texte fondateur, la technocratie — à laquelle est ici accolée une définition particulière — réinvente le groupe à partir d'une triple opération : historique, mémorielle et identitaire. All groups base their conscious existence on a grand narrative by which they define themselves, establish the facts of their history and commemorate their destiny. This article seeks to go to the heart of one of the " chapters " of the grand narrative of the Quebecois, the chapter called " Modern Quebec ". It tries to show how, by writing this new founding text, technocracy — here given a special definition — reinvents the group on the basis of a three-fold operation, related to history, memory and identity.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i40124720<br>
Date: 10 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Steidl Christina R.<br>
Abstract: Recent research on collective memory suggests that commemorations of difficult pasts take either a multivocal or a fragmented form. I suggest these forms exist as ideal types for the initial commemoration, but the commemorative field, as a whole, remains dynamic over time, effectively shifting between forms. This study traces the creation, maintenance, and transformation of collective memory of the May 4, 1970 shootings at Kent State from 1970 to 2013 using archival sources, media accounts, and participant observation. In examining the commemorative field at Kent, I theorize the existence of a third commemorative form—the integrated commemorative field, which allows for the expression of divergent narratives and the maintenance of separate commemorative spaces while simultaneously enhancing social solidarity through shared meta-narratives that stress overarching values, like human rights or scientific inquiry.<br>

Article Title: Cinematic Shocks: Recognition, Aesthetic Experience, and Phenomenology<br>
Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138215<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Hanich Julian<br>
Abstract: In this article I suggest that we, as human beings, gain personal recognition not only through intersubjective encounters with others, but also through aesthetic experience. To support my claims about what I call 'aesthetic recognition,' I focus on a pervasive but rarely explored phenomenon: the cinematic shock. Not only a staple ingredient of thrillers, horror films, and disaster movies, it is also found in art-films. The cinematic shock will serve as the case in point of my argument because in its lived intensity, density, and conspicuousness we can describe it more easily with appropriate words than other aesthetic experiences that are equally able to foster aesthetic recognition but are less readily accessible via language. When experienced in the social environment of the movie theater, cinematic shocks enable two widespread types of aesthetic recognition: aesthetic experience as individual self-recognition, and aesthetic experience as a collective recognition of accord. Due to the strongly affective lived-body experience brought about by an encounter with the aesthetic object, the recipient not only feels self-aware of and self-affirmed in his or her own embodied existence, he or she also experiences confirmation as part of a group responding equally—in accordance—to an aesthetic object. This double recognition gained from the cinematic experience of shock derives from the individual film experience and the collective theatrical experience. An additional outcome of my methodological reliance on dense phenomenological descriptions may be an argument for the value of phenomenology in both the study of film and of aesthetics more generally.<br>

Article Title: Everyday multiculturalism: Theorising the difference between 'intersectionality' and 'multiple identities'<br>
Publisher: SAGE<br>
Issue: i40142780<br>
Date: 8 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Werbner Pnina<br>
Abstract: This paper contrasts intersectionality, the negative definition of identities, and multiple identities, the situational valorisation of positive identities, to argue for a generational shift in the performance of everyday multiculturalism in Britain. In everyday encounters, actors work to sustain the definition of the situation (Goffman) and with it a surface of civility and mutual respect which are nevertheless morally compelling. Everyday relationships flow smoothly and naturally, in an unreflexive, taken-for-granted way, to constitute shared positive identities (Schutz). Such surface civility may, however, be disrupted by communicative breakdowns whenever participants do not share implicit systems of relevancy. Deconstructive analyses that probe beneath the surface of the everyday can also reveal the existence of negative identities, subject to discrimination and stigmatisation. This paper contrasts the experience of first-generation Commonwealth immigrants to Britain with that of successive generations, who unreflexively displayed a shared British identity during the London 2012 Olympics.<br>

Publisher: Duncker & Humblot<br>
Issue: i40145734<br>
Date: 1 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Maschke Günter<br>
Abstract: The author uses the term "banalité supérieure" to describe Schmitt's somewhat shocking thesis that the true political distinction is the one between "friend" (Freund) and "enemy" (Feind). To be sure, this perception does not free one from the necessity of continually determining a new the concrete friend-enemy relationship. Using the more recent literature from Italy, France, Spain and Germany, the discussion centers around the question whether Schmitt had several political terms which he himself often used and combined in different ways. The author demonstrates the fruitfulness of the etymological and philosophical study of the words "friend" and "enemy". At the same time, he presents the thesis that "friend" is also a political term and, as such, remains connected to "enemy". Hence, it is not important whether a political theory accentuates the "friend" or the "enemy". The criticism that Schmitt's anthropology is incomplete is rejected. As the classic authors have shown, it is sufficient that a political theory appreciates the value of experience. Experience confirms, however, the existence of danger and evil in human nature. Nevertheless, danger and evil may not be regarded as identical; political theory and' theology must remain separate. In conclusion, the author rebuffs the allegation that Schmitt was interested in the destruction of the Weimar Republic.<br>

Abstract: Neste ensaio, entrelaço fios de vidas das mulheres negras que estáo atadas óï fio da minha vida. Com os fios soltos das canções de Zezé Motta e dos escritos da filósofa Hannah Arendt, teço este texto-existência. Na leitura dos ensaios e poemas de Marlene Nourbese Philip, escritora afro-caribenha, me inspiro não só para resistir às amarras culturais hegemônicas, mas também para transcendê-las, criando possibilidades de escrita que vincule a dinâmica da fala com a dinámica da ocóo, compondo um texto que se movimenta ora como dança, através do espaço, ora como urna canção, ritmada pelo tempo, pois criar e dançar uma coreografia é uma forma de fazer historia. Como investiga Selma Treviños, trata-se de urna ferramenta para animar o passado ou uma "escrita" acerca de algo que já foi feito, se concordamos que cada corpo carrega sua pròpria história e individualidade, memòria, sentimentos e emoções. Na busca do entendimento desta minha breve existência, danço, escrevo, teço palavras com fios desfiados da flor do útero das minhas ancestrais. Vasculho minhas lembranças e, na memória corporal, decifro a dor, encontró a raiz da violência, observo o medo, destilo a alegría, enfeito a doçura, mergulho na paz e conheço a liberdade. In that essay I interweave threads of the black women's lives that are tied to the thread of my life. With the free threads of Zezé Motta's songs and of philosopher Hannah Arendfs writings, I weave this text-existence. In the reading of the essay and poems of Marlene NourbeSe Philip, writer Afro-Caribbean, I am inspired not only to resist the hegemonic cultural ties, but also transcend them, creating possibilities of writing that links the dynamics of the speech with the dynamics of the action, to compose a text that is moved some times as a dance through the space, other times as a song, with its rhythm determinedby time, because creating and dancing a choreography is a form of making history. As investigates Selma Treviños it is a tool to encourage th~<br>

Abstract: Cet article cherche à montrer comment l'expérience de «l'écharde dans la chair» provoque chez l'apôtre Paul un changement important de conviction. La permanence de cette affliction dont il aurait bien voulu être débarrassé lui permet de comprendre comment, au cœur d'une souffrance extrême, la grâce de Dieu donne sa pleine mesure. Les drames de l'existence ne sont plus ressentis comme limite ou abandon de la grâce, mais reconnus comme des lieux où la puissance et la bonté de Dieu peuvent s'exprimer sans se contredire. This article attempts to show how the experience of "the thorn in the flesh" provokes in the apostle Paul an important change of conviction. The permanency of this affliction, from which he would have liked to be freed, permitted him to understand how, in the midst of extreme suffering, the grace of God is fully shown. The dramas of life are no longer felt as the limit or the cessation of grace, but are recognized as scenes in which the power and goodness of God can be expressed without contradiction.<br>

Abstract: Dans le contexte des recherches actuelles sur le corps, cet article souligne la fécondité du dialogue engagé par P. Ricœur entre les savoirs objectifs et la phénoménologie dans la description des rapports de la nature et de la liberté. Cette conversation dessine une mise en relation originale entre l'existence corporelle et la Transcendance; elle invite à reconnaître dans la corporéité le lieu d'incarnation d'une confiance primordiale. In the context of current research on the body, this articles underlines the rich dialogue begun by P. Ricœur between the objective sciences and phenomenology on the connection between nature and freedom. This dialogue establishes an original link between corporal existence and transcendence; it invites us to see corporality as the incarnation of a primordial trust.<br>

Abstract: Contrairement à certains préjugés laïcistes radicaux, la question de Dieu est au cœur de l'éthique. Or les débats actuels de la bioéthique ne permettent pas toujours d'identifier clairement la pertinence de cette question. Afin de parvenir à une reformulation crédible de la contribution de l'éthique théologique à la discussion publique, il importe d'interroger les différentes manières de comprendre la relation entre les catégories d'immanence et de transcendance. En dialogue critique avec H. Tristram Engelhardt, l'auteur balise les conditions fondamentales d'accès à une interprétation de Dieu comme mystère du monde et de l'existence et donc aussi comme horizon indépassable de toute éthique. Contrary to certain radical lay prejudices, the question of God is at the heart of ethics. Yet current debates on bioethics do not always help to clearly identify the pertinence of the question. To reformulate the contribution of theological ethics to public discussion in a credible way, we must examine the different ways of understanding the relationship between immanence and transcendance. In critical dialogue with H. Tristram Engelhardt, the author marks out the basic conditions to access an interpretation of God as mystery of the world and of existance, thus also as the impassable horizon of all ethics.<br>

Abstract: L'épreuve du doute est condition fondamentale du travail du théologien. Mais elle est également condition fondamentale de l'existence des croyantes et croyants. Partant de cette double hypothèse, l'article se donne pour but d'explorer la fécondité du doute, en travaillant pour ce faire sur les deux plans de la théologie et de la foi dont la théologie entreprend de rendre compte. S'inspirant de quelques modèles issus d'époques diverses de l'histoire des idées, l'auteur tente de mettre en lumière la contribution fertile du doute dans le travail théologique en tant que tâche actuelle. Putting doubt to the test is a fundamental condition of the theologian's job. But it is also a fundamental condition in the life of believers. On this double premise, the article tries to explore the fecundity of doubt both in theology and in the domain of faith, of which the task of theology is to render account. Inspired by models from diverse eras in the history of ideas, the author throws light on the fertile contribution of doubt to modern theology.<br>

Abstract: Quelques questions philosophiques suggérées par la lecture du livre de J.-P. Jossua Lectures en écho. Journal théologique I, Paris 1976. Le recours à l'« expérience » devant la faillite des divers dogmatismes permet-il de donner un sens au témoignage de l'absolu? Le refus d'appuyer le christianisme à la culpabilité doit-il aboutir nécessairement à une revendication d'innocence sans intégrer l'apport des analyses de la flnitude et thématiser la condition de créature, inséparablement innocente et coupable? Penser que l'écriture est le lieu privilégié de manifestation du « je », n'est-ce pas recourir au postulat ontologique de la vérité comme fusion de la parole, du sens, du vécu, de la présence de l'homme et de sa vie? Some philosophical questions which arose from reading the book of J.-P. Jossua, Lectures en écho. Journal théologique I, Paris 1976. When faced with the failure of various dogmatisms, would not the recourse to "experience" by its very nature prevent "witness" from being an affirmation of the Absolute? By refusing to let Christianity lean on culpability, would one necessarily end up in a claim of innocence which would not integrate the contribution of analyses of limitedness and which would not come to grips with the condition of a creature which is inseparably innocent and culpable? By thinking that writing is the privileged place for the manifestation of the "ego", is one not resorting to the ontological postulate of truth as an amalgamation of word, sens, existence of man and life?<br>

Abstract: Le jugement de valeur est étudié par Nabert dans les Éléments pour une éthique. Il se situe à l'articulation de la compréhension de soi, de l'affirmation originaire et de la régénération. Pensé comme expression d'un acte originaire et non comme participation à l'être, il permet de lier réflexion, création et pluralité. Cette perspective métaphysique, soutenue par une philosophie réflexive de la conscience, suscite une perspective critique par rapport aux théories substantialistes (Scheler, Spaemann) ou procédurales (Habermas, Renaut) de la valeur. Si la valeur est promotion d'existence, les prédicats négatifs donnent forme à l'acte de protestation contre le mal, l'injustifiable. Jean Nabert studies the judgment of value in his Éléments pour une éthique. He himself is situated at the crossroads of the comprehension of self, original affirmation, and regeneration. Seen as the expression of an originating act and not as a participation in being, it can tie together reflexion, creation and plurality. This metaphysical perspective sustained by a reflexive philosophy of conscience invites a critical perspective in relation to substantialist (Scheler, Spaemann) or procedural (Habermas, Renaut) theories of value. If value is promotion of existence, then negative predicates give form to the act of protest against evil, the unjustifiable.<br>

Abstract: Dans l'Essai sur le mal, Jean Nabert, poursuivant une démarche déjà engagée dans les Éléments pour une éthique, affronte la question de la possibilité d'une justification de l'existence humaine, L'A. propose une analyse des grandes étapes de cet essai Dans le ch. 1, il décrit les diverses figures d'un mal excédant le champ défini par les normes de la moralité, et recherche les conditions de possibilité d'une telle expérience. Dans les ch. 2 à 4, il poursuit l'analyse de l'expérience d'un mal intérieur au vouloir propre et que dissimule la réduction de celui-ci à la transgression des normes d'un sujet autonome, et il examine la compréhension de soi du sujet de l'expérience impliquée dans cette dimension du mal. Dans le dernier chapitre, il pose la question des limites de ce que permet d'espérer une « approche de la justification » par un moi tel qu'il s'est d'abord compris par réflexion sur ces données fondamentales de son expérience; au sommet de cette approche, il aborde la question de la possibilité du pardon. Pursuing along the same lines as in his Éléments pour une éthique, Jean Nabert, in his Essai sur le mal, tackles the question of the possibility of justifying human existence. The author proposes to analyze the major stages in this essay. In chapter 1, he describes diverse representations of evil that exceed the boundaries as defined by the norms of morality, and researches the conditions in which such experiences are possible. In chapters 2 to 4, he continues the analysis of evil intrinsic to will itself, which is obscured by the reduction of this evil to the transgression of an autonomous subject's limits, and examines the subject's comprehension of self when implicated in this dimension of evil. In the last chapter, the question is asked of the limitations of that which an « approach to justification » may permit to be hoped for by a self such as first understood upon reflexion of the fundamental data of his experience; at the apex of this approach, he ad~<br>

Publisher: LIBRAIRIE PHILOSOPHIQUE J. VRIN<br>
Issue: i40185026<br>

Abstract: L'auteur se propose de vérifier l'affirmation de Lavelle selon laquelle l'ouvrage de 1937, De l'Acte, se serait progressivement développé comme une synthèse complète de sa philosophie. Or il existe, à l'état dactylographié, une version antérieure de ce livre, qui permet de comprendre combien l'aisance presque trop grande des analyses de 1937 cache en fait une élaboration lente et un effort continu. La version inédite insiste sur l'intemporalité transcendantale de l'acte, et sur l'impersonnalité de l'acte fondateur de toutes les existences personnelles. Ces thèses seront abandonnées en 1937. On analyse ensuite l'article « Être et Acte » et la conférence de la société française de philosophie sur « Acte créateur et acte réflexif », où est discutée la position de Jean Nabert. Les thèses de De l'Acte montrent une progression de l'identité de l'être et de l'acte (dans l'acte d'être) jusqu'à l'acte en sa forme la plus haute, l'acte d'amour. Situer cette œuvre capitale implique qu'on ait bien compris l'interprétation du sensible comme de la donnée matérielle qui doit être spiritualisée. L'expérience extérieure du sensible s'oppose à l'expérience intérieure de l'esprit. Et l'acte est l'œuvre de l'être spirituel. L'ontologie dynamique de Lavelle est une affirmation de la liberté humaine comme participation à l'acte créateur divin. Divin ou humain, l'être est subjectif parce que libre. Ainsi Lavelle s'inscrit dans la tradition platonicienne moderne, celle d'Avicenne d'abord, celle de Hegel ensuite. The author proposes to verify Lavelle's assertion that the 1937 work, De l'Acte, would be progressively developed as a complete synthesis of his philosophy. Now there exists in typewritten state an earlier version of this book, which allows us to see the extent to which the almost excessive facility of analyses of 1937 in fact conceals a slow development and a continuous effort. The unedited version insists upon the transcendental atemporality of act, and upon the impersonality of ~<br>

Abstract: Rousseau opposed both traditional and modern (empiricist) thinking when he made self-love the cornerstone of his system. Other modes of thought treat self-consciousness as constituted primarily by temporal desire. Rousseau raises love, for him the suspension of desire, to a position of ontological primacy in regard to self-consciousness. Like Pascal, he throws the empirical existence of the self into radical question and finds it to be as insubstantial and empty a concept as the Western tradition has found it-from Ecclesiastes and Socrates on. Rousseau declines the moralistic reproof of the self, however, and emphasizes its insubstantiality as its one strength, although a fictional one. The self exists only in the mode of a hypothesis (the fictional "as if"): it is a failure at being. But to amour (and to pitié) it makes all the difference and is worthy of their support.<br>

Abstract: This paper challenges the common assumption that the attention which modern literary theory pays to the textual aspects of literature is achieved at the expense of humanistic and moral concerns. It starts by outlining how modern literary theory differs epistemologically from the traditional critical approaches to literature. Traditional critical theory was developed in the defense of poetry against Plato's accusations, real or imagined, and this informed both its critical practice and its concept of man. It established its epistemology on an aesthetic, moral, social, philosophical or scientific basis in a manner that encumbered literature with the concepts of man inherent in them. In contrast, modern literary theory started from a different premise: instead of seeking to justify literature and its moral relevance, it strove to identify its literariness and the dynamics of its structure by using the disciplines of semiotics and linguistics. It posited the text as an autonomous entity and a complete structure aware of its existence in a society of texts with which it conducts a profoundly intertextual dialogue. As an autonomous structure, the literary work is independent of other social or philosophical constructs and thus capable of conducting a meaningful dialogue with them. The paper elaborates the various conceptual frameworks of Russian formalism, intertextuality, structuralism and deconstruction in order to examine their implicit assumptions about man. It shows how the autonomous and dialogical nature of the literary work in its Bakhtinian sense are relevant to the concept of man inherent in modern literary theory. In its elaboration of this concept, the paper shows how it was developed in conflict with the hierarchical nature of traditional, ethical and philosophical values. It illustrates also the relevance of autonomy, self-regulation, free-play and fair representation inherent in many concepts of modern literary theory to the question of human rights. The qu~<br>

Abstract: A properly sociological definition of the concept of discourse does not exist because the notion has never been detached from the linguistic sphere. Not only linguists and semiologists, but also sociologists, use the word primarily as a linguistic category. This article attempts to define the concept of discourse sociologically. It is argued that a sociologically defined notion should be dissociated from the linguistic realm. As a linguistic category, 'discourse' is either used as a synonym for language or text, or is closely associated with one of these notions. 'Discourse' in a sociological sense should refer to a class of texts. This definition confers upon the concept of discourse an intertextual dimension. Defined in this way, the category can not only become an operative sociological concept, but it also becomes autonomous and is no longer reducible to linguistic or paralinguistic conceptual entities, such as text or language. No longer confined to the linguistic realm, the concept can designate a particular entity which possesses its own existence. Discourse can become a thing in itself. The argument is presented in three parts. The first is a critique of the current definitions of the concept 'discourse'. The second proposes, as an alternative, a sociological definition of discourse. Finally the third part applies this new definition in a sociological analysis of journalism.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the
         sugyain the Babylonian Talmud that includes the story of the Oven of Akhnai, in BTBaba metzi‘‘a58b––59b, expanding earlier studies by Jeffrey Rubenstein and Charlotte Fonrobert. It shows that two scriptural quotations involving, respectively, David and Tamar, situated in the first part of thesugya, anticipate the subsequent story and clarify how it functions as a ““foundation myth”” of the Beit Midrash (Fonrobert), and, therefore, of male identity (Boyarin). I suggest that the entiresugyaconstructs male identity by way of contrast with two ““others,”” the divine and the female realms, which are excluded from the Law-making process. The danger of verbal wrong, however, reveals the necessity of reintroducing the excluded ““others.”” The text achieves this by recognizing the existence of a transcendent justice, and by making Tamar, a foreign and female character with no access to the Law, a model of delicacy in verbal communication.<br>

Abstract: An alternative optic on contemporary writing becomes available if we look back to Latin America nearly one hundred years ago. At the same time as the “Cannibalist Manifesto” was being written and circulated in Brazil, the polemic surrounding the reception of the Spanish-speaking poetic vanguard clustered around three major issues: the significance of technique; the existence of genuine novelty in avant-garde poetry; and creative sincerity and profundity.
         
               Consider, alongside the “Cannibalist Manifesto,” another, earlier founding document of Latin American letters, a short text by José Martí. Martí, an originator of54
            modernismoand a revolutionary leader in the Cuban struggle for independence, introduced a late nineteenth-century volume of his poems with a prose piece that declares, “These are my verses. I borrowed them from no one.”
               He continues:55
            
               Martí invokes Aristotelian mimesis as crucial to the writing of a poem: in this tale of literary composition, the writer filters reality and imagination and copies his perceptions onto the page. Yet the process of “copying” does not introduce any falsehood or deception. Quite to the contrary, Martí stakes out a poetics of sincerity and authenticity rooted in his own physical person, springing from his “own blood” rather than intellectual abstraction or a hodgepodge of combinatoric procedures. Martí states that the writer himself serves as his own warrant of truth, his own guarantor, because he has acquired knowledge through sensory experience (“None of them has emerged from my mind, warmed over, artful and beautified; they have come like tears springing from the eyes or blood spurting out from a wound…. I did not stitch together bits of this and that, but cut deep into myself. These poems emerged written not in academic ink but in my own blood. Whatever I place on view here I once have seen (

Abstract: If Dekuah signifies the unwillingness to live, or reminds us of the Frankenstein syndrome, as suggested above, it is no surprise that the child in the poem immediately announces that he is not Dekuah; he has not come to die. Emphasizing the singularity of his existence, his will to live, he says, “I've never been born before,” and then goes on to announce what he is and what he desires. “My name is Nehklon / Let me live.” Of particular relevance is the shift from the negative declaration “I am not” to a positive one, “I am.” In this linguistic switch, the poet signals a deeper moral and existential consequence. In this shift from a reactionary attitude to life to one that is proactive, Jabbeh Wesley brings the challenges of life affirmation to the consciousness of her readers. Through Nehklon, she enables us to imagine people taking charge of their lives, as Primo Levi does in his “If This Is a Man.” It is therefore not only Nehklon who pleads; all Liberians plead for a chance to live, for a fair share in life's bounty. There is nothing to be happy about in the remembrance of the war's violence; there is no happy ending for the narrative other than the hope that people might be allowed to live and to thrive. People are not Dekuahs; they have not come to die.<br>

Abstract: The term
         transculturation
            
               was first used by the Cuban sociologist Fernando Ortiz to describe the existence and relationships between the indigenous African and Spanish populations in Cuba.32
            
               He shows how these groups adapted to each other in modes of language, music, art, and agricultural work. The contemporary usage of the term has been enhanced by Mary Louise Pratt's attention to the meaning of travel in the transcultural situation.33
            
               For Pratt, transculturation brings into being “contact zones” within which cultures meet, clash, and grapple. According to Pratt the zones give expression to an improvisational modality. These contact zones have taken place for a long time over almost all the geographical spaces of the earth. The adaptation and improvisations coincidental to situations of this kind have to do with the pace and rhythm of the dominating culture, the number and variety of cultures in contact, and the rhetoric of occupation.34<br>

Abstract: In the event, SPEP did seem to be made up of oddballs and outsiders in those early years. In 1964 it was a bit larger than the twenty or thirty souls that Ed Casey describes in his paper, but not by much. The leadership was a diverse bunch: Aron Gurwitsch, gruff and insistent on rigor and clarity, the embodiment of the old-school European professor. His presence made me aware, for the first time, I think, of the existence of the New School for Social Research, that amazing institution where I would later teach and am teaching now. John Wild, with the fervor of the recent convert himself, was eager to convert others. According to one tale, possibly apocryphal, an undergraduate student reported that he kept talking about a place called “Lebensville” and saying we ought to go back there. Herbert Spiegelberg, sweetest of men, had earned the respect and gratitude of all for publishing his two-volume
      The Phenomenological Movement, which had appeared in 1960. George Schrader, slowly abandoning Kant for Heidegger. Bill Earle, a very smooth talker—that's all I remember. Erwin Straus, who in his old age exemplified, every time he stood up to speak, the epic struggle of our species to attain the upright posture. Dreyfus, Todes, Lingus, Schrag, and Edie were the Young Turks in that group. We graduate students, still looking on curiously from the sidelines at that point, slowly got a sense of the great learning and intellectual integrity of our elders and also eventually picked up the excitement of being an embattled minority struggling for survival and recognition.<br>

Abstract: I remember also being frustrated by Kierkegaard's tendency to reverse the modern idiom, so that he praises the power of “indirect” speech and elevates subjectivity over objectivity. Why, in a world full of objectivistic thinkers, should we start by voluntarily putting our bodies, our sense of what is important in life, and our shared social practices into ontological second place? Likewise, must we settle for Jaspers's mystification of
      ExistenzandTranscendenzby calling them the UNrepresentable? And do we really articulate better how it is to be in a world with others by following Sartre's famous reversal of essence and existence—as if an inverted Cartesianism comes closer to expressing lifeworld concerns than theMeditations on First Philosophy?<br>

Article Title: The Plight of Ethics<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: In the history of moral philosophy culminating in our moment of hyperbolic ethics, our plight has become less familiar and more uncanny, as the notion of duty or obligation increasingly takes on the sense of risk and urgency involved in substituting myself for another in a way that entails danger, even hostage, which, by the way, also has its roots in a Latin word for pledge—
      pledgein the sense of giving oneself over for the other and also in the sense of making a promise or a binding oath, in other words, a speech act, the very possibility of which assumes both other people and the Other of language and culture. Kant's autonomous will gives way to the vulnerability of the face for Levinas or suffering as the uncanny “capacity” for vulnerability for Derrida. The “I can” of moral agency becomes passively subjected to the other upon whom it depends ontologically and biologically for its very existence. Levinas proposes a responsibility that I cannot refuse because there is no I without it. Insofar as I am, I am answerable and responsible to and for the other. Contra Hegel and Sartre, Levinas (1998) maintains that subjectivity is not the in-itself become for-itself but, rather, the in-itself become for-the other. Yet Levinas insists that this hyperethical responsibility operates on a level opposed to the political. Justice, he says, requires a third, whereas the force of our ethical obligation finds its imperative in the face-to-face relation, which cannot be translated into the political realm.<br>

Abstract: One may be tempted to hold that Brentano's view of a psychic substance moves toward a dual-aspect theory (such as Peter Strawson's position), where the object present in the third person (“person” [for Strawson] or “brain” [for others]) is the substrate of both the ascribed mental and physical properties. Yet Brentano believed that it “was beyond any doubt” that mental phenomena have something mental as their substantial support and not something extended.
            
                  But when the mental substance is not awake it does not fall out of existence but, rather, continues to exist and somehow as the unconscious mental substance is itself the possibility and the source of subsequent consciousness.9
               
                  The question perhaps remains whether this unconsciousness is itself utter oblivion or a consciousness of the possibility to be self-reflexive, which reflexivity is always the heart of consciousness for Brentano.10<br>

Abstract: There are perceptible changes in the orientation of SPEP papers in the 1960s. The eleven papers from the first two programs that James Edie edited and published in 1965 range within the phenomenological/existential area from issues of perception, lifeworld, and Husserlian horizons to authentic existence, solitude, and avoidance of the void.
         
               The next three meetings broadened the range of topics considerably by featuring papers that connected phenomenology to artificial intelligence, natural science, linguistics, schizophrenia, body image, social roles, tragedy, the experience of the holy, Hume, Kant, and Wittgenstein. A new person in the European scene, Jacques Derrida, was invited to the fifth conference, but he was unable to attend (he sent a mimeographed copy of his paper that was available in French for those at the conference who might wish to read it).1<br>

Abstract: Of all the philosophers Catholics read, Heidegger enjoyed pride of place, aided by a wave of English translations and by the landmark study
            Heidegger: Through Phenomenology to Thought, by William Richardson, a Jesuit then at Fordham University.
                     When Catholic philosophers read7
                  Being and Timeit sounded just like what they who were wary of modernity had been looking for. When Heidegger criticized Descartes's idea of a worldless subject and his reduction of the world tores extensa, when Heidegger said that the question of the existence of the world when it is raised by a being whose being is being-in-the-world makes no sense, when Heidegger said that as soon as Dasein comes to be it finds that it is already there, that made instant sense to Catholic realists.
                     They had been critical of modern Cartesian epistemology for decades,8
                  
                     and here was Heidegger putting that argument on the map of contemporary philosophy in an original and magisterial way. When the “later” Heidegger offered a critique of what he called “onto-theo-logic,” when he said that an atheism about the God of metaphysics, about the9
                  causa sui, was closer to the truly divine God, Catholics knew from firsthand experience what he was talking about.
                     They had enough of the neo-Scholastic manuals, and they wanted to “overcome” them.10

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: For example, Saint Anselm of Canterbury posits in
         Proslogion, and more extensively inLiber apologeticus contra Gaunilonem, that “God is that than which nothing greater can be conceived.” One might suggest that he is here engaging in a hyperbolic mode of thought in his argument of unlimited development for the ontological proof of God's existence. Other than for his satisfaction theory of atonement offered inCur deus homo, Anselm is most known for this proof. Responding, in many ways, to nominalists such as Roscellin, abbot of Compiegne, who argued that universals are only words and have no actual existence, Anselm sought to prove God's existence through reason alone. For Anselm, God is a “universal substance,” which exists in both intellect and reality, and is the rule against which all is measured. In his argument he pushes toward this ultimate term, which he takes to dizzying heights through his use ofamplificatio. Employingincrementumby asserting what has no superior at all (Quintilian 8.4.7), Anselm presents his argument of intense degree—“that than which nothing greater can be conceived.” Although it is doubtful his explicit intent is to approach his discussion of God from a hyperbolic standpoint, in order to address the exigence of such an extraordinary subject matter he argues in the most effective way possible—through the practice of excess. Drawing the mind to the extreme limit, as Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca say, Anselm stretches the limits of reason through the hyperbolic within an argument of unlimited development in order to express what is inconceivable.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.46.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: The concept of the agential spiral is both derived from and builds on Paul Ricoeur's concept of “threefold mimesis.” Developed most explicitly in
      Time and Narrative, “threefold mimesis” traces how narrative represents human action by emplotting it in a framework of temporality. Ricoeur views time and narrative as integral elements of the human condition and our own understanding of it: “Time becomes human to the extent that it is articulated through a narrative mode, and narrative attains its full meaning when it becomes a condition of temporal existence” (1984, 1:52). The narrative creates an imagined world that, in turn, leads readers to act in the real world. Although Ricoeur gestures toward the public judgment and action that are the end of persuasion, he turns back to the individual experience of catharsis—the end of poetics—to explain how the reader “appropriates” the world of the read text. The concept of appropriation presented by Ricoeur primarily refers to the phenomenological experience of a change in perspective rather than a rhetorically produced orientation toward public action. I argue that Ricoeur's emphasis on appropriation through catharsis limits the usefulness of threefold mimesis as a means of understanding how texts (in our case, texts or practices of public memory) invite specificallypublicactions. Therefore, my reading of Ricoeur draws attention to two issues that Ricoeur underemphasizes. First, my reading highlights both the various agents who interpret and act on the past and their transhistorical relationships with one another. Specifically, I am interested in understanding how public memories respond to diachronic as well as synchronic collective contexts. Focusing on these performances of agency enables critical scholars to see how the representation of agency itself can link past, present, and future. Second, I use Maurice Charland's familiar concept of constitutive rhetoric to knit Ricoeur's ideas more tightly to rhetorical conce~<br>

Article Title: Dilemmas and Delusions<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: shaw.34.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Wixson Christopher<br>
Abstract: Along the same lines, in the preface to
      Man and Superman, he draws a distinction between two states of corporeal infirmity. The first, what he calls “the true joy of life,” results from “the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap, the being a force of nature.” The second is engendered by a failure of will and perspective, producing “a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.”
            Scholars and biographers have taken both views of Shaw. Countless testimonies of friends and acquaintances as well as innumerable pronouncements by GBS himself laud the extraordinary vibrancy of the “active young revolutionist” following his typical schedule of prolific writing and speech giving.22
         
            At the same time, Shaw's private diaries are replete with meticulous physiological self-examination, documenting his crippling headaches as well as myriad illnesses, injuries, changes in weight and appetite, and suspected symptoms. Robert Brustein attributes “a kind of Swiftian disgust at the human body and its functions” to the playwright, while Sally Peters pathologizes his interest in health, arguing its origin in latent psychosis, specifically an obsessive fear of contagion.23
         
            His commitment to vegetarianism, teetotalism, and Jaegerism, she argues, was founded as much upon hygienic paranoia as moral principle: “Fueled by a “desperate revulsion from body and biology[,] … Shaw's was an ever-lasting defense against dirt, poison, and contamination[,] whatever symbolized to him the form-destroying potencies of existence.”24
         
            In any case, the vexed body, on its way to evolutionary elimination, assiduously preoccupied Shaw, and matters of personal and public wellness remained an idée fixe until the end of his life.25<br>

Abstract: Yes, regrettably, the species is fallen and the will is impaired. Nevertheless, these deficiencies are remediable for Shaw and Ricoeur. The two place unwavering faith in the ineradicable goodness of creation and lodge unflagging hope in the inextirpable capacity of humans to repair the damage they have done to themselves and the planet that houses them. Things can be different. Lives need not be beggared. Tomorrow can be better than today. This is the inspiriting wager Shaw and Ricoeur make, with eyes fully open to the countless maladies that mar existence. Through the maelstroms that swirled around them, they stayed the course, undaunted: they remained faithful, hopeful, spiritual, creative, and humane; they lived long, active, and productive lives of notable achievement; they made uplifting the least advantaged the locus of their ameliorative efforts; they sought justice, equality, and reconciliation for everyone; and the world is a much better place because of them. By such benchmarks, Shaw and Ricoeur epitomize wellness. For these kindred spirits, ever the intrepid circumnavigators of the entropic regions, one touch of the divine that permeates the universe makes us all brothers and sisters under the skin. Accordingly, as harried members of a single global family under siege, it follows in their thinking that we are responsible for one another's welfare, and that we cannot save our individual selves apart from saving humankind at large. Hence, we cannot injure someone unjustly, or allow another to suffer unnecessarily, without diminishing ourselves. In the inclusive society they envision, our shared humanity elicits shared responses to life's exigencies wherever they occur.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Leopold Bloom, in
         Ulysses, expansively describes the Utopian as affording “no known method from the known to the unknown.”
               Utopia is a place that is impossible to arrive at by any known route, in that it is not really a place at all. It is therefore essential that, in order to reach Utopia, one takes an unknown and unknowable route, a path determined by its indeterminacy, a passage that deconstructs its own rationalistic epistemological foundations. It is only in its paradoxical nature that such a route, beyond sense (which forbids entry into the unreal), might discover the reality of that unreality. For, in the end, despite its fantastical absurdities—its self-conscious nowhereness—Joyce's Dublin, like Butler's Erewhon, is the opposite of nowhere: it is somewhere. It is by inscribing the material (the somewhere) within the dream (the nowhere) that the dream might be sustained; and it is also by inscribing the dream within the real that material existence can continue.166<br>

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: It is also worth noting that Bristol's assertion that architects are relatively powerless in determining the outcome, or consequences, of their works unfortunately encourages the view that architects thus need not take any responsibility for what they do. Such resignation would also seem to confirm the pointlessness of Utopia: if architecture is impotent in effecting “social change” because architects are “implicated” in the “structures and practices” of the system within which they operate, then their ability to plan a Utopia must be null. As bleakly attractive as this proposition might be, accepting it ignores the persisting existence of possibilities for subverting systems from within, even by architects entrapped by the forces of speculation that define the building industry. Unfortunately, it appears that this prospect is alien to Vidler, for example, who believes that “the fall of the Berlin Wall, the proclaimed death of communism and Marx, finished utopian thought very quickly. Perhaps one might say that utopian thought killed the possibility of utopian thought?”
