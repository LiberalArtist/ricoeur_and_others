  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w76ttq">Exploring Jesuit Distinctiveness</a><br>
  Author(s) Leitão Henrique<br>
  Abstract: “Two more private and particular considerations encouraged me in the work. The first, that I am a Spaniard; the second, that I am a priest of the Society of Jesus.”¹ Such was the explanation offered by the priest and scholar Pedro de Ribadeneyra (1526–1611) for the production of the
                  Historia eclesiastica del scisma del reyno de Inglaterra(henceforth, the “Historia”), his polemical account of the English Reformation. Troublingly, virtually all scholarship on theHistoriahas concentrated on the former factor, to the detriment of our appreciation of the latter.

  Book Title: The Genesis of Desire-  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Webb Eugene<br>
  Abstract: We seem to be abandoning the codes that told previous generations who they should love. But now that many of us are free to choose whoever we want, nothing is less certain. The proliferation of divorces and separations reveal a dynamic we would rather not see: others sometimes reject us as passionately as we are attracted to them.Our desire makes us sick. The throes of rivalry are at the heart of our attraction to one another. This is the central thesis of Jean-Michel Oughourlian's
      The Genesis of Desire, where the war of the sexes is finally given a scientific explanation. The discovery of mirror neurons corroborates his ideas, clarifying the phenomena of empathy and the mechanisms of violent reciprocity.How can a couple be saved when they have declared war on one another? By helping them realize that desire originates not in the self but in the other. There are strategies that can help, which Dr. Oughourlian has prescribed successfully to his patients. This work, alternating between case studies and more theoretical statements, convincingly defends the possibility that breakups need not be permanent.<br>

  Author(s) CERVIGNI DINO S.<br>
  Abstract: Canto XIX of the
                  Purgatoriohas not been among the most favored in terms of its readers’ attention. A survey of its critical history reveals, moreover, that readers have been attracted largely by one element, that of the dream of the siren with which the canto begins. The account of the pilgrim’s dream, however, occupies only nine tercets, or twenty-seven verses out of a total of 145. Even if we include in the episode the two introductory tercets that afford a temporal orientation, as well as the dreamer’s awakening to Virgil’s call and the latter’s explanation of the dream experience,<br>

  Book Title: Reason to Believe-Cultural Agency in Latin American Evangelicalism<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Smilde David<br>
  Abstract: Evangelical Protestantism has arguably become the fastest-growing religion in South America, if not the world. For converts, it emphasizes self-discipline and provides a network of communal support, which together have helped many overcome substance abuse, avoid crime and violence, and resolve relationship problems. But can people simply decide to believe in a religion because of the benefits it reportedly delivers? Based on extensive fieldwork among Pentecostal men in Caracas, Venezuela, this rich urban ethnography seeks an explanation for the explosion of Evangelical Protestantism, unraveling the cultural and personal dynamics of Evangelical conversion to show how and why these men make the choice to convert, and how they come to have faith in a new system of beliefs and practices.<br>

  Abstract: Thornton Wilder’s masterpiece,
                  The Bridge of San Luis Rey, begins with a tragedy that seems to defy explanation. A rope bridge gives way as a group of travellers are crossing a deep canyon, and they are thrown to their deaths. A Franciscan priest who witnesses the accident is both stunned and mystified. “The bridge seemed to be among the things that last forever; it was unthinkable that it should break.”¹ Brother Juniper doubts that a benevolent God would allow this fate to befall innocent people. There must surely be some reason for their deaths. “Why did this happen to those<br>

  Author(s) VUAILLE-BARCAN MARIE-LAURE<br>
  Abstract: The theme of exploration requires little explanation in terms of its relevance to the constant strivings of human life and, by extension, to the activities of learning and scholarship; indeed, with its corollary of the journey, it underlines, as do writings since time immemorial, including many a school motto, the intimate relationship between seeking and discovering; striving and finding; quest and knowledge. The title of this volume —

  Abstract: The imagination is notoriously difficult to define.¹ Indeed, this difficulty may explain the fact that prior to the Enlightenment there was no attempt to develop a unified theory of the imagination. In the history of ancient Greek philosophy, its amorphous character contributed to its being treated in two distinct, albeit related, ways. On the one hand, imagination was defined in terms of inspired artistic expression, outside the realm of explanation and description. On the other, it was described as a mysterious mental faculty that somehow accomplished the impossible, bridging the divide between the world of sensation and the world of<br>

  Author(s) BELL MICHAEL M.<br>
  Abstract: Michael Bell’s proposal for a “dialogic sociology” (this volume) is a response to what he perceives to be an obsession in the discipline with “total explanation,” which means that the sociological researcher attempts to develop a comprehensive understanding of a phenomenon using a conceptual apparatus that emphasizes causality, predictability, objectivity, and neutrality. He argues that sociologists are so preoccupied with discovering whether their preconceptions about social life are correct that they do not attempt to understand the social conditions in which people behave in ways that sociologists do not expect.<br>

  Book Title: The Cruelest of All Mothers: Marie de l'Incarnation, Motherhood, and Christian Tradition-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dunn Mary<br>
  Abstract: In 1631, Marie Guyart stepped over the threshold of the Ursuline convent in Tours, leaving behind her eleven-year-old son, Claude, against the wishes of her family and her own misgivings. Marie concluded, "God was dearer to me than all that. Leaving him therefore in His hands, I bid adieu to him joyfully." Claude organized a band of schoolboys to storm the convent, begging for his mother's return. Eight years later, Marie made her way to Quebec, where over the course of the next thirty-three years she opened the first school for Native American girls, translated catechisms into indigenous languages, and served some eighteen years as superior of the first Ursuline convent in the New World. She would also maintain, over this same period, an extensive and intimate correspondence with the son she had abandoned to serve God. The Cruelest of All Mothers is, fundamentally, an explanation of Marie de l'Incarnation's decision to abandon Claude for religious life. Complicating Marie's own explication of the abandonment as a sacrifice carried out in imitation of Christ and in submission to God's will, the book situates the event against the background of early modern French family life, the marginalization of motherhood in the Christian tradition, and seventeenth-century French Catholic spirituality. Deeply grounded in a set of rich primary sources, The Cruelest of All Mothers offers a rich and complex analysis of the abandonment.<br>

  Abstract: To his critics, Bourdieu’s understanding of human agency (upon which I have relied to loosely structure my explanation of the abandonment) amounts to nothing more than a sophisticated version of social determinism.¹ Although Bourdieu’s intention had been to articulate a way of thinking about why people do what they do that transcended the reductive binaries of domination and resistance, his critics have consistently accused him of proposing a model of agency that condemns human actors to the reproduction of their own histories. And it is easy to see upon what logical grounds such accusations rest. For Bourdieu, after all, social<br>

In many of his sermons, Eckhart speaks of man “without qualities [âne eigenschaften],”¹ thus fashioning a term and a concept for a religious ideal that embodies specific aspects of detachment, freedom, and salvation.

  Abstract: The origins of Western atheism lie in classical antiquity, in which first developed a naturalistic and empirical explanation of the world. Already visible in Greece in the philosophy of the Sophists of the second half of the fifth century B.C., this replacement of divine by natural causation became much more pronounced in the later schools of Epicurean Materialism and Scepticism. It is not easy to say precisely why this occurred, and why the old mythological conception of the gods as the sole agents of creation should have declined so rapidly.

Since knowledge derived from experience can never claim necessity, Kant concludes that such knowledge must be transcendental in origin. His account of how such knowledge is possible focusses on transcendental apperception and the order that it imposes upon the experience.

Indeed, simple homeostatic devices such as the fantail, even as they made possible the industrial revolution, served as the first modern models of political economy (Wootton 2007:42).

This warning is immediately followed by a religious explanation: ever since biblical times, the twelve ancient tribes produced twelve different sets of prayers, each delivered to twelve heavenly gates. As a result, a person who changes the prayers of his ancestors “confuses” the gates. The narrator explains that recent generations have already been punished for confusing the prayers, hence creating chaos and altercations<br>

  Abstract: In Modiano’s novels of the seventies, eighties and early nineties, the young female characters tended not to be very developed, broadly speaking: they were fairly generic ‘mystery women’ who attracted the young male narrator, often leading him to make undesirable acquaintances, and then disappearing without explanation, breaking his heart and giving him a reason to write about the experience. They were often a little, at times much, older than him, and their lives subordinate to that of the male narrator, both in narrative terms—that is to say, they were never narrators—and in terms of sheer content.

However, this does not mean that our explanation of human nature and of the human person need be involved or complicated. In fact, anthropology seeks above all a once-off, simple, unitary, integrated explanation of human identity. The search for truth, in fact, is always a search for unity, for simplicity, for harmony, for coherence. In other words, in order to<br>

  Abstract: John 5:18 says that the plot to have Jesus killed began because Jesus was “making himself equal to God.” This assertion can hardly be historical, so we must seek an explanation for it in the history of the Johannine circle. It was not only the Johannine Christians who made such connections, of course. Already in Mark hostility against Jesus is first aroused by his claim to exercise a prerogative—to forgive sins—that is God’s alone (Mark 2:7), and the actual plot against his life springs, as in John, from a Sabbath healing (3:6).

These include changes within the work of a single writer, changes among different writers who share common ends, like the Scriblerus group (this can include, as well, changes in what are called “schools,” “movements,” and “periods”), changes in the forms of genres, changes in style, changes in critical interpretation.

  Book Title: Heidegger's Estrangements-Language, Truth, and Poetry in the Later Writings<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Bruns Gerald L.<br>
  Abstract: According to Bruns, the strangeness of Heidegger's later writings is a deliberate attempt to expose philosophy to what it cannot contain within its powers of description and explanation. Heidegger takes poetry more seriously than any philosopher since Plato, says Bruns. In his texts on language and poetry he reappropriates the ancient notion of poetry as enigma, the impermeable text that resists our efforts to lay bare its meaning or structure. What matters to Heidegger in these writings, Bruns explains, is the rift between poetry and thinking., where each is said to repose in its own darkness. Poetry moves thinking away from philosophy by turning the thinker into a wanderer, closer to listening than to reasoning, more at home with puns than with concepts. Bruns shows this to be no less true of Heidegger's later writings as he examines them for the way they resist conventional methods of reading.<br>

The first phrase, “Beauty will save the world,” is a model of syntactic precision and order; it promises direct, unimpeded action. But the second phrase is disruptive; it shatters the integrity of the beauty-savior and bogs down the action in ambiguity and enigma. “Is it true, Prince, that you once said that ‘beauty will<br>

  Author(s) McGLOTHLIN ERIN<br>
  Abstract: There is nothing startling by now in the claim of a role for style in writing (or reading) history, but most working historians would probably still vote against it, the more so if the claim included Hayden White’s conception of historical discourse as based on emplotments shaped by literary figuration or tropes. Votes, however, are not arguments, and the case that White presented in

  Abstract: Since William Wrede’s classic study on concealment in the Gospels (1901 [1971]), narrative and secrecy are thought to be close allies in the Gospels of Mark and also John.
                  Messiasgeheimniswas the code he had invented to get a significant matter into perspective. To him the term suggested a theological idea that exercised controlling influence on Mark’s narrative, relegating it toDogmengeschichte(1901, 131). Today few will give unqualified assent to the term “messianic secret,” and fewer still subscribe to Wrede’s explanation of its functioning. But the alliance of Mark’s narrative with secrecy is not in doubt, and the debate<br>

  Author(s) Harrold Deborah<br>
  Abstract: We hope this book fosters work on political creativity, enlarging it from a residual explanation into a research program. In that spirit, we conclude with two ventures. First, we contrast notions of agency, order, and change with those of relationality, assemblage, and time to underscore what difference it makes to analyze political phenomena through the lens of political creativity rather than through a dualist framework in which structure and agency are kept apart. Although the pairing of two sets of concepts does not fully capture the rich and wide-ranging scholarship in this volume, we find it a useful heuristic to<br>

  Abstract: Among the great Victorian novelists, Thackeray could probably best be described as a natural connoisseur of the fine arts. George Eliot and Hardy acquired considerable expertise in matters of art, but both set out with a deliberate intention to learn the subject which was very different from Thackeray’s comfortable familiarity. This may help to explain why Hardy’s novels make more direct reference to painters and their works than do those of Thackeray, although an equally plausible explanation could be found in the later date at which Hardy was writing.

  Abstract: All scholars agree that there is linguistic variety in the Hebrew Bible. The dominant explanation of the distribution of linguistic forms in the Masoretic Text (MT) of the Hebrew Bible in modern scholarship has been in terms of a simple equation between the language of the MT and the language of the “original author” of the text in question. Current scholarship on the textual transmission of the Hebrew Bible, however, makes this explanation only one out of several—and not one of the more likely ones.<br>

  Author(s) Dallmayr Fred<br>
  Abstract: Despite the many discussions on the subject, the problem of justice has always retained a freshness and incisiveness that challenges our understanding. This is because, in our search for a theoretical explanation of a theory of justice and a rational account of its applicability, we always start from an immediate and concrete sense of justice or injustice. Thus consider the recent problem of socialized medicine and healthcare in America: Which theoretical approach among the proprietarians, communitarians, utilitarians, and contractarians¹ will most fully satisfy our demand for (which is to say, our concrete sense of) justice?

  Author(s) Sautter Ulrich<br>
  Abstract: It is traditionally held that interpretation is the method of the humanities, while explanation is the method of the sciences. At the same time, it is widely accepted that interpretation is an all-embracing activity and thus all cognitions are modes of interpretation, and moreover, as Gadamer declared, “Alles Verstehen ist Auslegen” [All understanding is interpretation] (Gadamer 1965, 366). It is clear that both views cannot coexist. If explanation is distinct from interpretation, and thereby distinguishes the sciences from the humanities, interpretation cannot be the umbrella concept that covers all understanding.<br>

This chapter seeks to answer the question by looking at the complex interactions of political opportunities/threats and the internal dynamics and competitiveness between different organizations and groups within the movement. What I am suggesting in this work is that much of the process of social movement development is understandable only by looking at the broader political environment as well as by looking within the movement itself.<br>

  Book Title: Scientific Understanding-Philosophical Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Eigner Kai<br>
  Abstract: To most scientists, and to those interested in the sciences, understanding is the ultimate aim of scientific endeavor. In spite of this, understanding, and how it is achieved, has received little attention in recent philosophy of science.
      Scientific Understandingseeks to reverse this trend by providing original and in-depth accounts of the concept of understanding and its essential role in the scientific process. To this end, the chapters in this volume explore and develop three key topics: understanding and explanation, understanding and models, and understanding in scientific practice.Earlier philosophers, such as Carl Hempel, dismissed understanding as subjective and pragmatic. They believed that the essence of science was to be found in scientific theories and explanations. In Scientific Understanding, the contributors maintain that we must also consider the relation between explanations and the scientists who construct and use them. They focus on understanding as the cognitive state that is a goal of explanation and on the understanding of theories and models as a means to this end.The chapters in this book highlight the multifaceted nature of the process of scientific research. The contributors examine current uses of theory, models, simulations, and experiments to evaluate the degree to which these elements contribute to understanding. Their analyses pay due attention to the roles of intelligibility, tacit knowledge, and feelings of understanding. Furthermore, they investigate how understanding is obtained within diverse scientific disciplines and examine how the acquisition of understanding depends on specific contexts, the objects of study, and the stated aims of research.<br>

One of its great successes is its impressive track record of giving explanations of natural phenomena, by which these phenomena are made understandable. This much is generally granted, but things become less clear when one asks what these physical explanations exactly consist in. Philosophers of science have proposed a variety of analyses of explanation (nomological-deductive, causal, unification, to mention but a few), and it is not immediately obvious which of these proposals best captures physical practice.<br>

When a writer, a painter, or a film director presents a scene, he or she must define a setting for the act. But creating a place is the primal act of architecture, and consequently these artists unknowingly perform the task of an architect. Unaware of the professional rules of the discipline, they approach the mental dimensions of architectural experience and, hence, reveal the phenomenological basis of the art<br>

  Book Title: Scandalous Knowledge-Science, Truth and the Human<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Herrnstein Smith Barbara<br>
  Abstract: This book explores the radical reconceptions of knowledge and science emerging from constructivist epistemology, social studies of science, and contemporary cognitive science. Smith reviews the key issues involved in the twentieth-century critiques of traditional views of human knowledge and scientific truth and gives an extensively informed explanation of the alternative accounts developed by Fleck, Kuhn, Foucault, Latour, and others. She also addresses the various anxieties (e.g., over ‘relativism’) and ‘wars’ occasioned by these developments, placing them in their historical contexts and arguing that they are largely misplaced or spurious. Smith then examines the currently perplexed relations between the natural and human sciences, the grandiose claims and dubious methods of evolutionary psychology, and the complex play of naturalist, humanist, and posthumanist ideologies in contemporary views of the relation between humans and animals.<br>

  Abstract: Speech sets man apart among animals, language distinguishes between nations: one knows where a man comes from only after he has spoken. Usage and need make that everyone learns the language of his country; but what is it that makes this language the language of his country and not of another? In order to tell, one must go back to an explanation that belongs specifically to the place and that predates even the local customs: speech, the first institution of society, owes its shape only to natural causes.<br>

  Abstract: A main axis of intellectual tension in the area of foreign policy analysis over the past forty years is the issue of the importance of “beliefs”¹ in the explanation and prediction of foreign policy decisions and outcomes. The seminal decision-making approach to foreign policy articulated by Snyder, Bruck, and Sapin at midcentury was partly in reaction to a skewed emphasis by the realist tradition on external circumstances (e. g., the balance of power) and the omission of beliefs in explaining foreign policy decisions.² Snyder and his colleagues argued that this strategy of explanation came at the expense of neglecting the<br>

  Abstract: Throughout Part 2 of this book, we were concerned with storytelling and narrative—with the patient-physician relationship growing out of the encounter of storytelling, the patient’s narrative itself, and a doctor’s ability in listening to narrative. Many experienced physicians develop types of understanding—
                  phronesis,narrative knowledge, and logic of diagnosis—that, in their functional engagements with narrative and reality, are different from and complementary to the biomedical knowledge of scientific explanation. Such engagements with narrative are at the heart of humanistic understanding. This chapter reexamines the importance of narrative in the practice of medicine from the point of view of<br>

  Abstract: When speaking of the BAN debates as Turner’s redressive phase, what is peculiar about the Bulgarian case is that the whole framework upon which the redressive mechanism was based was itself in a legitimacy crisis from the mid-1980s on. By the 1990s it had completely collapsed and this is probably the most salient explanation why the redressive machinery did not “fix” the problem. What the BAN debates did demonstrate, however, is that “it is in the redressive phase that both pragmatic techniques and symbolic action reach their fullest expression.”

Abstract: Leonhard Euler, the Basel mathematician, found Bonnet’s “little ethereal machine” too fragile. If a physical accident can shatter our memory—and therefore our personality—at a time when the “machine” is encased within our brains of flesh, how will this ethereal organ subsist undamaged after death, when it will be no longer protected? Were it destroyed, the personality itself would suffer the same fate; and the soul would have to be preserved by an implausible continuous miracle (see
         
               , pp. 292–93). Bonnet replied that he did not base the immortality of the soul on the “small organic machine.” Rather, since the soul is not the “whole man,” its union to an organic structure is indispensable. The Gospels, he observed, do not speak of the immortality of soul, but of man. If they did, resurrection would be meaningless. “Que signifierait la Résurrection, si l’âme étaitMA
            tout l’homme?”(
               , p. 301). That is why, for Bonnet, Saint Paul wasMA
            l’apôtre philosophe(
               , p. 246). The “key to the philosophical explanation” of such Christian dogmas as the incarnation and resurrection was the fact that they concern the “MA
            mixednature of our being” (
               , p. 360). And the key to our mixed nature is furnished by the brain. Anatomical debates on the seat of the soul in the brain are therefore relevant for discussing resurrection.MA<br>

Referring to a book popular in the peace movement (Macy
               1983), the speaker said Airdalers were personally “disempowered,”psychologicallyblocked from speaking their minds on mind‐boggling issues. The “personal empowerment” discourse that circulated widely among urban activists found its way into Airdalers’ talk.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: In my role as historian of Americanist anthropology, I have long mused over the disproportionate influence of a small number of linguistic anthropologists over the discipline as a whole. Duranti cites two recent American Anthropological Association presidents who are linguistic anthropologists: I note that Jane Hill crosses into cultural as well as biological anthropology and Don Brenneis is difficult to identify solely as linguistic or cultural anthropologist. My own explanation tends toward the rhetoric of continuity within the three variants of linguistic anthropology. Because we are not contentious among ourselves, moving comfortably across both the subdisciplines of anthropology and the disciplines of the social sciences and humanities, linguistic anthropologists are often identified as effective mediators and synthesizers. The seminal role of Edward Sapir in the Rockefellersponsored interdisciplinary social science of the interwar years provides an early exemplar; Sapir persuaded his colleagues that Chicago sociology and psychology/psychoanalysis were not in conflict but explored different sides of a single coin (his metaphor). He had moved beyond descriptive and historical linguistics as handmaidens to ethnology into the psychological reality of the phoneme and the theory of culture.<br>

Abstract: In this situation, the entire question (as much the question of anthropology as, through it, that of the philosophy of religion) comes down to understanding whether I know myself and, above all, by what right I know myself. Or rather, the issue is less about knowing if I know myself, as it is about understanding, in the event that I were to know myself, what status (and thus what mode of being) would be mine. Kant responds directly to these questions. “I [
         Ich], as intelligence and thinking subject, know myselfas an objectthat is thought [gedachtes Objekt], insofar as I am given to myself in intuition, solely and exactly,like every other phenomenon[gleich anderen Phänomen], only as I appear to myself, not as I am to the understanding—these are questions that raise no greater nor less difficulty than [that of knowing] how I can bean objectto myselfat all[überhaupt ein Objekt], and, more particularly, an object of intuition and of inner perceptions.”3In other terms, I do not know myself insofar as I know (following the singular privilege of being, as the sole thinker, the sole knower), but in so far precisely as I am simply known, and thus by the same right as any other known, which is to say as any other object. Strangely, I thus never know myself asIknow, but always only as amewho is known, and thus as an object. I only know myself as that which I am not, as theme‐object. The resulting distinction—between on the one hand the transcendentalI, the empty form that accompanies every other knowledge but remains itself neither representable nor knowable, and on the other the empiricalmethat belongs to the world of phenomena, and thus of objects known—manifests nothing of my specificity (the property of knowing) and puts into evidence precisely that which does not characterize me (the status of known). Thus am I masked and lowered to the dishonorable rank of an object. Rather than giving me access to the man that I am, this distinction between theIand themeforbids~<br>

Abstract: Beginning in the early 1960s, and punctuated by Foucault’s 1966
         Les mots et les choses(The Order of Things) and his 1969L’archéologie du savoir(The Archaeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language), poststructuralist critiques of truth claims and the imperialism of global history, a rethinking of the certainty of words and concepts in an “archeology (that is, a deconstruction) of the social sciences” struck at the heart of long‐standingAnnalisteprinciples.91Whether studying social control, discipline, power, or sexuality, old assumptions were dissected and new agendas initiated. The 1976Il formaggio e i vermi(The Cheese and the Worms) by Carlo Ginzburg and the 1979 launching ofmicrostoriaby Ginzburg, Carlo Poni, and Edoardo Grendi—practiced in France by Le Roy Ladurie in his 1975Montaillouand 1979Carnival in Romans—fostered a new kind of ethnographic history of everyday life that focused on the individual.92“The revival of narrative,” whether from Lawrence Stone’s famous 1979Past and Presentarticle or Paul Ricoeur’s 1983–85Time and Narrative,was to restore the story to history and to return to the event, as Pierre Nora had called for in his 1974 essay inFaire de l’histoire.
            93Pierre Bourdieu’s 1979La distinctionpushed for a reconciliation between events and structure.94By emphasizing that systems of oppositions are not stable structures but are constantly in the process of becoming, being made and remade, Bourdieu’s project to understand how social reality is constructed gets us closer to incorporating practice and perception with objective categories and suggests a way of bridging the gap between the endless details of one thing after another and causal explanation. This list of keyAnnalisteideas and methods derived from theMéditerranée’s problematic could include sharp criticism like that of François Dosse; the constructive response of Jacques Revel on theAnnalesparadigms, the social sciences, and the construction of the social; Pierre N~<br>

Abstract: Noting in the opening of his book rhetoric’s failure to develop a “general theory of expression,” Spencer goes on to sum up the advice of the rhetoricians in a single principle: brevity. Unconstrained by any commitment to received doctrine, he produces the following explanation for the supremacy of this principle:
            
                  As in Smith, a rhetoric has been generated from a communication theory. And this theory anticipates, if it does not actually arrive at, a concept of information. The principle of an “economy of attention,” which mandates Smith’s smallest possible number of words for any thought, is the same that governs information technologies generally, and the documentary genres in particular. The principle presupposes something that we now call processing, for which ease and speed are indeed ultimate desiderata.On seeking for some clue to the law underlying these current maxims, we may see shadowed forth in many of them, the importance of economizing the reader’s or hearer’s attention. To so present ideas that they may be apprehended with the least possible mental effort, is the desideratum towards which most of the rules above quoted point. When we condemn writing that is wordy, or confused, or intricate—when we praise this style as easy, and that as fatiguing, we consciously or unconsciously assume this desideratum as our standard of judgment.

Abstract: This openness to interpretation is what recontextualizes each reading in the series of readings, which is another reason why Ricoeur speaks of the text as having only semiautonomy. Great texts, such as those of Shakespeare, are open to recontextualization through new audiences and new reading encounters. The closure that is achieved in such texts is only temporary. Ricoeur argues that it is at the level of the text that we can best understand human objectification in the form of structural explanation and the hermeneutic understanding that is the counterpart of such explanation [

Abstract: According to James Lowenthal, “sacralizing some chosen time in the past … impedes historical understanding” (2000, 67) because the sacred defies explanation. For religious fundamentalists, all time—past, present, and future—is sacralized, as God’s plan constitutes the meta‐narrative of all history. Thus, history becomes imbued with inevitability, the richness of historical dilemmas is flattened out, the potential appreciation for multiple causalities is quashed, and all of history leads to a renewed avowal of faith or the condemnation for lack thereof. Moreover, the tantalizing sense of strangeness that all deep historical inquiry ought to engender (Wineburg
         2001) becomes an impossibility, for in a world where all events are simultaneously foretold and foretelling, “astonishment” as a “delight of learning history” (Lowenthal2000) is unlikely at best. Astonishment, after all, remains the domain of unbelievers.<br>

Abstract: Nonetheless this poses a problem, especially when it comes to the interpretation and implementation of human rights.
         14Thus some countries insist on their own religious interpretation of human rights, as is evident in the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam preparatory to the Second UN Human Rights Conference in Vienna in 1993, which states that “the islamic Shari’ah is the only source of reference for the explanation or clarification of any of the articles of this Declaration.”15As for the implementation of human rights, there are religious institutions like the Catholic Church, which, while recognizing human rights in societal domains outside their own, reject or limit some of these rights within their own domains, for instance, gender equality, freedom of religion, and freedom of speech—and do so on religious grounds.<br>

Abstract: However, the memory of Dimitrov in Leipzig, where the trial of 1933 was held, is minimal. The imposing building of the Federal Administrative Court, where the trials against Karl Liebknecht in 1907 and Dimitrov in 1933 took place, was transformed after the Second World War into the Museum of Fine Arts; it also housed the special museum devoted to the memory of Dimitrov, which had opened in 1952. In 2002, the building was given back to the Administrative Court. While a new building is being constructed to house the artifacts of the Museum of Fine Arts, nobody could answer my inquiries about the whereabouts of the materials from Dimitrov's museum during my visit in Leipzig in December 2003. A plaque in front of the federal building explains its history and mentions the Leipzig trial, but there is no explanation in the famous trial room.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: This is a thoughtful, wide‐ranging, and ambitious study by an author well established as an insightful cultural historian. Drawing on close and sensitive readings of a number of nineteenth‐ and twentieth‐century novels of homicide and detection, Stephen Kern charts a paradigmatic shift in the nature of fictional causality. Crime novels were chosen for the insight they might offer the historian into “new ways of rendering the causes and motives for human action,” and Kern traces a movement away from the “clear and strongly deterministic causal factors” (p. 4) favored by nineteenth‐century authors in the explanation of transgression toward greater complication and confusion in modernist representations of causal connection. He argues that a chronological reading of murder novels across his chosen period reveals a “multifaceted shift” in five interrelated ways—“namely, that causal understanding moved in the direction of increasing specificity [as a consequence of developments in forensic science, for example], multiplicity, increasing complexity, probability and uncertainty” (p. 6). In the eight chapters that follow, Kern marshals an enormous amount of evidence to trace these shifts in our understandings of the factors that may influence violent action—our ancestral inheritance, our childhood, the ways in which language or education construct our sense of the real or the actual, our sexuality, our emotions, our intellect, our interaction with society in a wider sense, and our ideological commitments. Kern’s range of reference is impressive, and he moves comfortably from the scientific to the literary, the prosaic to the poetic. He is well acquainted with contemporary developments in the ideas of chance, probability, and determinism, and, in particular, he writes knowledgeably of the consequences for fiction of the emergence of quantum theory in the first half of the twentieth century.<br>

Abstract: For another explanation of Smith’s approach to the Bible, see Barlow,
            Mormons and the Bible, 57–61; my emphasis, however, is on the extent to which Smith felt bound by the text, even as he changed it (see ibid., 61). Moreover, Barlow explains Smith’s approach to the text largely in terms of contemporary practices that did not distinguish authors from editors, arguing that Smith used these conventions “creatively” and consistent with “prophetic writers of ancient times.” My differences with this argument are slight and result primarily from my emphasis on those sections of the JST that are not merely editorial, but radical reformulations of the biblical narrative. I believe these additions are too extensive to be rationalized by nineteenth‐century editorial conventions, especially given the Bible’s near‐fetishistic canonical status during this period. Finally, though I, too, consider ancient “bible writers” to be a useful analogy to Smith’s production of new text, I do not ground the analogy in Smith’s felt sense of “godly authority or insight” or “concern … with enlightening the world through revealed truth” (ibid., 60–61). These are the elements of Smith’s own story which I argue are not necessary to and can obscure the nature and effect of his reformulation of the biblical narrative.<br>

Article Title: Two Apologetic Moments in Śaṅkara’s Concept of Brahman<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: Bakhtin,
            Problems of Dostoevsky’s Poetics, 221. To the extent that Śaṅkara’s works are double voiced, the perspective of the particular text he is commenting on is constitutive of his thought at that time. This notion of the inseparability of text and commentary would account for the differences that appear when Śaṅkara’s works are placed side by side. It seems to me that Sengaku Mayeda’s explanation for the differences between theGauḍapādīya‐ and theBrahmasūtra Bhāṣyas, as summarized by this quote from Gregory Darling, hits the nail on the head: “Mayeda’s point, however, is that the Gauḍapādīyabhāṣya represents an attempt to reinterpret the Buddhistic tendencies of the Gauḍa tradition along Advaita lines, whereas in the Brahmasūtrabhāṣya, Śaṅkara tries to reinterpret a bhedābheda text along Advaita lines” (Gregory J. Darling,An Evaluation of the Vedāntic Critique of Buddhism[Delhi: Motilal, 1987], 114; Mayeda’s original article is “On the Author of theMāṇḍūkyopaniṣad‐ and theGauḍapādīya‐bhāṣya,” inDr. V. Raghavan Felicitation Volume, ed. V. Raghavan and N. Sri Ram [Madras: Adyar Library and Research Center, 1967–68]). Moreover, the perspective of the particular text Śaṅkara is commenting upon—whether it be theGauḍapāda‐kārikā, theBrahma‐sūtra, or, if authentic, theYogasūtrabhāṣya—is such a major factor in determining the shape of his thought in a given work that I have doubts whether a distinct developmental factor can be realistically discerned, especially in the absence of a certain chronology of Śaṅkara’s authentic works.<br>

Author(s): Scimeca Ross<br>
Abstract: The third theory of truth is the pragmatic theory. This is America’s philosophical contribution to the question of truth. There are two variations to the pragmatic theory of truth. The first variation comes from Charles S. Peirce [
         69]. According to Peirce, truth is arrived at by abduction, that is, inference to the best possible explanation. Abduction is one of the three basic forms of inference, along with deduction and induction, by which hypotheses concerning reality are generated, that is, move from a particular case to a possible explanation of the case [69, vol. 7, p. 319]. Truth as consensus is the consequence of what Peirce called the “social theory of reality” [69, vol. 6, p. 610]. According to Peirce, this means that reality is the construct of all propositions arrived at by abduction. It is important to note, however, that Peirce did not think that propositions are true because they are arrived at by abduction; rather he thought that they are true because they will be universally accepted. Peirce realized that a proposition originally accepted to be true could very well upon further investigation prove to be false. The social theory of reality is in constant revision. Indeed, the growth of knowledge demands this continual revision of universally accepted propositions.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: This book will be read from cover to cover by very few people. It can be considered required reading for even fewer. Scholars interested in Continental philosophy and postmodern theology will appreciate Reynolds’s treatment of key themes and thinkers, although few of his arguments are novel. The strengths of the book are chiefly expository and topical. Reynolds does a good job of “teaching” his favorite thinkers to the uninitiated. His explanation of Richard Rorty’s concept of irony, for example, is quite useful. Furthermore, the issues that drive Reynolds’s argument (presumably, the possibility of peaceful coexistence in a world of profound difference) have genuine urgency.<br>

Article Title: Just War, Civic Virtue, and Democratic Social Criticism: Augustinian Reflections<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 592372<br>
Date: 01 2009<br>
Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Readers familiar with the just‐war tradition know that the explanation for this gap is genealogical: just‐war doctrine arose in illiberal, undemocratic contexts, in which the idea of popular sovereignty was either inconceivable or anathema to those who conceived it. Yet even if we set aside this problem of political pedigree, a more pressing problem lurks: we (generally) deploy just‐war doctrine chiefly as a morality of statecraft,
         6a set of norms according to which political elites and military soldiers should manage the destruction of war, not as a morality for assessing the sentiments and passions of citizens more broadly. As it is currently understood, the connections of just‐war doctrine to the virtues of democratic social criticism remain undertheorized. The tradition’s intellectual and cultural origins are premodern, and its potential role as guide for the individual conscience stands removed from the network of cultural and psychological forces that bear directly on political identity and the civic imagination. While it is true that just‐war criteria can instruct the private citizen’s moral deliberations,7little work has been done to indicate how and on what terms the ethics of war might inform and guide the powerful longings of patriotism and the existential features of membership in an ongoing political community—cultural forces and desires that press upon the workings of conscience. This connection—or lack thereof—between the ethics of war and the desires that animate a common life is of no small importance given the just‐war tradition’s idea that the good of political community is desirable enough to defend with lethal violence if necessary.<br>

Article Title: Coleridge’s Philosophy of Prayer: Responsibility, Parergon, and Catachresis<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: By making the victory against oneself the victory of prayer, Kierkegaard mirrors Coleridge in suggesting that the proper effect of prayer is a state of being founded on an unthinkable risk: explanation (
         forklaring) is never forthcoming from God, but transfiguration (forklarelse) is. He concludes by stating that an absolute debt to God, contrary to worldly logic, is actually an absolute honor, in a way not incompatible with Coleridge’s analysis of blessedness as a kind of being rather than having: the realization that yielding the finite self is a form of victory in that the precant “conquers for himself what is yet bestowed on him” (N5554, fol. 12v). Both thinkers, therefore, orientate prayer around a struggle with and passage through paradox. As such, they are of their historical moment. For a long time, one might argue, faith had been one of the most proper acts in Western culture: in the wake of the collapse of the so‐called religion of reason and the onset of modernity, it would become increasingly improper. With Matthew Arnold’s long, withdrawing roar and Nietzsche’s death of God on the horizon, a horizon already traced by Kant’sReligion within the Limits of Mere Reason, facing this impropriety would be one of the great tasks of modern religious thought.<br>

Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: It should be noted that much has been made of Blanchot's alignment with the far Right and a number of studies have attempted to read in his work an element of anti-Semitism, not only in his early political writings, but even buried within the philo-Semitism that characterizes his later work. This interpretation does not bear out in relation to either period. While it is clear that Blanchot wrote for publications in the 1930s that published anti-Semitic perspectives, he did not himself express anti-Semitic positions. His associations with the far Right movement can certainly be tied to its critique of capitalism, one that was often conflated with anti-Semitism, but as far as his own writings attest Blanchot himself did not participate in that conflation. For more on this issue and Blanchot's friendship with Lévinas, see Lescourret,
            Emmanuel Lévinas, pp. 64–65, 113–16. For a summary of the attacks and an explanation and defense of Blanchot's activities in the 1930s, see Leslie Hill,Blanchot, Extreme Contemporary(New York, 1997), pp. 36–46 and “La Pensée politique,”Magazine Littéraire, no. 424 (Oct. 2003): 35–38.

Abstract: These two starting points, placing witchcraft once in the domain of luck and again in the domain of hatred, identify a cleavage in the intellectual agenda of the work. In the first passage the focus is on explanation of misfortune as a means to interrogate the nature of rationality, and in the second it is on the understanding of evil as a means to interrogate the nature of morality. Is it not the case, though, that the problem of rationality overshadows that of morality? Or perhaps we ought to say that it is not only the case that Evans-Pritchard’s work has a central place in anthropological discussions of rationality but also that the issue of rationality has tended to dominate readings of this work.<br>

Abstract: Just a few years before Varro’s

               Surely, this was a translation, an64
            interpretatio Romana. But it was a translation that presupposed the principal universality of the phenomenon of religion and of the gods, even if it did not reflect it.
               Differences could be acknowledged, indeed, were easily acknowledged. Being subjected to ethnographic65
            topoior historical explanation, the differences’ importance was diminished—diversity is natural and contingent and does no harm. After all, the Romans were to build an empire. Management of diversity must have been the demand of the day.<br>

Abstract: Given the disorder of the final scene, it is hardly surprising that the onstage audience, the Duke, fails to understand the play. At one point he asks, “What’s the conceit of that?” (5.1.157). Caught up in the play, the Duke seeks artistic interpretation, the “conceit,” not criminal explanation of the deaths he witnesses. His question indicates the failure of the masque to make sense out of the suffering the Duke mistakenly thinks is part of the tragic script. Offstage audiences, however, have a larger play-text to draw from when trying to parse the significance of this violence. Hippolyto’s metaphors of fire connect his pain with earlier moments in the play’s exploration of familial relationships and corporeal identity. Astute listeners will remember that in act 4, Hippolyto railed against his sister Livia’s affair with Leantio, saying that his zeal to put an end to her relationship with someone below his family’s class “Puts fire into my blood” (4.2.14). The fire metaphor of the final scene recalls this motif of “fire in the blood” and frames his physical suffering within a larger tragic structure. Fittingly for a revenge plot, Hippolyto is brought down in a manner that references his own character traits.<br>

Abstract: The words of Pierre Reverdy may be recalled here: “L’image est une création pure de l’esprit…Plus les rapports des deux réalités rapprochées seront lointains et justes, plus l’image serait forte—plus elle aura de puissance émotive et de réalité poétique” (quoted in
            Henry 1971, 57). Concerning the way the links established by metaphor not only provide a form of conceptual explanation but synthesize a new representation of the world, Borges remarks: “No existe una esencial desemejanza entre la metáfora y lo que los profesores de la ciencia nombran la explicación de un fenómeno. Ambas son una vinculación tramada entre dos cosas distintas, a una de las cuales se la trasiega en la otra…[/]Su tumba son de Flandes las campañas / Y su epitafio la sangrienta luna[/] En frases como las anteriores, la realidad objetiva—esa objetividad supuesta que Berkeley negó y que Kant envió al destierro polar de un noúmeno inservible, reacio a cualquier adjetivación y ubicuamente ajeno—se contorsiona hasta plasmarse en una nueva realidad. Realidad tan asentada y brillante, que desplaza la inicial impresión que la engendró”(

Abstract: This article focuses on intellectuals—writers, philosophers, academics, scientists, and artists—who, by virtue of their accomplishments and talents, or simply because of their renown, wielded such moral authority that they became at times veritable “leaders of conscience,” influencing public opinion and, indeed, government policy in France. Responding to major events, whether colonial wars, international crises, or significant domestic political battles, French intellectuals weighed in time and again, from the Dreyfus affair to the bogus Sarkozy debate on “national identity.”
         
                  This article reviews the stance of French intellectuals on the question of Palestine and the wider Arab-Israeli conflict, and examines how the ideological and political assumptions underlying their positions were not always amenable to rational explanation or easily ascribed to traditional attitudes of the Left and Right.1<br>

Abstract: As Cardwell indicates, Maybeck's design was criticized because of his liberal mix of Greek and Roman sources—especially due to the combination of a Greek entablature in conjunction with arches and a domed structure (Cardwell,
               Bernard Maybeck, 149). In fact, Maybeck was quite open about his approach. In his typescript "The Palace of Fine Arts" he made numerous references to "the Greek" and "the Greeks" as an explanation to certain aspects of his design. His working drawings also demonstrate his interest in the Greek version of the Corinthian order (cf.Figure 18and the capital onFigure 7).<br>

Abstract: Wu argues that a “fundamental logic” underlies the structure of burials (219), and that only by uncovering this logic can we truly understand Chinese tombs. This thesis is reflected in Wu’s decision to arrange the book thematically into chapters that represent what he considers the “three most essential aspects of any manufactured work”: spatiality, materiality, and temporality (14). Because he is not bound by the same constraints that accompany the more traditional chronological and individual approaches to studying tombs, Wu is able to draw freely from a large, albeit fragmented, body of material and textual evidence to support his points. A major strength of this book may also be perceived as a weakness: Wu seems to be able to offer explanations for practically all the visual phenomena in tombs. One may question the reliability of such a comprehensive explanation for such an enormous amount of information.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur, "Metaphor and the Main Problem of Hermeneutics": The understanding of
interpretation as a reciprocity between text interpretation and self-interpretation "has been
opposed mainly by logical positivists, but also for opposite reasons by Romantic thinkers,
who oppose the kind of objectivity and the lack of self-involvement which is supposed to
characterize a scientific explanation of things" (p. 1).<br>

speech must break up each time both itself and what it has attempted. The final,

together with its explanations in the face of the existence of the poem" (pp. 234-35)<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur Steven D.<br>
Abstract: Methods of studying religion can be divided into those which help the investigator "understand" religion from the believer's standpoint and those which "explain" religion in the terms of the sciences. Yet despite the contemporary polemics, these methods need not be alienated from one another. Applying the hermeneutic theory of Paul Ricoeur we can see that the study of religion involves us in an act of interpretation which necessarily requires both methods of understanding and explanation. Ricoeur's theory is employed to show how these methods can be systematically used in tandem so that the most adequate interpretation of the religious world is produced.<br>

Article Title: The First Evil Will Must Be Incomprehensible: A Critique of Augustine<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263713<br>
Date: 9 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Teselle Robert F.<br>
Abstract: The thesis of this paper is that an absolute origin of evil, arising from the free will of a creature, must be incomprehensible. Although Augustine occasionally acknowledges this point, nevertheless in a number of better-known passages (chiefly in The City of God) he attempts to give a causal account of the fall of Adam and/or Satan. Much of the subsequent Christian tradition has unfortunately followed his lead, and major recent commentators routinely ignore or passively approve of his conceptual error. Augustine offers three unacceptable explanations of the fall, which conflict variously with his own doctrines of divine omnipotence, the goodness of creation, and creaturely free will and responsibility, as well as violating the canons of sound argumentation and explanation. First, his contention that free creatures made "out of nothing" inevitably fall makes the fall seem ontologically necessary (unfree) and thereby lays the ultimate responsibility for it on the Creator. Second, the appeal to pride as an explanation is a spurious causal account, for "pride" is only a synonym for "fallenness" itself and not a possible antecedent condition in a being created good and not yet fallen. Finally, his assertion that the first sin is intrinsically comprehensible, but not comprehensible to us because we are fallen, is an obfuscation masquerading as an explanation, for we have no warrant for supposing that this assertion is true or even meaningful. Instead of seeking causal explanation Augustine should have stayed with his own wiser observation that an evil will has no efficient cause. Theology of the Augustinian sort (which comprises much of the Christian tradition) ought to concede that the fall as a work of genuine freedom is an absurd "fact," an incomprehensible given which steadfastly and in principle resists causal explanation. The concluding section of the paper draws upon Ricoeur's insights to tell why the narrative structure of the "Adamic myth" (which has important p~<br>

Date: 9 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): Currie Gregory<br>
Abstract: This paper concerns the problem of how to give historical explanations of scientist's decisions to prefer one theory over another. It is argued that such explanations ought to contain only statements about the beliefs and preferences of the agents involved, and, in particular, ought not to include evaluative premises about the theories themselves. It is argued that Lakatos's attempt to build into such historical explanations premises of an evaluative kind is deficient. The arguments of Laudan to the effect that such explanations depend crucially upon evaluative assumptions about the rationality or irrationality of decisions are examined. It is argued that they do not establish the need for such assumptions. Similar criticisms are then shown to be applicable to a version of the 'hermeneutical' model of explanation for human actions.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i20081727<br>
Date: 3 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Deli Peter<br>
Abstract: There has been extensive debate on changing attitudes within the French left-wing intelligentsia in the decades following the Second World War and more specifically on why so many intellectuals became fellow travellers and were attracted to Stalinism in the period between 1945 and 1953. "Esprit's" reactions to de-Stalinisation from the time of the Russian invasion of Hungary in 1956 to the Soviet suppression of the Czech attempt to reform communism from within in 1968 are of interest, since "Esprit" was the most prominent Catholic left-wing but non-Marxist journal in France. In view of "Esprit's" very strong reaction to the Hungarian Revolution, its relative silence in 1968 on the drama that was being played out in Czechoslovakia requires explanation. Finally, because "Esprit" broke with communism in late 1956, intellectuals writing for that journal experienced little difficulty in adjusting to the new French intellectual climate of the mid-1970s. /// De nombreux débats ont eu lieu autour de la question du changement d'attitude des intellectuels de gauche en France dans les décennies suivant la Seconde Guerre Mondiale, et plus spécialement sur les raisons du succès du stalinisme dans ces milieux où se recrutèrent tant de compagnons de route entre 1945 et 1953. Les réactions d'"Esprit" à la dé-stalinisation, de l'invasion de la Hongrie en 1956 jusqu'à la répression du Printemps de Prague en 1968 sont particulièrement révélatrices à cet égard, car "Esprit" était la revue dominante du courant 'catholique de gauche -- non marxiste' en France. Au regard de la réaction très forte d'"Esprit" en 1956, son silence relatif lors du drame tchécoslovaque appelle une explication. Finalement, parce qu'"Esprit" a brisé ses liens avec le communisme à la fin de l'année 1956, les intellectuels qui travaillaient pour la revue ont eu peu de difficultés à s'adapter au nouveau climat intellectuel de la France du milieu des années 1970. /// Es hat eine ausgedehnte Diskussion um den Meinung~<br>

Author(s): Geary Dick<br>
Abstract: This article begins by examining recent work on labour history by some French and British historians, who have been influenced by postmodernism and the 'linguistic turn' but often find themselves locked into what are primarily 'cultural' explanations of labour's identity and development. It disputes the culturalist methodology and stresses that an alternative model of discourse analysis insists on contextualisation, which in turn re-instates the significance of realms of explanation outside language, text and culture. It also sees the comparative method as a means of identifying historical structures, and concludes with a schematic account of European labour in the twentieth century. /// Cet article commence par un examen de travaux récents au sujet de l'histoire ouvrière par certains historiens français et britanniques, influencés par le postmodernisme et le 'tournant linguistique' mais se trouvant souvent coincés dans des explications essentiellement 'culturelles' au sujet de l'identité et le développement du mouvement ouvrier. Il conteste la méthodologie culturaliste et souligne qu'il y a une autre mode de discussion, à savoir la contextualisation, qui sert à réaffirmer l'importance des domaines d'explication en dehors de langue, texte et culture. Il voit en outre dans la méthode comparative un moyen d'identifier les structures historiques; et termine avec un compte-rendu schématique du mouvement ouvrier européen au cours du vingtième siècle. /// Dieser Beitrag versucht zunächst die Werke einiger französischen und britischen Historiker zu analysieren, die von dem Postmodernismus bzw. dem 'Linguistic Turn' beeinflusst worden sind, die aber in einem meist kulturellen Erklärungsmodell der Identität und Entwicklung der Arbeiterschaft verhaftet sind.

Author(s): Schulkin Jay<br>
Abstract: Two philosophical traditions with much in common, (classical) pragmatism and (Heidegger's) hermeneutic philosophy, are here compared with respect to their approach to the philosophy of science. Both emphasize action as a mode of interpreting experience. Both have developed important categories -- inquiry, meaning, theory, praxis, coping, historicity, life-world -- and each has offered an alternative to the more traditional philosophies of science stemming from Descartes, Hume, and Comte. Pragmatism's "abduction" works with the dual perspectives of theory (as explanation) and praxis (as culture). The hermeneutical circle depends in addition on the lifeworld as background source of ontological meaning and resource for strategies of inquiry. Thus a hermeneutical philosophy of research involves three components: lifeworld (as ontological and strategic), theory (as explanatory), and praxis (as constitutive of culture).<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo tiene por objeto el estudio de la historia internacional de la legalidad del colonialismo en la época colonial en América Latina. Concretamente, a lo largo de la figura de Vasco de Quiroga y, el más ambicioso tratado, "Información en derecho" (1535), examinando las tensiones históricas y posibilidades de cambios prerrevolucionarios en el interior y comparación de este sistema colonizador. El estudio usará tipologías históricas de conflictos sociales y contiendas en el entramado genérico de esta disertación. El entramado principal utilizado para cada explicación será la cultura represiva aplicada a las tres dimensiones sociales. /// The aim of this article is to study the international history of the legality of colonialism in the colonial period in Latin America. Concretely, this will be examined through the figure of Vasco de Quiroga and the most ambitious treatise, "Información en derecho" (1535), delving into the historical tensions and possibilities for pre-revolutionary changes inside the system and in comparison to this colonizing system. The study will use historical typologies entailing social conflicts and strife in the generic framework of this dissertation. The main framework used for each explanation will be that of repressive culture, applied to the three social dimensions.<br>

Abstract: The ways in which values are assimilated to social research differ according to the theoretical frame of reference informing the research. An example from the writings of E. Digby Baltzell illustrates how a moral commitment shaped his assumptions about the nature of the social matrix and his research strategies. A Western moral rhetoric fares well if the researcher chooses a methodologically individualist framework. The framework assists a moral rhetoric by providing it with concrete rather than abstract social actors and with a basis for explanation in terms of motive rather than situational forces. Along the way moral statements can appear in the form of empirical generalizations and historical laws. Should sociologists deem ethically neutral social research desirable, this study suggests that concentration on scientific method, without exploring the value bases for selecting a frame of reference, is not a promising approach. A value analysis, especially around Weber's "value relevance," may function propaedeuticly.<br>

Issue: i210405<br>
Date: 10 1, 1992<br>
Author(s): Hall John R.<br>
Abstract: Conventionally, proposals to improve working relations between sociology and history have been interdisciplinary. The present essay advances an alternative approach-consolidation of sociohistorical inquiry as a transdisciplinary enterprise. All socio-historical inquiry depends on four elemental forms of discourse: discourse on values, narrative discourse, social theoretical discourse, and the discourse of explanation. Though inquiry is transdisciplinary in the problematics of these discourses, concrete methodology typically is oriented either toward theorization in relation to cases (historical sociology) or toward comprehensive analysis of a single phenomenon (sociological history). Varying the articulated relations among the four forms of discourse once for historical sociology and again for sociological history yields eight ideal typical strategies of inquiry. The four strategies of historical sociology include universal history, theory application, macro-analytic history, and contrast-oriented comparison. The parallel strategies for sociological history are situational history, specific history, configurational history, and historicism. These ideal types offer standard reference points that help clarify the underpinnings of a diverse range of scholarly practices.<br>

Abstract: The first part of the article discusses the usefulness of the biographical method in order to solve some epistemological crucial issues: the integration between comprehension and explanation, the possibility of an objective (or at least intersubjective) knowledge, the overcoming of the micro-macro dicothomy. The second part holds the utility of such a method in order to study the reflexive post-modern society and especially the contribution intellectuals can offer to the post-modern culture. Results from recent empirical research are discussed. The last part-though recognizing some methodological problems linked with life stories — stresses flexibility and openess as the main virtues of this method.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>

Date: 6 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): SEACHRIS JOSHUA<br>
Abstract: Death and futility are among a cluster of themes that closely track discussions of life's meaning. Moreover, futility is thought to supervene on naturalistic meta-narratives because of how they will end. While the nature of naturalistic meta-narrative endings is part of the explanation for concluding that such meta-narratives are cosmically or deeply futile, this explanation is truncated. I argue that the reason the nature of the ending is thought to be normatively important is first anchored in the fact that narrative ending qua ending is thought to be normatively important. Indeed, I think futility is often thought to characterize naturalistic meta-narratives because a narrative's ending has significant proleptic power to elicit a wide range of broadly normative human responses on, possibly, emotional, aesthetic, and moral levels towards the narrative as a whole.<br>

Abstract: This essay analyzes the contemporary culture of memory in Buenos Aires. The development of this culture since the democratic transition — and since Nestor Kirchner's turn in government in particular — is investigated. Data come from field-work research during the period of Cristina Kirchner's election victory in 2007. The official explanation of the duty to remember in order to re-establish the nation's democratic basis is shown through an analysis of Buenos Aires's urban landscape, and the building of such places of memory as the Museum of Memory and the Park of Memory, coinciding respectively with Nestor Kirchner's first election, and with Cristina Kirchner's election. The analysis of contemporary collective sensibility about the past dictatorship introduces an interview with a Madre de Plaza de Mayo, suggesting the task of watching over memory, and of coping with its current multiple interpretations.<br>

Author(s): Jacobs Anton K.<br>
Abstract: This essay suggests Friedrich Nietzsche has a contribution to make to the theoretical enterprise of social science. Contemporary theorizing, reflecting an increased attention to language, has been focusing on the dialogical mode of production and, of course, on hermeneutics. This has led to a renewal of interest in Friedrich Nietzsche. In this essay, two alternative models of the hermeneutic circle are examined: one arising out of the work of the school of Konstanz; the other associated primarily with the work of Juergen Habermas. The former presents a circular image of the "conversational" situation; the latter portrays a time schedule of the process based on the psychoanalytic process of therapy. Nietzsche's contributions are suggested to be significant, in the first model, in regard to the mode of production and, in the second, the stage of the quasi-naturalistic turn. Nietzsche's way to truth is through constant and relentless criticizing. In contrast to the rationalistic practices of Western philosophy, Nietzsche exercised an art of interpreting based on the use of metaphor and aphorism. This practice seems to reflect Nietzsche's concern to communicate truth in a world he saw as inherently ambiguous and dynamic, thus, rendering propositional truth impossible. Nietzsche radically challenges the rational foundations on which we stand. Thus he presents us with a mode of knowledge production that reclaims traditions lost to science. In addition, Nietzsche shows, by word and example, that his existential approach offers a way to see life as a text and source for quasi-naturalistic forays toward understanding. In this way Nietzsche shows that the traditional concept of knowledge is a pseudo-concept by revealing the intimate and inseparable connection between life and knowledge. Knowledge is rooted in life; it is a manifestation of concrete psychological and political realities. Consequently, it makes sense not to ignore life as a source for explanation when examining~<br>

Author(s): Doran Robert<br>
Abstract: To claim that Hayden White has yet to be read seriously as a philosopher of history might seem false on the face of it. But do tropes and the rest provide any epistemic rationale for differing representations of historical events found in histories? As an explanation of White's influence on philosophy of history, such a proffered emphasis only generates a puzzle with regard to taking White seriously, and not an answer to the question of why his efforts should be worthy of any philosophical attention at all. For what makes his emphasis on narrative structure and its associated tropes of philosophical relevance? What, it may well be asked, did (or could) any theory that draws its categories from a stock provided by literary criticism contribute to explicating problems with regard to the warranting of claims about knowledge, explanation, or causation that represent those concerns that philosophy typically brings to this field? Robert Doran's anthologizing of previously uncollected pieces, ranging as they do over a literal half-century of White's published work, offers an opportunity to identify explicitly those philosophical themes and arguments that regularly and prominently feature there. Moreover, White's essays in this volume demonstrate a credible knowledge of and interest in mainstream analytic philosophers of his era and also reveal White as deeply influenced by or well acquainted with other important philosophers of history. White thus invites a reading of his work as philosophy, and this volume presents the opportunity for accepting it as such.<br>

Issue: i23548421<br>
Date: 1 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): DANIELS JOHN<br>
Abstract: In this article, an attempt is made to relate the "intuitive" classical phenomenology of Gerardus van der Leeuw and the neo-phenomenology of Jacques Waardenburg. An outline of van der Leeuw's methodology is presented along with a summary of Waardenburg's critique. An account is then given of Waardenburg's alternative approach. When the two methodologies are juxtaposed, two points of convergence emerge. The first relates to the nonempirical nature of meanings; the second relates to the need to reconstitute the believer's world in order to gain understanding of phenomena. Discussion suggests that both methodologies entail the combined use of Erklären ['explanation'] and Verstehen ['understanding'] in explicating meanings. The conclusion is ventured that neo-phenomenology can be plausibly viewed as a modification of van der Leeuw's approach which is distinguished by greater hermeneutical sensitivity.<br>

Author(s): Latourelle René<br>
Abstract: The author studies systematically the internal criteria which he considers most valid, in so far as they are critically established, for providing access through the gospels to Jesus and for guaranteeing the historical authenticity of his life and message. After placing the problem of establishing valid criteria (la critériologie) in the context of the current critical study of the gospels and offering a number of critical observations designed to avoid confusions (especially the distinction between pure data, criteria and proof; between literary and historical criteria; between criteria and the intellectual attitudes that thereby follow), the author presents and discusses seven criteria which he groups under three headings: basic criteria (critères fondamentaux), dependent criteria (critères dérivés), and composite criteria (critères mixtes). Among the basic criteria he discusses: 1. the criterion of multiple testimony, together with the principal objection which can be raised against it, i.e. the extent to which one can speak of independent sources with regard to the gospels since all derive from oral tradition; 2. the criterion of discontinuity, considered on the levels of form and content; 3. the criterion of conformity (or of continuity or coherence), including the different formulations which contemporary exegetes propose, as well as its connections with the criterion of discontinuity; 4. the criterion of required explanation (explication nécessaire) or of sufficient reason for a group of convergent and well-attested facts. As an example of a dependent criterion called such since it is established in relation to the basic criteria, the author proposes the living, personal style of Jesus as distinguished from the gospels' literary style. Finally, among the composite criteria, that is to say the cases where an important literary characteristic is linked with one or several historical criteria, he mentions: the internal intelligibility of an account or of a group~<br>

Abstract: The Anglo-American discipline of International Relations defends its main principles and resists with an almost religious fervor any change to them, although the explanation of world affairs has been eluding it since its inception. The article attempts to draw up possibly the first historiography of the IR scholarship about religion in world affairs since the 90s, showing the heightened interest in the subject from most other social sciences and humanities. The article proposes the use of the term 'International Political Theology' to bridge the multiple literatures as well as to underscore the theological commitment of the IR discipline to its basic creeds and dogmas.<br>

Abstract: The antipositivist movement of the past two decades or so in economics, economic history, and history reveals the scope for a rapprochement, a growth of mutual respect and understanding, and perhaps even more active collaboration between the practitioners of these disciplines. The emergence of a more open-minded and flexible approach to economic methodology, and a more sophisticated awareness of the nature of historical explanation underlie this process. And the economists' increasing preoccupation with problems of time, expectations, uncertainty, and limited information provides substantive incentives for the widespread and varied efforts to break out of the confines of conventional static equilibrium theorizing.<br>

Abstract: The article of M. Lilla marks the political position of Derrida in the context of French philosophy since Sartre. Presenting him as an engaged opponent of existentialism and structuralism Lilla shows that Derrida's vehement philosophical fight is directed fundamentally against what he calls the logocentrism of all western philosophy. Derrida's only remedy against this disease: deconstruction of the language. In applying this recipe himself, Derrida ends at a somewhat mysterious one and only notion, the concept of justice, which according to him is not destructible and should not be destructed. The provocative explanation Lilla gives for the surprising fact, that Derrida's most fervent adherents live in the United States is the unlimited self-confidence and good nature of the Americans.<br>

Abstract: Unsere Literaturübersicht diskutiert die Frage, ob und inwieweit eine reife Liebesfähigkeit Erwachsener von entsprechenden Früherfahrungen abhängt bzw. inwieweit Liebe und Partnerschaft eine Korrektur ungünstiger emotionaler Erfahrungen der frühen Kindheit ermöglichen. Bestimmte Partnerschaftsstörungen stehen zu konkreten familiären Gegebenheiten der ersten Lebensjahre in keinem zwingenden Bezug. Sind Partnerschaftsstörungen nach traditioneller psychoanalytischer Auffassung als Folge eines ungelösten infantilen Konfliktes anzusehen, so greifen neuere Ansätze angesichts des weitgehenden Fehlens einer psychoanalytischen Interaktionstheorie bei der Beschreibung und Erklärung interpersoneller Phänomene zunehmend auf systemische Ansätze zurück. Äußerungen psychoanalytischer Autoren zur Entwicklung der Liebesfähigkeit reflektieren im historischen Überblick wesentliche Veränderungen der Theoriebildung. Neuere empirische Arbeiten weisen auf Korrektur- und Kompensationsmöglichkeiten ungünstiger Früherfahrungen von mittlerem Schweregrad hin. Dafür aber dürfte die warme und bedürfnisgerechte Zuwendung durch eine oder mehrere feste Bezugspersonen (möglichst durch die liebevoll und partnerschaftlich aufeinander bezogenen Eltern) in den ersten Lebensjahren eine grundlegende Voraussetzung erwachsener Liebes- und Partnerschaftsfähigkeit sein. In this survey of literature on the subject, we discuss the question of whether or not and if so to what extent a mature, adult ability to love depends on relevant early experience, or whether it functions as a corrective to unfavorable emotional experience in early childhood. There is no compelling connection between certain disturbances of partner relations and concrete family circumstances in the first years of life. Such disturbances are regarded by traditional psychoanalysis as the result of an unresolved infantile conflict; however, since there is no psychoanalytical interaction theory for the description and explanation of interpersonal~<br>

Abstract: This article discusses different theoretical and methodological approaches in the humanities and social sciences which strive to analyse and understand, interpret and explain texts and discourses in systematic, qualitative ways. After reviewing some of the salient theories in the social sciences (such as objective hermeneutics and critical hermeneutics), I argue that critical discourse studies require a 'trichotomy' consisting of explanation, interpretation and critique. Other approaches such as Ricoeur's 'hermeneutic arc' seem to neglect important structural and material dimensions of context as well as critical self-reflection. Moreover, I argue that much intuitive and non-transparent speculation in Hermeneutics might be transcended if more historical, cultural, linguistic and philological knowledges would be systematically and explicitly integrated into the analysis of text and discourse, in a retroductable manner. The latter possibility is illustrated by applying an interdisciplinary framework to some brief examples (e.g. intercultural and historical translation studies; the discourse-historical approach in critical discourse studies).<br>

Abstract: Intentional, 'commonsense,' or 'folk' psychology is, as Jerry Fodor has remarked, ubiquitous. Explanations of what we say and do in terms of our reasons for acting are the stock in trade of intentional psychology. But there is a question whether explanations in terms of reasons are properly explanatory. Donald Davidson and Daniel Dennett, to name two, have defended intentional psychology and its reason-explanations. Still, many philosophers — including Fodor, Davidson and Dennett — fail to pay due attention to the narrative basis of such agent-centered accounts of action. In this paper, I argue that psychological explanation is an agent-centered, narrative-based interpretive practice. To make my case, I present a poetics of psychological explanation: seven elements which collectively describe what makes psychological explanations work. Narrative form allows us to represent the temporal arc of agents' actions — as well as the temporal arc of their reasoning about their actions, both prospective and retrospective. It allows us to negotiate between the canonical and the exceptional in human experience, and thus to account for actions that strike us as puzzling or unusual — whether the puzzle originates in our suboptimal understanding or the agent's suboptimal reasoning. And it allows us to juxtapose different perspectives on any action. Such juxtapositioning gives us a mechanism for coming to see how an action that strikes us as misguided might have been construed by the agent as reasonable given her understanding of her circumstances. After establishing the seven elements of the poetics, I address the objection that narrative-based accounts of intentional action are not properly explanatory.<br>

Abstract: On this last point see my oration Relatieve autonomie als kruispunt van wegen
(Relative autonomy at the crossroads), given on the occasion of my taking up the
post of professor of the philosophy of the socio-cultural sciences at the Free
University, lOth October 1980. There I pointed out that marxists on the whole
gloss over this choice (esp. note 25). Peter Singer recently made a number of inter-
esting observations about this in the context of a review of several new publications
on Marx's view of history. See for example the following passages on William H.
Shaw's Marx's Theory of History (Stanford Univ. Press): 'Shaw has to admit that
the arguments Marx offers for the key idea of historical materialism — that material
production dominâtes social life — are "flimsy and perfunctory". How can this be,
if Marx considered himself a scientist and this was his great discovery? Shaw's
explanation is that Marx was so convinced that the primacy of production was
obvious that he did not see the need for more argument. But why was he so con-
vinced that it was obvious? Here Shaw uneasily confesses: "one senses that Marx
and Engels attached some sort of ontological primacy to material production, from
which its explanatory weight for social science follows". In short, Marx and Engels
simply regarded production as more "real" than politics, religion and ideas.' (Peter
Singer, New York Review of Books, 20 December 1979, p. 45).<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>

Author(s): Carr Steven G.<br>
Abstract: If, as many historians and theorists now believe, narrative is the form proper to historical explanation, this raises the problem of the terms in which such narratives are to be evaluated. Without a clear account of evaluation, the status of historical knowledge (both in itself and in all those social, political, and other contexts in which appeal to historical explanation is made) remains obscure. Beginning with the view, found in Hayden White and others, that historical narrative constitutes a meaning not reducible to the factual content it engages, this essay argues that such meaning can arise only through a synthesis of cognitive and normative discourses. Narrative combines "heterogeneous" language games in such a way that neither appeal to "truth content" nor to "justice" suffices to decide the question of which of two competing historical explanations is, as a whole, superior. Examining in critical detail the opposed positions on this issue articulated by two recent theorists-Frank Ankersmit ("narrative idealism") and David Carr ("narrative realism")-the paper concludes that the debate between those who hold that historical narratives should be judged in essentially cognitive terms and those who hold that they should be judged in essentially political terms cannot be resolved and that a philosophical view of historical narrative that is neither realist nor idealist needs to be developed.<br>

Author(s): Carr David<br>
Abstract: In this paper I look at narrative as a mode of explanation and at various ways in which the explanatory value of narrative has been criticized. I begin with the roots of narrative explanation in everyday action, experience, and discourse, illustrating it with the help of a simple example. I try to show how narrative explanation is transformed and complicated by circumstances that take us beyond the everyday into such realms as jurisprudence, journalism, and history. I give an account of why narrative explanation normally satisfies us, and how or in what sense it actually explains. Then I consider how narrative is challenged and rejected as a mode of explanation in many scientific and other contexts and why attempts are made to replace it with something else. I try to evaluate the nature and sources of these challenges, and I describe this controversy over narrative against the historical background of its emergence. My paper ends with a pragmatic defense of narrative explanation against these challenges.<br>

Abstract: This paper argues against causalism about reasons in three stages. First, the paper investigates Professor Davidson's sophisticated version of the claim that we must understand reason-explanations as a kind of causal explanation to highlight the fact that this move does no explanatory work in telling us how we determine for which reasons we act. Second, the paper considers Davidson's true motivation for regarding reasons-explanations as causal which connects with his claim that reasons are causes. He advocates anomalous monism in order to solve the mysterious connection problem. In assessing his proposed solution to this problem, the paper examines his `extension reply' to the charge that his token identity theory ultimately results in epiphenomenalism. The paper argues that only a reading of this reply makes for a stable anomalous monism but for this reason Davidson's compatiblist metaphysics is unfit for the task of solving the mysterious connection problem. Given that reductive accounts are incompatible with the special features of reasons explanations, the paper concludes that we must reverse the orthodoxy once again and eschew causalism about reasons and reason-explanations. Finally, the paper considers a possible way of recasting our understanding of causation so that the mysterious connection problem disappears.<br>

Author(s): Hall Anne<br>
Abstract: The problem of how to access and deploy the explanatory power of culture in historical accounts has long remained vexing. A recent approach, combining and transcending the "culture as structure"/ "culture as practice" divide among social historians, puts explanatory focus on the recursivity of meaning, agency, and structure in historical transformation. This article argues that meaning construction is at the nexus of culture, social structure, and social action, and must be the explicit target of investigation into the cultural dimension of historical explanation. Through an empirical analysis of political alliance during the Irish Land War, 1879-1882, I demonstrate that historians can uncover meaning construction by analyzing the symbolic structures and practices of narrative discourse.<br>

Author(s): Webster Steven<br>
Abstract: Using the hermeneutical theory of Paul Ricoeur, it is possible to discern symbolic dimensions in cultural anthropology. Symbols, here, are dominant images in anthropologists' texts, creatively posited by inquirers, that, most importantly, possess a surplus of meaning. A symbol's fullest surplus of meaning is a prereflexive and comprehensive "understanding" (Verstehen) that may encompass a scholar's attempts at "explanation" (Erklaren). Examples of this symbolic dimension are the "understandings" that lie implicit in two elaborate anthropological systems: Levi-Strauss's structuralism and Harris's cultural materialism. Amid their commitments to anthropological "science" and "explanation," the works of each disclose a distinctive Verstehen. For Levi-Strauss, this "understanding" is nurtured by his image "world of reciprocity." For Harris, it is carried by the image "nature." This "understanding" has two major functions. On the level of the intellectual coherence of their texts, it gives unity to their intercultural interpretations of other societies and to their intracultural interpretations of their own traditions. On a moral level, it includes modes of being-in-the-world that Levi-Strauss and Harris prefer and ocasionally press upon their readers. Discernment of symbolic dimensions of "understanding" in anthropologists' texts may be an initial step toward reflection on the matrices out of which diverse explanations are presented in anthropological literature.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i27504370<br>
Date: 11 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Wils Jean-Pierre<br>
Abstract: Over the last few decades there has been a revival of interest in virtue ethics, with the emphasis on the virtuous caregiver. This paper deals with the 'virtuous patient', specifically the patient with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). We believe that a virtue approach provides insights not available to current methods of studying coping styles and coping strategies. Data are derived from seven semi-structured in-depth interviews. The transcripts of the interviews were subjected to an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The focus of the analysis was on 'living well with chronic illness'. It appears that the moral challenges faced by patients with an ESRD are manifold. When they are invited to tell the story of their illness, they do not explicitly speak of virtues, but they often refer to moral qualities, and to attitudes that can be regarded as virtuous. We identify several such concepts in the narratives of patients with ESRD. We conclude that the Aristotelian model of virtue ethics is particularly descriptively (and possibly also normatively) relevant to the explanation of the life narratives and the moral challenges of patients with an ESRD.<br>

Abstract: Le problème de la représentation du passé ne commence pas avec l'histoire mais avec la mémoire qui a le privilège de la reconnaissance intuitive et directe des images gardées de l'impression en nous de la marque du passé, avec toutes les difficultés liées à la fiabilité relative de la mémoire. Le problème chemine à travers tous les stades de l'opération historiographique: témoignage et archive, — explication/compréhension —, représentation narrative et rhétorique au niveau du texte final de l'historien. Entre la mémoire et l'histoire, l'ordre de priorité reste indécidable. /// The problem of the representation of the past does not begin with history, but with memory. Memory has the capacity to recognize intuitively and directly the images we keep of the impression the past makes on us, with all the uncertainties stemming from its questionable reliability. This problem concerns all stages of the historiographic process: testimony and archives — explanation/comprehension — narrative and rhetorical representation during the writing of the historian's final text. But one thing remains certain, it is impossible to give priority to either memory or history.<br>

Abstract: Recent developments in historical sociology emphasize the centrality of temporality to analysis and explanation. Narrative uses temporal order to organize information about events and to foster their understanding but is insufficiently systematic to substitute for sociological explanation. This article illustrates a new interpretative heuristic for the computer- assisted analysis of qualitative narrative sequences, "event-structure analysis,"that infuses narrative with greater rigor and explicitness. Through the analysis of a lynching that took place in Mississippi in 1930, this article shows how event-structure analysis can be used to build replicable and generalizable causal interpretations of events.<br>

Publisher: Higher Education Press and Springer<br>
Issue: i27823295<br>
Date: 6 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Yiyu Liu<br>
Abstract: The essential significance of scientific metaphor lies in applying the general metaphorical theory to specific interpretations and elaborations of scientific theories to form a methodology of scientific explanation. It is a contextual grasp of objective reality. A given metaphorical context and its grasp of the essence of reality can only be valid when the context is continually restructured. Taking the context as a whole, the methodological characteristic of scientific metaphor lies in the unity of understanding and choice, experience and concepts, semantic structures and metaphorical domains, rationality and irrationality. As a form of thinking based on reasons, scientific metaphor plays an important role in invention, representation, explanation, evaluation, and communication. 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𰍀𦐒𶄶𤡇𠁁𢌒𤅸𣕘𙥨𳌤𰍀𸕄𡥇𩜂𵝰𤈒𩦒𠄐𱆅𣎘𩜂𵝰𰍀𠡕𠌇𵊙𷌢 𡙄𵠨𦄦𠀓, 𰀁𧒒𤐘𥄄𙥨𱆁𱆅𣎘𵊙𷌢𰍀𦁁𧡡𵝰𤘅𤠙. 𣐧𦅙𣕅𣑘𵉦𣑔𢌒𰍀𙥨𱆁𵠡𢙙𡉰 𥈦𥕩, 𡒂𦍷𵠡𢙙𰍀𙦁𦀩𷌥𦔀, 𥅥𳀡𲑳𣑐𸕄𡥇𵠡𢙙𰍀𣎄𢌒𡑐𠡔𥈦𥕩𣑔𢌒𦐒𶄶𰍀 𦍷𥤨𤘕. 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𰍀𦁁𧡡𵝰𩌅𤑉𴤠𩘖𠀦: 𩜂𵊙𙦂𶡳𥌡, 𲑣𹕤𙦂𧀐𤕥, 𵠡𠁁𲑧𦔀𙦂 𸕄𡥇𢒕, 𩜂𤘕𙦂𸝐𩜂𤘕𰍀𲑹𙥨. 𠌖𠀦𙥨𱆁𦍷𩜂𰀁𥔒𩜂𰍀𤘅𲔀𤐘𤌵, 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𠡕𦍷 𡑗𦄦, 𴤠𤑉, 𵠨𦄦, 𵞀𠈕𡑐𠄲𧥩𱕡𦁁𸝔𰍀𷌥𵈁𡅑𳀡.<br>

Abstract: Network analysis is one of the most promising currents in sociological research, and yet it has never been subjected to a theoretically informed assessment and critique. This article outlines the theoretical presuppositions of network analysis. It also distinguishes between three different (implicit) models in the network literature of the interrelations of social structure, culture, and human agency. It concludes that only a strategy for historical explanation that synthesizes social structural and cultural analysis can adequately explain the formation, reproduction, and transformation of networks themselves. The article sketches the broad contours of such a theoretical synthesis in the conclusion.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: i345794<br>
Date: 12 1, 1909<br>
Author(s): James Kevin<br>
Abstract: This essay argues that in Henry James's The Ambassadors (1903) Mrs. Newsome, who appears to be merely a representative of everything un-Jamesian, particularly a lack of moral and aesthetic imagination, should not be so quickly dismissed. Post-structuralist critics do not hesitate to denounce her. They typically identify Mrs. Newsome's "book" of expectations for Strether, her emissary, and for Chad, her successor, with the closed book of logocentric tyranny; both are said to rely on unambiguous reference and to enforce the cold rationality of linear causation. Derridean readers of The Ambassadors unmistakably prefer Madame de Vionnet's Paris, embodying as it apparently does their own essentially skeptical doctrines about representation. James, however, plays a more subtle game of balance and synthesis, suggesting that while Newsome's book is firm against new impressions, expecting experience to submit utterly to preconceived plans and moralistic evaluations, it also successfully asserts against Parisian representational openness and mystery the viability of reasonable explanation. Her book is vindicated insofar as it stands for the persistent relevance of linear causality and for the nonabsolute grounding of speculation in the concrete world of events and consequences. Newsome's extreme rationalism is in fact denied full authority early in the novel, whose true subject is located when extreme skepticism seems to dominate and explanation seems irrelevant. During the course of the story, time's subtle order slowly reemerges, and James the realist steps forward from behind the post-structuralist veil.<br>

Abstract: Before World War II the intellectual climate of American sociology was congenial to the growth of a sociology of knowledge akin to Mannheim's. Yet in the postwar period American sociologists committed themselves to ahistorical theory, positivist methodology, and team research; their "scientistic" sociology did not permit the historicism, relativism, and holism necessary to Mannheimian analysis. Currently, however, convergent trends in a number of disciplines--not only sociology but also philosophy, anthropology, literary criticism, and the histories of ideas, science, and art--favor a revival of the Mannheimian program. Analysts of culture now seek to integrate the sociological goals of "explanation" and "understanding"--the formulation of quasi-laws of behavior, based on identification of the social structural elements of culture production, and the interpretation of the subjective meaning of culture, based on recovery of actors' intentions. Their research program requires investigation of the peculiar sociohistorical circumstances that condition actors' perceptions, necessitating attention to the cognitive content of culture. This article surveys both the theoretical justifications for such a research program and recent exemplifications of it, focusing on anlyses of what Mannheim termed "objective culture"--such symbolic vehicles for conceptions as religion, the arts, science, and political thought that acquire independent existence, becoming subject to diverse interpretations.<br>

Abstract: Although the I960 student sit-ins were not nearly as uncoordinated as contemporaneous and subsequent accounts suggested, their repeated characterization in participants' accounts as "spontaneous" merits explanation. Analysis of campus newspaper articles and letters to the editor, speeches, and organizational and personal correspondence shows the emergence of a coherent and compelling narrative of the sit-ins, in which spontaneity denoted not a lack of prior coordination but independence from adult leadership, urgency, local initiative, and action by moral imperative rather than bureaucratic planning. Narratives of the sit-ins, told by many tellers, in more and less public settings, and in which spontaneity was a central theme, helped to constitute "student activist" as a new collective identity and to make high risk activism attractive. It was the storied character of representations of the sit-ins that compelled participation. This case suggests the more general importance of narrative-as distinct from collective action "frames"-in accounting for mobilization that takes place before the consolidation of movement organizations.<br>

Abstract: The natural science model has fostered fragmentation among the human sciences, leaving them ill-equipped to address matters of public policy which demand more holistic approaches. This paper proposes a science of political ethics which could encompass factual, normative, and value materials. Ricoeur's processes of guessing, explanation, and comprehension are used to develop a theory of interpretation for the new science. The work of art is used as the metaphor for interpreting societal processes.<br>

Author(s): Felman François<br>
Abstract: Dans ce plaidoyer argumenté en faveur de l'histoire du temps présent, François Bédarida lève une à une les objections faites à ce champ historiographique regardé, quelquefois encore, avec suspicion. Cette notion de temps présent est définie dans une mise en perspective avec le passé et l'avenir. En définitive, l'historien, confronté à la mémoire immédiate des témoins, trouve dans le temps proche un terrain à la fois fragile et fécond. Depuis une vingtaine d'années, l'histoire du temps présent contribue au renouvellement du champ historiographique, tant par le regard qu'elle permet d'offrir sur la notion d'historicité que par la mise en œuvre de pratiques particulières. Les objections formulées à son égard sont cependant nombreuses: absence de recul, manque ou, au contraire, surabondance des sources, incomplétude de l'objet, flou sur la définition même du champ d'études. Or l'intérêt de l'étude du très contemporain réside justement dans la complexité des liens que le présent entretient avec le passé et l'avenir: un temps présent qui fait figure de trait d'union entre ces différentes temporalités à l'image d'un passeur ou d'un traducteur. Mais bâtir une histoire du temps récent ne consiste pas à faire œuvre de mémoire: si l'historien se nourrit des témoignages de ses contemporains, il exerce son regard critique sur eux et, tâche tout à fait inconfortable, fait œuvre d'explication en fonction d'un présent dont il est à la fois l'acteur et l'interprète. /// Over the last twenty years, the history of the present has renewed historiography through the vision it provides on the notion of historicity as well as by the implementation of particular practices. But there are many objections to it: a lack of distance; either a lack of or too many sources; the lack of completion of the object, blurriness about the very definition of the field of study. Nevertheless, the author suggests that the interest in the study of the contemporary dwells in the complexity of the links the pr~<br>

Author(s): Donati Pierpaolo<br>
Abstract: El cambio social, ¿es realizado por actores/agentes (=sujetos, individuales y supraindividuales), o bien por determinismos colectivos (como estructuras y sistemas)?, ¿o tal vez por una combinación cualquiera entre actores y mecanismos sociales? Las teorías sociológicas, desde el Ochocientos hasta hoy, se han dividido en dos grandes campos: a) Por un lado, han habido teorías que han adoptado un "paradigma olístico". b) Por otro, han emergido teorías que, juzgando las primeras como infectadas de determinismo, han elaborado un "paradigma accionista". Muchos autores han mezclado o combinado juntos ora una, ora otra de estas posturas sin lograr encontrar un punto de vista capaz de integrarlas o trascenderlas. El resultado es que, hoy, la mayor parte de las teorías oscilan entre el primer y el segundo paradigma, o bien tratan de comprender el cambio social a través de mezclas o "fórmulas combinatorias" entre las dos. La tesis del autor es que ni las teorías sistémicas (olísticas) ni las accionísticas (individualistas) ni sus combinaciones pueden encontrar una "comprensión adecuada" del cambio social. Ofrecen visiones parciales de la historia, que son insuficientes en tanto que comparten una carencia común: la idea de que la relación social sea un resultado (un efecto) de "otras" variables en juego, como las estructuras sociales o --por el contrario-- la subjetividad individual, o bien un determinismo en sí misma. Para comprender el cambio social se precisa de una teoría adecuada al carácter relacional de la realidad social, como realidad sui generis "hecha de" relaciones sociales. Se propone aquí un paradigma, denominado "relacional", según el cual el cambio social consiste en la "emergencia" de realidades sociales movidas por sujetos (individuales y colectivos) queestán en relación entre ellos en un determinado sentido. "Comprender" signifìca "relacionarse" con todo lo que tal relación (¡social!) significa y comporta. En la parte final se trata de ejemplificar las potenc~<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i40008393<br>
Date: 1 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Browne M. Neil<br>
Abstract: The doctrine of comparable worth is frequently denounced by economists as inefficient, unnecessary, unworkable, incredibly costly, and replete with unfortunate consequences for the same low-wage workers it alleges to be helping. This paper attempts to identify an explanation for both the vigor and content of economists' common antipathy toward comparable worth. The methodology of the paper is taken from Donald McCloskey's recent The Rhetoric of Economics and Feyerabend's epistemology of conversation. A content analysis of economists' criticisms of comparable worth reveals a much different methodology from that deified in the beginning chapters of Principles of Economics texts. Facts and empirical validation are not the primary bases responsible for their conclusions. The theoretical and empirical support for current relative wages is not solid enough to explain either the nearunanimity of economists' arguments or their vitriolic tone. This paper analyzes the fundamental role played by metaphor in guiding economists' analysis of comparable worth. Metaphor is treated in this paper as a pre-rational image that, much like Kuhn's paradigms, provides insight and establishes blind spots.<br>

Author(s): Tunstall Dwayne<br>
Abstract: This paper aims to sever the tie between Josiah Royce s ethico-religious insight and his idiosyncratic absolutistic idealism. The first section of this paper sets the stage for this severance by explaining what it is that Royces ethicoreligious insight needs to be separated from: his absolutistic idealism and its conception of God. This explanation will consist mainly of a concise description of Royce s phenomenology of concept formation in chapter nine of his Religious Aspect of Philosophy (1885) and a critical exegesis of his 1895 Berkeley lecture, "The Conception of God." The second section of this paper actually severs the tie between Royces ethico-religious insight and his absolutistic conception of God via a Marcellian critique of Royce's conception of God. The third section of this paper places Royces ethicoreligious insight in a more hospitable environment — namely, the philosophical orbit of a Marcellian existential phenomenology.<br>

Abstract: La tesis de este artículo es que el mejor medio para rebatir las críticas que dirigen a la historia los "postmodernistas" (etiqueta que incluye a los post-estructuralistas, materialistas culturales, nuevos historicistas, etc.) es hacer una nueva y detallada exposición de lo que en realidad los historiadores hacen y por qué lo hacen. Se abordan para ello dos problemas centrales: el del lenguaje y el de la historia como actividad social y profesional. Más adelante se analiza la diferencia entre el estudio de aspectos del pasado humano rigurosamente delimitados y los estudios especulativos, realizados por filósofos, teóricos literarios y otros investigadores ajenos a la profesión. Los "postmodernistas" simplemente son los intrusos más recientes en el estudio de la historia. En la parte esencial del artículo se analiza el contraste entre lo que los postmodernistas dicen que hacen los historiadores y lo que éstos en realidad hacen. /// The thesis of this article is that the best way to refute the criticism made of history by "postmodernists" (a label which includes post-structuralists, cultural materialists, new historicists etc.) is to give a new and detailed explanation of what historians actually do and why they do it. To do this two central problems are tackled: that of language and that of history as a social and professional activity. Further on there is an analysis of the difference between the study of strictly limited human past and speculative studies, undertaken by philosophers, literary theorists and other researchers outside the profession. The "postmodernists" are simply the latest most recent intruders in the study of history. The essential part of the article analyses the contrast between what postmodernists say and what they actually do.<br>

Abstract: The role of narrative in explanation has received considerable attention in most of the disciplines concerned with questions of historical process, including history, geology, psychoanalysis and palaeo-anthropology. Archaeologists, however, have been curiously reluctant to consider the proposition that their reconstructions of the past are fundamentally narrative in character. An argument is put forward for the serious study of narrative in archaeology, and three case studies from the prehistory of the New Guinea Highlands are presented in support: a brief review of the debate over the impact of sweet potato on Highland society; an analysis of the changing interpretations of the Kuk Swamp agricultural site by Jack Golson; and a summary of the role of indigenous narratives in accounting for the history of wetland drainage amongst Huli speakers in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea.<br>

Abstract: It is argued that to understand the Manus' construction of their environment their view of the night sky has to be taken into account. In Manus thought, celestial bodies and constellations were believed to reside at the edge of a saucer-shaped world, being able to permeate sea and sky and interact with the peoples' immediate environment. While only a small number of constellations had been named, these were sufficient to function as a calendar, a visualization of the seasonal cycle and a metaphorical explanation of the seasons. As such, they made the Manus world autonomous in the sense that the causes supposed to bring about seasonal change were situated within this world or at its edge.<br>

Abstract: La première partie de l'article recueille, comme préalable nécessaire à une sociologie de l'éthique, les notions élaborées pour rendre compte de l'expérience éthique. La seconde partie traite de la reprise de ces notions dans les sociologies de Weber et de Habermas. Weber fait intervenir l'éthique dans le cadre de son explication de l'émergence de la société moderne. Habermas remodèle la théorie wébérienne en introduisant le concept d'activité communicationnelle et c'est à partir de là qu'il introduit l'éthique de la discussion. As a necessary preliminary to a sociology of ethics, the first part of this article is reviewing the various notions drawn up in giving an account of the developments in the field of ethics. The second part is devoted to the further examination of these notions in the sociological research studies carried out by Weber and Habermas. Weber is including ethics in the framework of his explanation of the way in which modern society has emerged. Habermas is adding a new element to Weber's theory through bringing in the concept of communicative process, which leads him to introduce the notion of an ethics of discussion.<br>

Abstract: Nous nous proposons ici de réfléchir à la question suivante : Comment expliquer le fait que les fondateurs du « programme fort », Barry Bames et David Bloor, insistent depuis quelques années pour dire qu'ils n'ont jamais nié l'influence de la « réalité » sur la formation des connaissances scientifiques et qu'en fait ils ont été mal compris de leurs lecteurs ? Alors que Bloor tente d'expliquer les malentendus en les situant complètement du côté du récepteur, en invoquant une loi psychologique dite de « conventionalisation » proposée par Frederic Charles Bartlett, nous voulons esquisser ici une explication complémentaire qui se situe du côté de l'émetteur et prend au sérieux la structure argumentaire des textes. We propose in this paper to answer the following question : How can we explain the fact that the founders of the « Strong Program », Barry Bames and David Bloor, insisted, over the last couple of years, to say that they have never denied the role played by « reality » in the construction of scientific knowledge, and thus have been misunderstood by their readers ? Whereas Bloor explains these misunderstandings by invoking a psychological law of « conventionalization » due to Frederic Charles Bartlett, thus locating the source of the problem on the receiver's (reader's) side, we suggest here a complementary explanation taking into account the argumentative structure of the text itself, hence situating the origin of the confusion on the writer's side.<br>

Abstract: La notion wébérienne de « compréhension » ne se réduit pas à la continuité cognitive que réclament aujourd'hui les « sociologies compréhensives » entre connaissance ordinaire et connaissance scientifique. Elle s'élucide au contraire dans les notions qui appartiennent à son extension logique : le sens subjectivement visé, Vinterprétation rationnelle et l'explication causale. On analysera ici ces trois notions coextensives, de même que les différentes formes de circularité qu'elles entretiennent dans la sociologie wébérienne. Weber's notion of « understanding » cannot, as claimed by comprehensive sociologists, be understood simply as cognitive continuity between ordinary knowledge and scientific knowledge. Rather, it must be logically extended, taking into account subjective meaning, rational interpretation and causal explanation. The article analyzes these three coextensive notions, as well as the different forms of circularity they create in Weber's sociology.<br>

Abstract: Van Parijs démontre que certains schémas d'explication fonctionna-listes ou évolutionnistes (par renforcement/accommodement) sont compatibles avec le schéma d'explication économique (fondements microéconomiques de la macroéconomie), à condition d'affaiblir la rationalité individuelle. Curieusement, Van Parijs refuse ce pas en avant vers le » Réalisme Cognitif dans le cas du modèle économique, pour lequel il continue de recommander la conception optimisatrice de la rationalité individuelle. Cette contradiction a deux effets: elle coupe Van Parijs des interrogations actuelles sur les institutions, et elle enferme son travail dans la perspective ancienne de Friedman (1953). Van Parijs proves that some functionalist or evolutionary schemes of explanation (those by reinforcement or accomodation) are coherent with the usual economic model of explanation (micro-foundations of macro-observations), provided that individual rationality is less that perfect. Strangely, Van Parijs does not allow the economic model to do this step toward » cognitive Realism , and argues for its keeping a strong hypothesis of individual rationality. This contradiction linduces two consequences : Van Parijs cannot integrate recent economic research on institutions, and his work remains trapped within the boundaries of Friedman's Methodology of Positive Economics (1953).<br>

Abstract: Hermeneutical philosophy as developed by Heidegger and Gadamer is not compatible with the classical phenomenological programme elaborated by Husserl. The hermeneutical stress on historicity as a necessary condition for understanding is unfamiliar to Husserl's strictly theoretical approach. However, this does not mean that a hermeneutical philosophy as such cannot be conceived in a phenomenological sense. Whether or not hermeneutical philosophy is phenomenological depends on the paradigm chosen for hermeneutical explanation. A hermeneutics referring to the interpretation of texts may elucidate constitutional elements of phenomenology, e.g. phenomenological reduction and reflection. In this way it even can initiate a modification of phenomenology which, instead of being caught up in its subjective foundation, now appears as elucidating the openness of the correlation between intentional attitudes and their 'objects'. For this correlation the interpretation is a paradigm, whereas the openness of the correlation can be explained in respect of freedom, language, and time.<br>

Author(s): Villani A.<br>
Abstract: On essaie dans ces pages d'appliquer à la philosophie de Kant et de Dilthey certains concepts en vue d'une perspective critique de l'histoire. La distinction diltheyenne entre explication et compréhension est mise en rapport avec celle qu'opère Kant entre jugement déterminant et jugement réfléchissant. Puisque la majeure partie de la complexité historique ne peut trouver son explication dans des lois générales, on propose une compréhension réfléchissante du récit historique. Mettre en relation le jugement réfléchissant et la compréhension revient à souligner la dimension normative de l'interprétation historique. La perspective anthropologique de Kant fait également place aux jugements préréflexifs, préliminaires sur l'histoire, tandis que l'approche diltheyenne par les Geisteswissenschaften ramène à une conscience reflexive ou autoréférée qui replace l'individu en son temps et en son lieu. D'autres aspects peuvent encore conduire à notre rapport critique à l'histoire : le modèle kantien d'une orientation réfléchissante de la communauté humaine, les limites qu'ilpose à l'interprétation authentique, la conception heideggerienne de l'authenticité historique, l'analyse diltheyenne des systèmes d'influence réciproque comme cadre de l'idée d'une imputation causale singulière chez Paul Ricœur. This essay is an attempt at applying certain concepts to the philosophy of Kant and Dilthey, so as to develop a critical perspective on history. Dilthey's explanation-understanding distinction is related to Kant's distinction between determinant and reflective judgment. Since much of the complexity of history cannot be determinantly explained by general laws, a reflective understanding of the meaning of historical narrative is suggested. To relate judgment and understanding is to highlight the evaluative dimension of historical interpretation. Kant's anthropological perpective also makes room for pre-reflective, preliminary judgments about history, whereas Dilthey's human science app~<br>

Author(s): Zizek Tyler<br>
Abstract: "Always historicize": Frederic Jameson's imperative today exerts a powerful influence on the study of religion. It informs a wide range of methods and, perhaps more important, it shapes influential definitions of religion and religious subjectivity and agency. This article examines this influence and argues for the necessity of thinking the limits of historicism. Building on Robert Orsi's efforts to identify a space for academic exploration in-between religious testimony/narrative and social-scientific diagnosis/ explanation, I turn to recent efforts by Eric Santner and Slavoj Zizek to articulate a concept of subjectivity-tied closely to Franz Rosenzweig's concept of "revelation"-in "excess" of history and ideology. Santner and Zizek do not argue for a new, extra-historical foundation for agency and for religious claims but rather theorize and intervene in the "syntax" by which we are bound to history and society. This approach to historicism allows the scholar of religion to enrich accounts of creative religious agency at the same time that it forces them to rethink their relation to religious phenomena and religious subjects in terms of what the anthropologist Michael Jackson calls "encounter."<br>

Abstract: Les préoccupations et les discours relatifs à l'Ethique ont peu à peu envahi la pensée contemporaine dans de nombreux domaines : médecine, biologie, économie, politique, sexualité, vie en société, etc. , Parallèlement, et en apparence de façon paradoxale, l'école s'est désintéressée de l'enseignement de la morale et fuit les sujets brûlants dont nous abreuvent les médias. Seule l'Instruction civique a retrouvé une place dans les programmes depuis 1985. L'article décrit l'évolution des conceptions en la matière depuis la fondation de l'école républicaine en 1880 jusqu'à nos jours et cherche à estimer l'impact qu'ont eu les instructions officielles dans les classes. Il apporte une explication hypothétique de la désaffection constatée et plaide pour une prise en compte, à tous les niveaux, des problèmes de valeurs dans l'enseignement. Debates concerning ethics sweep through contemporary thinking in many fields : médecine, biology, economics... Surprisingly school has neglected the teaching of ethics. Only civics has regained its place in the curriculum since 1985. The author makes a review of this subject teaching from 1880. He proposes an explanation for this loss of interest observed and set the case for taking into account the problems related to the teaching of values.<br>

Abstract: This article argues for a synthesis of George Herbert Mead's conception of the temporal and intersubjective nature of the self with Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory of narrative identity. Combining the insights of Ricoeur's philosophical analysis with Mead's social-psychological orientation provides a subtle, sophisticated, and potent explanation of self-identity. A narrative conception of identity implies that subjectivity is neither a philosophical illusion nor an impermeable substance. Rather, a narrative identity provides a subjective sense of self-continuity as it symbolically integrates the events of lived experience in the plot of the story a person tells about his or her life. The utility of this conception of identity is illustrated through a rereading of Erving Goffman's study of the experience of mental patients. This example underlines the social sources of the self-concept and the role of power and politics in the construction of narrative identities.<br>

Abstract: A análise da construção de figuras femininas como Leonor Teles e Filipa de Lencastre nas crónicas de Fernão Lopes, requer uma metodologia metahistórica como a proposta por Hayden White em Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe e The Content of the Form. Só assim é possível encontrar o comentário social, cultural, político e até histórico aí subjacente. Os quatro "modes of emplotment" e "explanation by emplotment" propostos por White revelam que a narrativa da estória de Leonor está estruturada como tragédia enquanto que a de Filipa é típica de romance medieval. A mensagem histórico-política entretecida por Lopes nas estórias destas rainhas aponta para a responsabilidade de Leonor em causar a queda da primeira dinastia portuguesa, enquanto Filipa é louvada como mãe de uma nova dinastia abrindo uma era de paz e prosperidade. O objectivo último do cronista é justificar a aclamação problemática de D. João I.<br>

Abstract: How did cultural dynamics help bring about the societies we now recognize as modern? This article constructs seven distinct models for how structures of signification and social meaning participated in the transitions to modernity in the West and, in some of the models, across the globe. Our models address: (1) the spread, via imitation, of modern institutions around the world (memetic replication); (2) the construal, by socio-cultural forces and by state organizations, of the modern citizensubject (social subjectification); (3) the continual search for new meanings to replace traditional religious meaning-systems (compensatory reenchantment); (4) repeated attempts, in modern revolutions, to remake society completely, according to a Utopian vision (ideological totalization); (5) the cultural origins and social consequences of scientific and humanistic worldviews (epistemic rift); (6) the gendered politics of state formation (patriarchal supercession); (7) the invention and production of race in the colonial encounter (racial recognition). We explicate the models in reverse chronological order, because in our synthesis, we argue that the original modern break results from a dynamic combination of racial recognition, patriarchal supercession, and epistemic rift; these changes set the stage for the four other processes we theorize. In addition to our synthesis, we also consider, from a more neutral perspective, the kinds of causal arguments upon which these models tend to rely, and thus explicate the analytical undergirding for the application of any of these models to empirical research on transitions to modernity. Throughout the article, we consider how these models might, and might not, mesh with other families of explanation, such as the politico-economic.<br>

Abstract: The traditional mode of explanation in physics via deduction from partial differential equations is contrasted here with explanation via simulations. I argue that the different technologies employed constitute different languages, which support different sorts of narratives. The narratives that accompany simulations and articulate their meaning are typically historical or natural historical in kind. They explain complex phenomena by growing them rather than by referring them to general laws. Examples of such growth simulations and growth narratives come from the evolution of wave functions in quantum chaos, snowflake formation, and Etruscan genetics. The examples suggest a few concluding remarks on historical explanation.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I sketch a reconstruction of the basic psychoanalytic conception of the mind in terms of two historical resources: the conception of the subject developed in post-Kantian idealism, and Spinoza's laws of the affects in Part Three of the Ethics. The former, I suggest, supplies the conceptual basis for the psychoanalytic notion of the unconscious, while the latter defines the type of psychological causality of psychoanalytic explanations. The imperfect fit between these two elements, I claim, is reflected in familiar conceptual difficulties surrounding psychoanalytic theory and explanation.<br>

Publisher: Berghahn Journals<br>
Issue: i40101498<br>

Author(s): Perrin Christophe<br>
Abstract: S'il déclame contre les deux principes qui sont ceux de Descartes, Sartre se réclame pourtant de lui. Sans doute n'est-il pas à un paradoxe près. Reste qu'il nous faudra ne pas l'être moins pour expliquer le sien. Car certes, le sens du texte qu'il intitule « La liberté cartésienne » et qui articule ce volume de morceaux choisis qu'est Descartes 1596-1650 confère quelque cohérence à cet apparent non-sens. Mais une fois présenté de cette oeuvre le paratexte, il nous faudra affirmer non seulement que celle-ci se lit avant L'être et le néant quoiqu'elle ait été publiée après, mais, plus encore, qu'elle est un ensemble d'écrits de Descartes sur Sartre quoiqu'elle soit un écrit de Sartre sur Descartes. C'est qu'outre l'analyse sartrienne des analyses cartésiennes de la Méditation quatrième, on y trouve une psychanalyse existentielle par l'auteur de son devancier, à l'occasion de laquelle a lieu non pas un transfert, mais un contre-transfert. Although Sartre denounces Descartes' two principles, he nevertheless draws inspiration from him. No doubt this is close to being paradoxical; we shall have to be no less paradoxical in our explanation. For although the text entitled "Cartesian Freedom," which introduces a volume of selections from Descartes, Descartes 1596Ί650, confers some coherence on this apparent non-sense, once the texts surrounding this work have been taken into account, we have to conclude not only that this text predates Beinjj and Nothingness, even though it was published afterwards, but that it is a collection of Descartes' writings on Sartre, even though it is a writing by Sartre on Descartes. For beyond the Sartrean analysis of the Cartesian analyses of the Fourth Meditation, we find Sartre's existential psychoanalysis of his predecessor, in which takes place not a transference, but a counter-transference.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113430<br>
Date: 10 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Fludernik Monika<br>
Abstract: The narratological category "person" needs to be replaced by a different conceptual framework. The traditional distinctions between narrative levels and between story and discourse are inadequate to an explanation of much postmodernist writing. Classic narratological categories correlate with a realist understanding of story and with a realist conceptualization of story telling with some postmodernist techniques of writing, such as second-person fiction, refusing to play by such conceptualizations. Gabriel Josipovici's Contre-jour is an instance of a radical deconstruction of realist parameters. Realist recuperations or naturalizations of intractable writing have to be evaluated as readings against the anti-mimetic grain of such texts, and the possibility of such narrative recuperation does not provide evidence for the reinstatement of traditional narratological distinctions. The failing of current narratology to account for second-person narrative is due to the inapplicability of traditional narratological categories, a break-down that is motivated by the ideological commitments of much postmodernist, and especially second-person, fiction since these deliberately question realistic frames of cognition and story understanding.<br>

Abstract: Depuis le célèbre article de Merleau-Ponty, « De Mauss à Claude Lévi-Strauss », la manière dont on évalue le rapport entre ces deux auteurs détermine ou exprime autant d'interprétations historiques du structuralisme et de choix théoriques ou philosophiques quant aux sciences sociales. Cette filiation se voulait une critique: être fidèle à la découverte de Mauss, celle du caractère central de la réciprocité dans la vie sociale, imposait de dépasser la sociologie vers une sémiologie générale. Cet article s'efforce de montrer qu'il ne s'agit pas là, contrairement à l'interprétation subtile qu'en fit Merleau-Ponty, défaire de la réalité sociale un système de points de vue substituables ou de mouvements córreles de subjectivation, mais de montrer que ce sont les « valeurs » qui, du fait de leur nature, de leur ontologie, doivent nécessairement circuler entre plusieurs points de vue exclusifs et complémentaires. Il revisite la célèbre critique de Lévi-Strauss à Mauss sur l'explication de l'obligation de donner par une « force des choses », et replace l'apport de l'anthropologie structurale dans la philosophie de l'esprit contemporaine, là où elle se confronte aux questions ouvertes par la physique sur l'ontologie des objets quantiques. Since Merleau-Ponty's famous paper « De Mauss à Claude Lévi-Strauss », the way the link between these two authors has been construed determine or reveal as many historical interpretations of structuralism as philosophical and theoretical choices about social sciences. We know that this vindicated kinship was supposed to be critical: being faithful to Mauss's discovery, that of the centrality of reciprocity in social life, compelled us to overcome sociology in the direction of a general semiology. This paper, in opposition at Merleau-Ponty's subtle interpretation of this move, tries to show that it was not aimed at a redefinition of social reality as a system of substitutablepoints of view and correlated movements of subjectivation, but at t~<br>

Abstract: Inquiry in the social sciences is based on theoretical assumptions that are not always clearly articulated in research reports. This article surveys some of the theoretical positions that underlie various qualitative research methods and discusses some of the methodological issues raised by those positions. The four themes that serve as anchor points for the discussion are contextualization, an approach to social-scientific observation that takes into account the environment in which the observational event takes place; understanding, an approach to the problem of knowledge and explanation that addresses the range of what can be learned from observation; pluralism, the proposition that not only social settings but the methods for explaining them resist reduction to a single model; and expression, the problem of conveying the results of research.<br>

Abstract: À partir de plusieurs vagues d'enquêtes par entretiens approfondis, cet article s'efforce de montrer ce que le rapport au politique, notamment l'investissement dans les objets politiques et les préférences que l'on peut avoir ou ne pas avoir dans ces domaines, doivent aux diverses socialisations constitutives de l'expérience du monde social d'un individu. Il exemplifie la manière dont chacun s'appuie sur des visions et valorisations du monde élaborées à travers son histoire sociale personnelle pour appréhender les questions politiques. Au-delà de la description des instruments cognitifs mobilisés dans des situations, il s'agit d'expliquer les conditions de l'adhésion aux représentations et les facteurs de l'activation de leurs ressources cognitives. Ce travail est aussi l'occasion d'élargir les problématiques des travaux touchant à la socialisation politique et de questionner certains de leurs résultats. L'enjeu théorique est de dépasser les dualismes — explication versus compréhension, objectivisme et subjectivisme, déterminisme et liberté, intérêts et croyances, holisme et individualisme, méthodes quantitatives et qualitatives — qui structurent et bornent trop souvent les recherches des sciences sociales. Using several series of in depth interviews, this article shows what the relationship to politics, particularly the investment in political objects and one's preferences in these areas, owe to the various socializations that make up the experience of the social world of an individual. It exemplifies how people depend on visions and outlooks of the world worked out through their personal social history to grasp political questions. Beyond describing the cognitive instruments mobilized in these situations, there is the question of explaining the conditions for accepting these representations and the factors of the activation of their cognitive resources. This is also the opportunity to widen the problematics of researches touching upon political socialization and t~<br>

Issue: i40128070<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Hill Robert J.<br>
Abstract: Biblical Inspiration has long been considered an important concept for Catholic theology, but the difficulties experienced in trying to give an adequate and convincing explanation of how divine and the human authors could collaborate in producing Biblical texts has discouraged many writers from pursuing the topic. Some have considered that the difficulties are so great that the task of exploring a theology of Inspiration is too great to make the effort worthwhile. This article, in attempting to sketch a model for Biblical Inspiration, begins by trying to identify exactly what is required for the theology of Inspiration, and then discarding what is not; it also sets out to distinguish clearly between Revelation and Inspiration, while recognising that the two are closely related, and using a model of symbolic mediation for Revelation. The article goes on to propose a model of Inspiration which satisfies not only the demands of contemporary Biblical scholarship and philosophical hermeneutics, but also the requirements of the doctrine of Inspiration as found in the Magisterial documents of the Catholic Church.<br>

Abstract: According to German criminal law, a person who violates a criminal law rule will be excused under the conditions of § 35 German Criminal Code (necessity as an excuse). What are the reasons for not holding an offender responsible in these cases although he may have even caused the death of his victim? In section II of this essay, the usual answers to this question are analysed. The result is that none of them is utterly convincing. They all have in common that they underestimate the importance of the victim's interest in his personal freedom. In section III, the author puts forward his own interpretation of § 35 German Criminal Code. This interpretation is based on the distinction between two meanings of legal freedom. In the first place the members of a legal community are obliged to respect the „negative freedom“ of each other. On the basis of this understanding of „freedom“ the defence of necessity appears as an alien element within the system of criminal law. However, the status of the members of a legal community is not confined to their „negative freedom.“ To some extent, the criminal law also recognizes their „positive freedom“: the interest of each individual to preserve his personal integrity. The defence of necessity in § 35 German Criminal Code can be interpreted as acknowledging the offender's „positive freedom.“ In the final section of this essay (section IV) this model of explanation is applied to a range of detailed problems raised by § 35 German Criminal Code.<br>

Abstract: What is the future of the poetic figures in a technological and scientific world where a more restricted view appears to be emerging as to what is adequate and relevant about metaphors? What part should the radical trope play in a script where the figures that are heralded are usually those that are perceived as having practical importance, i. e., those that fill in the gaps of existing knowledge? It will be the intent of this paper to show that the current preoccupation of much of philosophy and psychology with structural explanation and cognitive theory has certainly contributed to establishing a coordinated and unified theory of metaphors, but left unto itself such a concern is severely limited and does not adequately explain the full potential of metaphorical expressions.<br>

Article Title: Criticism, Literary History, and the Paradigm: The Education of Henry Adams<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219749<br>
Date: 5 1, 1973<br>
Author(s): White Wayne<br>
Abstract: Literary historians have persistently regarded The Education of Henry Adams as a "paradigmatic" text. While "historical explanations" stress the book's historical achievement, "critical explications" portray it as a failure of historical consciousness that achieves its success in the ahistorical arenas of aesthetic integration and imaginative projection. To relate the products of "explication" with the aims of "historical explanation," I regard the work's true "paradigm achievement" as an inquiry into "historical being." For Adams this achievement embodies disciplinary formulation and professional commitment and thus coordinates historical speculation and self-cultivation. One must assess the ethical density and cultural significance of the text before explaining its historical identity. The Education, despite its origin in epistemological chaos, makes the past eternally relevant to the present; for it is a personal and theoretical discovery of how the narrative structures of history and selfhood create the possibilities of individual and social life.<br>

Abstract: «At the basis of the literary act is a consciousness of language. Whether or not the writer is given to abstract reflexion, there is in literature itself a metaliterary dimension.» In his article on the Evolution of Literary Theory, Tzvetan Todorov examines the relation between the «discourse on Literature» and the object of that discourse: literature. Whereas exegesis concerns itself with the Elucidation and explanation of an historically given object, theory itself constitutes its object. Theory then is in turn seen to be historically informed. From the Poetics of Aristotle, through the medieval hermeneuts, the Renaissance concern with genres, Todorov traces the development of the theoretical discourse which proposes literature as its object. Only in the romantic period is a theory of literature, in the strict sense, elaborated. In the 20th century this theory is further influenced by other emergent disciplines :Marxism, psychoanalysis etc. The final pages of Todorov's paper consider in detail the impact of structuralism, particularly in France, on the literary theoretical discourse. He concludes with reference to the changes taking place currently. According to Todorov, it is in the «idea of genre» that the «transformation will take place.»<br>

Abstract: Many anthropologists argue that human affairs are subjective and therefore outside the realm of empirical science. While this position is based on important observations about the process of understanding human affairs, the arguments employed do not imply that the application of empirical science to the explanation of human affairs is either impossible or inappropriate, as some critics maintain.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i227591<br>
Date: 3 1, 1972<br>
Author(s): Wolpe Donald L.<br>
Abstract: Recent changes within social and cultural anthropology have made history a key issue, but in this essay I argue that the field has yet to develop the resources that are required to deal with temporality. This point is made through an extended examination of Jean and John Comaroff's work on Christianity and colonialism in southern Africa. Arguably, the Comaroffs read history backward and then present its unfolding as a kind of inexorable logic. In doing so, they homogenize missionary and Tswana "cultures" and attribute agency to abstractions rather than to people acting in particular material contexts. In contrast, I argue for a narrative approach to historical anthropological explanation. The emergent qualities of events - and the variable ways in which capitalism, hegemony, Protestantism, and vernacular modernisms relate - require narrative for explanation, narrative that encompasses within itself the narratives of social actors themselves.<br>

Date: 12 1, 1981<br>
Author(s): Young Robert J.<br>
Abstract: This paper applies the critical theory of Jürgen Habermas to theoretical issues in criminology. Since criminologists have generally neglected the critical tradition, we include a brief summation of concerns central to critical sociology. These concerns include a defense of reason and a provocative critique of both culture and science. We then apply the critical model to themes and issues in criminology. Specifically, our analysis uses Habermas' three "knowledge constitutive interests" to reconceptualize cultural explanations of crime, to address the linkage between macro-and micro-levels of explanation, and to outline a novel interpretation of the relationship between culture and social structure. We conclude with a critique of Habermas' prescription for social change.<br>

Abstract: David Jenkins persistently recommended that in reading the Bible the reader has always to ask ‘How did people think then which led them to put it like that?’ He provided the following as an example. The writers of the gospels lived at a time when demon possession was the available conceptuality if a person fell to the ground writhing and foaming at the mouth. In the Middle Ages, the conceptuality within which explanation arose was that of the humours of the body and the cure would have been blood-letting. In medicalized 21st century conceptuality, it would be said that the person was having an epileptic fit and the needed response is to keep calm and re-assure.<br>

Abstract: In
         Survival in Auschwitz, Levi recounts how the inmates of the camps used the word “Muselmann” to designate those so debilitated by hunger and sickness that they resembled the living dead more than human beings.
               Giorgio Agamben describes them as the body “of the overcomatose person and the neomort attached to life-support systems today” (156). The existence of nearly every so-called Muselmann ended in the gas chamber. For Agamben, even though those who were eventually led to the gas chambers were the perfect witnesses of the evils of the Holocaust, they cannot bear witness because they took their experience to the grave. Nevertheless, Agamben argues that a life that had become “bare, unassignable and unwitnessable” is not necessarily condemned to silence (156–57). However, the only way it can speak is through the survivor, through the witness, whose authority “consists in his capacity to speak solely in the name of an incapacity to speak—that is, in his or her being a subject” (158). In light of Agamben's explanation, we understand that Primo Levi, who barely survived extermination, speaks not just for himself but also on behalf of all who did not survive. Testimony consists of any action taken by the survivor of violence to ensure that the Muselmann is not forgotten. Agamben argues that “it is because there is testimony only where there is an impossibility of speaking, because there is a witness only where there has been desubjectification, that the2
            Muselmannis the complete witness and that the survivor and theMuselmanncannot be split apart” (158).<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: The focus on arts and letters in Marcuse has made him a favorite among literary and cultural critics, and he is inviting to contemporary rhetoricians as well. A rhetorical reading of Marcuse would point out his insistence on the mediated means of communication necessary to convey hope in a future utopia. The engine of social change, one might say, is dependent on a rhetorical, utopian imagination: the art of inventing utopian topics and using them in linguistic, artistic, or architectural works to persuade others in an ethical way to improve and fulfill human desire—rather than pervert it by generating more and more desire for its own sake. In particular, Marcuse's “education of desire” resembles Kenneth Burke's explanation of literary or artistic form as the evocation and fulfillment of desire (more on this presently). There are many ways in which, at first glance, Marcuse's and the other historical theorists' ideas depend on principles of rhetoric, whether they name them as such or not. While there is no consideration of specific rhetorical proofs, reference to utopia itself could be considered a trope or a metaphorical construct. There must always be a consideration of audience in the historical theorists' understanding of points in time and in the transformation of society by means of cultural production and reception. But most strikingly, Marcuse's ethical stance resembles a liberal-humanist mainstay in rhetorical theory, one that stems back to Plato and Aristotle in ancient rhetoric. Rhetoric in the liberal-humanist tradition has always worked hand in hand with considerations of ethics in a human naturist sense. To persuade an audience or to move attitudes in a society, the good of human beings, individual or collective, must be first and foremost in the mind that produces utopian creative output (whether the good is objective or relative). This utopian topos in arts and letters is presented in a way that specifically appeals to, and draws from, the audience, ~<br>

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Most claims to Utopia for architecture are undertheorized at best, in the sense that the association between Utopia and architecture is either presumed—assumed to require no explanation or argument—or imagined as inevitably negative—charting impossibility or failure at best and absolutism and inhumanity at worst. Alternatively, Utopia is confused with other characteristics—described as visionary, for example, but also misconstrued with determinism and technological utopianism. As suggested above, the most common pitfall shared by treatments of Utopia coming from within architecture and urbanism is the conflation of
         visionarywithrevolutionary,technological optimism,social ideals,futurism, and, of course,Utopia. WhileUtopiamay encapsulate all of these other terms, each could happily survive on its own withoutUtopia.<br>
