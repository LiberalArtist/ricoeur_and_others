  Book Title: Invoking the Invisible Hand-Social Security and the Privatization Debates<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Medhurst Martin J.<br>
  Abstract: In Invoking the InvisibleHand Robert Asen scrutinizes contemporary debates over proposals to privatize Social Security. Asen argues that a rights-based rhetoric employed by Social Security's original supporters enabled advocates of privatization to align their proposals with the widely held belief that Social Security functions simply as a return on a worker's contributions and that it is not, in fact, a social insurance program.By analyzing major debates over a preeminent American institution, Asen reveals the ways in which language is deployed to identify problems for public policy, craft policy solutions, and promote policies to the populace. He shows how debate participants seek to create favorable contexts for their preferred policies and how they connect these policies to idealized images of the nation.<br>

The fact is that I do not have a secure understanding about the state of the art as it is now practiced in teaching public speech. I have not made a survey of the methods now used in classroom instruction, nor undertaken a systematic study of the textbooks, and I have not reviewed the current scholarly literature.

  Abstract: If the devil is in the details, then God is in the prepositions, and I want today to look at one such preposition: the little word “for.” I think this to be the most diffi cult and delicate word to parse in the whole of theology. Let me explain why. As St. Th omas Aquinas taught us, we cannot say of God what God is, only what God is not. Th is very properly negative approach to God is vital if we are to avoid idolatry.

  Abstract: Since 1961, Girard’s production has grown without interruption, to at least the same degree as his fame. Without doubt, the fascination with Girard’s thought derives from the fact that he has constructed a true “speculative cathedral,” a theory that proposes to explain everything from myths to rituals, Greek tragedies to modern novels, holocausts of historical magnitude to everyday customs. At first glance, it would seem that Girard has changed little or nothing of his speculative construction since then, but if we look closely, there are noticeable problems and corrections that threaten the very foundations of mimetic theory. Indeed, recent criticism<br>

  Abstract: In 1944, from his prison cell at Tegel, Dietrich Bonhoeffer wondered whether Christianity had in fact outlived its usefulness as a religion.¹ His sentiments have been echoed in the subsequent half-century since, particularly with the rise of the postmodern climate. It would not be difficult to multiply logarithmically these critiques of Christianity. That there has been an expulsion of things Christian from the academy there is no doubt; more notably, it is paralleled in the expulsion of Jesus from the Christian churches.<br>

  Abstract: When Mario Sansone stated that Canto XXVII functions as a narrative pause between two climactic sequences (the rise through the three richly populated last cornices of the purgatorial mountain and the meeting with Matilda and Beatrice in the Terrestrial Paradise), he certainly did not mean to reduce Canto XXVII to merely a link lacking a poetical strength of its own. In fact, Sansone has added that the pauselike quality or narrative suspension following the poignant voice of Arnaut Daniel in the refining fire and foreshadowing the apparition of Matilda in the place of perennial springtime is counterpointed by an “ascending<br>

Johane’s position as a prophet was marked by music well before the articulation of a distinct Friday or Saturday message. It was the singing, in fact, as much as what Johane said, that often got the nascent apostolics into trouble.

Though it is yet too early to speak of a genre of modern history, the development of new linguistic resources, in fact an entire semantic field, was the crucial and final element that brought the historicization process to a mature point.

  Book Title: Cannibal Talk-The Man-Eating Myth and Human Sacrifice in the South Seas<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Obeyesekere Gananath<br>
  Abstract: In this radical reexamination of the notion of cannibalism, Gananath Obeyesekere offers a fascinating and convincing argument that cannibalism is mostly "cannibal talk," a discourse on the Other engaged in by both indigenous peoples and colonial intruders that results in sometimes funny and sometimes deadly cultural misunderstandings. Turning his keen intelligence to Polynesian societies in the early periods of European contact and colonization, Obeyesekere deconstructs Western eyewitness accounts, carefully examining their origins and treating them as a species of fiction writing and seamen's yarns. Cannibalism is less a social or cultural fact than a mythic representation of European writing that reflects much more the realities of European societies and their fascination with the practice of cannibalism, he argues. And while very limited forms of cannibalism might have occurred in Polynesian societies, they were largely in connection with human sacrifice and carried out by a select community in well-defined sacramental rituals.
      Cannibal Talkconsiders how the colonial intrusion produced a complex self-fulfilling prophecy whereby the fantasy of cannibalism became a reality as natives on occasion began to eat both Europeans and their own enemies in acts of "conspicuous anthropophagy."<br>

  Abstract: Despite that fact that I am not as familiar with the political and economic situation of Fiji in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries as I am with the Maori, I believe that in Fiji also there developed a form of pronounced anthropophagy that must be seen in terms of the European presence. The lure of trade, the musket wars, and the rise of powerful chiefdoms and the political confederations that resulted drew Fiji gradually into the world capitalist order. We know that pronounced anthropophagy existed in New Zealand mainly, though not exclusively, in the Bay of Islands area.<br>

Can there be maintained identity between New Testament teachings and later doctrinal formulations that utilize very different conceptual frameworks? Most importantly, if doctrines do in fact develop over time through expansion, contextualization, and critical correction, how can the faith communities that develop and reformulate doctrines claim to be part of the same broad Christian tradition?<br>

  Book Title: Figures of a Changing World: Metaphor and the Emergence of Modern Culture-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BERGER HARRY<br>
  Abstract: Figures of a Changing World offers a dramatic new account of cultural change, an account based on the distinction between two familiar rhetorical figures, metonymy and metaphor. The book treats metonymy as the basic organizing trope of traditional culture and metaphor as the basic organizing trope of modern culture. On the one hand, metonymies present themselves as analogies that articulate or reaffirm preexisting states of affairs. They are guarantors of facticity, a term that can be translated or defined as fact-like-ness. On the other hand, metaphors challenge the similarity they claim to establish, in order to feature departures from preexisting states of affairs. On the basis of this distinction, the author argues that metaphor and metonymy can be used as instruments both for the large-scale interpretation of tensions in cultural change and for the micro-interpretation of tensions within particular texts. In addressing the functioning of the two terms, the author draws upon and critiques the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, Roman Jakobson, Christian Metz, Paul Ricoeur, Umberto Eco, Edmund Leach, and Paul de Man.<br>

Not every contributor takes into account theoretical discussions of metaphor, but the usefulness of every single paper lies in the fact that they explore actual texts while sometimes theorists tend to work out of context.<br>

  Abstract: In her autobiography, Edith Stein tells us that at the age of fifteen she “deliberately and consciously” gave up praying.¹ Perhaps the most significant experience between this decision and her return to the practice of prayer with her conversion to Catholicism at the age of thirty was her contact with Edmund Husserl and his theory of phenomenology. In fact it may be the case, as Jude Dougherty has observed,² that her religious conversion was made possible by her philosophical conversion to phenomenology. Husserl, himself a convert to Christianity, understood prayer in terms of the inward turn of his transcendental phenomenology.<br>

  Abstract: “Reading” is a term that, through overuse, can easily become confused with interpretation. In fact, there is a crucial difference: Reading involves the undoing of interpretative figures; because it is not an operation opposed to the understanding but rather a precondition for it, it allows us to question whether the synthetic moves of the understanding can close off a text. It leads away from meaning to such problems as the text’s constitution and meaning generation. Unlike interpretation, which implies a development over the course of a narrative toward a single figure reconciling all its diverse moments, reading states the logic<br>

  Abstract: The Song of Songs offers no single, stable perspective from which to view the amorous scenes unveiled on its pages. Most readers of the Song from antiquity to the present have, however, been inclined to identify with the female figure traditionally known as the Shulammite. But who is the Shulammite, and who, for that matter, is her beloved? The sustained ambiguities of identity and fluid reversals of erotic roles have made this text fertile ground for conceiving and reconceiving the mysteries of desire, in particular, the mysteries of

He was born in 1913 and died in Paris in 2005, having taught for many years in Straβburg, Paris, and Chicago. Ricoeur is known primarily as a hermeneutic thinker, although his hermeneutic work always also refers to and assumes phenomenology and interacts with various other philosophical approaches. In fact, in many ways a possible conversation between various philosophical traditions, approaches, and discourses could be said to be a distinctive mark of Ricoeur’s philosophy.

  Abstract: Philosophical hermeneutics is built on the assumption that people make sense of their lives by placing themselves in a larger normative context.
                  Environmentalhermeneutics focuses on the fact that environments matter to people, too, because environments embody just such contexts.¹ This is most obvious for cultural landscapes, yet it applies to the specifically natural world as well: Nature can function as a larger normative context with its own narrative dimension.

  Book Title: Scrolls of Love: Ruth and the Song of Songs-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stahlberg Lesleigh Cushing<br>
  Abstract: Scrolls of Love is a book of unions. Edited by a Jew and a Christian who are united by a shared passion for the Bible and a common literary hermeneutic, it joins two biblical scrolls and gathers around them a diverse community of interpreters. It brings together Ruth and the Song of Songs, two seemingly disparate texts of the Hebrew Bible, and reads them through a number of the methodological and theological perspectives. Respectful of traditional biblical scholarship, the collection of essays moves beyond it; alert to contemporary trends, the volume returns venerable interpretive tradition to center stage. Most significantly, it is interfaith. Despite the fact that Jews and Christians share a common text in the Hebrew Scripture, the two communities have read their Bibles in isolation from one another, in ignorance of the richness of the other's traditions of reading. Scrolls of Love brings the two traditions into dialogue, enriching established modes of interpretation with unconventional ones. The result is a volume that sets rabbinic, patristic, and medieval readings alongside feminist, psychoanalytic, and autobiographical ones, combining historical, literary, and textual criticism with a variety of artistic reinterpretations-wood cuts and paper cuts, poetry and fiction. Some of the works are scholarly, with the requisite footnotes to draw readers to further inquiry: others are more reflective than analytic, allowing readers to see what it means to live intimately with Scripture. As a unity, the collection presents Ruth and Song of Songs not only as ancient texts that deserve to be treasured but as old worlds capable of begetting the new.<br>

  Book Title: Divine Enticement: Theological Seductions-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): MACKENDRICK KARMEN<br>
  Abstract: Theology usually appears to us to be dogmatic, judgmental, condescending, maybe therapeutic, or perhaps downright fantastical-but seldom enticing. Divine Enticement takes as its starting point that the meanings of theological concepts are not so much logical, truth-valued propositions-affirmative or negative-as they are provocations and evocations. Thus it argues for the seductiveness of both theology and its subject-for, in fact, infinite seduction and enticement as the very sense of theological query. The divine name is one by which we are drawn toward the limits of thought, language, and flesh. The use of language in such conceptualization calls more than it designates. This is not a flaw or a result of vagueness or imprecision in theological language but rather marks the correspondence of such language to its subject: that which, outside of or at the limit of our thought, draws us as an enticement to desire, not least to intellectual desire. Central to the text is the strange semiotics of divine naming, as a call on that for which there cannot be a standard referent. The entanglement of sign and body, not least in interpretations of the Christian incarnation, both grounds and complicates the theological abstractions. A number of traditional notions in Christian theology are reconceived here as enticements, modes of drawing the desires of both body and mind: faith as "thinking with assent"; sacraments as "visible words" read in community; ethics as responsiveness to beauty; prayer as the language of address; scripture as the story of meaning-making. All of these culminate in a sense of a call to and from the purely possible, the open space into which we can be enticed, within which we can be divinely enticing.<br>

Ethics is more often than not conceived as the very resistance to seduction, if not in fact to any sort of pleasure (or bliss, which seems to undermine the ethical subject).¹ It is dutiful, we think, a little bit ascetic (provided we don’t overly enjoy our asceticism), rule-bound or abstemiously virtuous. And if seduction is about sustaining the possible, then to prescribe, whether character or behavior, seems contradictory to it.

  Publisher: Harvard University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAHANE AHUVIA<br>
  Abstract: These innovative essays by leading scholars of Homer, oral poetics, and epic invite us to rethink some key concepts for an understanding of traditional epic poetry. Egbert Bakker examines the epic performer's use of time and tense in recounting a past that is alive. Tackling the question of full-length performance of the monumental
         Iliad, Andrew Ford considers the extent to which the work was perceived as a coherent whole in the archaic age. John Miles Foley addresses questions about spoken signs and the process of reference in epic discourse, and Ahuvia Kahane studies rhythm as a semantic factor in the Homeric performance. Richard Martin suggests a new range of performance functions for the Homeric simile. And Gregory Nagy establishes the importance of one feature of epic language, the ellipsis. These six essays centered on Homer engage with fundamental issues that are addressed by three essays primarily concerned with medieval epic: those by Franz BÃƒÂ¤uml on the concept of fact; by Wulf Oesterreicher on types of orality; and by Ursula Schaefer on written and spoken media. In their Introduction the editors highlight the underlying approach and viewpoints of this collaborative volume.Reviews of this book:"Despite its wide range of topics and approaches, the volume has a clear thematic focus. All contributors seek to leave behind the more formal concerns of past generations of scholars and aim instead at an understanding of orality as that which is (conceptually or actually) close, immediate, or performed. In their joint search for the new picture, classicists, linguists, and medievalists discover a range of different 'oralities'."<br>

  Book Title: The Reinvention of Religious Music: Olivier Messiaen's Breakthrough Toward the Beyond-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): van Maas Sander<br>
  Abstract: Present-day music studies conspicuously evade the question of religion in contemporary music. Although many composers address the issue in their work, as yet there have been few attempts to think through the structure of religious music as we hear it. On the basis of a careful analysis of Olivier Messiaen's work, this book argues for a renewal of our thinking about religious music. Addressing his notion of a hyper-religiousmusic of sounds and colors, it aims to show that Messiaen has broken new ground. His reinvention of religious music makes us again aware of the fact that religious music, if taken in its proper radical sense, belongs to the foremost of musical adventures.The work of Olivier Messiaen is well known for its inclusion of religious themes and gestures. These alone, however, do not seem enough to account for the religious status of the work. Arguing for a breakthrough toward the beyondon the basis of the synaesthetic experience of music, Messiaen invites a confrontation with contemporary theologians and post-secular thinkers. How to account for a religious breakthrough that is produced by a work of art?Starting from an analysis of his 1960s oratorio La Transfiguration de Notre-Seigneur Jsus-Christ, this book arranges a moderated dialogue between Messiaen and the music theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar, the phenomenology of revelation of Jean-Luc Marion, the rethinking of religion and technics in Jacques Derrida and Bernard Stiegler, and the Augustinian ruminations of Sren Kierkegaard and Jean-Franois Lyotard. Ultimately, this confrontation underscores the challenging yet deeply affirmative nature of Messiaen's music.<br>

  Abstract: Améry defends both the refusal to let time heal all wounds and the refusal to forgive or forget as being the right and privilege of the moral person. He characterizes his unwillingness to move on or to let go of his
                  ressentimentsas a display of personal moral virtue, rather than as a failure to be condemned or treated. In fact, he ties the special kind ofressentimentharbored by the survivor of the Holocaust to different kinds of virtues and values: a protest against forgetfulness and shallow conciliatoriness, a struggle to regain dignity; an acute sense of the inexpiable<br>

  Author(s) LEVINSON JERROLD<br>
  Abstract: The clearest example OF the tendency to generate theoretical problems by splitting apart terms that are in fact inseparable is the persistent debate over the relation between authorial intention and the meaning of texts. Some theorists have claimed that valid interpretations can only be obtained through an appeal to authorial intentions. This assumption is shared by theorists who, denying the possibility of recovering authorial intentions, also deny the possibility of valid interpretations. But once it is seen that the meaning of a text is simply identical to the author’s intended meaning, the project of
                  groundingmeaning in intention becomes incoherent.<br>

  Abstract: Philosophical anthropology. The label conjures up a hybrid few have heard of, and for many of those, a hybrid of questionable viability. Indeed, the words sound a flat thud in the ears of most philosophers and a rude intrusion in the ears of most anthropologists, who hardly want anything to do with it. Some would in fact question the very existence of such an animal since the cross-disciplinary marriage necessary to its birth is believed never to have been consummated—at least to the satisfaction of both parties.<br>

I will show that sensitivity to the rule of contradiction can be useful in the lives of children, especially in combating prejudice and discrimination. Sensitivity to the rule encourages children to seek counterexamples to universal judgments. Second, I will argue that sociological models that attempt to delineate the roots of prejudice can be complemented by an understanding of the rule of contradiction. Here I am concerned with the phenomenon, cited by such models, of assimilating relative differences among groups, which in fact may be true, to overgeneralizations that allege natural<br>

  Abstract: What happens if we enlarge the time frame of the Great War? European and world politics were militarised well before the war. In both Ireland and the Balkans, the violence that fed directly into the war started in 1912–13, as William Mulligan has shown in chapter 1. Continued militarisation of politics and far worse violence prolonged the fighting beyond 1918. In fact, the Great War was the epicentre of a larger cycle of conflict that did not finish until 1923, with the end of the war between Greece and Turkey, the resolution of the crisis over German reparations—which<br>

Both of these responses may be necessary in certain situations. But the binary of violence/nonviolence is not the most important consideration when weighing how to express an adversarial politics. The greater question is how effective action is possible—action that will, in fact, resist and transform.

He had no intention of creating a new religion; rather, he was a reformer of the Judaism of his day. True, his critique went far beyond an intellectual subversion. In fact, Jesus progressively thought of himself as the "Son of Man" inaugurating the advent of the Kingdom of God on earth.<br>

Narrative criminology conceives of a world where experience is always storied and where action advances or realizes the story.

  Abstract: Language has been granted too much power. The linguistic turn, the semiotic turn, the interpretative turn, the cultural turn: it seems that at every turn lately every “thing”—even materiality—is turned into a matter of language or some other form of cultural representation. The ubiquitous puns on “matter” do not, alas, mark a rethinking of the key concepts (materiality and signification) and the relationship between them. Rather, it seems to be symptomatic of the extent to which matters of “fact” (so to speak) have been replaced with matters of signification (no scare quotes here). Language matters. Discourse matters.

  Abstract: Our task in this chapter is to find a persuasive reply, one that does without mimeticism, to the discordant chorus of charges against literary humanism I have outlined. It is not easy to know where to begin. The problem is not only that, in the equally bewildering array of arguments underpinning the main charges against literary humanism, it is difficult to distinguish those whose centrality makes them most worthy of attack. Matters are made still worse by the fact that the claims traditionally regarded as fundamental to literary humanism, here summarized as CIC and the six claims of literature study,<br>

One might argue that their primary function is to provide shelter for the inhabitants and their possessions—a place to stay warm and dry, and to sleep without fear of predators or pathogens. Buildings also provide spaces to safely contain and facilitate social groups focused on learning, work, or play. And they provide for privacy, a space for solace and retreat from the social demands of human existence. These primary physical requirements, and their many subsidiaries, simply reflect the fact that we are biological creatures.

  Abstract: In a study of the Basseri pastoralists of southern Iran, Barth (1961) expresses some surprise regarding their lack of religious interest (they describe themselves as ‘slack Muslims’). His surprise is caused by the fact that religion seems to loom large in the lives of most of the peoples described in classic anthropological studies. This may be a major reason why religion has always been a central field of inquiry in anthropology, even if, as Evans-Pritchard (1962) once pointed out, social scientists have themselves often been indifferent or even hostile to religion.<br>

Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson had been there in the 1940s, Clifford Geertz in the 1960s. The British anthropologist Mark Hobart was about to devote a lifetime of study to Bali.

Yet there are certain social principles which have very widespread acceptance among the vast majority of Catholics in France.

In fact, they have become so generally identified with Catholicism that Catholics with different views must usually explain their reasons for going against the crowd.<br>

  Book Title: Timing Canada-The Shifting Politics of Time in Canadian Literary Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Huebener Paul<br>
  Abstract: From punch clocks to prison sentences, from immigration waiting periods to controversial time-zone boundaries, from Indigenous grave markers that count time in centuries rather than years, to the fact that free time is shrinking faster for women than for men - time shapes the fabric of Canadian society every day, but in ways that are not always visible or logical. In Timing Canada, Paul Huebener draws from cultural history, time-use surveys, political statements, literature, and visual art to craft a detailed understanding of how time operates as a form of power in Canada. Time enables everything we do - as Margaret Atwood writes, "without it we can't live." However, time also disempowers us, divides us, and escapes our control. Huebener transforms our understanding of temporal power and possibility by using examples from Canadian and Indigenous authors - including Jeannette Armstrong, Joseph Boyden, Dionne Brand, Timothy Findley, Lucy Maud Montgomery, Gabrielle Roy, and many others - who witness, question, dismantle, and reconstruct the functioning of time in their works. As the first comprehensive study of the cultural politics of time in Canada, Timing Canada develops foundational principles of critical time studies and everyday temporal literacy, and demonstrates how time functions broadly as a tool of power, privilege, and imagination within a multicultural and multi-temporal nation.<br>

But it is also entirely new, and the fact that Thomas More coined a self-canceling name for the island and the political idea associated with it tends to function somewhat like King Utopus’s moat, cordoning off that idea from the continent from which it might have come, either directly or indirectly.

Products such asEpoisses de Bourgogneorfoie grasare defined by the fact that they depend on the shared savoir-faire of a given community and its culture. These products,<br>

  Abstract: Over the last two decades or so, a thriving cottage industry has developed dealing with the origins and genesis of fundamentalist movements around the globe. Yet the scholars, policy analysts and intelligence experts involved in this huge effort had precious little to say about why such movements survive, and even flourish at times. After all, the odds are pretty much against them, as evidenced by the fact that the membership turnover rate is high. The stringent behavioural requirements, typical of fundamentalist groups, stand in stark contrast to the anything-goes, hedonistic, open society around them. One can just pick up one’s<br>

  Book Title: Critical White Studies-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stefancic Jean<br>
  Abstract: No longer content with accepting whiteness as the norm, critical scholars have turned their attention to whiteness itself. In
      Critical White Studies: Looking Behind the Mirror, numerous thinkers, including Toni Morrison, Eric Foner, Peggy McIntosh, Andrew Hacker, Ruth Frankenberg, John Howard Griffin, David Roediger, Kathleen Heal Cleaver, Noel Ignatiev, Cherrie Moraga, and Reginald Horsman, attack such questions as:*How was whiteness invented, and why?*How has the category whiteness changed over time?*Why did some immigrant groups, such as the Irish and Jews, start out as nonwhite and later became white?*Can some individual people be both white and nonwhite at different times, and what does it mean to "pass for white"?*At what point does pride in being white cross the line into white power or white supremacy?*What can whites concerned over racial inequity or white privilege do about it?Science and pseudoscience are presented side by side to demonstrate how our views on whiteness often reflect preconception, not fact. For example, most scientists hold that race is not a valid scientific category -- genetic differences between races are insignificant compared to those within them. Yet, the "one drop" rule, whereby those with any nonwhite heritage are classified as nonwhite, persists even today. As the bell curve controversy shows, race concepts die hard, especially when power and prestige lie behind them.A sweeping portrait of the emerging field of whiteness studies,Critical White Studiespresents, for the first time, the best work from sociology, law, history, cultural studies, and literature. Delgado and Stefancic expressly offer critical white studies as the next step in critical race theory. In focusing on whiteness, not only do they ask nonwhites to investigate more closely for what it means for others to be white, but also they invite whites to examine themselves more searchingly and to "look behind the mirror."<br>

  Book Title: Hidden Intercourse: Eros and Sexuality in the History of Western Esotericism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>

  Abstract: From rumors about gnostic orgies in antiquity to the explicit erotic symbolism of alchemical texts, from the subtly coded eroticism of medieval kabbalah to the sexual magic practiced by contemporary occultists and countercultural translations of Asian Tantra, the history of Western esotericism is rich in references to the domains of eros and sexuality. This volume, which brings together an impressive array of top-level specialists, is the first to analyze the eroticism of the esoteric without sensationalism or cheap generalizations, but on the basis of expert scholarship and attention to textual and historical detail. While there are few domains where the imagination may so easily run wild, the various contributions seek to distinguish fact from fiction-only to find that historical realities are sometimes even stranger than the fantasies. In doing so, they reveal the outlines of a largely unknown history spanning more than twenty centuries.<br>

  Book Title: Jesus and the Cross-Necessity, Meaning, and Atonement<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Laughlin Peter<br>
  Abstract: According to the Nicene Creed, Christ died for us and for our salvation. But while all Christians agree that Christ’s death and resurrection has saving significance, there is little unanimity in how and why that is the case. In fact, Christian history is littered with accounts of the redemptive value of Christ’s death, and new models and motifs are constantly being proposed, many of which now stand in stark contrast to earlier thought. How then should contemporary articulations of the importance of the death of Christ be judged? At the heart of this book is the contention that Christian reflection on the atonement is faithful inasmuch as it incorporates the intention that Jesus himself had for his death. In a wide-reaching study, the author draws from both classical scholarship and recent work on the historical Jesus to argue that not only did Jesus imbue his death with redemptive meaning but that such meaning should impact expressions of the saving significance of the cross.<br>

First, that the fruitful dialogue between John Paul and Levinas has been largely overlooked. Second, John Paul and Levinas’ approaches to the body are discordant (more on this below). Third, John Paul’s account of the body is a positive theological development that is made clearer and enhanced by reading Levinas. In consideration of these three judgments, a way is opened up that indicates how a theological approach to the body can be fruitfully developed. In fact, John<br>

  Abstract: The last two chapters have demonstrated the fact that the church, as a witnessing community, cannot rise above and live outside its surrounding society and culture. In his 1924 essay “Church and Culture,” for example, Barth writes that the church cannot give witness without conversing with the “actual political and economic standards of its own age. Throughout its own course, the Church swims along in the stream of culture” (
                  TC: 351). This does not imply, of course, that the church ought to accommodate itself to its surrounding culture, only that the church cannot “free itself even partially” from society and<br>

  Author(s) Milbank John<br>
  Abstract: The response of wonder before God’s communication of esse deepens when we become aware that God gives the human person, along with the capacity to stand on his own, the capacity to act out of his own being (
                  autexousia).¹ When God gives, he gives because he wants to share his giving. In fact, it would not be a real giving if God did not allow the concrete singular being to participate in his capacity to give, in his own freedom. The divine creating act goes so far that Aquinas claims that the human person is the cause of himself.² Gregory<br>

To assert that the questions at the heart of Bonhoeffer’s thinking and witness are inherently matters of reflective Christianembodimentin the world may seem so clear as not to warrant comment; obviously humans are constituted as bodies, and anything we might say about our humanity and life together in the world must take account of that fact.<br>

  Abstract: Ever since the rise of the modern exact sciences, it has become more and more clear that the scientific mind is not bound by an exhaustive understanding of its own doings. The fact is that, while discovering the inner structure or the nexus of relations pertaining to an object, science ignores the paths that led to this structure or these relations; but these paths lie precisely at the basis of the ontological ground of the object. Husserl reflected on this legacy of the scientific revolution when he argued that “it is not always natural science that speaks when natural scientists<br>

  Abstract: Despite the fact that the Fourth Gospel was finalized in a Hellenistic setting, its cultural background and thought forms remain thoroughly Jewish.¹ Recognizing Semitic terms and syntax within the Johannine narrative provides a distinctive window into the Evangelist’s presentation of Jesus. While scholars have tended to assume with varying degrees of certainty that none of the Evangelist’s words go back to the historical Jesus, the presence of this Semitic material nonetheless requires an accounting for its origin.

The transcendent approach emphasizes the absolute other that engenders the happening: essentially the impossible horizon of the happening or the ungraspable which is always about to occur. The immanent approach insists, instead, that the event is graspable as it takes place, that it is a fact unfolding among or between its declared historical elements, a real undetermined movement of flight, what Nancy calls “thethatitself of the ‘that-it-happens.’”¹ To<br>

The death of Claude Lévi-Strauss in 2009 provides the obligation as well as the opportunity to engage in such an exercise of historical retrospect. Lévi-Strauss moved with characteristic creative aplomb across a remarkable range of potential disciplinary homes, but anthropology remained his home base, the place of comfort from which to discomfit other disciplines. The history of anthropology therefore has a particular claim to the movement he founded and popularized beyond its origins in Saussurean linguistics despite the fact that French structuralism has<br>

  Abstract: Since Europeans first encountered Native Americans, problems relating to language and text translation have been an issue. Translators needed to create the tools for translation, such as dictionaries, still a difficult undertaking today. Although the fact that many Native languages do not share even the same structures or classes of words as European languages has always made translation difficult, translating cultural values and perceptions into the idiom of another culture renders the process even more difficult.<br>

Several factors explain this fact: the socioethnic background of the author, the literary quality of the work, the nature of the sources consulted for its composition, and the fact that until late into the nineteenth century it would remain the only published text solely dedicated to the topic of Incan history.

While it is true that, in the narrator’s words, “Hirshl and Mina’s story is over,” the novel itself does not conclude with their dialogue. In fact, instead of granting the reader a sense of closure, the novel ends with the narrator’s statement that Bluma’s story isnotover. The narrator also promises the reader that “everything that happened to Bluma Nakht would fill another book.”¹ This promise, however, was never fulfilled.

  Abstract: John’s portrayal of Jesus is notable for many reasons, but one of the most intriguing is the fact that Jesus knows what is going on in other characters’ minds and hearts, while these same characters have no grasp of what is going on in his.

Although the relatively limited number and contextual information available for Bronze Age objects leaves little opportunity to consider in detail how they were perceived by their makers and wearers, they can nevertheless be used to give insights into their significance and the way in which they embodied identity<br>

The apparently unremarkable first-person narrator, chronological narrative and realist representation have all turned out to be playful subversions of these familiar narrative tropes. So too has his use of historical facts: far from adding up to a historical novel, they result in an uneasy mixture of fact and fiction which has a morally disturbing effect on the reader. This leads us to a question of classification. Modiano’s novels are not what they seem, so we know what they are not: but what exactly are they? To what subgenre<br>

In fact, since Adorno’s early works of the 1930s up to his mature works of the 1960s, nature seems to represent what has been systematically repressed in the course of civilization. Hence, if observed from a dialectical point of view and expressed in somehow Pinkfloydian terms, nature appears as something like “the dark side of the truth” (or, in a more Springsteenian fashion, the “darkness” that lies “at the edge of<br>

Thus in approaching matters aesthetic, one should have firsthand acquaintance with art objects as well as with the beauties of nature and, if possible, with artistic practice.

Using a series of examples she shows that the interaction between an Englishman and a Pole does not always go smoothly, because of the fact that differences in the formulation and interpretation of requests can lead to misunderstandings. According to Wierzbicka, two cultural values held by Poles seem to motivate certain lexico-syntactic phenomena in this type of speech acts namely cordiality and courtesy.<br>

The word connotes the remarkable fact that biological devices, or processes, appeared in the course of evolution to allow animals and people to survive on our planet. Given the complexity of natural processes, the developing and growing brain must find solutions based on simplifying principles. These solutions make it possible to process complex situations very rapidly, elegantly, and efficiently, taking past experience into account and anticipating the future.

  Abstract: Despite the intimidating sound of the word, “hermeneutics” is easily defined as the science of interpretation. You would think hermeneutics had always been a matter of interest, but in fact it’s of continuous interest only fairly recently. Aristotle did write a treatise called
                     De Interpretatione, and the Middle Ages were much concerned with interpretation, so I suppose what I’m saying in part is that the word “hermeneutics” wasn’t then available; but it’s also true that at many times the idea that there ought to be a systematic study of how we interpret things wasn’t a matter of pressing concern.<br>

  Book Title: Absorbing Perfections-Kabbalah and Interpretation<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Bloom Harold<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging discussion of Kabbalah-from the mystical trends of medieval Judaism to modern Hasidism-one of the world's foremost scholars considers different visions of the nature of the sacred text and of the methods to interpret it. Moshe Idel takes as a starting point the fact that the postbiblical Jewish world lost its geographical center with the destruction of the temple and so was left with a textual center, the Holy Book. Idel argues that a text-oriented religion produced language-centered forms of mysticism.Against this background, the author demonstrates how various Jewish mystics amplified the content of the Scriptures so as to include everything: the world, or God, for example. Thus the text becomes a major realm for contemplation, and the interpretation of the text frequently becomes an encounter with the deepest realms of reality. Idel delineates the particular hermeneutics belonging to Jewish mysticism, investigates the progressive filling of the text with secrets and hidden levels of meaning, and considers in detail the various interpretive strategies needed to decodify the arcane dimensions of the text.<br>

  Abstract: So far we have examined the different ways in which the worlds of the sacred texts were imagined by various Jewish mystical thinkers and how they interpreted those books. In the past few chapters the emphasis has been on explicating the exegetical techniques, which offered the strong exegetes the possibility of discovering, in fact rediscovering, religious worlds that had previously been adopted by the Kabbalists, or sometimes by their philosophical sources, from a variety of relatively late intellectual and literary corpora—mostly Greek thought as translated and adapted in Arabic and, less frequently, Latin.

  Abstract: Since David Hume (1711–1776), philosophy, as well as common sense, has differentiated science from morality. Science establishes facts (“what is”), whereas morality decides “what should be,” but many admit that we cannot distinguish what should be from what is. I shall consider whether it is plausible to take an opposite, although perhaps rather surprising, approach and ask whether we can favor what should be from our knowledge about what is. In fact, such a question belongs to a long philosophical tradition, including Hume, Henri de Saint-Simon (1760–1825), Auguste Comte, Charles Darwin, and contemporary ethologists. My idea is to<br>

Or one might apply the concept of style to the work of a particular filmmaker’s oeuvre, referring, for instance, to the style of Stanley Donen or Yvonne Rainer or Theo Angelopoulos.<br>

Adolf Deissmann, Adolf von Harnack, Ernst Lohmeyer, Paul Wendland, and Karl Bornhäuser, for example, recognizing New Testament echoes of imperial language, argued that biblical authors used political terms and images drawn from the imperial cult to oppose persecuting emperors and a hostile empire.² Contemporary exegetes largely<br>

  Book Title: Faces of Displacement-The Writings of Volodymyr Vynnychenko<br>

  Author(s): SOROKA MYKOLA<br>
  Abstract: "Whom do our people read? Vynnychenko. Whom do people talk about if it concerns literature? Vynnychenko. Whom do they buy? Again, Vynnychenko." So wrote Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky about the young Volodymyr Vynnychenko. An innovative and provocative writer, Vynnychenko was also a charismatic revolutionary and politician who responded to the dramatic upheavals of the first half of the twentieth century by challenging old values and bringing forward new ideas about human relationships. Despite his inseparable association with Ukraine, what is often overlooked is the fact that Vynnychenko wrote the majority of his works outside his native land following his flight from Tsarist and Soviet tyranny. In this ground-breaking study, Mykola Soroka draws on contemporary theories of displacement to show how Vynnychenko's expatriate status determined his worldview, his choice of literary devices, and his attitudes toward his homeland and hostlands. Soroka considers concepts of identity to study the intertwined experiences of the writer - as an exile, émigré, expatriate, traveler, and nomad - and to demonstrate how these experiences invigorated his art and left a lasting impact on his work. The first book-length study in English on Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Faces of Displacement is an insightful examination of an exiled writer that sheds new light on the challenges faced by the displaced.<br>

Vision came to be systematically understood as an act conditioned by culture, social class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, and geography.

  Abstract: Divination and Human Naturecasts a new perspective on the rich tradition of ancient divination-the reading of divine signs in oracles, omens, and dreams. Popular attitudes during classical antiquity saw these readings as signs from the gods while modern scholars have treated such beliefs as primitive superstitions. In this book, Peter Struck reveals instead that such phenomena provoked an entirely different accounting from the ancient philosophers. These philosophers produced subtle studies into what was an odd but observable fact-that humans could sometimes have uncanny insights-and their work signifies an early chapter in the cognitive history of intuition.<br>

  Abstract: Other than the time between the two World Wars, democracy has been a remarkable success after World War II. From 1918 through 1939, after the progression of democratic tendencies in the beginning of the 1920s, most countries in Europe gradually returned to autocratic, even fascist regimes. Today it is a fact that democracy is deeply rooted in Western European countries and all communist regimes in the eastern half of Europe have failed. Some countries, in that region, though, are on their way to democracy, and in other countries democratic governments are trying their first steps, which turn out to be<br>

  Book Title: The Imaginary Revolution-Parisian Students and Workers in 1968<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Seidman Michael<br>
  Abstract: The events of 1968 have been seen as a decisive turning point in the Western world. The author takes a critical look at "May 1968" and questions whether the events were in fact as "revolutionary" as French and foreign commentators have indicated. He concludes the student movement changed little that had not already been challenged and altered in the late fifties and early sixties. The workers' strikes led to fewer working hours and higher wages, but these reforms reflected the secular demands of the French labor movement. "May 1968" was remarkable not because of the actual transformations it wrought but rather by virtue of the revolutionary power that much of the media and most scholars have attributed to it and which turned it into a symbol of a youthful, renewed, and freer society in France and beyond.<br>

  Abstract: Wage earners took advantage of the momentary weakness of state power in the middle of May to initiate the largest strike wave in French history. The fact that student radicals looked to workers to make the revolution was less important in sparking strikes than the divisions among political elites. What has been called the “political opportunity structure” encouraged the extension of the unrest to wage earners.¹ Even some members of the Gaullist majority wavered in support for the government. As in 1789, 1848, and 1871, cleavages within ruling groups promoted popular revolt. Both student and worker actions were parts of<br>

  Abstract: The genres of autobiographical writing and utopian writing have little in common. While an autobiography is an account of the life of an individual written by that individual, utopian narrative offers a vision of an ideal place and social system for a collective. In fact, according to Robert F. Sayre, autobiography and utopia indicate polarities: between experience and prophecy, self and society, private and public or emotional unity and rational order (Sayre 1972, 21, 23). Both forms have firmly marked their presence in the culture and history of Australia. Autobiography, as Joy Hooton writes, has always been a prolific genre<br>

  Author(s): KITCHENER RICHARD F.<br>
  Abstract: Best known as a child psychologist, Jean Piaget considered himself primarily an epistemologist who was engaged in empirical research on the development of knowledge. In this book, philosopher and psychologist Richard F. Kitchener provides the first comprehensive study in English of Piaget's genetic epistemology, or his theory of knowledge. Drawing largely on a careful perusal of Piaget's untranslated works, Kitchener presents little-known aspects of Piaget's thought and argues that, in fact, Piagest has been misunderstood and was completely justified in his claim to be an epistemologist rather than a psychologist.<br>

How is it possible, for example, for the necessary truths contained in logic and mathematics to result from the contingent ones the child first encounters?¹ How is it possible for the epistemic objectivity of adulthood to develop from the subjectivity and egocentrism of childhood? How is it possible for objective social structures, containing properties ofjustice, fairness, and reciprocity, to develop from individual behavior patterns lacking these features?

Untethered words wander around aimlessly, whence we get our concept of ambiguity or the waywardness of discourse. However, the tying down of one’s words is not easy. In fact, sometimes Socrates makes it sound like the question is all that can be justifiably put into words.

  Book Title: Return from Exile - Rückkehr aus dem Exil-Exiles, Returnees and Their Impact in the Humanities and Social Sciences in Austria and Central Europe<br>
  Publisher: Verlag der österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften<br>
  Author(s): PRISCHING MANFRED<br>
  Abstract: The tremendous loss to the humanities and social sciences in the 20th century resulting from the expulsion of thousands of scholars and artists from Austria and Central Europe has been well documented. The present collection of articles deals with a related but under-researched aspect – it combines analyses of the complex bureaucratic and the ideological obstacles which exiled scholars from a wide range of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences and creative artists faced when they were willing to return and specific essays documenting the varying opportunities for individual returnees to influence the development of their different disciplines after the end of the Nazi tyranny. The 27 essays highlight the roles of a number of returnees as generous mentors for younger scholars and their encouragement of modernization and internationalization in an atmosphere of stagnation and provincialism in the universities. Eminent experts in history, philosophy or political science who had returned were hampered by the denial of full academic appointments despite their highly stimulating initiatives, while theatre directors had a relatively strong impact on the programs in the theaters and the other media. The volume also illustrates personal factors, including the understandable hesitation of prominent intellectuals such as Oskar Morgenstern or Ernst Krenek to give up the advantages of US American citizenship for academic positions, especially in a country exposed to political threats in the Cold War; but the essays also bring out the fact that quite a few of the émigrés remained exiles on both sides of the Atlantic. A particular strength of the volume is the detailed consideration of the fortunes and the influence of the impressive array of exiled Austrian economists. Many of them returned from Britain, helping to shape economic theory and Austrian economic policy, even though necessarily mainly from outside the universities, while transatlantic exiles largely remain~<br>

To repeat, aesthetic imagination and literature especially have been regarded with doubt, in fact with hostility, by all kinds of regimes and systems over the centuries, from Mediterranean antiquity and the Middle Ages to “bourgeois” and democratic states, not excluding self-censorship and “political correctness,” and certainly the great totalitarian systems of the twentieth century. All were severe in their attempt to eradicate or at least to marginalize aesthetic imagination and to rein in literature. Why<br>

  Author(s) Schmitz Kenneth L.<br>
  Abstract: The ontological examination of being as gift undertaken so far appears to be too anthropologically burdened to allow for a concept of absolute gift. In fact, if being-gift is being-given and being-in-debt, then it does not seem possible to formulate a concept of gift which, while remaining one, is nonetheless able to embrace the similarities and the differences between the being-given proper, on the one hand, to the human spirit and, on the other, to absolute spirit. Nevertheless, only if the latter is gift can Bruaire validly argue that gift is the metaphysical name for being—and not merely its<br>

  Author(s) BURGESS J. PETER<br>
  Abstract: During the Middle Ages, traditions of blood feud, desires for conquest and power, and even the chivalric code of honor intensified the frequency and legitimacy of war. Yet war as an inescapable fact of life does not diminish the desire for peace; in fact it may intensify our human sense of its value. Because conflict was so terribly damaging to land and lives in medieval Europe, ensuring peace often meant controlling war, or at least some of the negative and destructive by-products of the seemingly interminable hostilities. Consequently, the desire for peace in the Middle Ages was intimately related to<br>

The governing elites, both the warrior nobility and the bishops themselves, accepted the hieratic vision of a sacred kingdom and the holy purposes of the Carolingian state, a fact that embittered every conflict.

Despite the fact that the dramatist’s writings for the stage clearly flout conventional Lopean parameters, it is not indicative of a theatre which is deficient or inferior. Rather, Cervantes constructs an aesthetic which permits free expression of seditious voices and an alternative stage for those discourses normally quashed by prevailing dramatic monopoly.

  Abstract: At the dawn of Western civilization (so called), we find two conceptions of citizenship: one Greek, arising in Athens, and the other Christian, inspired by Jerusalem. The first conception of citizenship, usually associated with Aristotle, is that of membership in a polis, or city-state (with Aristotle holding that such membership is “natural” for, or constitutive of, human beings). The second conception, most prominently formulated by Saint Augustine, assumes a duality of membership: that is, membership in the earthly city (

His landmark science fiction film does not attempt to free us somehow from our five senses, certainly.

This movement, however, has also been answered with renewed versions of the traditional functionalist and behaviorist rejections of the study of consciousness as anything other than an incidental by-product of computational capacity (Dennett, 1991). Consciousness is seen as private and hence outside scientific scrutiny, confabulated and deluded in its pretended access to cognitive process, and ultimately nonfunctional.

Unfortunately, data about analyses adequate for research purposes are difficult to obtain, and much of the data that are available have been so transformed in the process of reduction that investigators cannot be sure of their meaning. The very fact that the data were collected may so affect the analytic process that the data do not adequately represent ordinary psychoanalytic work. Analysts who are willing to collect detailed data about their work may be highly atypical in other ways. Data that appear in published reports are usually chosen because they<br>

  Author(s) Stanley Christopher D.<br>
  Abstract: Much of the discussion about the apostle Paul’s “respect for context” has assumed that the meaning of the Old Testament text is relatively clear. In this model, the task of the scholar is to evaluate the proximity or lack of proximity between Paul’s interpretations and the original meaning of the texts. By drawing on the concept of latent meaning, Mitchell Kim has drawn our attention to the fact that the original meanings are far from clear. It is a common experience that people “say more than they know,” so that hindsight can lead to an acknowledgment of “that’s what I<br>

  Abstract: The word “ethics” does not appear in biblical Hebrew. Of course, this does not mean that there were no assumptions about the nature of morality in ancient Israel. This fact has been recognized, yet up to now, scholarly discussions on ethics in the Hebrew Bible have been primarily concerned with what philosophers call

  Abstract: In Canada, it appears that biblical scholars do not often avail themselves of the opportunity to reflect on how their political, historical, and social contexts impact their work on the Bible.¹ This does not mean that Canadian biblical scholarship is not “engaged”; rather, I suspect that it has more to do with a perception that there is not much about biblical studies in this country that marks it as distinct—as any different, say, from American biblical studies in general.² In fact, the reluctance to think about what makes biblical studies in this country

Supposing a case, then, must mean thinking in the subjunctive mood: imagining scenarios, developing hypotheses, speculating that “if this were the case,” or “in that case,” or even “in any case….” But “case” also has another meaning: a crime that requires investigation.¹ Indeed, the best way to solve such a case, according<br>

  Abstract: Postmodern and post-colonial discourses have praised hybridity and ambivalence as enriching traces of identity-building in our age of multidirectional migrations as if only travelling between and across cultures through transnational dislocations could provide the experience of developing diasporic, hyphenated or deterritorialised identities. But some authors are beginning to challenge what may be too narrow a perspective of the social conditions from which such identities can spring. The Portuguese sociologist Santos recently highlighted the fact that since its inception Portuguese colonialism has always been an experience of ambivalence and hybridity in the relationship it promoted between the coloniser and the colonised.<br>

  Book Title: The Machine Question-Critical Perspectives on AI, Robots, and Ethics<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Gunkel David J.<br>
  Abstract: One of the enduring concerns of moral philosophy is deciding who or what is deserving of ethical consideration. Much recent attention has been devoted to the "animal question" -- consideration of the moral status of nonhuman animals. In this book, David Gunkel takes up the "machine question": whether and to what extent intelligent and autonomous machines of our own making can be considered to have legitimate moral responsibilities and any legitimate claim to moral consideration. The machine question poses a fundamental challenge to moral thinking, questioning the traditional philosophical conceptualization of technology as a tool or instrument to be used by human agents. Gunkel begins by addressing the question of machine moral agency: whether a machine might be considered a legitimate moral agent that could be held responsible for decisions and actions. He then approaches the machine question from the other side, considering whether a machine might be a moral patient due legitimate moral consideration. Finally, Gunkel considers some recent innovations in moral philosophy and critical theory that complicate the machine question, deconstructing the binary agent--patient opposition itself. Technological advances may prompt us to wonder if the science fiction of computers and robots whose actions affect their human companions (think of HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey) could become science fact. Gunkel's argument promises to influence future considerations of ethics, ourselves, and the other entities who inhabit this world.<br>

  Abstract: After Representation?explores one of the major issues in Holocaust studiesùthe intersection of memory and ethics in artistic expression, particularly within literature.As experts in the study of literature and culture, the scholars in this collection examine the shifting cultural contexts for Holocaust representation and reveal how writersùwhether they write as witnesses to the Holocaust or at an imaginative distance from the Nazi genocideùarticulate the shadowy borderline between fact and fiction, between event and expression, and between the condition of life endured in atrocity and the hope of a meaningful existence. What imaginative literature brings to the study of the Holocaust is an ability to test the limits of language and its conventions.After Representation?moves beyond the suspicion of representation and explores the changing meaning of the Holocaust for different generations, audiences, and contexts.<br>

  Book Title: Imprints, Voiceprints, and Footprints of Memory-Collected Essays of Werner H. Kelber<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Kelber Werner H.<br>
  Abstract: Jesus and his followers defined their allegiances and expressed their identities in a communications culture that manifested itself in voice and chirographic practices, in oral-scribal interfaces, and in performative activities rooted in memory. In the sixteen essays gathered in Imprints, Voiceprints, and Footprints of Memory, Werner Kelber explores the verbal arts of early Christian word processing operative in a media world that was separated by two millennia from our contemporary media history. The title articulates the fact that the ancient culture of voiced texts, hand-copying, and remembering is chiefly accessible to us in print format and predominantly assimilated from print perspectives. The oral-scribal-memorial-performative paradigm developed in these essays challenges the reigning historical-critical model in biblical scholarship. Notions of tradition, the fixation on the single original saying, the dominant methodology of form criticism, and the heroic labors of the Quest—stalwart features of the historical, documentary paradigm—are all subject to a critical review. A number of essays reach beyond New Testament texts, ranging from the pre-Socratic Gorgias through medieval manuscript culture on to print’s triumphant apotheosis in Gutenberg’s Vulgate, product of the high tech of the fifteenth century, all the way to conflicting commemorations of Auschwitz—taking tentative steps toward a history of media technologies, culture, and cognition of the Christian tradition in the West.<br>

I continue to view it as a puzzle that admits of no simple or general answer.

We can see the role of political temporality in sweeping historical narratives, such as those a nation tells itself about its founding moment and subsequent arc of development, an arc that almost always legitimizes the status of the contemporary social and political order. We can see it in more quotidian forms such as the calendars that organize people’s lives and in so doing habituate citizens into annual practices of remembrance, memorialization, and obligation.

  Abstract: My experience tells me something quite different from the texts and dances of classicism and metaphysical dualism—that our transcendence is not won at the expense of flesh and body, nor is mind higher than matter: mater, matron, matrix, mother, the land. Rather, we pierce reality through the body, and we transcend downward as well as upward. The “descendental,” a word we do not use as much as its “transcendental” opposite, is that which descends to the matter-of-fact.¹<br>

  The Modiano Novel from:

  Abstract: We have now seen numerous instances of Modiano at his most subversive. The apparently unremarkable first-person narrator, chronological narrative and realist representation have all turned out to be postmodern subversions of these familiar narrative tropes. So too has his use of historical facts: far from adding up to a historical novel, they result in an uneasy mixture of fact and fiction which has a morally disturbing effect on the reader. This leads us to a question of classification. Modiano’s novels are not what they seem, so we know what they are not: but what exactly are they? To what subgenre<br>

  Abstract: When I consider all the unsolicited emails I receive every day, it seems to me that there are two main values for our contemporaries, money and sex, both quite everyday things. Now the world does not, of course, consist solely of spam, but on a somewhat higher level, in the case of professional and economic success measured in monetary terms, and in the case of love, we are in fact dealing with core values of Western culture and society. But they are so normal and everyday that they are scarcely perceived as values that function as guides to action.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjd80">American Creoles</a><br>
  Author(s) Lahens Yanick<br>
  Abstract: Édouard Glissant’s writing is deeply rooted in a strategy that challenges a hegemonic form of language use,¹ as described in detail by Celia Britton, with particular reference to his essays and novels (Britton, 1999). Miles Davis’s music, too, can be interpreted as a counter-discourse. The literature of the Caribbean and jazz music in the United States belong in fact to areas of cultural activity which have comparable histories despite their dissimilarities. A comparative approach to Glissant’s writing and the trumpet player’s improvisations can therefore allow us to reflect on the connections between strategies of resistance and, on the other hand,<br>

  Book Title: The Poetry of Saying-British Poetry and its Discontents, 1950-2000<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): SHEPPARD ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: In The Poetry of Saying Robert Sheppard explores an array of ‘experimental’ writers and styles of writing many of which have never secured a large audience in Britain, but which are often fascinatingly innovative. As a published poet in this tradition, Sheppard provides a detailed and thought provoking account of the development of the British poetry movement from the 1950s. As well as analysing the work of individual poets such as Roy Fisher, Lee Harwood and Tom Raworth The Poetry of Saying also examines the influence of the Poetry Society and poetry magazines on the evolution of British poetry throughout this period. The overriding virtue of the poetry of this period is its diversity, a fact that Sheppard has not ignored. As well as providing a fascinating into the work of these poets, The Poetry of Saying offers an ‘insider’s’ commentary on the social, political and historical background during this exciting period in British poetry.<br>

  Abstract: Many humanities and social science scholars today are committed to, or at any rate, pay lip service to ideals of interdisciplinarity and methodological cross-fertilization. In light of this fact, it is remarkable that there should be so little dialogue between historians of philosophy (including those who study political and religious philosophy) and intellectual historians, particularly with respect to study of ‘non-Western’ thought systems or world views. A common tendency among intellectual historians today is to reduce history of philosophy to a minor province of philosophical hermeneutics. The increasingly ahistorical philosophical hermeneuticists, in turn, usually prioritize exposition and internal analysis of<br>

For this reason it is of great importance that there are public spaces where we encounter these “others”, are confronted by them and must relate to them.

For Unamuno, reason alone can provide only intellectual, not emotive or spiritual, fulfillment: “el más trágico problema de la filosofía es el de conciliar las necesidades intelectuales con las necesidades afectivas y con las volitivas”

Her relationship to Jesus was unusual and out of line within the context of Carmelite spiritual practice. She saw Jesus as a Jew before Christian theologians took this fact seriously, but her mystical marriage to him reveals that she advanced in her interior life an unambiguous supersessionism that demands the replacement of Judaism with Christianity.

Everwine writes with the same 'deified heart' that divines the mystery of his quotidian subjects in a language that is at once plain and poetic.

  Abstract: I wouldn’t have thought of attempting a self-account of my own if it were not for the fact that, having attended to those of others, it would be unseemly simply to walk away. These nine people have proffered generous and intimate acts of self-disclosure, and, having heard them out and having commented on them, it seems a bit like the room has grown quiet and at least some eyes now turn toward me, as though, going around the circle, it is my turn. Isn’t it unseemly to receive the confidences of others without responding in kind?<br>

  Abstract: In a penetrating inquiry into the history of modern prison reform, the late Norval Morris, a legal scholar at the University of Chicago, asked us to confront the question of why prison conditions merit a society’s most serious consideration. Part of the answer, said Morris, “is to be found in the fact that the criminal justice system exercises the greatest power that a state can legally use against its citizens.” Consequently, the treatment of convicted criminals discloses the functioning norms of human decency and fairness, the protections of citizenship, and the restraints on the exercise of force that pervade the<br>

  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>

  Abstract: Radović ultimately argues for the power of literary imagination to contest the limitations of geopolitical boundaries by emphasizing space and place as fundamental to our understanding of social and political identity. The physical places described in these texts crystallize the protagonists' ambiguous and complex relationship to the New World. Space is, then, as the author shows, both a political fact and a powerful metaphor whose imaginary potential continually challenges its material limitations.<br>

Gershom Scholem’s classic essay “Redemption through Sin” remains one of the most influential essays written not only in Jewish Studies but in the History of Religions more generally.¹ It was a tour de force, serving at once as programmatic seed, historiographic manifesto, research agenda, and transvaluational breakthrough.

  Abstract: Could World War I have been averted if Franz Ferdinand and his wife hadn't been murdered by Serbian nationalists in 1914? What if Ronald Reagan had been killed by Hinckley's bullet? Would the Cold War have ended as it did? In
      Forbidden Fruit, Richard Ned Lebow develops protocols for conducting robust counterfactual thought experiments and uses them to probe the causes and contingency of transformative international developments like World War I and the end of the Cold War. He uses experiments, surveys, and a short story to explore why policymakers, historians, and international relations scholars are so resistant to the contingency and indeterminism inherent in open-ended, nonlinear systems. Most controversially, Lebow argues that the difference between counterfactual and so-called factual arguments is misleading, as both can be evidence-rich and logically persuasive. A must-read for social scientists,Forbidden Fruitalso examines the binary between fact and fiction and the use of counterfactuals in fictional works like Philip Roth'sThe Plot Against Americato understand complex causation and its implications for who we are and what we think makes the social world work.<br>

  Book Title: Touching the World-Reference in Autobiography<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): EAKIN PAUL JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Paul John Eakin's earlier work Fictions in Autobiography is a key text in autobiography studies. In it he proposed that the self that finds expression in autobiography is in fundamental ways a kind of fictive construct, a fiction articulated in a fiction. In this new book Eakin turns his attention to what he sees as the defining assumption of autobiography: that the story of the self does refer to a world of biographical and historical fact. Here he shows that people write autobiography not in some private realm of the autonomous self but rather in strenuous engagement with the pressures that life in culture entails. In so demonstrating, he offers fresh readings of autobiographies by Roland Barthes, Nathalie Sarraute, William Maxwell, Henry James, Ronald Fraser, Richard Rodriguez, Henry Adams, Patricia Hampl, John Updike, James McConkey, and Lillian Hellman. In the introduction Eakin makes a case for reopening the file on reference in autobiography, and in the first chapter he establishes the complexity of the referential aesthetic of the genre, the intricate interplay of fact and fiction in such texts. In subsequent chapters he explores some of the major contexts of reference in autobiography: the biographical, the social and cultural, the historical, and finally, underlying all the rest, the somatic and temporal dimensions of the lived experience of identity. In his discussion of contemporary theories of the self, Eakin draws especially on cultural anthropology and developmental psychology.<br>

In reality Darwin’s “theory” of evolution was a whole bundle of theories, and it is impossible to discuss Darwin’s evolutionary thought constructively if one does not distinguish the various components of which it consists. But quite aside from the fact that it helps understanding of the structure of evolutionary theory, to carry the analysis to the level of the subtheories Darwin adopted, it is important to call attention to the composite nature of the Darwinian theory for three very<br>

  Abstract: Adopting any model of literary interpretation plunges one at once into enormously involved philosophical problems. I have provisionally put forward a model on Heideggerian lines. But the model is Heideggerian
                  onlyin that it accepts Heidegger’s crucial notion that interpretation is a making-explicit of what is already grasped (“understood”), but not fully articulated, in our encounters with literary works. What concerns me here is something I have previously mentioned in passing—namely, the fact that a Heideggerian model might seem to lead inevitably to a strict relativism, and, therefore, to the conclusion that knowledge in the human studies is impossible.<br>

                  The Adventures of the Dialectiche repeats once again the litany of requirements that he places on truly political thought: it begins with a probabilistic reading of events, it needs a philosophy of history, it treats people statistically, it aims at success (AD 239, 9, 226, 251, tr. 163, 3, 154, 172). Chastising Sartre for his notion of “pure action,” Merleau-Ponty reminds him that political actors cannot use the fact that history is “overflowing with meaning” to justify an arbitrary perspective<br>

But home meant not only the city of Philadelphia or America, which, after all, has always been more a conceptual space than an actual geographical location; home in late summer of 1788 also included the recently constituted and ratified United States of America.

Until the seventeenth century in Europe, and even later in China, India, and the Near East, thought, especially within high intellectual traditions, was primarily exegetical in character and expression.

  Author(s): Morrison Karl F.<br>
  Abstract: Twelfth-century writers assimilated and transformed a tradition of the conceptual unity of all the arts and attributed that unity to the fact that art both conceals and discloses. Recovering that tradition, especially the methods and motives of concealment, provides extraordinary insights into twelfth-century ideas about the kingdom of God, the status of women, and the nature of time itself. It also identifies a strain in European thought that had striking affinities to methods of perception familiar in Oriental religions and that proved to be antithetic to later humanist traditions in the West.<br>

In this way, no text (indeed, no system of signification) can purport to be the one unique text, the text that could, through its own unity, lead us towards a unified totality. The notion of a unified literary tradition in which a singular voice could take on the value of the whole is therefore constantly dissolved in the multiplicity of voices that tradition is constituted by.

In a work which is replete with exaggeration couched in poetic, figurative, and metaphoric language, one fact might easily be overlooked. Nietzsche is making this claim literally and takes this claim very seriously: “Body am I entirely.” Within the context ofZarathustra, a book which is addressed to “all or no one,” Nietzsche attempts to persuade those few who are capable of actualizing<br>

  Abstract: “The last Kantian in Nazi Germany”: this is how Emmanuel Levinas (1990b, 153) describes “Bobby,” the dog who befriends him during his “long captivity” in a slave-labour camp. Thirty years after the fact, Levinas briefly tells the story of his terrible days in Camp 1492, days whose numbing inhumanity is momentarily relieved by the arrival of an animal that offers a semblance of respect. I say “semblance” because Levinas’s experience of Bobby is informed by conventional assumptions about animality that make it impossible for him straightforwardly to attribute dutifulness to a creature that is not human.

They seem to be ritual forms, and at the same time, to be something more, even opposed to ritual action. The urgency and personal quality of these forms of devotional practice lead, sometimes, to readings of them as transparent statements of fact. Conversion narrative, for example, is both clearly a form of devotional practice and also “real,” compelling as autobiography and a source of information about practitioners’ lives.

  Abstract: The aim of this book has been to historicize and understand French cinema’s exploration of the road movie. As I suggested in my introduction, this is not a straightforward task. As the road movie is dif-fi cult to identify in culturally specific terms, and is therefore always a genre in search of its identity, a French road movie is engaged in a constant negotiation of its own physical and conceptual boundaries. In fact, as I hope to have shown, analysing the ‘French road movie’ ultimately begs the question of its ‘French-ness’. If the road movie, to an extent, resists being<br>

  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: Rhetoric has its own definitions for terms, not to say concepts, that often crop up, as if by themselves, in other disciplines. In fact, one of the enduring features of rhetoric is, as Aristotle would have it, that it is a “technique” that cannot aspire to be a science because it does not have an object of its own. Rhetoric is by essence latitudinarian and the price to be paid is that of being pillaged by the human sciences, which own their objects, or believe that they do. Rhetoric has many Others. It is a way to preserve what has<br>

  Working-Class Boys and Street Violence in Southeast London from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qddtx">Young Men in Uncertain Times</a><br>

  Abstract: With few exceptions in academic literature concerning violence in Northern Ireland (Bell 1990; Jenkins 1983; Roche 2008; Roche 2007; Roche 2005a; Roche 2003), young people and their violent interplay have not held much appeal for social scientists. This is so even despite the fact that throughout urban, enclaved, and economically deprived working-class housing areas in Northern Ireland, young people, and particularly young men, are reported as consistently participating in “low-level” violent activities. While no formal definition of this notion of “low-level” violence exists, its use in the Northern Irish context is widespread. Thoughts vary on the origin of the expression<br>

The pantomime had in fact been commissioned by Tairov so that the season in which it was performed would have at least one pantomime, given the contemporary interest in nonverbal drama.

That his verses had disappeared (or –horribile dictu– been cancelled) from Sura 53 ‘The Star’ of theQur’ândoes not take away from the fact that they had been ‘there’. Muhammad was their mental receiver and scribe, unaware of their being inspired by the devil and not, as usual, by Gibreel. Their actual absence only bears witness to their one-time presence.

  Book Title: Medieval Manuscripts in Transition-Tradition and Creative Recycling<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): VERBEKE Werner<br>
  Abstract: Manuscripts constitute the source material par excellence for diverse academic disciplines. Art historians, philologists, historians, theologians, philosophers, book historians and even jurists encounter one another around the codex. The fact that such an encounter can be extremely fertile was demonstrated, during an international congress in Brussels on November 5-9, 2002. A record of the discussions can be found in this volume of the Mediaevalia Lovaniensia. The editors selected those lectures that focused on the historical, literary-historical, philosophical and theological aspects of the congress theme as opposed to those with an explicit art-historical perspective. The common thread, however, is always the codicological aspect: what can the study of manuscripts contribute to the literary-historical interpretation or the insight into the functioning of a text in its original context. The various contributions testify to a fearless and unrestrained interdisciplinary approach to the material. The subjects broached cover a broad domain: from the development of classical themes to the transmission of lyrical models, from visual material giving evidence of the reception of literary texts to the artes-literature used as a vehicle for a love story.<br>

  Abstract: The sources responsible for the expansion and transformation of the law and economics movement of the 1970s and 1980s have never been adequately explained. One fact remains clear: this movement coincided with the rise of interdisciplinary legal studies and the growing disenchantment with the legal process and fundamental rights schools. In the midst of the disintegration of and disillusionment with mainstream jurisprudence, legal scholars looked outside law to economics for law’s missing authority and the autonomy of legal discourse. Of all the social sciences, economics was the most promising candidate offering “right answers” for law’s problems.<br>

  Abstract: Philosophers of science have a long tradition of making a connection between explanation and understanding, but only lately have they started to give the latter notion a substantial role in their theories. The reason is because understanding is an even more difficult notion than explanation. To my mind, the recent interest in understanding (exemplified by this volume), springs from the fact that explanation is a cognitive activity, and for too long theories of explanation have dismissed the cognitive dimension with the weak excuse of its being a too “subjective” ingredient for a theory of

  Book Title: Liberalism at Its Limits-Crime and Terror in the Latin American Cultural Text<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): RODRÍGUEZ ILEANA<br>
  Abstract: In
      Liberalism at Its Limits,Ileana Rodríguez considers several Latin American nations that govern under the name of liberalism yet display a shocking range of nondemocratic features. In her political, cultural, and philosophical analysis, she examines these environments in which liberalism seems to have reached its limits, as the universalizing project gives way to rampant nonstate violence, gross inequality, and neocolonialism.Focusing on Guatemala, Colombia, and Mexico, Rodríguez shows how standard liberal models fail to account for new forms of violence and exploitation, which in fact follow from specific clashes between liberal ideology and local practice. Looking at these tensions within the ostensibly well-ordered state, Rodríguez exposes how the misunderstanding and misuse of liberal principles are behind realities of political turmoil, and questions whether liberalism is in fact an ideology sufficient to empower populations and transition nation-states into democratic roles in the global order.In this way,Liberalism at Its Limitsoffers a critical examination of the forced fitting of liberal models to Latin American nations and reasserts cross-cultural communication as crucial to grasping the true link between varying systems of value and politics.<br>

The fact that Humphreys made a practice of using classical myth in a variety of narrative techniques in his fiction before he began to use Celtic myths predominantly does not prevent his use of indigenous myth being considered as a deliberately anti-imperial strategy. ‘The Land of the Living’ sequence is perhaps the best, certainly the most complex, example of his use of a variety of tales from

  Abstract: All the existentialists are united in their opposition to idealist philosophies which ignore space and time as necessary conditions of the human existence. In no way is the finiteness of the human creature more evident than in the fact that he must live an earthly existence, and, since things in time have a beginning and an end, that he must be subject to the mysteries of birth and death. Ignoring these fundamental facts, the idealists sought to transcend the time process by rational system and they imposed a rational pattern upon the course of historical events. In other words, they<br>

Rather, it aimed at prompting new interest for, and innovative academic perspectives on, the manifold significations of independent documentary production today.¹ Besides demonstrating the complexity, variability, pragmatism and paradoxes that this notion of ‘independent’ documentary entails, this collection of case studies also endeavoured to reveal important similarities among different practitioners in the field.

  Abstract: Behind this playful, exuberant image,¹ celebrating Lady Ottoline Morrell and her court at Garsington, lie complex emotions. At an early age, Dorothy Brett had suffered from hearing problems. It first became noticeable while she was a student at the Slade School of Art, then, as now, part of University College, London. The Provost of this prestigious institution, horrified by the fact that Brett and two friends had chosen to picnic on the hallowed lawn inside the courtyard, delivered a severe reprimand. ‘I’m sorry, I’m deaf,’ Brett replied, ‘I haven’t been able to hear a word you said.’²<br>

  Abstract: An essential (albeit controversial) point should immediately be made clear: the work of Angelopoulos is not ‘modernist’ in the sense that Anglo-Saxon critics have given to this term to qualify, in art history, a time past, but still belonging to modernity.¹ From end to end, Angelopoulos’ work is, in fact, traversed by history. Yet modernity is defined precisely by our awareness of unsurpassable historicity. In the words of Jacques Rancière, we have entered into the ‘ age of history’. He adds that it is also the ‘age of cinema’, as this late art possesses a singular power of ‘historicity and<br>

Moreover, the connotations of the term within each of these areas are multiple, complicated and contested. It is thus not easy to define the term or to determine the nature of the phenomenon that the term describes.

  Abstract: Historians have often treated the introduction of women’s suffrage as a narrative of linear progress. In this view, women’s exclusion from the suffrage resulted from ageold prejudices, which, gradually and inevitably, gave way to modern egalitarian ideas. Recent scholarship, however, has complicated this story by emphasising the intractability of the issue. Enlightenment and republican discourse talked in universal terms, but constructed the citizen as public man in opposition to private woman, creating a feminine ‘other’ in order to create a ‘universal’, which was in fact gendered, masculine (Sowerwine 2010: 19).

  Abstract: The literary, however identified, may be said to include many examples of non-fiction, including works of journalism. Given the reporter’s quasi-objective relationship to history, the journalistic article was in some ways seen as a model for much literature in the 1930s, with a writer such as George Orwell specialising equally in fiction, essay-writing and reportage, and a novelist such as Christopher Isherwood fashioning himself in fiction as a news camera ‘recording, not thinking’.² Newspaper articles are, in fact, defined by their place of publication rather than their content, but there are certain likely formal characteristics or principles of journalistic writing<br>

It is easy to state that the mind is shaped wholly by a combination of neurophysical parameters and social experience, but the very fact that one feels so resistant to this idea shows the merits of deeper examination.

Arguably, alienated from their own acts of creation, cultural producers have reified their own constructions, believing likewise that these reflect a sacred essence of ‘natural beauty’. Icons abound.

Whereas John Everett Millais, Nikolai Ge, and Édouard Manet broke with long-standing iconographic traditions, portraits of Jesus in fiction from the same time period were innovative, in large part, by the fact of their existence. Extended literary portraits are not a common feature of premodern imaginative retellings of gospel narrative. The life of Jesus, as the canonical gospels suggest, need not accommodate descriptions of the Christ image. In the 1830s and 1840s, authors of fiction began hesitantly to describe the body of Jesus thanks<br>

  Abstract: Petrarchism is not a monolith, but an endless series of refractions.

  Abstract: In approaching Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) philosophically, one immediately runs into the oldest and most cherished conundrum with respect to female philosophers. It appears to be the case that many female thinkers whose work might be deemed to be philosophical wrote in styles that were somewhat nonstandard, even for their respective times. Thus, arguments have frequently been made that such women are absent from the canon because of the fact that their work was demonstrably nonphilosophical, rather than due to their sex.

Nationalism as a mass movement, Hobsbawm indicates, is a final stage, coming after the formation of a state.

  Book Title: Modernist Commitments-Ethics, Politics, and Transnational Modernism<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Berman Jessica<br>
  Abstract: Jessica Berman demonstrates how modernist narrative connects ethical attitudes and responsibilities to the active creation of political relationships and the way we imagine justice. She challenges divisions between "modernist" and "committed" writing, arguing that a continuum of political engagement undergirds modernisms worldwide and that it is strengthened rather than hindered by formal experimentation. In addition to making the case for a transnational model of modernism, Berman shows how modernism's play with formal matters, its challenge to the boundaries between fact and fiction, its incorporation of vernacular and folkways, and its engagement with embodied experience and intimacy offer not only an expanded account of modernist texts and commitments but a new way of thinking about what modernism is and can do.<br>

  Book Title: Reclaiming the Enlightenment-Toward a Politics of Radical Engagement<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRONNER STEPHEN ERIC<br>
  Abstract: This book tackles an obvious yet profound problem of modern political life: the disorientation of intellectuals and activists on the left. As the study of political history and theory has been usurped by cultural criticism, a confusion over the origins and objectives of progressive politics has been the result. Specifically, it has become fashionable for intellectuals to attack the Enlightenment for its imperialism, eurocentrism, and scientism, and for the sexism and racism of some of its major representatives. Although the fact that individual thinkers harbored such prejudices is irrefutable, Stephen Bronner argues that reducing the Enlightenment ethos to these beliefs is wholly unsustainable.<br>

Celebrating the life-giving potential of people, places, and powers that lie beyond our established worlds,

At the book's heart is the fictional story of Tom Lannon, a graduate student from Cambridge University, who remains ambivalent about pursuing a conventional life. After traveling to Sierra Leone in the aftermath of its devastating civil war, Tom meets a writer who helps him explore the possibilities of renewal. Illustrating the fact that certain aspects of human existence are common to all people regardless of culture and history,Harmattanremakes the distinction between home and world and the relationship between knowledge and life.<br>

It is a matter of “returning” to the question of representation as an explication of the relation between a subject and an object.

  Book Title: After Christianity-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): D’Isanto Luca<br>
  Abstract: When Vattimo was asked by a former teacher if he still believed in God, his reply was, "Well, I believe that I believe." This paradoxical declaration of faith serves as the foundation for a brilliant exposition on Christianity in the new millennium -- an age characterized by a deep uncertainty of opinion -- and a personal account of how Vattimo himself recovered his faith through Nietzsche and Heidegger. He first argues that secularization is in fact the fulfillment of the central Christian message, and prepares us for a new mode of Christianity. He then explains that Nietzsche's thesis concerns only the "moral god" and leaves room for the emergence of "new gods." Third, Vattimo claims that the postmodern condition of fragmentation, anti-Eurocentrism, and postcolonialism can be usefully understood in light of Joachim of Fiore's thesis concerning the "Spiritual Age" of history. Finally, Vattimo argues for the idea of "weak thought." Because philosophy in the postmetaphysical age can only acknowledge that "all is interpretation," that the "real" is always relative and not the hard and fast "truth" we once thought it to be, contemporary thought must recognize itself and its claims as "weak" as opposed to "strong" foundationalist claims of the metaphysical past. Vattimo concludes that these factors make it possible for religion and God to become a serious topic for philosophy again, and that philosophy should now formally engage religion.<br>

  Book Title: Wicked Cinema-Sex and Religion on Screen<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): Cutrara Daniel S.<br>
  Abstract: From struggles over identity politics in the 1990s to current concerns about a clash of civilizations between Islam and Christianity, culture wars play a prominent role in the twenty-first century. Movies help to define and drive these conflicts by both reflecting and shaping cultural norms, as well as showing what violates those norms. In this pathfinding book, Daniel S. Cutrara employs queer theory, cultural studies, theological studies, and film studies to investigate how cinema represents and often denigrates religion and religious believers—an issue that has received little attention in film studies, despite the fact that faith in its varied manifestations is at the heart of so many cultural conflicts today.Wicked Cinema examines films from the United States, Europe, and the Middle East, including Crimes and Misdemeanors, The Circle, Breaking the Waves, Closed Doors, Agnes of God, Priest, The Last Temptation of Christ, and Dogma. Central to all of the films is their protagonists' struggles with sexual transgression and traditional belief systems within Christianity, Judaism, or Islam—a struggle, Cutrara argues, that positions believers as the Other and magnifies the abuses of religion while ignoring its positive aspects. Uncovering a hazardous web of ideological assumptions informed by patriarchy, the spirit/flesh dichotomy, and heteronormativity, Cutrara demonstrates that ultimately these films emphasize the "Otherness" of the faithful through a variety of strategies commonly used to denigrate the queer, from erasing their existence, to using feminization to make them appear weak, to presenting them as dangerous fanatics.<br>

                  homo loquens? Where, in fact, isthere, exactly? And how often does the phonetic aftermath of a given word seem to generate its own virtual alternative as part of the serial coming-to-be not just of a verbalized world elsewhere but of a newly channeled linguistic gesture?

The fact that certain losses are entailed in the gains thus achieved, as has been earlier suggested, does not make the gains less real.

  Abstract: A book including the word “ethics” on its cover invokes, for better or for worse, a certain professional affiliation with the field of philosophy and, more specifically, the philosophical branch of ethics. This book, however, is neither written 
                  by a philosopher, nor is it, strictly speaking, written for philosophers. As a matter of fact, philosophers, especially those who professionally concern themselves with questions of ethics, will likely perceive this book to be a great disappointment. The book will disappoint professional philosophers because it conceives ethics in an extremely flexible sense as it arises out of the reading of individual texts<br>

  Abstract: In
         Paradigms for a Metaphorology, originally published in 1960 and here made available for the first time in English translation, Hans Blumenberg (1920-1996) approaches these questions by examining the relationship between metaphors and concepts. Blumenberg argues for the existence of "absolute metaphors" that cannot be translated back into conceptual language. These metaphors answer the supposedly naïve, theoretically unanswerable questions whose relevance lies quite simply in the fact that they cannot be brushed aside, since we do not pose them ourselves but find them already posed in the ground of our existence. They leap into a void that concepts are unable to fill.<br>

  Abstract: In common parlance the terms “historical interpretation” and “historical representation” are often used interchangeably. The historical text can alternatively be described as an “interpretation” or as a “representation of the past.” Nevertheless, the two terms do not have quite the same meaning. This is clear from the fact that language, either spoken or written, is the prototypical object of interpretation, whereas the object of representation is reality. Texts are interpreted, and landscapes or still lives are represented in paintings made of them. It makes no sense to speak of the “interpretation” of the landscape we see through the windows of<br>

Goethe notes that the seventeenth-century painter’s technique is impeccable, but the essay focuses on Ruisdael “as a thinking artist, even as a poet” (als denkenden Künstler, ja als Dichter).¹ “Ruysdael als Dichter” implicitly disputes the conclusions of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing’s

  Book Title: Christians and Jews in Angevin England-The York Massacre of 1190, Narratives and Contexts<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Watson Sethina<br>
  Abstract: The mass suicide and murder of the men, women and children of the Jewish community in York on 16 March 1190 is one of the most scarring events in the history of Anglo-Judaism, and an aspect of England's medieval past which is widely remembered around the world. However, the York massacre was in fact only one of a series of attacks on communities of Jews across England in 1189-90; they were violent expressions of wider new constructs of the nature of Christian and Jewish communities, and the targeted outcries of local townspeople, whose emerging urban politics were enmeshed within the swiftly developing structures of royal government. This new collection considers the massacre as central to the narrative of English and Jewish history around 1200. Its chapters broaden the contexts within which the narrative is usually considered and explore how a narrative of events in 1190 was built up, both at the time and in following years. They also focus on two main strands: the role of narrative in shaping events and their subsequent perception; and the degree of 'convivencia' between Jews and Christians and consideration of the circumstances and processes through which neighbours became enemies and victims.

  Book Title: Narratives of Identity in Alban Berg's "Lulu"-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): dos Santos Silvio J.<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the crossroads between autobiographical narrative and musical composition, this book examines Berg's transformation of Frank Wedekind's Erdgeist (1895) and Die Büchse der Pandora/ (1904) -- the plays used in the formation of the libretto for Lulu -- according to notions of gender identity, social customs, and the aesthetics of modernity in Vienna of the 1920s and 1930s. While Berg modernized several aspects of the plays by Wedekind and incorporated serial techniques of composition from Arnold Schoenberg, he never let go of the idealistic Wagnerian perspectives of his youth. In fact, he went as far as reconfiguring aspects of Richard Wagner's life as an ideal identity to be played out in the compositional process. In the process of composing the opera, Berg also reflected on the most important cultural figures in fin-de-siècle Vienna that affected his worldview, including Karl Kraus, Emil Lucka, Otto Weininger, and others. Adopting an approach that combines a systematic analysis of Berg's numerous sketches for Lulu, correspondence, and the finished work with interpretive models drawn from cultural studies and philosophy, this book elucidates the ways in which Berg grappled with his self-image as an "incorrigible romantic" (unverbesserliche Romantiker) at the end of his life, explaining aspects of his musical language that have been considered strange or anomalous in the scholarship.

  Book Title: Tragedy and the Tragic in German Literature, Art, and Thought-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Quinn Thomas P.<br>
  Abstract: The many catastrophes of German history have often been described as tragic. Consequently, German literature, music, philosophy, painting, and even architecture are rich in tragic connotations. Yet exactly what "tragedy" and "the tragic" may mean requires clarification. The poet creates a certain artful shape and trajectory for raw experience by "putting it into words"; but does putting such experience into words (or paintings or music or any other form) betray suffering by turning it into mere art? Or is it art that first turns mere suffering into tragic experience by revealing and clarifying its deepest dimension? What are we talking about, exactly, when we talk about tragic experience and tragic art, especially in an age in which, according to Hannah Arendt, evil has become banal? Does banality muffle or even annul the tragic? Does tragedy take suffering and transform it into beauty, as Schiller thought? Is it in the interest of truth for suffering to be "beautiful"? Is it possible that poetry, music, and art are important because they in fact create the meaning of suffering? Or is suffering only suffering and not accessible to meaning, tragic or otherwise? This book comprises essays that seek to clarify the meaning of tragedy and the tragic in its many German contexts, art forms, and disciplines, from literature and philosophy to music, painting, and history.

  Book Title: Love and Death in Goethe-`One and Double'<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Dye Ellis<br>
  Abstract: Goethe, in association with his younger Romantic compatriots the Schlegels, Novalis, Fichte, and Schelling, struggled with the subject-object dichotomy, and tried to bridge the gap between self and other, consciousness and nature. His theory and practice prefigured the Romantics' determination to display and interrogate the linguistic and cultural structures informing their own thinking and modes of representation--what Goethe calls one's "Vorstellungsart." His work exploits, subverts, and supplants inherited conventions and signs, demonstrating with virtuosic irony that literature is a system of texts, pre-texts, and pre-established but dynamic conceptual models. 'Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double"' explores Goethe's use, in a wide range of his poetry and prose, of the theme of 'Liebestod' (love and death) and related embodiments of the paradox of unity in duality. Ellis Dye also examines Goethe's use of other themes related to love and death--the 'femme fatale', the 'vagina dentata, Frau Welt', the Lorelei, venereal disease, the 'Lustmord' --and considers issues of selfhood and individuation as well as the possibility that the love-death theme contains an implicit gender bias toward the existential fact of personal separateness. Poems, plays, and novels are dealt with, nevertheless, as works of art, not only as illustrations of an idea or as points of intersection in a system of rhetorical conventions, and are examined for intellectual cohesiveness, elegance, and integrity of design as well as special meanings and effects. ' Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double" ' explores the meaning of the central theme of Romantic poetry in the works of the most important Romantic poet of all. Students of literary culture, both the lay reader and the Goethe specialist, will be enlightened by its approach and find pleasure and instruction in its revelations.

  Abstract: Goethe’s 
                  Faust expresses Romanticism’s agony over the fact of individuation and the individual’s distance from its origin and destiny. Its action is propelled by a man’s desire to escape from selfhood into love. Faust does not end in a Liebestod, like Romeo and Juliet or Aida. Yet what is at stake is the continuation of Faust’s self-identity in time versus his dissolution, his Entgrenzung, in a timeless moment of bliss. The escape from selfhood into union with another, whether a lover, the world, or God, would be a Liebestod, and there are many echoes of the love-death theme in Faust,<br>

  Abstract: In Quebec, the massive sociopolitical and cultural changes of the 1960s and the consolidation of the liberal État-providence in the 1970s saw a great overlap of culture and politics. The linkage was, in fact, so significant that in the 1980s, after the failure of the referendum for independence, many intellectuals and writers would reflect nostalgically on the previous two decades. They detected a general disengagement in the literature of the 1980s. The literary critic Gilles Marcotte even spoke of a “génération en deuil de ce qui la précède et de ce qui ne pourra pas advenir,” a “génération qui refuse<br>

In an attempt to construct a new identity for herself after a severe rupture in her life story, Thomas’s protagonist, Alice Hoyle, oscillates between traditional, socially accepted positions for women and new identities she imagines for herself. The title not only points to the plot but also to the textual devices of Thomas’s narrative that moves back and forth between fixture and fluidity, fact and fiction.¹ The laws and features of the intertidal<br>

  Book Title: Fighting For Time-Shifting Boundaries of Work and Social Life<br>
  Publisher: Russell Sage Foundation<br>
  Author(s): Kalleberg Arne L.<br>
  Abstract: Though there are still just twenty-four hours in a day, society’s idea of who should be doing what and when has shifted. Time, the ultimate scarce resource, has become an increasingly contested battle zone in American life, with work, family, and personal obligations pulling individuals in conflicting directions. In Fighting for Time, editors Cynthia Fuchs Epstein and Arne Kalleberg bring together a team of distinguished sociologists and management analysts to examine the social construction of time and its importance in American culture. Fighting for Time opens with an exploration of changes in time spent at work—both when people are on the job and the number of hours they spend there—and the consequences of those changes for individuals and families. Contributors Jerry Jacobs and Kathleen Gerson find that the relative constancy of the average workweek in America over the last thirty years hides the fact that blue-collar workers are putting in fewer hours while more educated white-collar workers are putting in more. Rudy Fenwick and Mark Tausig look at the effect of nonstandard schedules on workers’ health and family life. They find that working unconventional hours can increase family stress, but that control over one’s work schedule improves family, social, and health outcomes for workers. The book then turns to an examination of how time influences the organization and control of work. The British insurance company studied by David Collinson and Margaret Collinson is an example of a culture where employees are judged on the number of hours they work rather than on their productivity. There, managers are under intense pressure not to take legally guaranteed parental leave, and clocks are banned from the office walls so that employees will work without regard to the time. In the book’s final section, the contributors examine how time can have different meanings for men and women. Cynthia Fuchs Epstein points out that professional women and stay-at-home fathers fac~<br>

  Abstract: Ever since the pioneering empirical work of Alfred Chandler, the investigation of multidivisional firms has been transforming our understanding of what organizations are and of how they operate. Williamson began the theoretical task by undermining the classical Weberian dichotomy between markets and hierarchies. Through his transaction cost analysis of contracting systems, Williamson underlined the fact that current business management is a mixture of market and hierarchy principles. Hybrid organizational forms such as diversification, profit centers, performance evaluation, transfer pricing, subcontracting, joint ventures, and conglomerates all point to the pervasiveness both of profit-oriented exchange relations within economic units and of overtly<br>

  Book Title: Promises of 1968-Crisis, Illusion and Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): TISMANEANU VLADIMIR<br>
  Abstract: This book is a state of the art reassessment of the significance and consequences of the events associated with the year 1968 in Europe and in North America. Since 1998, there hasn’t been any collective, comparative and interdisciplinary effort to discuss 1968 in the light of both contemporary headways of scholarship and new evidence on this historical period. A significant departure from earlier approaches lies in the fact that the manuscript is constructed in unitary fashion, as it goes beyond the East–West divide, trying to identify the common features of the sixties. The latter are analyzed as simultaneously global and local developments. The main problems addressed by the contributors of this volume are: the sixties as a generational clash; the redefinition of the political as a consequence of the ideological challenges posed to the status-quo by the sixty-eighters; the role of Utopia and the de-radicalization of intellectuals; the challenges to imperialism (Soviet/American); the cultural revolution of the sixties; the crisis of ‘really existing socialism’ and the failure of “socialism with a human face”; the gradual departure from the Yalta-system; the development of a culture of human rights and the project of a global civil society; the situation of 1968 within the general evolution of European history (esp. the relationship of 1968 with 1989). In contrast to existing books, the book provides a fundamental and unique synthesis of approaches on 1968: first, it contains critical (vs. nostalgic) re-evaluations of the events from the part of significant sixty-eighters; second, it includes historical analyses based on new archival research; third, it gathers important theoretical re-assessments of the intellectual history of the 1968; and fourth, it bridges 1968 with its aftermath and its pre-history, thus avoiding an over-contextualization of the topics in question.<br>

Insofar as Stambolov had become a symbol of independent national policies, directed against Russia in particular, the newly restored democracy in Bulgaria marked its exit from the Soviet sphere of influence with this monument.

Abstract: Patten presents a detailed explication and defense of Hegel’s conception of freedom as rational self‐determination. On such a view, inherited from Kant, being free involves more than the absence of coercion or being able to do as one pleases. Freedom requires actors to self‐legislate their behavior such that the good reasons motivating them override their contingent desires and inclinations. Given standard objections to Kant’s idea of autonomy, and Hegel’s own statements of those objections, Patten carefully analyzes Hegel to demonstrate both that he does in fact hold a related view, and that his view does not fall prey to the same problems as Kant’s. Central to Patten’s interpretation of Hegel is the idea that free agents will be ones who act in ways harmonious with those features of modern life and the modern state that establish the conditions Hegel thinks are necessary for the realization and sustenance of individual freedom.<br>

Abstract: The fact that Watts, Hartley, and Bonnet were praised by the English chemist and religious controversialist Joseph Priestley for their germ theory of resurrection highlights how broad the margins for maneuvering in the physico‐theological field were. Priestley asserted the materiality of the soul, denied its immortality, and (in analogies that explicitly concerned personal identity) affirmed that we are as entirely composed of matter as a river of water or a forest of trees. For all intents and purposes, he said, we shall at resurrection be the same we were on earth if “we shall all know one another again, and converse together as before” (Joseph Priestley,
            Disquisitions Relating to Matter and Spirit and the Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated[1777; New York, 1976], p. 160).<br>

Abstract: Important insights into group style come from the focus on group identity in social identity theories (Tajfel
            1982; Farr and Moscovici1984; Hewitt1989; Jenkins1996; see also McCall and Simmons1978; Melucci1988) and the “symbolic boundary” perspective (Lamont1999,1992; Lamont and Fournier1992; Lamont and Thevenot2000). These approaches alerted us at the outset to the fact that groups draw boundaries that identify “people like us,” and exclude others as different, or less worthy, in the process. For instance, upper‐middle‐class people draw socioeconomic, cultural, and moral boundaries between themselves and other groups (Lamont1992); people develop musical preferences by contrasting themselves with others who have different preferences (Bryson1996); moral entrepreneurs enforce boundaries between art and “obscenity” with specific social groups, not just society in general, in mind (Beisel1997). People imagine their tangible, face‐to‐face group on a broader, less tangible social map. This “mapping” is one of the three dimensions of group style—the “group boundaries” dimension—introduced at the start and illustrated in our cases. And as Lamont argues (1992), a group’s social map has many overlapping kinds of distinctions, not just class distinctions.<br>

Abstract: 4. Are the paradigm shifts I identified for the study of language as culture in the United States of more general relevance?This possibility was also raised by psychologists in the audience when I presented an earlier draft of the article at the Universit di Padova in October 2000. In the printed version I purposely left out my own speculations in this direction because I felt that I did not have the data and the expertise to venture into other fields, but this is a worthwhile project for others to pursue. After all, many of the writers I mentioned were or are part of wider networks of scholarship extending to other disciplines and other countries. One in fact might see van Dijks comments as the beginning of a widening of the discussion by a major figure in another field, namely, discourse studies. His complaints about what is typically left out of the analysis in linguistics and anthropology not only underscore the privileging of certain contexts for analysis (e.g., spontaneous talk), which is to be expected, but also remind us that text itself is one of those key terms that can be interpreted very differently across disciplines and, I would add, across paradigms. I suspect that a study of how the term text has been interpreted and used in the humanities and social sciences would be an equally exciting exercise, although it would be difficult to justify the same temporal restriction to the 20th century given the ancient hermeneutical traditions from which our contemporary notions of text derive.<br>

The intense and occasionally pointed dialogues bring forth an incremental, but substantial clarification of the issues at hand, the issues at stake, and their potential (but not actual) interaction. The fact of the matter is that neuroscience has no privileged bearing on human affairs simply because it deals with the brain. Why push it to realms in which it does not belong?<br>

We also witness a dissociation between corporeal, mental, and social phenomena, such as the construction of the self, “normally” inscribed in or displayedsimultaneouslyby “one” body.<br>

Abstract: Philosophy must know, and thus also not cease to will to know, the one who knows, at the risk of degrading the one who knows (himself) to the status of what he knows. Theology in the strict sense recognizes its object—in fact, a formal nonobject—as revelation. It thus accepts, or rather claims as its highest epistemological necessity, to treat of the incomprehensibility of God, such as it results directly from his infinity and, above all, from his holiness.<br>

Abstract: A psychological turning point in Braudel’s life came at age twenty‐five with his father’s death on January 27, 1927.
         111That summer Braudel returned to Paris to help sort out family affairs. He began his first serious archival research at the Archives Nationales and the Bibliotheque Nationale and changed the title of histhèseto “Philippe II et la politique espagnole en Méditerranée de 1559 à 1574” (i.e., from Cateau‐Cambrésis to the Turkish reconquest of Tunis). That fall his mother came to Algiers to keep house for him, which prompted him to undertake a first marriage with the daughter of the vice‐principal of his school on October 27, 1927, which ended in divorce five years later. Archival work in Simancas began in the following summers, 1928 through 1933.112His 1928 first article, “The Spaniards and North Africa,” was derived from his revisedthèsetopic, and it eventually made its way into Part III ofThe Mediterranean,in a discussion of the North African defense network. Neither this section nor a topic such as the battle of Alcázarquivir (August 4, 1578) constitute anything other than “potted” history derived from 1930s scholarship—nothing, in fact, to suggest his intimate contact with North African society and culture.113If the view of “the Mediterranean as seen from the opposite shore, upside down” revolutionized his vision, his geographic orientation tuned out any unique or original perspective in this section of what became Part III. In 1930 Braudel served as an assistant secretary at the Congress of Historical Sciences held in Algiers amid the celebrations of Algeria’s one‐hundredth anniversary as a French colony, and he appears to have been less on the outside than his memory or self‐image would like to admit. More than the place, it was what he did there, his role as a secondary school teacher, that shaped the young Braudel.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Bourgeois contends that there are two ways of getting the relation between the enterprise of critique and its grounding in reason wrong. Neither understands the distinction between limit and boundary adequately, and, consequently, both produce untenable philosophical positions, in Bourgeois’s view. The first way, exemplified by Heidegger, attempts to derive the limit from below in finite human subjectivity (or Dasein). Heidegger, fatefully neglecting the essential idea of boundary according to Bourgeois, argues, in
      Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics(1929), that the origin of Kant’s two sources of cognition, sensibility and the understanding, resides in the creative intuition of the productive imagination. Going beyond Kant, Heidegger locates the genesis of the pure concepts or categories of the understanding in the imagination. In fact, in Heidegger’s account, the transcendental imagination becomes nothing other than the primordial time of Dasein. Reason does not set the limits of knowledge. Rather, imagination, or Dasein, limits itself through the existential projection of the meaning of Being as determined by Dasein’s own structure of finite temporality.<br>

Abstract: Accordingly, Meyers examines the role of a series of gender‐specific images in women’s agency, addressing pronatalism, mother‐child imagery, the family, narcissism, aging, and sexuality. Each of these topics could occupy a book, and one hopes that Meyers will expand on the ideas developed here. The strength of this approach is the familiarity of the subject matter to a large audience—although not to all women—and Meyers strives to remain conscious of the fact that she cannot make universal claims about women. But many readers will find something in the text that resonates with their own experience. (Meyers’s discussion relies in part on interviews with women.) For example, when she criticizes “matrigyno‐idolatry” (32) or the pressure to become a mother, she does not merely report on tensions that some women face. Nor does she simply analyze the power of social discourse to manipulate women’s choices. Rather, she sticks to her middle path, demonstrating persuasively that there is currently no space in matrigyno‐idolatrous discourse for genuine autonomy for women, and she makes a parallel point for each set of images she examines. Whatever choice one makes—including the choice to remain childless, which, she correctly points out, is seldom considered by feminist theorists—there is a cultural image ready at hand to define and constrict women’s agency.<br>

Author(s): Mandry,  Christof<br>
Abstract: Christof Mandry’s recent book reopens this debate about Christian ethics, explores some of the terrain of the historical debate, and then tries to press the discussion forward. Originally written as a thesis under the direction of Dietmar Mieth, himself a contributor to this debate, Mandry's book provides a solid, if somewhat schematic, account of the lines of contention even as he makes an important contribution to the discussion within the European, especially German, context by drawing on fresh resources. Thematically, the book is divided into two parts. Part 1 explores the question of theological and philosophical ethics by examining in some detail exemplary positions. Mandry explores within Roman Catholic theology both the work of Franz Böckles, whose
      Fundamentalmoral(New York: Pueblo Publishing, 1980) offered a transcendental account of the theonomous autonomy, and that of Klaus Demmers, who insists on the “effective history” of faith on reason. Mandry then examines an analogous debate among Protestants by examining, specifically, Gerhard Ebeling’s account of moral conscience and Wolfhart Pannenberg’s argument for a distinctly theological grounding of ethics. The fact that thinkers from the various sides of the Christian tradition could reach such starkly different positions while drawing on strands of their own communions is of course important to note. Throughout, Mandry’s readings are fair and insightful.<br>

Abstract: MacIntyre shows how narratives constitute social life: “I can only answer the question ‘What am I to do?’ if I can answer the prior question ‘Of what story or stories do I find myself a part?’ We enter human society, that is, with one or more imputed characters—roles into which we have been drafted” [
         13, p. 216]. While there continues to be argument over the claim that stories are lived before they are recounted and that life is stories being lived out, the work of Carr shows that this is so, for the overall temporal structure of action is narrative in character; life is an inchoate narrative [24]. Human reality is not just a sequence because it can be demonstrated that narrative coherence inheres in “even the most elementary experience or action” [24, p. 88]. Narrative coherence is “an essential structural feature of the very fact ofhavingan experience orperformingan action” [24, p. 88]. Hence, order is present in events even before a narrative is imposed on them, and “the real difference between ‘art’ and ‘life’ is not organization versus chaos, but rather the absence in life of that point of view which transforms events into a story bytellingthem” [24, p. 59]. This emphasis on activity is also found in MacIntyre: “Narrative is not the work of poets, dramatists and novelists reflecting upon events which had no narrative order before one was imposed by the singer or the writer; narrative form is neither disguise nor decoration” [13, p. 211]. For MacIntyre, human actions are themselves enacted narratives; for Carr, it is in living out a life that we achieve a “grasp” at the level of attempting to make meaning or sense of relationships [24]. According to Gare, following this line of thought shows us the following:
               
         Actions are lived stories. The more complex the action, the longer its duration and the more people involved, the more obviously this is the case. Actions such as building a community or developing our understanding of the~<br>

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: We have seen that the shroud is the Word’s “symbol” and the relics are its “agents.” We glean a clearer understanding of this rhetorical and linguistic connection if we read it in the light of Renaissance notions of emblematic expression. In an earlier section of this essay, I explained Tesauro’s innovative theories. I pointed out that Tesauro believes in the existence of visual hybrids, some sorts of emblematic
      imprese, at once “heroic” and personal messages expressed through general visual statements. Contradicting a tenet of the Renaissance concept of emblem, in theTelescopeTesauro contends that “the [impresa] is a miraculous composition whose soul is outside of the body.”121For Tesauro, the “miracle” of animpresalies in the fact that its message turns into a personal, nonvisible insight. The “soul” of the shroud‐impresais the marvel brought about in the “mirror” of our intellect.<br>

Abstract: What is particularly intriguing here is Frei’s connection between the “particularistic” practices of reading represented by Midrash and the “cultural future” of civilization. Adherence to the literal sense, through typological practices of reading, thus cultivates a practice and informs a worldview that can resist and challenge the universal, hegemonic tendencies of modernity. As he continues, “The Protestant theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher called Judaism a fossil religion, in part at least out of the animus which many Rationalist, Romantic, and Idealistic thinkers bore toward Jewish particularism. And yet it is now conceivable that that `fossil' may bear more of the future of the culture of the West in its hands than Christianity, and its traditional, particularistic forms may not be adventitious to the fact.” The “fossilization” of Judaism from the perspective of the Enlightenment is well known; moreover, the rejection of Jewish particularism by Rationalism, Romanticism, and Idealism bears a strong resemblance to the simultaneous occlusion of the practice of figural reading so powerfully described in
         Eclipse: “Beyond that, however, the example of Judaism in the modern Western world might be a beacon to a reconstituted Christian community. One never knows what this community might then contribute once again to that culture or its residues, including its political life, its quest for justice and freedom—and even its literature. If the priorities are rightly ordered, the literal sense may be counted on to play a significant part in such a less pretentious enterprise. It will stretch and not break.” As Frei notes, such cultural benefits must be considered “secondary” or “incidental”—yet, this paragraph speaks volumes as to the potentially transformative impact that he envisages through adherence to the literal sense of scripture and attention to its relation to Midrash. Such potential is highly significant, given Frei’s frequent disparagement of allegoric~<br>

Abstract: “Citatology” nearly always ignores this question, implicitly treating references to an author as an index of recognition (of indebtedness or legitimacy). In point of fact this apparent function may nearly always be associated with such diverse functions as the manifestation of relations of allegiance or dependence, of strategies of affiliation, of annexation or of defence (this is the role, for example, of guarantee references, ostentatious references or alibi‐references).<br>

Abstract: The latter is important, for however hard judges try to stand in the shoes of both parties—which they have to keep doing to the very last minute—ultimately they have to take a position above the parties, for they in fact occupy the position of a “third party.” This is analogous to what is known as the accusatorial principle that was probably already current in Roman law but has certainly functioned in canon law since Gregory I. It requires that the two parties, accuser and accused, be tried on an equal footing by a third party, carefully distanced from both and above them.

Abstract: Empirical studies of these multiple conditions do in fact suggest ways in which children exercise social agency, such as through resilience to poverty’s effects, awareness of family situation, support of parental employment, self‐limitation of wants, and capabilities to adapt and grow even under the severest conditions. However, they also reveal a massive failure of American society to respond to the needs of its most vulnerable members, and indeed to respond to human vulnerability as such. The problem faced in children’s poverty is not just children’s lack of social participation. The problem, more fundamentally, is that “social participation” in the United States today is defined in a primarily adult, individualistic, market competitive, and utilitarian way, so that children are bound to lose out. Barbara Bennett Woodhouse has argued that American “rights” language tends to emphasize this kind of state‐free autonomy over state support for needs and dignity.
         47Or, as Jürgen Habermas would put it, the lifeworld of children (both within and outside families) has been thoroughly “colonized” by the values of the marketplace, values that happen to be chiefly agential and adult.48<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Abstract: A hermeneutically sophisticated
         imitatio Deiwill therefore resist all too frequent appeals to poetics as merely an expression of individual subjectivity or as its opposite, a representation of a given traditional narrative to be applied and adhered to. Understood instead as animitatio Creatoris, humanity is ultimately responsible for narrating itself over time. Its capability for doing so is presupposed in the fact that human beings tell moral stories and myths at all. The impossible possibility commanded by our own mysterious natures is to imitate our own Creator in creating ever less distorted, violent, and exclusive historical worlds. Those done violence can find herein a deep well of empowerment to work toward transforming the social order. Those who perpetrate violence can discover that social creativity belongs to humanity as such in all its vulnerability, difference, and otherness. In both cases, what is to be imitated, in a hermeneutically dynamic way, is neither a lost nor an eternally fixed moral order but our own morally invisible creative humanity.<br>

Abstract: I suspect that this difficulty surfaces in part because the topic of memory and promises has a greater affinity with the chapter on mutual recognition placed at the end of the book. On a first note, it appears artificial to treat individual and collective memory separately. In fact, this disturbing separation repeats itself, but more mildly, in the treatment of the individual and collective capacities at the end of the chapter. Once again, what seems to belong to a social analysis is treated with a phenomenological account of the self—even if it is true that Ricoeur conceives it as a “transition point” toward mutual recognition.<br>

Abstract: Deliberation poses some stringent requirements within the framework of ultimately reaching a just and fair outcome. This is, in fact, the case with ethical and moral theory in general. Jürgen Habermas points out, “Since moralities are tailored to suit the fragility of human beings individuated through socialization, they must always solve two tasks at once. They must emphasize the inviolability of the individual by postulating equal respect for the dignity of each individual. But they must also protect the web of intersubjective relations of mutual recognition by which these individuals survive as members of a community” [
         35, p. 200]. Habermas’s is a fundamentally phenomenological perspective insofar as the relationship between self and other is a foundational imperative. (You are different from me, and you and your ideas have legitimacy. You and I share the moral imperative; moreover, I must acknowledge and operate according to your right to be.) Building on the phenomenological base, he outlines a discourse ethics as a practical means of deliberating and accepting moral norms. There are advantages to discourse ethics within our professional community. For one thing, even in the initial stages of deliberation, the positions taken by all participants can be known; there is a starting point from which to begin. For another, discourse ethics requires that there be publicity, that positions and, more important, reasons for holding positions be made public so that they can be deliberated. There is a genuine process of argumentation at work in order for both the validity of an argument (the logical connection between conclusion and premises) and the truth of the premises and propositions to be tested in an open forum.<br>

Abstract: Responsibility for and to this double heritage then requires the invention, each time anew, of a rule according to which both contradictory demands could be met simultaneously or of an action from which such a rule could, after the fact, be construed. In Patočka’s parlance, such responsibility toward the memory of Europe is, therefore, inevitably heretical. The relation to this memory is a responsible one only if the contradictory injunctions are met in a way that amounts to a transformation of the tradition that is new each time, one that is singular. Needless to say, what we have seen in regard to the relation to the memory of Europe is valid as well for all other responsible decision making insofar as it takes place against the backdrop of an experience of tradition. Any responsible decision making must face the demand to give reasons without at the same time being reduced to knowledge that would merely be put into effect.<br>

Author(s): Wall,  John<br>
Abstract: Finally, in
      Moral CreativityWall carries out a dialogue with a wide variety of contemporary philosophical and theological voices, including narrative theology, recent Aristotelianisms, feminism, liberation theology, communicative ethics, and others. Often, the intent is to show how the voice captures only one side of the tension between freedom and finitude. Ricoeur, with his passive/active model of selfhood, is presented as the corrective to such one‐sided accounts. In fact, one of the great virtues of the book is the fact that it makes Ricoeur’s voluminous writings available to the debates of contemporary ethics in an accessible way. Wall’s original reflections on contemporary ethical thought are clear‐eyed as well, particularly some of his comments on the status of evil in narrative theology.<br>

Abstract: If, for Halbwachs, history delegitimizes the “lived
         (vécu)past,” it is possible to observe a similar impulse occurring elsewhere, namely, Japan, where Yanagita Kunio produced a history(Meiji Taishoshi: Sesohen)on the model of an immense tableau comprised of past and present customs mingling together in 1920s Tokyo and actually envisaged history’s vocation as recording the cohabitation of different customs reflecting mixed temporalities in the present. In Peru at around the same time, Jose Carlos Mariátegui was reflecting on the intersection of historical times coexisting in conflict within a developmental framework and with the figure of unevenness that clearly signified the noncontemporaneity of the contemporaneous.32And in our time this fixation on the historical present as the punctual point of mixed temporalities has appeared more frequently, throughout the world, as evidenced by Chinua Achebe’s novelization of the conflict produced by clashing times in eastern Nigeria(The Arrow of God)—the visualization of temporal islands where contacts and collisions have taken place and have launched the production and spread of culturalmétissage—and even Achille Mbembe’s formulation of the entanglements of time employed to explain the postcolony. In fact, there are innumerable examples of the noncontemporaneous contemporary that can be recruited from the domains of literature, cinema, and, obviously, sociology, an immense literature analyzing the conflicts of tradition and modernity that, especially in the great cities of the world, take place between immigrant parents and their children, among the claims and practices of diasporic peoples in the heart of modern metropolitan life, and within virtual pockets of a transplanted Third World. Also, movements like the Zapatistas in Chiapas have managed to balance the cyclical time of the indigenous community with a political project of liberation inscribed in a Marxian narrative of modernity (though free of progressivist~<br>

Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: This is not to argue against the kind of verification fundamental to scientific history, though it does side with Warnock’s observation that a positivist approach can miss the role of human imagination in not merely perceiving but also constructing reality. Rather, it is to argue for something besides the power of description at work in certain narratives, especially those that rise to the level of mythos and make a claim to religious authority. Smith’s narratives do not display fact to be assented to but draw the reader into a malleable reality by means of the malleable plots that traditionally provided the basis for Jewish and Christian ethos and ethic. It can be said that Smith was translating time, not text. Specifically, he translated biblical time in service to, he said, an “ushering in of the dispensation of the fullness of times … a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers … from the days of Adam even to the present time.”
         97Whatever his intention, the effect was to deploy the biblical text in a manner that radically subverted centuries of theologizing on who God is and how humans are to worship God.<br>

Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: The dichotomous nature of Śaṅkara’s distinction between
         jñānaandupāsanashould make us immediately suspicious of apologetic interests driving his analysis. The assimilation of meditation to ritual activity allows Śaṅkara to group Yoga, Mīmāṃsā, and Bhedābheda Vedānta together on one side of an apologetic divide. On the other side stands Śaṅkara’s Advaita as the lone defender of pure Vedāntic knowledge. As if there were any doubt as to the relative ranking of these two paths, Śaṅkara correlatesjñānaandupāsanawith the higher and lower (paraandapara) forms of brahman, respectively.95Like most apologetically motivated schemas, this one suppresses important aspects of the views that it relegates to positions of inferiority. In particular, as Halbfass notes, Śaṅkara fails to acknowledge the fact that the teachers of Yoga, no less than Śaṅkara, recognized the need to transcend a preoccupation with results and an acquisitive attitude.96More generally, his dichotomy shears off the cognitive connotations ofupāsana, which theBrahma‐sūtramost probably regarded as continuous withjñāna.97<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and~<br>

Issue: 527832<br>
Date: 01 2008<br>
Author(s): Scimeca Ross<br>
Abstract: This unique notion of truth for librarianship that we are proposing is derived from what has been called historicism. Historicism is not really a theory of truth as much as it is a theory of knowledge in which the question of objective truth is eliminated. This elimination of objective truth implicit in historicism has been attacked from many quarters. The origin of this theory is J. G. Herder’s
         Reflections on the Philosophy of the History of Man[71]. With regard to the question of truth, historicism interprets both human consciousness and the propositions expressing the nature of humans themselves and all of reality as historically conditioned, even current knowledge [71, pp. 96–104]. Herder looked at the supposed teleological progression of reason and found it often wanting. Nevertheless, he believed that reason and goodness would eventually triumph over irrationalism and human folly [71, pp. 115–18]. Consider the following example that illustrates the difference between historicism and the three theories of truth discussed above. For the historicist, the proposition that the world is the center of the universe was true for the medieval mind. For the correspondence theorist, that proposition is simply false, although the additional fact that the medieval mind accepted this proposition to be true would be conceded. The coherence theorist would say that, although the medieval mind accepted the Aristotelian‐Ptolemaic view of the universe, which in itself is a coherent system of propositions, this coherent system would eventually be supplanted by Copernicus’s view. This revolutionary change in knowledge is often expressed as a paradigm by Thomas Kuhn and other philosophers of science. The historicist would point out that such paradigms of knowledge usually have a localized point of origin and gradually expand to the other areas of scholarship, finally entering the public consciousness, where they are accepted or rejected [67, pp. 160–73]. The historicist ackn~<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives.

2008<br>
Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: In conjuring up the conceptual field of such effects, we might turn to set theory and picture a Venn diagram by which narratography is defined as exactly the zone of overlap between narratology and stylistics. Narratography would be shaded in there by the very shadings and incremental gradations of prose in the thick and thin of its own action as linguistic incident. Here emerges, in sum, the heuristic value of a so-called
         Story Left Behindin staging by exaggeration the everyday wake of narrativity in verbal process. Any narrative sentence may have its dramatic prehistory. It need not necessarily be distended or suddenly truncated, not by definition brutal or suppressed or moving or any one thing in particular, and not necessarily longer than the plotted tension of the preceding paragraph or even sentence. But narrative prehistory is manifest as a forward pressure nonetheless. That's why this essay's approach is in fact “narratival” rather than strictly stylistic (whatever that might mean)—and often dialectical as such. And why its instinct for intensive reading comes into sync with the impetus of plotted structure rather than just local representation. And why, further, even in imagining an entire shadow plot, the inflated exception developed in the fictional phase of this essay can still prove the rule of the minuscule. Whole lives, of course, don't usually lie battered, absented, and returned by deformation under the tread of suchfrictionin prose. Broad swaths of plot aside, it is rather in the immediate pace of reading that some aspect or facet of an advancing story is often bent noticeably out of shape. Narratography becomes, in this sense, the tracking of syntax and of the words it marshals for the impinging microplots, one after the other, of their own proximate backstories.<br>

Abstract: The coordination of the work of involuntary memory with the work of dreams is the vehicle for Marcel’s recuperation of his amorous self. He renounces his current, self‐centered self for the altruistic self that embodies “the diminished life” of his resurrected grandmother.
         63I have used elsewhere the predicate of “altruism” to designate a project of self‐expression that incorporates alterity as its very raison d’être, arguing that genuine altruism is found in the expressions of human love.64In this perspective, one could say that Marcel’s strategy of amorous self‐discovery promotes at once the affirmation and the negation of personal will. Just as Schopenhauer’s rejection of the self‐serving egoism of individual will may be seen as revisionistic, and narrower in existential options, with respect to Augustine’s avocation of the perfectibility ofvoluntasin the amorous individual, so may Marcel’s commitment to the recuperation of his amorous self be seen as revisionistic with respect to Schopenhauer’s obstruction of will’s self‐affirmation. Marcel’s willful annihilation of his self‐centeredmoiis the diametrical opposite to will’s nihilistic destruction of the self; by renouncing his self‐centeredmoi, in fact, Marcel manages to salvage his altruistic self from the oblivion of unconscious memory, and thereby affirm it.<br>

Abstract: In this revised dissertation, W. David Hall argues that Paul Ricoeur’s religious writings can offer an important context for interpreting his philosophical project—that, in fact, Ricoeur’s philosophical writings take on more of a theological tenor over time, especially if one focuses on their growing emphasis on ethics. This development, Hall argues, culminates in a creative tension between love and justice that finds its peak in a confrontation between the ideas of autonomy and theonomy. “The love command lends an imperative structure to the ideal of love that opens it to moral judgment in general and ideals of justice in particular” (2), yet without turning into something reducible to the Kantian notion of a moral categorical imperative. Rather, what is at issue is a “poetic” use of the imperative in Ricoeur’s thought.<br>

Abstract: The remembrance of death and the love of life, which I have explored today, are in fact etched into the structures of our everyday, lived reality. Forty years ago this week, riots broke out at Columbia University and other institutions of higher learning and then, in May, throughout the United States and Europe over the war in Vietnam. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot. We are still at war but now on a global scale. And the killing of the just and innocent continues. Years ago some farsighted people grasped the massive danger we posed to our planet’s environment and forms of life, and we this week celebrate Earth Week in order to counter that danger. The past months have been scarred by an onslaught of murders in our city, especially against children. The remembrance of death surrounds us. Yet this week is also one of freedom and life. Jews around the world during Passover look back and reenact those events that led to their liberation from bondage. Christians look forward to Pentecost and the rush of new life in the spirit. Other religions also celebrate life in its many forms. People of good will around the world struggle against the onslaught of poverty, oppression, and dehumanization in the name of human dignity and also the fragile goodness of finite life.<br>

Abstract: One of the dominant trends in Buddhist studies and in the study of religion more broadly during the past few decades has been the increasing focus on the significance of the material dimensions of religion. This emphasis on materiality is commonly advocated as a corrective to earlier scholarship that tended to privilege the intellectual, spiritual, and textualized forms of religion, and the effects of this reorientation can be seen in the increasing volume of scholarship devoted to material culture and religious ritual, ranging from studies that attend to the built environments within which religious practices take place and to the material objects employed by practitioners, to analyses of the complex interactions of embodied agents engaged in ritual practice. Feminist scholars of religion have contributed greatly to the turn to the material by drawing out the interpretive implications of the fact that those ritual agents are generally embodied as either males or females, as are the scholars who observe, analyze, and, in many cases, participate in those rituals.<br>

Article Title: Coleridge’s Philosophy of Prayer: Responsibility, Parergon, and Catachresis<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: The interesting thing is that Coleridge accepts much of the Kantian analysis: these concepts, such as a personal God, grace, and the possibility of prayer, are indeed improper to reason, but they are returned as improper to the very heart of the human subject. Thus, Coleridge writes that “only a negative rationality can be demanded” (N5383) of prayer. Prayer involves “contradictions
         in terms, I grant you: never the less so it is! … Were it not a contradictionin terms, it would not be anIdea… but either a Fact of the Sense or the Conception of the Understanding! … Spiritual things can only be spiritually discerned. … It is impossible, you say—Yea, I reply: but nevertheless such is the truth” (N5554, fols. 12v–13). Both Kant and Coleridge recognize that parerga possess a certain phenomenological irreducibility: they do seem to force themselves to be thought, even if they are strictly unthinkable. Yet where the former privileges philosophy’s right to exclude unthinkable concepts, the latter bears witness to the necessity of these same concepts. In Coleridge’s work, the human subject must act, at its very center, on and across the limit of what it can justifiably think and know: “The more I read & reflect on the arguments of the truly philosophical Theists & Atheists, the more I feel convinced that the ultimate difference is a moral rather than intellectual one / that the result is an X Y Z—an acknowledged Insufficiency of the Known to account for itself, and therefore a something Unknown—but to which the Theist dedicates his noblest feelings of Love, & Awe, & by a moral syllogism connects & unites it with his Conscience & Actions—while the Atheist leaves it a blank in the Heart, because it is a Blank in his Understanding” (N4030).<br>

Article Title: Critique and Promise in Paul Tillich’s Political Theology: Engaging Giorgio Agamben on Sovereignty and Possibility<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: This kind of free exchange shows why promise does not accept the given without a critical reserve; it does not merely endorse political realities as it finds them. It does not introduce new immanent criteria for judging the political; rather, it, as Tillich indicated, opens possibility. The prophetic can provide an engine for addressing the construction of sovereignty as Schmitt has outlined it, as it seems to threaten human life; it can do so by endorsing political practices that are in fact otherwise than sovereign and that involve the establishment of free reciprocity and a field of exchange among equals without domination or debt. This seems to be the task that Tillich ascribes to the congregation: “The congregation should not take itself as a higher sociological form than other forms of community life, rather as a particular expression of the transcendental meaning of sociological forms … such a church that the social forms should elaborate their transcendental content‐meaning.”
         45The church, Tillich asserts, should be the place for this deliberation and anticipation. In short, he proposes the church as the site of promise.<br>

Article Title: Literary Unrest: Blanchot, Lévinas, and the Proximity of Judaism<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: This notion of literature develops from Blanchot's reading of Mallarmé as well as his encounter with the Hegelian description of comprehension. Drawing from Kojève's seminars, Blanchot begins with the notion that language involves the absence (the annihilation or death) of the object, such that for one to possess the idea of cat, one must annihilate the uniquely real cat in its existence.
         35“Common language,” Blanchot writes, recognizes this operation as unproblematic or at least productive. For in killing the real cat, I have gained something much more secure, the idea of cat, which cannot die. Literary language differs from common language not in the act itself, for by the very fact that it is language it must also enact a negation of the object. “But literary language,” Blanchot suggests, “is made of uneasiness” (“L,” p. 315; “LRD,” p. 325). Literary language draws attention back to the negativity of the operation, focusing on the fact that the word expresses the nonexistence of the cat and that what it has given us as a replacement is a word. Literature dramatizes the operation of replacement by offering “an endless sliding of ‘turns of phrase' which do not lead anywhere. Thus is born,” Blanchot writes, “the image that does not designate the thing but, rather, what the thing is not” (“L,” p. 315; “LRD,” p. 326). The mark of the literary is the mark of the trope, a turn. A figure of speech is a turn that multiplies the absence between the object and the word, for now what we have is a word that refers not to the object but to another word.<br>

Article Title: Making Knowledge: History, Literature, and the Poetics of Science<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 652685<br>
Date: 9 2010<br>
Author(s): Bono James J.<br>
Abstract: The work of scientists continually demands the intimate interweaving of text and action in the making of science. As Laura Otis notes in her essay in this Focus section, language, narrative, and metaphor play important roles in the making of scientific knowledge and hence in the history of science. She cites the example of Santiago Ramón y Cajal to suggest how the superiority of metaphors drawing on “trees and plants” to the metaphor of “telegraphic networks” rests in no small part in the ability of the former to fix the attention of the neurobiologist on precisely those material phenomena—and techniques of active observation appropriate to them—that might reveal how “nervous systems grew and changed throughout organisms' lives in response to ongoing activity.” Laura Dassow Walls explicitly evokes the root meaning of “text” (“
         textum,” in Latin) as the action of weaving together in order to insist that we “extend Lorraine Daston's gallery of ‘things that talk’ by proposing that literary texts are ‘things’ too—they too are talkative, they too ‘knit together matter and meaning.’”7In fact, for Walls a key commonality science shares with literature is that both actively seek through the generation of fictive “gestalts”—or forms—togather togetherthings in their respective universes in such a way that they “knit together matter and meaning.” In effect, Walls calls for literary scholars to attend to “things” as agents capable of being made to talk, just as scientists who “make things talk” as a matter of course through their own material practices need to attend to the ways that “literature”—and, I would add, the literary in their own work—“weave[s] the talking things of the sciences into new and surprising alliances.”<br>

Article Title: Animals, Poetry, Philosophy, and Dante's<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 653501<br>
Date: 08 2010<br>
Author(s): Schildgen Brenda Deen<br>
Abstract: However, the Aristotelian topos of the “sagacity of bees,” found in Bartholomeus Anglicus, Albertus Magnus, Vincent of Beauvais, and Thomas Aquinas, was adopted to signify the wonder of nature.
      70Thus, whether in their natural environment, as parallel to an idealized monastic setting, or linked with the “celestial realm,” bees, as the least animal-like creatures who were deemed closest to the heavenly sphere, offered Dante an image for an idealized golden age, an eschatological future already realized in the natural world. Dante's transfigured golden age, however, is not in the past but in the immanent present of the actions of bees, which as nonhuman creatures most like angels, and as poetic vehicles, make transcendence visible in the immanent world of nature. But there is more here, because Dante's use of the nonhuman animal simile places the immanent creature outside itself, and knowledge of self, and makes this a condition of blessedness to which humans might aspire. This has both an aesthetic and heuristic function because it poses a question about the philosophical boundaries that place man above all other creatures. The fact that the poet chooses insects, bees, birds, or fish and avoids mammals (except of course the lamb) as his vehicles to convey this insight suggests these creatures are more analogous to this “blessed” condition than wolves or other predatory creatures. Mammals, in Dante's bestiary, tend to fall easily into the static allegory/personification realm, in step with the “common association” notion of the metaphor, whereas Dante's similes with insects, bees, birds, or fish show how a close observation of nature can become the poetic means for making the immanent transcendent and the transcendent present in the immanent.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 656725<br>
Date: 01 01, 2011<br>
Author(s): Pranger Burcht<br>
Abstract: If that is indeed the case, it is our historical duty to realize that the rhetoric of
      Confessionscomprises both sound and silence to the effect that the fullness of voice can sound in such a way that it is possible to say about Augustine—and his reader—that he “did not hear [its] silence.” Is that perhaps the essence of the fact that what Augustine is looking for cannot but be a momentary gift and that the rhetoric of this search in all its loudness comes down to shaping the fact that it cannot be ascertained, beyond the “speech act” ofconfessioitself, whether that which is given sounds or not? Saying this, we do not find ourselves in the realm of mystical silence. We are, rather, faced with the demands of rhetorical precision. For to establish the magic of a language of desire that is given—a language with the power of Kafka's hammer of the facts of life in the shape of the song of the Sirens—confessiohas to be framed and shaped, dramatized and theatricalized. Consequently, the possibility has to be taken into account that the phrase “Ulysses did not hear the silence of the Sirens” is not the final word about the matter, just as the dialectic of speech and silence cannot be taken to function as an automatism.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 659348<br>
Date: 4 2011<br>
Author(s): Landy Joshua<br>
Abstract: It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
            Adaptation—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case thatAdaptation“undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on Film,” inBooks in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship, ed. Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up tosomething, and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average movie we find easier to read. In fact,Adaptationhas only solidified Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.<br>

Author(s): Bowman Sharon<br>
Abstract: In fact, Larmore goes further, suggesting that beliefs and desires suffice by themselves to explain action without any “additional act of will … to decide to carry out” the prospective act they indicate (103)—as if beliefs and desires also psychologically necessitate actions that express them unless the reasons they embody are overridden by others. On the contrary, many recent thinkers (Kane, Korsgaard, Mele, Pink, etc.) have argued that beliefs and desires do not add up to an actual intention to act: we must instead form an intention to act on them. This much must be conceded, even if we reject multiple recent arguments that intention formation is itself an voluntary process that we control (i.e., a volitional process). On this basis, Larmore could have held that even “surd” wants (as MacIntyre once called them) have normative significance through presenting themselves as motives that could be taken up or embodied in an intention. Intentions clearly involve their own kind of commitment with normative significance (as analyses by Bratman and others have shown)—although this is commitment only in a weak sense since an intention may be coerced, driven by alienated desires (as in compulsive disorders), or just weak willed. So it is distinct from the higher kind of agentive commitment involved in personally autonomous intentions.<br>

Author(s): LaCocque André<br>
Abstract: This observation reveals some divergence between the biblical answer to Babel and the more universal discussion of LaCocque’s analysis. The critique of Babel’s hubris leads to the covenant of Genesis 12, the “great exception, the miraculous ‘otherness’ that is both judgment and relief for ‘all the families of the earth’” (100). But questions remain. For J, the answer to the loss of innocence in Eden and Babel is the covenant, but in LaCocque’s reading, the text affirms rather the indeterminacy and perennial suspicion of structure more characteristic of postmodern thinkers. In his reading, the tower claims a presence, but “deconstructionism shows the absence of such absolute presence” (154). Such a reading is justified in part by the fact that “authorial intent never exhausts the text’s meanings” (93). While there may be little to regret over the deterioration of Babel’s collapse, the same kind of deconstructive move could be made against the theology of J. The understated theologies of J and LaCocque run suggestively through
      The Captivity of Innocence, but much more could be said about them and how they are related.<br>

Abstract: As is often the case, when a scholar who is trained as a descriptivist (in disciplines such as history, sociology, and ethnography) attempts to take on theoretical issues they become theoretically parochial. They understand what works for their predefined area of expertise. However, theory takes place in constituting the domains for research, prior to the act of description, not in the applying individual concepts to preexistent object-domains. As Paul Ricoeur put it, “to delimit a domain of application is a hermeneutical act,” an act “that calls for reflection in terms of a general theory of interpretation” (
      Figuring the Sacred[Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress Press, 1995] 304). This kind of reflection, in my view as a scholar trained in theory, is completely lacking in Vásquez’s choice of criterion, despite his long sections of exegesis of theoretical texts. Rigorous exegesis is not the same thing as rigorous theoretical thinking. Rather, in Vásquez’s choices we find a predetermined view in search of a theory. The book becomes a justification of his choices, not a critical, reflexive, hermeneutical act. Theory happens before the explication of theory begins, and awareness of this fact is absent from this text.<br>

Abstract: This straight-forward reading of the passage has been obscured by interpreters, ancient and modern, who interpret מחניהם as referring to “their camps” (plural) and thus assert the existence of a requirement to maintain purity in all cities. For a coherent understanding of the syntax and content of this passage, it is necessary to understand the form as singular (“their camp”). Note the form מחניך alongside מחנך in Deut. 23:15, both meaning “your camp” (singular). Among the moderns, the fact that מחניהם in our verse is singular has been noted by J. Licht (
         A Commentary on the Book of Numbers, vol. 1 [Jerusalem, 1985], 59–60 [Heb.]), and Levine (Numbers 1–20, 182, 186), and it is assumed by the JPS translation. I plan on elaborating on these points in a study in progress, “The Wilderness Camp Paradigm in the Holiness Source and the Temple Scroll: From Purity Laws to Cult Politics.”<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: Question six raises the issue of whether the cultural systems that Geertz discusses—religion, ideology, aesthetics—are in fact any more systematically coherent than morality, extending this to the methodological relation between spiritual and moral and between spiritual and evil. Crapanzano is correct to identify the anthropological effacement of both spiritual and evil, though one might refer to both as insistent discursive shadows, rather than actual absences. In question seven, I agree that the reification and gothic characterization of evil may blind us to and add power to the rhetoric of evil. This is part of why anthropologists intuitively avoid evil, and precisely why I insist on the thematization rather than the reification of evil, and avoid the gothic characterization of evil to bring in the ethnology of witchcraft instead. Crapanzano’s attribution of evil to demons and devils in question nine plays into such a gothic characterization. In question eight, I am not certain that the identification of structural/symbolic oppositions qualifies me as a dualist in the usual sense, but certainly the specter of dualism that haunts the category of evil supports my argument for a need to rethink the category. This leads directly to the final question about the amoral and moral indifference. Thematizing evil rather than reifying it allows a distinction between saying “I don’t give a damn,” which is in fact a moral stance, and really not giving a damn, which is truly outside morality—this is related to the distinction between a criminal and a sociopath. Finally, Crapanzano’s reference to the bleaker side of human consociation prompts us to reiterate that evil is better examined not for its own sake but as integral to morality. Certainly amorality and moral indifference have moral and cultural consequences.<br>

Abstract: But perhaps I go too far in giving such ethical weight to a stage play written and presented primarily as an entertainment. In spite of the early moderns’ enthusiasm for poetry’s ability to delight and to instruct, art and ethics are not identical. In fact, the distance between them can be such that we might wonder whether they are ever in alignment, whether art can ever bring about an ethical end. If the ethical is imagined as an encounter with radical alterity, what can be the value of the simulation? On this question, Levinas is equivocal, if not contradictory. On the one hand, he distrusts art as an escape or an evasion. Art can give us selfish pleasure and enable our flight from the real world, thereby offering us false transcendence. In this respect, art is an idol: a lifeless object put in place of the other. On the other hand, Levinas openly acknowledges his philosophical debts to the great authors of Russia and western Europe and frequently refers to their literary works in his own writings. (The most obvious example is the line from
      The Brothers Karamazovthat Levinas adopts as his motto, quoting it no less than twelve times in his published work.)
            The best authors, Levinas will say, not only recognize and resist art’s idolatrous potential but also wrestle with core philosophical questions, such as the meaning of life and the meaning of the human. In this way, the best art can prepare one for authors like Plato and Kant. What is more, it can also model the way out of being. According to Levinas, good art can imitate a form of ethical discourse by continually interrupting itself and calling itself into question.58

Abstract: In the cosmos of
         Paradise Lostthere is perhaps no stranger fact than this—that the Son at his greatest moment in the poem says almost exactly the same thing as Adam at his worst. I say “almost” because it is of course the minor differences that make all the difference in Milton’s world. The Son is able to imagine the manner in which Satan might react to the fall of man, but unlike Adam, he refuses to give voice to that possibility. He chooses not to speak for the devil. Adam, however, relishes the opportunity to speak the words of another as his own. As in the cases of Eve and Raphael, the dramatic potential of this moment is too often unrecognized. How does Adam look and sound when he suddenly begins to act in the role of archfiend? Does he exclaim like a Roman orator and make elaborate gestures? Does he extend an index finger toward his chest when he says “Me first / He ruined,” feeling perhaps the thrill of being not entirely himself? But again, if Satan will never be able to say these words, then the “me” Adam points to can in the end be no one but himself. It is hardly surprising that in the very next line he consents to the formal act of sin, telling Eve: “I with thee have fixed my lot” (9.952).<br>

Abstract: The working of metaphor in
      The Duchess of Malfiand other early modern tragedies lays the foundation for the genre’s and the culture’s representations of violence. The associative and interpretive aspects of metaphor create discourse communities that understand pain as a meaningful experience with affective consequences beyond physical empathy. As a result, all forms of violence are potentially meaningful or even coercive. InThe Duchess of Malfi, the tortures Ferdinand proposes for his sister and Antonio are made meaningful through metaphor, as he imagines forms of violence that target the aspects of her crime that he finds most repulsive:
            The coal-pit scenario stems from a reaction against the possibility that heaven might bless their marriage, as suggested by the Duchess during the actual
               
         
                  
               I would have their bodies
                  Burn’t in a coale-pit, with the ventage stop’d,
                  That their curs’d smoake might not ascend to Heaven:
                  Or dippe the sheetes they lie in, in pitch or sulphure,
                  Wrap them in’t, and then light them like a match:
                  Or else to boile their Bastard to a cullisse [strong broth],
                  And give’t his leacherous father, to renew
                  The sinne of his backe.

The burning imagery from both this and the following vision recall the characterization of lust as a fire that consumes an individual, making it appropriate that Ferdinand would use the sheets from their bed as a tool of murder. The murder of the child becomes an indictment of the lust that created it as well as an echo of the ghastly practice of feeding a parent his or her own children seen in Seneca’sThyestesand Shakespeare’sTitus Andronicusas perhaps the ultimate form of revenge.

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D.<br>
Abstract: In recent years autobiographies have become ever more highly esteemed as sources for historical research. At the same time, more and more historians have themselves published their life stories. Jeremy D. Popkin analyzes both tendencies in this study on history, historians, and autobiography. He has read more than 300 autobiographies, mainly by English and American historians but also including French, German, Dutch, and Italian works. Popkin makes clear that this is a very interesting body of texts, because historians who have turned into autobiographers unconsciously demolish the existing wall between historiography and autobiography. When in the nineteenth century truth and objectivity became the professional standard among historians, the genre of autobiography fell into disgrace and was left to literary critics. Historians writing their life stories are, on the one hand, bound to the rules of this narrative and literary form, but, on the other hand, they are dedicated to the professional standards of their discipline. In fact, they are aware that their autobiographies are likely to be read more critically than those written by members of other professions. Their own life story should reinforce their historical work by showing truth and credibility.<br>

Author(s): Gutterman David S.<br>
Abstract: Gutterman pairs Sunday with King, focusing on their sermons and speeches. His readings are sharp and detailed, and his solid historiography sits alongside the work of David Chappell or Clifford Putney. The chapters on PK and CTR are well written but contain misunderstandings of each group's political orientations. Gutterman briefly outlines PK's declension narrative involving the breakdown of the “nuclear family”; but this begs for further comparative work, as he does not engage the 1970s architects of this narrative (e.g. Richard Viguerie), nor does he make sufficient use of literature on gender and religion. He also mishandles some of PK's political complexities, asserting that PK “has a political vision, and proclaims a political theology” (p. 99) even as its members see “no reason for democratic politics” (p. 125). In fact, PK do not dismiss politics altogether; politics are simply seen as serving a different purpose than evangelism. In other words, the relations among oft‐used terms like “politics,” “democratic politics,” and “political theology” are at times imprecisely articulated.<br>

Abstract: It could in fact be argued that not even the divinity or divinities called Elohim, whose function it is to separate, exist in any other sphere of the real; as Paul Beauchamp also observes: “Au lieu d’être séparé dans un lieu sacré correspondant à une partie du monde, Dieu est séparant. Au lieu qu’il soit lui-même à part, c’est le sacré qui prend la fonction de séparer et de compartimenter. Il y a là un type de pénétration négative dans le monde ainsi égalisé qui complète nécessairement la notion de transcendance” (

Abstract: Ibid., 255. In fact, as Craig reports, in the case of one of such structures—dining room/kitchen building—the client's intent—eventually abandoned—was to have it designed by the contractor's in-house draftspeople. This intention was due to Maybeck's overall tendency to excessive structural design of Principia buildings (ibid., 226–28).<br>

Article Title: The Apparatus of the Dark: Emily Dickinson and the Epistemology of Metaphor<br>
Publisher: The University of California Press<br>
Issue: ncl.2012.67.issue-1<br>
Date: 6 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: This essay argues that Emily Dickinson’s poetry intervenes in the broad cultural assessment of epistemology provoked by the evolutionary debates of the 1860s. While scholars have begun to explore the thematic correspondences between Dickinson’s poetry and some aspects of this cultural conversation, this essay examines the ways in which her intervention occurs at the level of poetic form and is in fact profoundly dependent upon form. Specifically, it analyzes a set of her poems from the early 1860s through the early 1870s in which she uses the dual structure of metaphor to elicit a way of thinking about truth that is aligned with the empirical methods of research that were widely embraced in the mid nineteenth century; however, in the face of an increasingly contingent notion of truth, Dickinson’s way of thinking significantly revises cultural assumptions about what those methods might yield. The metaphors examined here amplify the distinctions between two material entities—lightning and fork, or sunset and lilac, for example—rather than merging them or leaping beyond them to stable, transcendent meaning. What Dickinson plays with is the possibility of a revised version of revelation or truth, one that is not only derived from the observation of material difference through the two parts of a metaphor, but that is more radically contingent on the perpetuity of such dual perception. Altogether, Dickinson’s metaphors are both critical and recuperative, as they contribute to the dismantling of fixed truth while embracing the limited revelations made possible by—
         onlymade possible by—sustained process.<br>

Abstract: Abstract:The fact that classical and early medieval allegorical personifications were exclusively female has long perplexed literary scholars and rhetoricians. Although arguments have been made about this gendering using grammatical formalism for the most part, an examination of rhetoric's own deep structure—that is, the discursive metaphors it has always employed to talkabouttropes and figures—promises to better articulate the gendered bases of the figure. Using analytical tactics drawn from Paul de Man's discussions of prosopopeia, this essay re-examines some of the rhetorical record along with programmatic imagery from patristic writings in order to demonstrate how women theinselves could serve as the "figures of figuration."<br>

Abstract: The cross-cultural program of research presented here is about matters of temporal persistence-personal persistence and cultural persistence-and about solution strategies for solving the paradox of "sameness-in-change." The crux of this paradox resides in the fact that, on threat of otherwise ceasing to be recognizable as a self, all of us must satisfy at least two constitutive conditions. The first of these is that selves are obliged to keep moving or die, and, so, must continually change. The second is that selves must also somehow remain the same, lest all notions of moral responsibility and any commitment to an as yet unrealized future become nonsensical. Although long understood as a problem demanding the attention of philosophers, we argue that this same paradox arises in the ordinary course of identity development and dictates the different developmental routes taken by culturally mainstream and Aboriginal youth in coming to the identity-preserving conclusion that they and others are somehow continuous through time. Findings from a set of five studies are presented. The first and second studies document the development and refinement of a method for parsing and coding what young people say on the topic of personal persistence or self-continuity. Both studies demonstrate that it is not only possible to seriously engage children as young as age 9 or 10 years in detailed and codable discussions about personal persistence, but that their reasoning concerning such matters typically proceeds in an orderly and increasingly sophisticated manner over the course of their early identity development. Our third study underscores the high personal costs of failing to sustain a workable sense of personal persistence by showing that failures to warrant self-continuity are strongly associated with increased suicide risk in adolescence. Study four documents this same relation between continuity and suicide, this time at the macrolevel of whole cultures, and shows that efforts ~<br>

Abstract: Anyone who wishes to understand the debate between Hegel and Schleiermacher is forced to confront not only the staggering complexity of their thought but also the disparate nature of the key texts which are available and the fact that many philosophers and theologians approach Hegel and Schleiermacher with misleading preconceptions. This article attempts to illuminate the conflict between the two thinkers by exploring the biographical and historical context in which it arose. The author argues that, while neither thinker depended upon the other in forming his own position, each man kept the other's position constantly in view as a foil for his own. After a consideration of some early indications of conflict, the debate between Hegel and Schleiermacher is traced through a series of events which begins with Hegel's call to Berlin. While Schleiermacher was apparently quite willing to have Hegel come to Berlin, differences in political philosophy soon led to conflict, with the student movement providing a concrete focus for their disagreement. Schleiermacher's role in excluding Hegel from the Berlin Academy of Sciences is shown to have heightened the tensions. The article concludes with an exploration of Hegel's critique of Schleiermacher's dogmatics. It is argued that the intellectual core of the conflict between the two men centers upon the problem of immediate knowledge.<br>

Article Title: The First Evil Will Must Be Incomprehensible: A Critique of Augustine<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263713<br>
Date: 9 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Teselle Robert F.<br>
Abstract: The thesis of this paper is that an absolute origin of evil, arising from the free will of a creature, must be incomprehensible. Although Augustine occasionally acknowledges this point, nevertheless in a number of better-known passages (chiefly in The City of God) he attempts to give a causal account of the fall of Adam and/or Satan. Much of the subsequent Christian tradition has unfortunately followed his lead, and major recent commentators routinely ignore or passively approve of his conceptual error. Augustine offers three unacceptable explanations of the fall, which conflict variously with his own doctrines of divine omnipotence, the goodness of creation, and creaturely free will and responsibility, as well as violating the canons of sound argumentation and explanation. First, his contention that free creatures made "out of nothing" inevitably fall makes the fall seem ontologically necessary (unfree) and thereby lays the ultimate responsibility for it on the Creator. Second, the appeal to pride as an explanation is a spurious causal account, for "pride" is only a synonym for "fallenness" itself and not a possible antecedent condition in a being created good and not yet fallen. Finally, his assertion that the first sin is intrinsically comprehensible, but not comprehensible to us because we are fallen, is an obfuscation masquerading as an explanation, for we have no warrant for supposing that this assertion is true or even meaningful. Instead of seeking causal explanation Augustine should have stayed with his own wiser observation that an evil will has no efficient cause. Theology of the Augustinian sort (which comprises much of the Christian tradition) ought to concede that the fall as a work of genuine freedom is an absurd "fact," an incomprehensible given which steadfastly and in principle resists causal explanation. The concluding section of the paper draws upon Ricoeur's insights to tell why the narrative structure of the "Adamic myth" (which has important p~<br>

Abstract: Using George Bataille's reflections on desire, death, and God as the basis for considering the love poetry of the Song of Songs as a manifestation of the commingling of separate realms and separate bodies in the service of a longed-for continuity helps us to see that such a commingling is never far from the domain of violence and that such continuity of being is never far from death. But the biblical book itself helps us to see something that is missing from Bataille's analysis-that is, a more complex understanding of the implications of desire for the divine. What if, contra Bataille, God were not "by definition" immune to risk? What if the divine were not understood to be perfection but, rather, bound as well to the vicissitudes of desire, with all the anguish and ecstasy that it implies? The Song of Song's lyrical presentation of Eros, carried over as it is into the tradition of allegorical interpretation, may, in fact, have rather profound implications for how we talk about God.<br>

Abstract: Creativity is seen as inherent in the developmental potential of the individual and of society as well. This "yen for becoming" is felt at all ages, and is in fact recognized as associated with the realization of the profoundest aspirations of man. Its origin is detected in early childhood. It is deeply rooted in the associative trend of thought and action, a trend which tends to perpetuate itself in the direction of unending abundance and novelty. The process assumes passage from awareness to memory, and even to the subconscious. The thought of the moment dips into the past, awakens memories, even those seemingly forgotten, reactivates all that is pertinent for the creation of new structures. It is believed that this tendency is essentially dynamic, endowed with energy which drives toward endless realizations. Nothing dies in the subconscious, as Freud pointed out. Each past experience is apt to return into consciousness and engage in a double process of homogenization and heterogenization, of convergent and divergent currents. Here the combinations, or commutations and permutations, are indefinite, an array which defies any computer. Creativity calls into play all energized experiences, present and stored, cognitive and affective, perceptual and conceptual, sensory and motoric, verbal and non-verbal, taxonomic and functional, real and symbolic; it constantly provokes new patterns. The richer the content of experience, the greater the possibility of innovation. The creative construction starts with the activation of readily available knowledge, the elements of which trigger related material in the memory and the subconscious. The movement is derived from active associations that continue to connect the units, and is oriented toward specific goals, leading to eventual syntheses, which may be expressed in either action or discourse. Here we face an unfurling, which coincides with interpretation, the unlocking of the new meaning built from the past upon the first mean~<br>

Abstract: This article explores Derrida's relation to Hebraism and Hellenism in terms of negative theology. Derrida's work has recently been claimed by theologians attempting to reintegrate it into a Christian discourse by way of negative theology. This essay argues that Derrida's critique of the Greek tradition of metaphysics cannot be reappropriated by theology and in fact sets out to expose traditional negative theology as essentially metaphysical and open to its critique. At the same time, the essay questions and explores to what extent Derrida's work can be claimed as Hebraic, as a distinct and nonmetaphysical tradition.<br>

Author(s): Brockelman Paul<br>
Abstract: The new scientific cosmology which has emerged over the past forty years seems to be forcing philosophers and theologians alike to rethink the traditional theistic conception of God in which God is pictured as a First Cause designer of the universe in favor of what Joseph Campbell more mystically calls an "immanent ground of being, transcendent of conceptualization." The central thrust of these reflections is that we encounter that "immanent ground of being" through the experience of wonder and awe. Since actual experience is involved, then a phenomenological description of exactly what it is in the new cosmology (and the universe) which induces such wonder is possible. The basic thesis is that we experience wonder in the face of the remarkable and transcendent (beyond finite predicates and understanding) coming-into-being of nature over twelve to fifteen billion years. Wonder is the human reaction to and appreciation for the astounding fact that nature and all of its parts actually are. It is; we are; such is the ineffable beyond in our midst.<br>

Abstract: It has recently been claimed (1) that mental states such as beliefs are theoretical entities and (2) that they are therefore, in principle, subject to theoretical elimination if intentional psychology were to be supplanted by a psychology not employing mentalistic notions. Debate over these two issues is seriously hampered by the fact that the key terms 'theoretical' and 'belief' are ambiguous. This article argues that there is only one sense of 'theoretical' that is of use to the eliminativist, and in this sense some kinds of "belief" (dispositional states, infra-conscious states and the Freudian unconscious) are indeed "theoretical" and hence possible candidates for elimination, while others (consciously occurring thoughts like judgements and perceptual Gestalten) are not theoretical and hence not candidates for elimination.<br>

Abstract: As a tool for understanding the world in which we live the study of the history of political thought is stunted because of a preoccupation with the Western canon as the history of political thought to the exclusion of other histories and traditions. This ongoing exclusion is itself facilitated by a deeply entrenched select reading of the Western canon; a reading that overlooks a tendency within the canon to not just ignore but suppress and dismiss the value of other accounts of history and traditions of thought. An opening of the Western mind to these assumed to be alien traditions of social, legal and political thought reveals that, in the global market place of ideas, these purportedly competing and non-compatible traditions of thought might in fact have considerably more in common than what sets them apart: thus opening the way for an authentic inter-civilisational dialogue that focuses more on co-operation and less on clashes.<br>

Author(s): Mattingly Cheryl<br>
Abstract: In this article I consider "narrative mind reading," the practical capability of inferring the motives that precipitate and underlie the actions of others. Following Jerome Bruner, I argue that this everyday capacity depends on our ability to place action within unfolding narrative contexts. While Bruner has focused on narrative mind reading as a within-culture affair, I look to border situations that cross race and class lines where there is a strong presumption among participants that they do not, in fact, share a cultural framework. Instead, interactions often reinforce actors' perceptions of mutual misunderstanding and cultural difference. Drawing on a longitudinal study of African American families who have children with severe illnesses, I examine narrative mind reading and misreading in one mother's interactions with the clinicians who treat her child. I further explore how narrative misreadings are supported through chart notes and "familiar stranger" stories. The focus on miscommunication grounds a theory of the reproduction of cultural difference in interactive dynamics and brings Bruner's emphasis on narrative into dialogue with contemporary anthropology of cultural borderlands.<br>

Abstract: The idea that we can properly be held responsible for what we believe underlies large stretches of our social and institutional life; without that idea in place, social and institutional life would be unthinkable, and more importantly, it would stumble and fall. At the same time, philosophers have argued that this idea is strange, puzzling, beyond belief, false, meaningless or at any rate defective. The first section develops the alleged problem. The burden of this paper, however, is not to discuss the merits of this idea but rather to measure the damage in case the idea turns out to be defective indeed. This is done by substantiating the claim that this idea indeed underlies large and important stretches of our social and institutional life. Section 2 substantiates that claim by presenting the results of a web search on the use of what I call "deontological epistemic expressions", i.e. expressions in which deontological and epistemological notions (both broadly construed) are combined; examples are "obligation to believe", "not permitted to forget", "right to know". The ubiquitous use of these expressions, I argue, is linguistic evidence for the claim that the contested idea indeed pervades our social life. Linguistic evidence, however, can be frail and misleading. From the fact that we say that the shade is moving we cannot conclude that shades really exist; likewise it may not be permitted to conclude from the ubiquitous use of deontological epistemic expressions that there really are doxastic obligations (and hence doxastic responsibilities). The third section, therefore, moves beyond the linguistic evidence and discusses two social institutions, viz. education and law as we find them in modern Western societies, and argues that they cannot be made sense of unless the contested idea is in place. Educational and legal systems of course vary greatly throughout the Western world. Such differences as exist, however, are irrelevant for the claim I will be making in t~<br>

mances of History, Ithaca-London, Cornell University Press, 1988. Dice Petrey: "As exempli-
fied in S/Z, the critical debate on realism posits a dichotomy between radical indeterminacy and
complete certainty. Textual meaning is either guaranteed by an extratextual referent to be fixed,
stable, and unquestionable or detached from every extratextual presence to become shifting,
ephemeral, and unknowable. From the point of view of such critics as Lukács, realism repre-
sents a world ontologically independent of the terms in which it is represented; for Barthes and
Johnson, ontological independence is a myth concealing the fact that representation can never
depict anything except its own artifices", p. 55.<br>

Abstract: In Sumatra's Angkola Batak culture, rituals celebrating major kinship-related events such as marriage have many layers of social and symbolic meaning; they have political, kinship, musical, mythic, and philosophical dimensions as lengthy, oratory-filled ceremonies that unite wife-giving lineages with wife-receivers. This article examines several ways that the interpretive approach that is discussed in the introduction can help students of Indonesian ritual grasp diverse aspects of Batak marriage rituals such as their hidden symbolic organization and their practical political implications. The article deals with a short sequence of adat dance staged for anthropological research purposes. (Adat, once translated as customary law, roughly means Angkola ceremonial life, kinship norms, and political thought; adat is eminently flexible, redefined by each Batak generation.) The choreography of the dance (wife-receivers dancing with wife-givers), songs, clothing, the political biographies of the participants, and the fact that the event was staged render the ceremony open to both structural and social contextual inquiry.<br>

Abstract: Caryl Phillips's narrative is painfully concerned with the relationship of Empire, Colony, and the In-between; Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean; slavery, rebellion, and freedom; Men, women and children; absent or useless fathers and damaged, aimless sons. It explores what hold in common while never losing sight of the painful quotidian, the specific. It is a narrative where the picaresque shakes hands with the epic and the linearity is broken, encircled, and put fast forward or in reverse by a mise-en-abîme of sorts: the tale-within-the-tale-within-the-tale even if interrupted by the tapestry of an emergent voice that finally proposes itself as both the identity and the difference of its verbal universe. "Enter your own self and discover the world," Phillips seems to be saying, "but also go out into the world and discover yourself." Once that call is answered, fiction itself becomes another way of questioning truth as we strive for it through the paradox of a lie. That lie can be called the imagination. It can also be seen as a parallel reality. For it may be observed as a critical mirror of what passes for the truth in the world of convention. It certainly sets up a second universe of being, where the narrator, say Cambridge in Cambridge, has a reality greater, though no less important, than the host of hastily met and then forgotten people we deal with on a daily basis. It is in this sense that Phillips brings into light another way of telling in that his narrative gives weight and presence to the virtues and vices—the fugitive personalities—of our daily acquaintance. This is the prerogative of his style, which I try to discuss in this essay. It has the power to render disenchantment and pleasure without resolving the contradiction between them. In fact, what holds them in tension, as equal forces straining in opposite directions, is the artist's mature subjectivity, stripped of hubris, unashamed either of its fallibility or of the modest assurance it has gained ~<br>

Abstract: This essay is a comparative study of the tributes paid to the American philosopher John Rawls, in France and the United States, after his death in November 2010. Whereas in the U.S. tributes to Rawls appeared in scholarly journals, in France they did in political magazines and general interest media. Besides, the focus in U.S. journals on Rawls's philosophical commitments is at odds with the emphasis placed by the French media on the political interpretations of his theory of justice. The contrast between Rawls's French and U.S. "funerals" is a consequence of the way intellectual fields in France and the U.S. differ in their relation to politics. While Rawls conformed with what was expected of him in the American academia by staying away from politics almost all his life, he was seen in France as an intellectuel engagé, the typical figure of intellectual life since the Dreyfus case. The contrast between the French and American reactions to Rawls's death is also related to the fact that those who first got interested in his theory of justice in France were supporters of the anti-totalitarian left or center-right, rather than academic philosophers.<br>

Abstract: When analysing the concept of social relationship, the link between a person and an individual, who from a sociological perspective do not have the same semantic value, needs to be reconsidered as whole. As an individual is typically enclosed in a social dimension, it cannot have a self-referential character. Instead, it tends to half-reveal the authentic foundation of the civil society on the basis of a range of values which, after leading to the recognition of the self, activate relationships with the social other and the rest of the world including the transcendental one. In fact, within the opening relationship it's possible to find the conscience of own existence, to purchase the awareness of own identities and to become responsible of own world of life. Considering the aspects of sociological compromise and moral quality of the afore-going, it is clear that socio-cultural exchanges — where relationship skills come clearly into play — are the heuristic foundation of the complex relationship between individuals and society. Consequently, such exchanges become social dynamics through which affective similarities and legitimate differences interact to build an ethical balance for society as well as support a differentiated development of social bonds.<br>

Abstract: Death and futility are among a cluster of themes that closely track discussions of life's meaning. Moreover, futility is thought to supervene on naturalistic meta-narratives because of how they will end. While the nature of naturalistic meta-narrative endings is part of the explanation for concluding that such meta-narratives are cosmically or deeply futile, this explanation is truncated. I argue that the reason the nature of the ending is thought to be normatively important is first anchored in the fact that narrative ending qua ending is thought to be normatively important. Indeed, I think futility is often thought to characterize naturalistic meta-narratives because a narrative's ending has significant proleptic power to elicit a wide range of broadly normative human responses on, possibly, emotional, aesthetic, and moral levels towards the narrative as a whole.<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mank~<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: This article considers the function of the mashal (parable) in Rabbinic literature and the connection between the use to which the mashal is put in that literature and the literary form it takes. Following a consideration of the contexts, narrative and exegetical, in which the mashal appears in midrashic and talmudic literature, three disctinct models for the form are proposed: (1) As a didactic tool, whose form is exoteric and relies largely on figurative language that illustrates the ideas the parable teaches. (2) As an instrument of sectarian doctrine, often esoteric in its form, and one which closely resembles allegory and seeks to disguise its message if not to hide it. (3) As a homiletical device with the form of an allusive tale told for an ulterior purpose, in order to persuade its audience of a certain inexplicit message. The article suggests that the mashal in Rabbinic literature generally falls into the third category, and that the messages it seeks to persuade are mainly on the order of praise or blame (or a subtype of praise or blame, like apologetics, polemics, eulogy, or complaint). Examples of meshalim for several of these categories are briefly discussed. The article concludes with a detailed analysis of the meshal found in Lamentations Rabba 3, 21. This is a praise-mashal whose narrative also suggests a certain kind of blame and, in effect, allows the mashal to be read in two ways. On the basis of this analysis, it is suggested that the rhetorical richness of the mashal derives in part from the tension between the mashal's function and its narrative complexity, and that the popularity of the form was a result of the fact that the use of narrative in the mashal allowed the Rabbis to express certain feelings and attitudes that other, more prosaic, midrashic literary forms could not convey.<br>

Abstract: La réception des Formes parmi les catholiques a été à la fois importante — comme en témoignent le nombre et la qualité d'ensemble des recensions —, plutôt courtoise de ton et très critique sur le fond. De Loisy (qui a fourni des arguments à ses anciens coreligionnaires) à Lucien Laberthonnière, il n'a rencontré parmi les catholiques que des contradicteurs qui se sont montrés très attentifs, dans la lignée des controverses à propos du modernisme, aux problèmes de méthode que posait sa pensée. Plus encore qu'au contexte tendu du début du siècle qui n'a certes pas facilité les choses, cette fin de non-recevoir était surtout due au caractère très contre-intuitif de sa pensée pour des croyants, à l'ampleur de ses ambitions théoriques et à son prophétisme latent. Il a fallu attendre que la conjoncture s'apaise et que sa pensée se décante chez ses disciples, dans l'entre-deux-guerres, pour qu'un savant catholique comme Gabriel Le Bras puisse en faire l'une des sources d'inspiration de son travail. The reception of the Forms among Catholics was important — as evidenced by the amount and quality of the reviews —, courteous (overall) and extremely critical. From Loisy (who, in this case, gave ammunition to his former coreligionists) to Lucien Laberthonniere, he met, among Catholics, only opponents who were very attentive, in the modernism controversy tradition, to the methodological problems prompted by his thoughts. This negative response was not only due to the tension of the turn of the century that did not help matters, but also mainly to the fact that his thoughts were highly counter-intuitive for believers, just as his theoretical ambitions and latent prophetism. It was not until the situation calmed down and his thoughts started to settle with his disciples, during the inter-war period, that a Catholic scholar like Gabriel Le Bras was able to turn him into a source of inspiration for his work.

Abstract: Nietzsche's impact on educational thought has always been surprisingly neglected, possibly because it is hard to divorce his educational views from his philosophical endeavour, as a whole which has given rise to considerable scholarly polemics during the last few decades. Recently several articles propagating various interpretations of Nietzsche's educational teaching have been published Their main weakness lies in the fact that Nietzsche's central educational theses are discussed quite apart from his "psychological" philosophy, while it is the philosophy that serves as the necessary background for understanding those theses. The present paper, mainly analyzing nietzsche's essay "Schopenhauer as Educator", will attempt to provide a better insight into Nietzsche's early psychological and pedagogic thought. It will also demonsrate those basic criteria implicit in his method of psychologization, which at the very outset had served Nietzsche as an educational means of testing the integrity of certain examplary personalities. Nietzsche's Educational Thought is established in the service of authenticity — a central and influential Existentialist concept, the main ideas of which are explicated in the paper. Another Nietzschean concept, much negleted yet significant, that of the "Higher-Self", is elaborated and compared to Freud's parallel notion of the "Super-Ego".<br>

Abstract: "La dérive d'une vie," that of the hero in En rade, is metaphorized by the dérive of narrative, composed of a complex network of metaphors. In 1893, Paul Souriau proposed that metaphor makes a fleeting representation pass into the unconscious. Dreams and hysteria, states in which the unconscious holds sway, are of considerable importance in this text. An analysis of the way that metaphor works will shed light on the relationships between dream and reality, and between consciousness and the unconscious in general. The double fil of extended metaphor is also metaphorized as a bifurcating road, the road of narrative and the labyrinthine path the hero's thoughts take. In fact, route or chemin is not only a metaphor for the text and for extended metaphor itself, but also for the complex pathways of the nerves and brain. If the road or path of narrative is also a representation of nerves/brain, then retracing these pathways of metaphors would be a way of following the text's attempt to dissect the brain and uncover the links between dream and reality, the double sphere of activity that characterizes this novel.<br>

Abstract: The author studies systematically the internal criteria which he considers most valid, in so far as they are critically established, for providing access through the gospels to Jesus and for guaranteeing the historical authenticity of his life and message. After placing the problem of establishing valid criteria (la critériologie) in the context of the current critical study of the gospels and offering a number of critical observations designed to avoid confusions (especially the distinction between pure data, criteria and proof; between literary and historical criteria; between criteria and the intellectual attitudes that thereby follow), the author presents and discusses seven criteria which he groups under three headings: basic criteria (critères fondamentaux), dependent criteria (critères dérivés), and composite criteria (critères mixtes). Among the basic criteria he discusses: 1. the criterion of multiple testimony, together with the principal objection which can be raised against it, i.e. the extent to which one can speak of independent sources with regard to the gospels since all derive from oral tradition; 2. the criterion of discontinuity, considered on the levels of form and content; 3. the criterion of conformity (or of continuity or coherence), including the different formulations which contemporary exegetes propose, as well as its connections with the criterion of discontinuity; 4. the criterion of required explanation (explication nécessaire) or of sufficient reason for a group of convergent and well-attested facts. As an example of a dependent criterion called such since it is established in relation to the basic criteria, the author proposes the living, personal style of Jesus as distinguished from the gospels' literary style. Finally, among the composite criteria, that is to say the cases where an important literary characteristic is linked with one or several historical criteria, he mentions: the internal intelligibility of an account or of a group~<br>

Author(s): Schmidinger Heinrich M.<br>
Abstract: The relationship between Sören Kierkegaard and Johann Gottlieb Fichte has been a desideratum of philosophical inquiry for a considerable time. And this for two reasons: firstly, we do not know enough about Kierkegaard's relationship to German idealism, as long as we limit ourselves to the relationship of Kierkegaard-Hegel or Kierkegaard-Schelling. Secondly, there are quite a number of publications, which see in Fichte the most noteworthly intellectual relationship to Kierkegaard within the framework of idealism. It is necessary therefore to raise the following questions: what can we determine from the texts and historical material, which we possess, about Kierkegaard's relationship to Fichte? Is the opinion justified that Fichte is intellectually related to Kierkegaard? The present article's research gives the following answers to these questions: historically speaking there are again and again texts in which Kierkegaard relates to Fichte. Particulary for the early years, a certain occupation with him cannot be denied. As a matter of fact a whole series of formal agreements cannot be overlooked. Nevertheless there can be no question of a real meeting of minds. Fichte was merely an occasion for Kierkegaard to form his own philosophy, in no way however an intellectual partner. This historical result in no way excludes the possibility of comparing Kierkegaard and Fichte on the same intellectual level. Seen from this point of view there is actually a certain reason in establishing an intellectual relationship in the secondary literature. But nevertheless the differences outweigh the agreements. This can not only be ascertained fundamentally insofar as both come from a completely different understanding of reality, but also as regards their concept of subjectivity. Especially, as far as the structures, which ascertain the self-realization of the subjectivity, are concerned, the differences are particulary noticeable. With this result one does not however intend to say, t~<br>

Issue: i23653923<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Taylor Betsy<br>
Abstract: The global justice movement reveals a diverse array of emergent publics striving politically for a sustainable world. Working partly from John Dewey, we try to illuminate democratic grounds for knowledge and action in these endeavors. We begin by situating Dewey's ideas in the politics of American history, especially historian John Diggins' countervailing approach to issues of authority, knowledge and opinion. Diggins, against Robert Westbrook and others, contends that Dewey's philosophy of politics chased radical democratic illusions, whereas he might have learned from Charles S. Peirce to uphold the boundary between professional communities and other entities including democratic publics. Dewey saw no democratic alternative to harness the political energy of ordinary people. We argue that Dewey had come to understand that a corporate state system of political economy had come to engulf both the liberal democratic polity and the professions. Dewey's political challenge to the professions and his illumination of the aesthetic ecology of democratic publics prefigure a democratic republican alternative that opens up a new basis for participation in the global justice movement confronting, among other obstacles, a transnational corporate state based in the USA. A Marxist-progressivist notion of the ongoing socialization of markets by corporate capitalism too often reinforces an anti-Populist intellectual sensibility that is coupled with, whether wittingly or not, either a social-democratic elitism or a revolutionary vanguardism. Globalization struggles need, on the contrary, a pragmatic vision of democratic publics instituting a true diversity of policies assuring a world-in-common. The fight for public spaces in the treacherous politics of civil society and global consumerism is a struggle against subjectivization. The fact that corporate state elitism, in the U.S. context, feeds on a rightist version of nationaism does not mean we can junk the history of democratic s~<br>

Abstract: On démontrera en particulier que le caractère strictement phénoménologique de la psychanalyse existentielle permet non seulement de dépasser la forme traditionnelle de la métapsychologie psychanalytique et le caractère reificateur de ses concepts, mais encore que celle ci a même anticipé la problématique specifiquement narcissique de Kohut. Le fait que cette psychanalyse existentielle puisse formuler les problèmes de manière plus adèquate en raison de son approche phénomenologique n'exclut pas que, inversement, la théorie narcissique puisse à son tour crtiquer la psychanalyse existentielle, là où celle ci tend à poser les états psychopathologiques comme structures d'être. Cet article se termine par une considération critique sur le manque de place que la théorie narcissique accorde à la sexualité et sur l'apolitisme radical de celle ci qui la démarque de la théorie sartrienne et de son évolution philosophique. First it is demonstrated that the strictly phenomenological approach of existential psychoanalysis is able to overcome the traditional form of the Freudian psychoanalytical metapsychology by means of its concretizing terms. Then it is pointed out that existential psychoanalysis has been anticipating problems, especially in the field of Kohut's theory of narcissism. The fact that it can illustrate these problems more adequately because of its phenomenological approach does not mean that the other way round the theory of narcissism cannot criticize the existential psychoanalysis — that is to say in its tendency towards attributing a psychopathological state to patterns of being. Lastly critical remarks are made regarding the diminution of sexuality in the theory of narcissism as well as its apolitical sealing — off — the latter being in contrast to the further development of Sartre's philosophy.<br>

Publisher: Franz Steiner Verlag<br>
Issue: i23676356<br>
Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Cerar Miro<br>
Abstract: The law is, on the one hand, always to some extent an expression of the dominant political power and ideology, while on the other hand it is relatively autonomous towards politics and other value-normative social phenomena, such as morality, customs, and religion. Despite the fact that from the deepest ontological perspective the separate existence of law and politics is an illusion, this separation must be acknowledged and maintained in our social life. The more autonomous the law, the more it develops its specific ideology. The latter can either serve as an appropriate counterbalance to the excessive tendencies of politics, or it can be abused for different political purposes. In the first case, we can speak about the constructive role of the law vs. politics, while in the second case its role is (self)destructive. In the first case different checks and balances between law and politics serve democratic society, while in the second case the differences between both phenomena are blurred, which leads to authoritarianism or totalitarianism.<br>

Abstract: Contre les excès de l'individualisme libéral et l'incapacité des politiques sociales de résoudre les problèmes, les communautariens proposent de reconstruire le modèle social sur le lien intercommunautaire. Critiquant le modèle libéral/universaliste de dénier toute diversité au profit de l'individu prétendument neutre mais qui ne représente en fait que les préoccupations d'un homme blanc et hétérosexuel, ils proposent un modèle de la reconnaissance centré sur la "reconnaissance de la valeur égale" de chaque culture. Mais face à la question multiculturelle, leur attitude n'est pas dépourvue ambiguïtés, ce qui entraîne des risques de discrimination, d'affrontement et de violence. Against the excesses of liberal individualism and the incapacity of social policies to resolve the resulting problems, communitarians suggest rebuilding social relations on the basis of an intercommunitarian link. Criticizing the liberal/universalist model because it denies diversity for the sake of individualism (which claims to be neutral, but in fact represents the interests of White and Black heterosexual man), communitarians propose a model of recognition based on the "acknowledgment of equal value" of every culture. However when facing multicultural issues, their attitude tends to become ambiguous and involves risks of discrimination, and thus of confrontation and, ultimately, violence.<br>

Abstract: This paper, a reply to Professor R. S. Downie's criticisms of our paper 'A Political Critique of Kantian Ethics in Social Work', both appearing in BJSW 19, 6, tries to answer the main charge against us of illegitimately bridging the logical gap between statements of value and statements of fact. In addition to this, we explicate further our original arguments that language and power are indissolubly bound to each other, and that a Kantian approach to social work theory and practice fails in trying to dissolve that relationship by finding a neutral, universal ground from which to derive ethical principles and judgements.<br>

Abstract: Many contemporary liberals increasingly accept that plural societies must aspire to far more expansive and inclusive ideals of justice and citizenship than liberal doctrine would suggest. The dominant perception is that extending the set of rights is the most effective way to implement a just and stable multicultural society. In fact, this is not a very plausible description of what people seek in demanding greater respect for diversity. Nor does it offer a compelling vision of how things ought to be. First, social expectations regarding recognition are not uniquely linked to rights; they encompass intractable struggles over values, as well as ways of living and evaluating. For example, a central feature of feminist, black and multicultural politics is the attempt to change social culture into a medium through which personal integrity and self-esteem may be acquired. Second, liberalism cannot easily accommodate this type of struggle, since it takes for granted a narrowly constricted conception of politics that is based on instituting public laws that harmonize the freedom of everyone. Anyone who takes seriously the idea that recognition surpasses legal relations of respect will then surely wish to consider whether liberalism must not be corrected and extended to reveal the political significance of the social conditions that enable individuals to experience themselves as both autonomous and individuated.<br>

Abstract: The article of M. Lilla marks the political position of Derrida in the context of French philosophy since Sartre. Presenting him as an engaged opponent of existentialism and structuralism Lilla shows that Derrida's vehement philosophical fight is directed fundamentally against what he calls the logocentrism of all western philosophy. Derrida's only remedy against this disease: deconstruction of the language. In applying this recipe himself, Derrida ends at a somewhat mysterious one and only notion, the concept of justice, which according to him is not destructible and should not be destructed. The provocative explanation Lilla gives for the surprising fact, that Derrida's most fervent adherents live in the United States is the unlimited self-confidence and good nature of the Americans.<br>

Abstract: The curriculum for biblical studies in the Israeli public high school system is designated by the official program of the ministry of education to be taught along essentially critical lines based on historical-philological research tools. The aim of this article is to expound on the cultural consequences and hermeneutical problems which are a direct product of this prescription, with emphasis on three major points: first, the fact that the official program of studies has completely disregarded contemporary hermeneutical approaches; second, the import of this hermeneutic deficiency given a literal reading of the biblical text which is meager in descriptive details but is hermeneutically saturated; third, the cultural status of the Bible class as sole agent of socialization pertaining to Jewish knowledge in Israeli public high-schools.<br>

Abstract: The problem that Petrarch's Canzoniere poses for the modern reader is the same as that posed by all collections of poems assembled by their author: it is a matter of understanding the connection between each of the poems and the collection, the relation between the whole and the parts. On the one hand, the collection presents a discontinuous series of poems composed separately that can be read as discrete works; on the other hand, the same poems come together as part of a love and/or existential story. Our task is to study the Canzoniere as a macrotext and to clarify the relation of each of the compositions to the collection of lyric verse to which it belongs. Petrarch's desperate attempt to complete his work is the same hopeless challenge that the mythical Arachne dared to make to Minerva. At the deepest level Petrarch reveals an awareness of the fact that every human endeavor is a spider's web that is woven in the course of a lifetime, and thus is never completed. The destiny of human beings therefore is to weave a tapestry that is never finished, just as the fate of the poet is to write an in-finite work; namely, a work that in the end can never reach the perfection and integrity of the divine work.<br>

Abstract: Son ya varias las décodas transcurridas desde que los estudios de folklore en general y la etnomusicología en particular se han visto dominados por la analitica deconstructiva y el pensamiento culturalista, configurando un bloque paradigmático sumamente influyente en el multidisciplinar territorio de las ciencias sociales. Las aportaciones provenientes de estas corrientes han resultado en líneas generates de gran valor e interés para la comunidad científica, ensanchando y dinamizando el hasta entonces relativamente reducido campo de acción e interpretación de disciplinas como la musicología comparada. Sin embargo el proceso de renovación académica –que encabezarían obras como las de Benedict Anderson y Eric Hobsbawm– ha implicado asimismo un desigual desplazamiento del foco de atención desde el objeto de estudio mismo hacia la esfera de su contexto, relevancia social e implicaciones ideológicas. La deconstrucción se ha ejercido particularmente en contra del aserto diferencial, subrayando sus debilidades argumentales, excesos etnocéntricos y –con frecuencia– obvios intereses espurios, una tarea históricamente necesaria pero que a la par ha sustraído del folklore todo valor ontológico en aras de su significado, y del trabajo científico el vital soporte empírico, que ahora se ve arrinconado por una elaboración altamente abstracta al amparo de un lenguaje en el límite de la saturación semántica. Este artículo explora la vía crítica descrita para concluir planteando determinadas alternativas en defensa de una tradición sostenible –a pesar del vigor innegable y sinergético de las fuerzas del progreso, los procesos de hibridación y globalización y las alteraciones provenientes del constructo folklorista–, así como del hecho diferencial implícito y su asunción y gestión no indefectiblemente en el marco de un proyecto político o comercial. Studies of folklore in general and ethnomusicology in particular have been dominated by deconstructive analysis and culturalist theory fo~<br>

Abstract: On part ici de l'hypothèse que Mémoires d'aveugle. L'autoportrait et autres ruines de Jacques Derrida est en quelque sorte l'illustration de La Voix et le phénomène et donc la critique, par Derrida, de la phénoménologie de l'intuition, de la perception et de la vue. On relève toutefois aussi des rencontres avec Husserl et Kant. On n'oublie pas non plus qu'il y va de l'art, des arts visuels et, dans la grande richesse thématique de cet ouvrage, on relève des moments forts, aussi bien que des moments faibles, au sujet des arts du « visible ». La question demeurant : Derrida « voit »-il le dessin, la peinture et, même, entend-il la musique? The starting point of this paper is the hypothesis that Mémoires d'aveugle. L'autoportrait et autres ruines is somehow the illustration of Speech and Phenomenon, and constitutes consequently Derrida's critique of the phenomenology of intuition, perception and vision. It is however also possible to put the emphasis on some crossingpoints with Husserl and Kant. What should not be forgotten is the fact that what is at stake here is art, i.e. visual arts, and that in the great thematic richness of this work, it is possible to bring to light strong and weak points concerning the arts of the « visible ». But the question remains : can Derrida « see » the design, the painting, and even can he hear the music?<br>

Author(s): LOOBUYCK PATRICK<br>
Abstract: In the first half of the twentieth century noncognitivism was the predominant metaethical point of view in analytical philosophy. This perspective came under critical scrutiny as early as the late 1950s, and by the 1970s its authority began to be undermined. For various reasons cognitivist theories began to be put forward with confidence. Different philosophers tried ways to restore the role of reason in ethics. This shift in the philosophical climate was influenced by—or was at least in accordance with—the thought of the later Wittgenstein. In particular, this article will consider the relevance of Wittgenstein for cognitivist views, such as that of S. Toulmin, relativists like G. Harman, and British moral realists like S. Lovibond and J. McDowell. In fact, Wittgenstein is one of the founding fathers of antifoundationalism. He gives us the hopeful insight that the end of foundationalism does not necessarily imply the end of moral philosophy but must be considered a new start of it.<br>

Abstract: This study is based on 150 interviews carried out in three countries among individuals of working class origin who have experienced very rapid social advancement. My approach consists of three stages. First, I establish a typology of the many forms taken by attempts to rehabilitate their working class origins among those interviewed. Second, I draw upon this typology to open up avenues for reflecting on what makes it possible to present working class origins as a resource. In this respect, it would seem that the narrative skill with which this experience is recounted – a matter of genuine social competence – constitutes a decisive factor. The conception of working class origins as a resource is above all permitted by a process of mystification which seeks to obscure the fact that this value is the product of an effort of self-narration. Third, I take a comparative approach to show that such individual strategies of narration remain extremely contingent on the cultural specificities of the countries in which they take place.<br>

Author(s): Benjamin Roy<br>
Abstract: In this paper, I examine the influence of the Gospel of John on Joyce's aesthetic. My basic claim is that the gospel aided Joyce in charting a middle course between materialism (body without spirit) and spiritualism (spirit without body). After examining the temptations of flying too high (symbolism, mysticism, gnosticism) and flying too low (historicism, realism, materialism), I show how Joyce made use of the Johannine strategies of epiphany and realized eschatology to achieve a synthesis between these extremes. The essay is much indebted to two students of John—Rudolph Bultmann and Franz Mussner—who examined John's peculiar synthesis of fact and allegory. In addition, the scholar Jacques Aubert was indispensable for his analysis of a similar trajectory in Joyce's aesthetic.<br>

Abstract: This essay advances the concept of transversality by drawing philosophical insights from Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Calvin O. Schrag, and the Martinicuan francophone Edouard Glissant. By so doing, it begins with a critique of the notion of universality in modern Western philosophy. It targets Hegel—the modernist incarnate—in particular, who had a dark view of the non-Western world. His overarching Eurocentric universality is founded on the fallacious premise that what is particular in the West is universalized or universalizable, whereas what is particular in the non-West remains particular forever. As Glissant puts it succinctly, however, thinking about "One" is not thinking about "All" or "Many." Eurocentric universality is outmoded and thus has no place in the globalization of the multicultural world. It simply ignores the reality of interlacing of multiple life-worlds. The concept of transversality, which is symbolized in the Maitreyan Middle Way, is proposed to replace universality, which tends to be nothing but the philosophical expression of a particular socio-cultural life-world. It not only reduces ethnocentric ignorance but also fosters a hybridity that in fact dissolves the binary opposition between particularism and universalism. In short, transversality is conceived of as a new paradigm in philosophical conceptualization or world philosophy. What is traditionally called "comparative philosophy" is not just a neglected branch of philosophy, but it is poised to transform radically the very conception of philosophy itself.<br>

Abstract: The superfluity arises from the fact that this "double of Krsna" never has to
take the reins, since Nala is driving; see Hiltebeitel, Rethinking, 232-33. As men-

sion of the "avatära" theme in both epics, and especially in the Rämäyam, see

Abstract: Paul Oskar Kristeller (born 1905) actually did sit down with us at the Institute for
Christian Studies in the late 1970's, and recounted the graduai demise of old-style, German
Idealistic Humanism, for which he had given his scholarly life in Renaissance studies. The
fact that he told this intelleaual history as an eye-witness, yet générations later, gave the
account an incredible feel of veracity, even though the painful failure of his own involved
contribution showed through.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur, op.cit., p. 156. The tremendous difficulties we face in developing an
adequate view of evil are well illustrated by the fact that Ricoeur himself, despite his clear
intentions to the contrary, works with a view of human "fault" in Fallible Man (Chicago:
Henry, 1965) which itself comes very close to reading sin and evil into the fundamental
human structure. See the Master's thesis of Henry Venema, Philosophical Anthropology, and the
Problem of Evil: An Interpretative Analysis of Paul Ricoeur's Philosophy of Will (Toronto: Institute
for Christian Studies, 1986).<br>

Abstract: I am very much aware of the fact that this notion of 'otherness' is highly unqualified and
needs further delineation. I already suggested a link to Reformational philosophical distinc-
tions when I said that the child does not just 'swallow up' otherness, but learns to discern and
to distinguish as one of the effects of the confrontation with otherness. Otherness mav
heighten one's sense for qualitative (and potentially structural) distinctions, in other words.<br>

Abstract: In Cooper's interpretation of Dooyeweerd two further errors are present. Cooper (1989,
250) says that Dooyeweerd's "notion of the ego allows the supranatural to shape the temporal
but not the reverse." Dooyeweerd however speaks of both divergence and concentration.
Cooper also states that in Dooyeweerd the basic directions of thinking, imagining and willing
are rooted in the heart, not in the temporal act structure. The passage at issue deals with the
functioning of the soul after death. Cooper holds that such rootedness of the basic directions
in the heart allows us to argue that the basic directions can also function outside the earthly
(i.e. temporal) modes. Apart from the fact that for Dooyeweerd the supra-temporal belongs to
the creatural (earthly) order, Cooper neglects that Dooyeweerd strongly denied the idea of an
incorporeal personal centre: acts and basic directions are inconceivable without involvement of
the temporal function cloak, c.q. the act structure.<br>

Abstract: The main aim of this article is to offer a critical reflection on the need of rethinking the teachers' professional skills and their academic pathway, given the changes and current transformations (crisis, in its etymological sense). In fact, a series of changes, transformations, are identified and affect directly the educator's comprehension. Amongst others: the transformation of work bound up with the processes of the economic globalization, and the transformation of the learning environments imbued by the TICs; the population growth, a demographic transformation with geopolitics relevance, and finally, as a result from the previous ones, the raise in the migratory flows. Under this context, this paper tries to reconceptualize teachers' training and their depiction as professionals from the view of Gustav Mahler in his statement Tradition is the spreading of fire and not the veneration of ashes. Thereupon, some categories that help in the teaching update, are proposed and explained; such as authority (as reputation or moral authority, role model and, hence, less so as bare exercise of power), the personalization of education, the importance of home community (society), and, lastly, the alternation within school-society and work-study. El objetivo de este trabajo es ofrecer una reflexión acerca de la necesidad de re-pensar la profesionalidad de los docentes y de su itinerario formativo, a la luz los cambios y transformaciones actuales (crisis, en sentido etimológico). En efecto, se identifican una serie de cambios, de transformaciones, que afectan directamente a la comprensión del docente, del enseñante. Entre otros: la transformación del trabajo vinculada a los procesos de la globalización económica y la transformación de los entornos de aprendizaje imbuidos en las TICs; el aumento de la población, la transformación demográfica con trascendencia geopolítica; y por último, y como confluencia de las dos anteriores, el aumento de los flujos migratorios.

Abstract: I am indebted to the insightful work of Emily Rosenberg and Frank Costigliola. See,
for example, Rosenberg, "Gendered Discourses in Dollar Diplomacy," and Costigliola, "The
Nuclear Family: Cold War Gendered Discourse in the Western Alliance," both papers deliv-
ered at the Annual Meeting of the Organization of American Historians, 1993. One might
argue that gendered analysis of international relations should do more, that is to explain why
women everywhere are treated unequally. See Sarah Brown, "Feminism, International
Theory, and International Relations of Gender Inequality," Millennium: Journal of International
Studies 17 (1988): 461-75. But Brown makes no effort to show that the structure of international
relations is, in fact, responsible for the situation she abhors.<br>

lutionary hope but out of the experience of partial or total disenchantment with the revolution-
ary promise. The striking fact is that a number of these works nonetheless retain, but translate
into a different dimension of experience, the design, the ideas, and the imagery of the callower
works their authors had composed in a mood of millennial excitement" {Natural Supernaturalism,
p. 335).<br>

Abstract: De nombreux textes, à commencer par l'étude de Max Weber, ont déjà défriché le champ d'une sociologie de la musique et précisé à quels objets elle pouvait s'intéresser et comment elle pouvait les aborder. Le domaine, et l'appellation même, des musiques " populaires " demeurent toutefois problématiques. L'enseignement tiré de travaux des historiens de la culture conduit à les envisager comme " musiques de masse ". Pour les étudier, la sociologie peut les considérer comme un " fait sociomusical total " et y rechercher des représentations sociales, à la fois déchiffrement de la société par ses membres et moyens d'action sur elle. Une analyse tripartite modifiée, s'inspirant de la méthode proposée par Jean Molino et Jean-Jacques Nattiez et tenant compte des leçons de l'ethnomusicologie, peut fournir un cadre d'analyse général à partir duquel un très grand nombre de domaines s'ouvrent à l'exploration du chercheur qui y découvrira des mélanges infinis et, refusant de juger esthétiquement, s'attachera plutôt à expliquer le jugement esthétique des acteurs de ce " phénomène social total ". /// Several writings, starting with Max Weber's, have done pioneering work in the sociology of music. They have formulated the subjects to be studied and suggested how they can be approached. Many problems, however, remain. The lessons drawn from studies by cultural historians lead us to see it as " mass music ", which sociology can take to be a " total sociomusical fact ". The search can then be undertaken for the underlying " social representations ", which are both an interpretation of society by its members and a means of action on society. Modeled on the method proposed by Jean Molino and Jean-Jacques Nattiez, a modified threefold analysis taking into account the teachings of ethnomusicology, can help devise a general analytical framework that opens a large number of fields where sociologists will discover infinite mixtures.

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i25478832<br>
Date: 5 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Wächter Kirsten<br>
Abstract: Looking at the public reaction to it, one might say that Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List" is undoubtedly the most successful film about the Holocaust. The film's success in the U.S. and other Western countries can be traced back mainly to the fact that it creates the impression of telling a true, apparently authentic, story. This essay investigates how this impression of historical truth and authenticity emerges in a fiction film. For this purpose the essay reverts to a concept developed by Jörn Rüsen, which distinguishes among three dimensions of historical culture, namely political, aesthetic, and cognitive. In addition to the historical context that serves as a specific precondition for the film's success, the essay primarily investigates the strategies of authentication Spielberg applied at both the visual and narrative levels. The investigation concludes that the impression of evidence produced by the movie is significantly a result of the sophisticated balancing of the three dimensions mentioned above. The film utilizes artifacts of an existing and increasingly transnational (visual) memory for the benefit of a closed, archetypical narrative. It follows the aesthetic and artistic rules of popular narrative cinema, and largely recurs to conventions of representation that were common in film and television programs of the 1990s. Although these forms condense the historical course of events, the film manages to stay close to insights gained by historiography. The hybrid amalgamation of history and memory, and of the imaginary and the real, as well as the combination of dramaturgies of popular culture with an instinct for what can (not) be shown-all of these factors have helped "Schindler's List" to render a representation of the founding Holocaust myth in Western societies that can be sensually experienced while being emotionally impressive at the same time.<br>

Abstract: Cet article aborde un aspect du processus d'interprétation de la vie religieuse ou cloîtrée amorcé au sein des communautés religieuses catholiques romaines dans les années '70. On avance que, durant cette période de transition, on a fait l'expérience d'un rejet massif du concept de "cloître" en tant que clôture au sens physique, en soulignant le fait qu'il y avait là plus qu'une simple modification de la pratique communautaire, axé sur une réalité transcendante de caractère utopique qu'on aurait voulu orientée en direction d'une expérience communautaire de caractère profane. En fait, ce type de rejet apparaît comme une transformation du concept de "cloître," ne niant point le fait de la continuité au niveau de l'identité communautaire. Les religieuses catholiques romaines ont eu recours à deux images de pointe: la fiancée éternelle du Christ et le clown, ou bouffon, du monde profane. /// This paper examines one aspect of the interpretive process undertaken by religious communities of North American Roman Catholic sisters in the 1970s, or the redefinition of cloister. It is suggested that during this transitional period, widespread rejection of the concept of cloister as physical enclosure was more than a mere illustrative shift away from a communal paradigm stressing utopian transcendence, and toward a communal paradigm identified as profane. In fact, this rejection signaled a transformation in the concept of cloister that allowed for continuity in communal themes of identity across contrasting paradigms. To effect this transformation, Roman Catholic sisters contrasted two liminal images: the transcendent Bride of Christ, and the profane clown.<br>

Abstract: Regido por la subjetividad, el universo contemporáneo del creer es en todas sus partes de circulación fluida, inmediatamente refractario a cualquier referencia estructurante a estabilidad alguna, excepto cuando postula esta estabilidad como puramente operatoria. El objetivo del creer contemporáneo no consiste en alcanzar una "identidad religiosa" (que se concibe como "estable"), sino demostrar que puede ser un creer dentro del movimiento. En realidad, el concepto de "religión", como también los de "secularización" y de "laicidad" que se le asocian, pasan a ser, en situación de plena legitimidad social de la individualización radical de la construcción de una relación con el sentido, conceptos cada vez más indeterminados y en consecuencia de sobra inutilizables, al menos mientras se persista en reconocerles una pertinencia que les sería propia. La "religión", por ello, no es sino el indicador de recomposiciones más amplias, en las cuales participa, por otra parte, como instrumento de gestión. Así, sólo tiene sentido como objeto de intermediación, un analizador que, contextualizado, puede por lo demás resultar muy precioso. /// Ruled by subjectivity, the contemporary universe of belief is in all its parts of fluid circulation, immediately impervious to any structuring reference to any stability, unless this stability is posited as a purely operating principle. The aim of contemporary belief is not to achieve a "religious identity" (which would be conceived as "stable"), but to show that it can be a belief within movement. In fact, the concept of "religion", as well as the related concepts of "secularization" and "laicism" that are associated to it, happen to become, in a situation of total social legitimacy of radical individualization in constructing a relation with meaning, increasingly indeterminate and consequently utterly useless concepts, at least as far as there persists the will to grant them a pertinence of their own.

Abstract: This essay examines how activists in rural southern India have sought to reshape the field of political communication by encouraging lower-caste women to submit written, signed petitions to district-level government offices, and so represent themselves to the state. I argue that contradictions between democratic recognition and the will to development that inhere to the political structure of contemporary governance in rural India correspond to tensions within the semiotic structure of signature itself, between constative representation and performative creation. Governmentality and the forms of communication that it requires often rest on the notion that written self-representation constitutes an act of political agency. But the limits of a governmental communicative reason that would conflate written subject and agent become especially clear in postcolonial contexts where the construction of those citizens that would be represented is in fact a product of the very act of representation. It is the narrative of development-as-pedagogy that holds out the promise of a future alignment of communicative frameworks, technologies, and participant roles, allowing for the transparent self-representation of an already-constituted citizen. By tracking the ambivalent experience of one group of women in particular, this account focuses on how the logic of signature as self-representation has served to recontextualize the marginality of petitioners as something within the state's broader field of power.<br>

Abstract: Gelley has restated the deManean position as follows: "[T]he scandal of example,
its logical fallacy, lies in the fact that this ethical summons—the obligation to judge—is predicated
not on a law or rule—thus at the level of the general or universal—but on the instance of its
particularity, an instance that cannot in itself suffice to justify the principle in question" (Intro-
duction 14).<br>

Article Title: Duality, Opposition and Typology in the Qur'an: The Apocalyptic Substrate / ‮الثنائية والتقابل وتصنيف النماذج: حديث القرآن عن الأخرويات‬<br>

Abstract: This article highlights two features of Qur'anic style and content: duality/opposition and typological figuration, which can be seen as providing a continuous and consistent 'narrative stream' through the Qur'an. It is of some interest that both of these features have been singled out as distinctive of apocalypse as a genre in the study of numerous religious and cultural traditions. As debate on whether or not the Qur'an is a bona fide example of apocalyptic literature quietly continues, the interplay of conceptual and substantive oppositions and dualities is discussed in order to highlight the importance of this prominent feature to both the form and contents of the Book. It is suggested that its function is profoundly related to the typological figuration indispensable to the Qur'anic depiction of, for example, the character of the prophets and therefore prophethood. Whether or not this represents a genuine instance of apocalyptic literature, it nonetheless remains that the prominence of the motif renders the Qur'an susceptible of a reading expressive of something called an apocalyptic imagination. It is hoped that this article succeeds in demonstrating that in fact these apparently familiar subjects are stimulated to new life by considering them as defining, interlocking, structural elements of a distinctive Islamic apocalypse. ‮تبرز هذه الدراسة خاصيتين لأسلوب القرآن ومادته: الثنائية/التقابل وتصنيف النماذج مما قد ينظر إليه على أنه يمثل تيارا مستمرا ثابتا في القرآن. ومن اللافت للنظر أنه قد جرى الترکيز على هاتين الخاصيتين على أنهما يختصان بالحديث عن أحوال الآخرة في کثير من الأديان والتقاليد الثقافية. وفي هذا المقال سندرس التفاعل بين الثنائية والتقابل لکي نبرز الأهمية الأساسية لهذه الخاصية بالنسبة لشکل القرآن ومحتواه. فنحن نرى أن وظيفتها تمت بقوة إلى ظاهرة تصنيف الأنواع في تصوير القرآن لشخصيات الأنبياء ثم النبوة نفسها. والأمل أن ينجح هذا المقال في التدليل على أن هذه الموضوعات المألوفة يمکن رؤيتها على أنها نمط إسلامي فريد في الحديث عن الأخرويات.‬<br>

Author(s): Smalley B.<br>
Abstract: See above, 45, 170-172. The Migne édition of Β is incomplète, lacking the
prologue; see F. Stegmüller, Repertorium Biblicum Medii Aevi (henceforward
referred to as RB) no. 2604. Canon B. Merlette has discovered that B represents
an abridgement, with altérations, of a commentary entitled 'Glose magistri Anselmi
de Monte Leonis et Remensis archiepiscopi super Matheum' in MS Paris, Bibl.
nat. lat. 2491, foll. 1-143. He takes this for 'le Commentaire "magistral" d'Anselme'.
The fact that Master Anselm was never archbishop of Reims and that this manu-
script is datable from the end of the twelfth Century (Catalogue général des MSS
latins 2, Paris 1940, 487) makes me wonder whether it was really the original
and not an enlargement of B. Merlette does not question the doubtful ascription
of B to Geoffrey Babion, nor does he consider the evidence for the late dating
of B. If B depended on Anselm's 'magistral' commentary, he must have changed
it drastically. See B. Merlette, Enseignement et vie culturelle IXe-XVIe siècle.
Ecoles et bibliothèques, in Ministère de l'Education nationale. Comité des travaux
historiques et scientifiques, Actes du 95' Congrès national des sociétés savantes,
Reims, 1970. Section de philologie et d'histoire jusqu'à 1610, 1 (1975) 44-46. This
important discovery makes it necessary to reconsider the relationship between
MS lat. 2491 and A and B. Meanwhile, the outcome, whatever it may be, would
not affect Comestor's use of B, which concerns us here.<br>

Abstract: It is important to maintain the distinction between the experience of turmoil
and not getting tangled in it. The contemplative is not exempt from the experience
of inner turmoil (a term which necessarily covers a vast semantic field: from polit-
ical power struggles to gossip at table to interior trials) and, in fact, is often more
vulnerable to it. In his book, House of Wisdom (New York: Harper and Row,
1985), John S. Dunne expresses this through the metaphor of a storm: an impor-
tant leg of the spiritual journey is moving through the storm into its eye and then
Walking with this storm in order to remain in the still simplicity of its eye.<br>

Abstract: From the perspective of Gabriel Marcel’s juvenile writings, most notably
         Fragments Philosophiques(1909-1914) andJournal Métaphysique(1914-1923), this study discuss the first theoretical statute of the experience of God. This reflexive movement, strictly speaking, phenomenological-existential is based (as background) on the critique of absolute knowledge (modern idealism and scientism) which, according to Marcel, is an unavoidable contradiction: at the same time, it affirms the being, it denies the being. What draws attention is the fact that such explanatory model is transposed and, therefore, applied using the classical formulation of the so-called problem of the existence of God, of which theodicy has one of the most eloquent and emblematic metaphysical discourses. For the young French thinker, God cannot be verified or justified as an ontological proof: God is the Inverifiable Absolute, since it has to be experienced in the act of faith, in the expression of love and grace.<br>

Abstract: Une longue série de détournements d'avions et d'explosions en vol accompagnent l'histoire de l'aviation civile. Comment peut-on rendre compte de ce qui est thématisé par les acteurs comme une «menace» à la fois insaisissable et persistante? Comment procède-t-on à la «mise en sécurité» d'un aéroport? L'article propose une description de la prévention du terrorisme aéroportuaire comme un dispositif de tri censé, par la vigilance, permettre le filtrage des personnes et des objets potentiellement dangereux. Pour les autorités, confrontées à un adversaire adoptant les habits de la normalité pour se dissimuler, et faisant, par là même, planer un doute sur sa présence, exercer le soupçon apparaît à la fois comme une nécessité, dans la mesure où il peut permettre d'empêcher un attentat, et un risque, dans le fait que le soupçon peut facilement apparaître comme arbitraire. L'une des réponses apportées à ce dilemme est à chercher dans le design du dispositif: en inscrivant le double impératif – assurer la sécurité sans mettre en cause les libertés publiques – dans sa matérialité et dans ses procédures, la contradiction, sans être toujours entièrement levée, tend néanmoins à être désamorcée. Cette configuration ne manque pas de soulever des interrogations concernant la sociologie de la menace où le soupçon est généralement traité uniquement du point de vue du risque d'arbitraire. The history of civil aviation has been accompanied by a long series of hijackings and in-flight explosions. How are we to account for something that the actors themselves refer to as an elusive yet constant threat? How does one go about "securing" an airport? The article proposes to describe airport terrorism prevention as a sorting device that is supposed to filter out potentially dangerous people and objects through vigilance. Airport authorities are faced with an adversary who takes on ordinary habits to conceal himself and thereby generates doubts about his presence. For these authorities, exercis~<br>

from the general sense these theorists would give to the term 'rational', with the instru-
mental sense of which it might be confused.<br>

Article Title: A Cause for Concern: Reasons, Causes and Explanations<br>
Publisher: International Phenomenological Society<br>
Issue: i345615<br>
Date: 6 1, 1958<br>
Author(s): Wittgenstein Daniel<br>
Abstract: This paper argues against causalism about reasons in three stages. First, the paper investigates Professor Davidson's sophisticated version of the claim that we must understand reason-explanations as a kind of causal explanation to highlight the fact that this move does no explanatory work in telling us how we determine for which reasons we act. Second, the paper considers Davidson's true motivation for regarding reasons-explanations as causal which connects with his claim that reasons are causes. He advocates anomalous monism in order to solve the mysterious connection problem. In assessing his proposed solution to this problem, the paper examines his `extension reply' to the charge that his token identity theory ultimately results in epiphenomenalism. The paper argues that only a reading of this reply makes for a stable anomalous monism but for this reason Davidson's compatiblist metaphysics is unfit for the task of solving the mysterious connection problem. Given that reductive accounts are incompatible with the special features of reasons explanations, the paper concludes that we must reverse the orthodoxy once again and eschew causalism about reasons and reason-explanations. Finally, the paper considers a possible way of recasting our understanding of causation so that the mysterious connection problem disappears.<br>

Publisher: Armand Colin<br>
Issue: i27582855<br>
Date: 6 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Payen Pascal<br>
Abstract: The article proposes to analyse the fictional aspects in history writing. Indeed, history doesn't borrow from fiction its compositional techniques only; the discursive strategy which consists in narrating a story is in fact part of historical knowledge as such. A study of Cambysis's biography in Herodotus (II,l-III,66) leads us to grant a very specific function to Book II dealing with Egypt—nearly always considered as some sort of useless overgrowth—and to the "secondary remarks" concerning the Greek world (III,38, 39-60). Setting the Egyptian civilization as a foil enables Herodotus to establish a parallel between expansionist ideas and folly and he includes the Greeks in a plot itself critical of helleno-centric ideology. Our methodological approach owes as much to Ricœur's hermeneutics, as to H. R. Jauss's esthetics of reception and to the various streaks of narratology (narrative syntax and "mise en abîme"), with a view to showing that, once replaced in its "Erwarthunghorizonte", the form of the historical narrative makes full sense.<br>

Issue: i27646209<br>
Date: 6 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): DiCenso James<br>
Abstract: This paper engages Freud's relation to Kant, with specific reference to each theorist's articulation of the interconnections between ethics and religion. I argue that there is in fact a constructive approach to ethics and religion in Freud's thought, and that this approach can be better understood by examining it in relation to Kant's formulations on these topics. Freud's thinking about religion and ethics participates in the Enlightenment heritage, with its emphasis on autonomy and rationality, of which Kant's model of practical reason is in many ways exemplary. At the same time, Freud advances Kantian thinking in certain important respects; his work offers a more somatically, socially, and historically grounded approach to the formation of rational and ethical capacities, and hence makes it more compatible with contemporary concerns and orientations that eschew the pitfalls of ahistorical idealist orientations.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo pretende abordar, desde una perspectiva analítica, la posibilidad de fundamentar las posiciones morales de la izquierda. En ese sentido, se analiza, en primer lugar, por qué la izquierda necesita de un discurso moral; una vez establecido que la izquierda es necesariamente moral, se investiga cuál puede ser la fundamentación de esa moral particular; y en tercer y último lugar, se descarta la posibilidad de que, al no encontrar fundamentación, quepa la posibilidad de omitirla. This article will try to address from an analytical position the possibility of portraying the foundations supporting the moral stances of the left. In this sense, the reason why the left needs a moral discourse is analysed in the first place; once the fact that the left is necessarily moral is established, the precise foundations supporting that specific moral is investigated; and thirdly and lastly, the possibility of omitting that supportive foundation given the absence of it, is rejected.<br>

Abstract: El autor propugna que el conocimiento en el ámbito de las ciencias sociales no se puede comparar fácilmente con el conocimiento puramente filosófico o el conocimiento histórico ni reducirlo a uno u otro. De hecho, tiene sus raíces en la comunidad y, por lo tanto, da lugar a una empresa colectiva. En esencia, se basa en una interacción entre seres humanos y presupone una relación de confianza mutua entre el investigador y los miembros del grupo social que se va a investigar en una situación dada. Un enfoque cualitativo, que sitúe en un mismo plano al investigador y a los investigados, parece por tanto necesario. Cuesta creer que una persona pueda estar dispuesta a confesar sus experiencias (Erlebnisse) a una grabadora o a un cuestionario rígidamente precodificado. The Author's contention is that knowledge in social science cannot be easily compared and reduced either to purely philosophical knowledge or to historical knowledge. In fact, it is community grounded and therefore it results in a collective enterprise. In essence, it is based on an interaction among human beings and it presupposes a relation of mutual trust between the researcher and the members of the social group to be investigated in a given situation. Therefore, a qualitative approach whereby researcher and researched are in the same footing and involved in a face to face relationship seems to be necessary. It is hard to believe that somebody would willingly confess his/her Erlebnisse to a tape-recording machine or to a rigidly precodified questionnaire.<br>

Abstract: Sociocultural anthropology and evolutionary biology have reached the point at which it is possible to give a coherent and synthetic account of the origins of human cultural variability. From a sociocultural perspective what must be explained is not just the fact of varying cultures and societies, but also the human capacity to create, maintain and alter social forms over time. From a biological perspective we have to ask, what is the selective advantage of such variability? The answer lies in human sociality. Sociality consists in a package of social intellectual capacities-higher order intentionality, pedagogy, narrativity, crativity, speech-which made possible an increasing division of labour. But as these capacities grew, they gave rise to distinctively human (rather than Darwinian) history, that is to the forms of social, political, economic and cultural causation which create ever new variations on the theme of social existence.<br>

Article Title: Rereading the Book in Henry James's The Ambassadors<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: i345794<br>
Date: 12 1, 1909<br>
Author(s): James Kevin<br>
Abstract: This essay argues that in Henry James's The Ambassadors (1903) Mrs. Newsome, who appears to be merely a representative of everything un-Jamesian, particularly a lack of moral and aesthetic imagination, should not be so quickly dismissed. Post-structuralist critics do not hesitate to denounce her. They typically identify Mrs. Newsome's "book" of expectations for Strether, her emissary, and for Chad, her successor, with the closed book of logocentric tyranny; both are said to rely on unambiguous reference and to enforce the cold rationality of linear causation. Derridean readers of The Ambassadors unmistakably prefer Madame de Vionnet's Paris, embodying as it apparently does their own essentially skeptical doctrines about representation. James, however, plays a more subtle game of balance and synthesis, suggesting that while Newsome's book is firm against new impressions, expecting experience to submit utterly to preconceived plans and moralistic evaluations, it also successfully asserts against Parisian representational openness and mystery the viability of reasonable explanation. Her book is vindicated insofar as it stands for the persistent relevance of linear causality and for the nonabsolute grounding of speculation in the concrete world of events and consequences. Newsome's extreme rationalism is in fact denied full authority early in the novel, whose true subject is located when extreme skepticism seems to dominate and explanation seems irrelevant. During the course of the story, time's subtle order slowly reemerges, and James the realist steps forward from behind the post-structuralist veil.<br>

Abstract: This essay explores the drama of selfhood and the attendant problem of ethics in Brian Friel's Faith Healer. Drawing from the tenets of Freudian psychoanalysis, I scrutinize the protagonist's narrative identity through fissures created by the discrepancy between his story and the other two characters' versions. These crevices register the protagonist's post-traumatic affects for an uncanny home, which, intertwined with his equally uncanny talent to become the place of trauma, compels him to return time and again instead of acknowledging its loss. Symptomatically, in his fixation on an uncanny home in order to disavow its loss, the protagonist sutures his privation, to such an extent that he not only bars memory exchange with other characters, but appropriates them into a master narrative. Given the fact that the three characters' stories are addressed to invisible auditors who converge with the play's actual audience, the healer's final act of authority is limited as long as it is subject to the audience's interpretation of his memory narrative. In its appeal to the audience's decision on ethical justice for the healer's narrative imagination among multiple proposals, this play is an exercise of poetical ethics of memory.<br>

Author(s): James David<br>
Abstract: Grounded theory's popularity persists after three decades of broad-ranging critique. In this article three problematic notions are discussed-'theory,' 'ground' and 'discovery'-which linger in the continuing use and development of grounded theory procedures. It is argued that far from providing the epistemic security promised by grounded theory, these notions-embodied in continuing reinventions of grounded theory-constrain and distort qualitative inquiry, and that what is contrived is not in fact theory in any meaningful sense, that 'ground' is a misnomer when talking about interpretation and that what ultimately materializes following grounded theory procedures is less like discovery and more akin to invention. The procedures admittedly provide signposts for qualitative inquirers, but educational researchers should be wary, for the significance of interpretation, narrative and reflection can be undermined in the procedures of grounded theory.<br>

Abstract: L'Église Universelle du Royaume de Dieu du Cap-Vert, avec près de 20000 fidèles, sur 475000 habitants (soit 4%), connaît, depuis une décennie, un réel succès, dans ce pays-archipel, catholique à plus de 93%. La modernisation rapide du pays (devenu depuis janvier 2008, un Pays de Développement Moyen) renvoie à un moment particulièrement instable. L'embellie économique conduit à une réforme importante de la culture capverdienne et une augmentation des inégalités sociales, ressenties pour certains comme une forme de souffrance. L'Église Universelle répond à l'inquiétude et au doute engendrés par cette situation et ressentis plus fortement par certains groupes de population, par la promotion d'une identitt positive, qualifiée de "gagnante". En tant qu'entreprise religieuse, l'Église pousse ses membres à s'approprier du changement comme d'un fait inéluctable de société. Par la promotion d'une morale de la conviction liée à un procès de la responsabilisation, l'Universelle met en avant la réussite individuelle qui devrait, dans la foulée, libérer le croyant des anciennes formes de la solidarité, notamment celles liées à la "vieille société capverdienne" et toujours louée par de nombreux poètes et chanteurs. /// The Universal Church of the Realm of the God of Cape Verde, with about 20000 believers, on 475000 inhabitants (around 4%), has been, for a decade, a real success, in this country-archipelago which counts about 93% Catholics. The fast modernization of the country (since January 2008, a Country of Average Development) sends at a particularly unstable moment. The economics' taking off leads to an important reform of the capeverdean culture and an increase in the social disparities, understood for some as way of suffering. The Universal Church answers the anxiety and the doubt engendered by this situation, and more strongly felt by certain groups of population, by the promotion of a positive identity, qualified as "winning".

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur argues that it is in fact obe-
dience to the law that is evil, and not transgression of the law:
Evil in moral consciousness is essentially transgression, that is, subversion of a law; it
is in this way that the majority of pious men continue to consider sin. And yet, situ-
ated before God, evil is qualitatively changed; it consists less in a transgression of a
law than in a pretension of man to be master of his life. The will to live according to
the law is, therefore, also an expression of evil - and even the most deadly, because
the most dissimulated: worse than injustice is one's own justice. Ethical conscious-
ness does not know this, but religious consciousness does. (438)<br>

Abstract: Sociology of religion and more specifically of ideologies is governed by the opposition between a certain tradition which considers religion as an instrument of communication and learning, i.e. as a structured and structuring system, and another tradition which emphasizes the political function of religious ideology. In fact, it is through its logical function of prescribing its structure to the mind, that religion fulfils the political function of maintaining the eternity of structures, i.e. the absolute of the relative and the legitimacy of the arbitrary and thus the domestication of the dominated. /// Se halla dominada la sociología de la religión (y más generalmente la de las ideologiás) por la oposición entre la tradición que trata la religión como instrumento de communicación y de conocimiento, es decir como sistema estructurado y estructurante, y la tradición que insiste en las funciones políticas de la ideología religiosa. En realidad, es precisamente porque cumple una función lógica, imponiendo sus estructuras al pensamiento, que la religión desempeña el papel político de eternización de las estructuras, es decir de absolutización del relativo y de legitimación del arbitrario y, con eso, de domesticación de los dominados. /// Die Soziologie der Religion und - allgemein gesehen die Soziologie der Ideologien - wird beherrscht vom Gegensatz einerseits zwischen der Tradition, die die Religion als ein Kommunikations- und Wissensinstrument ansieht - das heisst, als ein strukturiertes und strukturierendes System - und anderseits der Tradition, die die politischen Funktionen der religiösen Ideologie unterstreicht. In Wirklichkeit erfüllt die Religion nur insofern eine politische Funktion der Verewigung der Strukturen - das heisst die Absolutisierung des Relativen und die Legitimation des Willkürlichen und dadurch die Zähmung der Beherrschten - als sie eine logische Funktion erfüllt, indem sie dem Denken ihre Strukturen auferlegt. /// Социология религии (и вообще вс~<br>

Author(s): Wright Dominique<br>
Abstract: Cet article tente de clarifier les concepts de liberté et de contrainte à partir d'une étude de la conception architecturale, activité que les praticiens disent être un espace contraignant tout en parvenant à concevoir des solutions inédites. L'étude vise des résultats factuels et théoriques. Factuels, car il apparaît que les difficultés de l'exercice professionnel ne résultent pas tant des contraintes que de la sur-responsabilisation et de la sous-faisabilité des études qu'elles induisent. Théoriques, car les faits plaident pour une révision fondamentale du rapport négatif par lequel se définissent habituellement la liberté et la contrainte. Ces faits sont par exemple que les interdictions sont moins contraignantes que les prescriptions et que certaines stratégies de " phagocytage " peuvent trouver la voie de la liberté dans le respect à la lettre d'une contrainte. /// This article attempts to clarify the concepts of freedom and constraint through a study of architectural design work, an activity that its practitioners represent as a constraining space, though they in fact manage to find new solutions within it. The study aims at both factual and theoretical results: factual in that the difficulties of exercising this profession seem to be due less to constraints than the excessive degree of responsibility and near impracticability of the studies they induce; theoretical because certain facts suggest that a fundamental revision of the negative relation generally understood to obtain between freedom and constraint is in order. Two examples of such facts: prohibitions are not as constraining as prescriptions, and certain " absorption " strategies can open a path to freedom while following a given constraint " to the letter ". /// Dieser Artikel versucht die Begriffe von Freiheit und Zwang klarzustellen anhand einer Untersuchung von Architekturkonzepten, die die Praktiker als Aktivität in Zwangsräumen beurteilen, in denen trotzdem neue Lösungen möglich sind.

Abstract: L'étude d'un conflit centré sur le maintien d'écoles élémentaires dans le dispositif de zone d'éducation prioritaire (ZEP) permet de clarifier les figures de montée en généralité dans les engagements et les mobilisations autour de l'école. La mobilisation que nous avons analysée en nous fondant sur les récits rétrospectifs de ses différents protagonistes montre la possibilité pour des mouvements locaux de s'articuler à des revendications non particularistes, sans toutefois oublier les motifs initiaux d'insatisfaction. Cet accès à une cause argumentée, au-delà du travail de médiatisation du mouvement, lui a donné sa consistance interne. En effet, à partir d'un ancrage localisé, ces formes d'action ont fait émerger des questions d'intérêt général que nous présentons et discutons. La clôture de la controverse montre cependant que si l'administration accède à la satisfaction de la revendication initiale des parents, elle méconnaît sa légitimité. /// The study of a conflict centered on whether to keep primary schools in the ZEP programme, gives some clear figures illustrating the more general nature of commitment and mobilization on school matters. Mobilization, which was analyzed from retrospective accounts of its various protagonists, shows how it is possible for local movements to take part in non-specific claims, without however forgetting the initial reasons for dissatisfaction. This means of access with a justified cause reaching beyond the mediatization of the movement, has given it an inner strength. In fact, these types of action, coming from a local base, have brought into light questions of general interest that are presented and discussed. However, the closing of debate shows that although administration meets the parents' initial claim with satisfaction, it refuses to recognize its legitimacy. /// Die Untersuchung eines Konflikts zum Erhalt von Grundschulen im Rahmen der sog.

Date: 9 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Williamson Cécile<br>
Abstract: The real exchange rates of CEECs have been appreciating for the last decade, especially when measured by consumer prices. We argue that the size of this appreciation is linked to the exchange rate regime, the pegged currencies being more prone to this phenomenon in the long run. We also show that this appreciation is not necessarily linked to overvaluation. First, it is largely reduced when using a proxy of tradable prices as deflator, according to the "Balassa-Samuelson effect". Second, we use a large sample of emerging countries to calculate "normal" levels of real exchange rates taking into account the "Balassa effect" and show that CEECs do not suffer from systematic overvaluation according to this norm. We then calculate Fundamental Equilibrium Exchange Rates, using a model of the foreign trade of five CEECs (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Estonia) and their main partners based on NIGEM. We show that these CEEC currencies only have very small misalignment. This is due to the fact that the response of their foreign trade to small changes in the exchange rate is especially high, because of the high degree of openness and large export price elasticities. /// Les taux de change réels des PECO se sont appréciés durant la dernière décennie, particulièrement quand ils sont mesurés par les prix à la consommation. Nous montrons que l'ampleur de cette appréciation est liée au régime de change, les monnaies à changes fixes étant les plus touchées à long terme par ce phénomène. Nous montrons également que cette appréciation ne correspond pas nécessairement à une surévaluation. Premièrement, elle est largement réduite lorsqu'on utilise des prix de biens échangeables comme déflateur, ce qui permet de prendre en compte l'effet Balassa-Samuelson. Deuxièmement, nous utilisons un grand échantillon de pays émergents afin de calculer des normes de taux de change réels capables de prendre en compte l'effet Balassa-Samuelson.

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i369550<br>
Date: 12 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): Rüsen Jörn<br>
Abstract: Much international and intercultural discourse about historiography is influenced by a way of historical thinking deeply rooted in human historical consciousness and that works throughout all cultures and in all times: ethnocentrism. Ethnocentric history conceives of identity in terms of "master-narratives" that define togetherness and difference as essential for identity in a way that causes tension and struggle. These narratives conceive of history in terms of "clashes of civilizations," and they reinforce the idea that international and intercultural relations are merely struggles for power. The main elements of ethnocentrism are: asymmetrical evaluation, teleological continuity, and centralized perspective. This essay articulates possibilities for overcoming these three elements by replacing asymmetrical evaluation with normative equality; teleological continuity with reconstructive concepts of development that emphasize contingency and discontinuity; and centralized perspectives with multi-perspectivity and polycentric approaches to historical experience. Adopting these possibilities would lead to a new mode of universal history rooted in a concept of humankind that can help solve the problem of ethnocentrism. This idea of humankind conceptualizes the unity of the human species as being manifest in a variety of cultures and historical developments. This is in fact the traditional concept of historicism, which can be further developed towards a historiography that responds to the challenges of globalization and cultural differences. The essay outlines theoretical and methodological means in historical studies that bring this idea of humankind into the work of historians, thus enabling them to contribute to a new culture of recognition. The article is based on the assumption that the creation of such a culture is the most important task of scholarly work in the humanities in general, and historical studies in particular, at the beginning of the twenty-first centu~<br>

Abstract: What is the connection between modern democratic thought and globalization? This article examines the rationale behind the present crisis of democracy. It demonstrates that the problem facing modern democratic thought has less to do with the asymmetries associated with the forces of globalization and more to do with an asymmetry within popular sovereignty itself: the fact that the boundaries of democracy cannot themselves be democratically legitimated. By making this argument the article seeks to move beyond the contemporary opposition between nationalism and cosmopolitanism. It shows that the appeal to globalization among contemporary political theorists to a large extent is analogous to the appeal to the nation during the French Revolution.<br>

Author(s): Martin Mariana<br>
Abstract: Las políticas a través de las cuales los gobiernos democráticos trataron de poner fin a los debates sobre la represión de las dictaduras, en el Cono Sur de América Latina y en Sudáfrica, han fracasado. Esos intentos, representados por el modelo de "la comisión de verdad y reconciliación" -hoy en día activamente promovido en el nivel internacional- no permitieron la reconciliación deseada. La retórica del perdón empleada por los gobiernos fue estéril, confirmando el veredicto de la filosofía moral: no es posible un "perdón político". Sin embargo, este artículo defiende la conveniencia de un análisis de esa retórica. En primer lugar, tomar en cuenta esa retórica ayuda a discutir las explicaciones propuestas por las ciencias sociales y por los juristas de los procesos de transición a la democracia. En segundo lugar, la retórica del perdón produjo efectos políticos en cierto modo contradictorios. Impulsada por los gobiernos para poner un "punto final" a los debates sobre la violación de los derechos humanos, en los hechos impidió su clausura. Pero, por otro lado, esa retórica condujo a la escritura de una historia pacificadora. /// The policies through which democratic governments in the Southern Cone of Latin America and South Africa tried to put an end to the debates on repression during previous dictatorships have failed. Those attempts, embodied in the "Commission for Truth and Reconciliation" model actively promoted today at the international level, did not enable the reconciliation sought after. The rhetoric of forgiveness used by governments was futile, confirming the verdict by moral philosophy: "political forgiveness" is not possible. However, this article contends there are benefits in analyzing that rhetoric. First, taking that rhetoric into account contributes to discussing the explanations of the processes of transition to democracy proposed by social sciences and jurists. Second, the rhetoric of forgiveness produced somewhat contradictory political effects~<br>

Abstract: Assessing the limits of evolutionary and cognitive approaches to the study of culture goes to the heart of an issue that tends to divide humanists and scientists. The issue is how far, in dealing with complex cultural texts and the complex transactions we perform as readers, can we advance by scientific reduction? The issue is vexed by the fact that at times the complexity and novelty of humanistic discourse is little more than obfuscation and strained ingenuity. But such failings discredit neither the search for novelty, nor the earned perception of irreducible complexity, nor the immense importance of work that is necessarily, and terminally, speculative.<br>

Abstract: Roman Catholic social ethics traditionally has affirmed moral objectivity, universal moral goods, and progressive social reform - premises that guide just war theory. In recent decades these guiding values have been challenged by contemporary critical philosophies, confessional or communitarian religious ethics, and the fact of cultural pluralism. I A the middle of this century, thinkers like John Courtney Murray gave Catholic ethics a more historical turn, while retaining an essentially realist and meliorist approach to morality and politics. Now this confidence and optimism are questioned anew by ethnopolitical violence, the ambiguities of humanitar- ian intervention, and uncertain attempts at reconciliation and restoration. Such developments show that the central quandary of Christian and po- litical ethics is not the achievement of agreement on basic human goods; it is the expansion of the circle of solidarity in which basic goods are shared in practice. I will suggest that Christian symbols can help evoke the sense of human solidarity that is necessary to sustain peace, and that transformative efforts toward peace in violence-torn societies can be successful.<br>

Abstract: Erik Erikson's work in psychosocial developmental theory has made valuable contributions to the field of religious ethics on some very basic issues. This paper makes scattered elements of Erikson's explicit ethical perspective available in concise fashion for critical ethical reflection. It does this in such a way as to highlight the centrally important fact for religious ethics that implicitly operative in Erikson's view is a criterion of "self-transcendence" as definitive of mature personal (fully human, ethical) development.<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo expone los principales resultados de una investigación realizada con el objeto de analizar el papel que cumplen las emociones colectivas en el mantenimiento del orden social. En concreto, trata de explicar el hecho de que las noticias más importantes que aparecen en los medios de comunicación sean noticias de horror, es decir, noticias en las que la muerte siempre aparece en el primer plano de la escena. Los informativos de los medios de comunicación expresan y fomentan la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. Ahora bien, para entender esta cultura es preciso determinar previamente la naturaleza emocional del horror, así como establecer una definición sociológica de este sentimiento. El horror es una emoción compleja compuesta por sentimientos de terror, de asco y de conmoción. El horror, sociológicamente, puede entenderse como "la emoción mediante la que un orden social señala sus límites más extremos". El estudio concluye señalando que existen dos modos alternativos de mantener el orden y la cohesión en el seno de un sistema social. El primer modo de legitimación, característico de las sociedades centrípetas, funciona mediante la gran potencia atractiva que ejerce sobre el campo social un núcleo central de valores sociales positivos. El segundo, característico de las sociedades centrífugas, funciona mediante la gran potencia repulsiva que ejercen sobre el campo social las transgresiones flagrantes del orden moral. El modo típico en el que las sociedades centrífugas regulan el orden social explica la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. /// This article sets out the main results obtained from a research study carried out for the purpose of analysing the role that collective emotions play in maintaining social order.

Abstract: Political and legal debates over the value of official silence in the aftermath of civil wars are inconclusive. On the one hand, official silence is considered disrespectful to the memory of the victims and an impediment to establishing a culture of accountability and respect for human rights. On the other, silence is regarded as instrumental to achieving peace. Yet, longitudinal analysis of the dynamics of official silence in Mozambique demonstrates that, in this post-conflict country, as in others, silence has not in fact been achieved. Official silence in politically pluralistic environs can also offer opportunities for political elites to use memories as weapons to settle accounts with former wartime foes. In post-civil war Mozambique, Frelimo and Renamo over time have moved away from the initial strategy of official quiescence. Both parties appropriated the official silence to wage fierce political battles where memories of the violent past are used as the principal weapon. The interruption of silence through manipulative appropriations of the grisly past take place in dispersed political activities; however, the most confrontational and violent eruptions of memory occur in the Mozambican national parliament. These political confrontations signal the necessity in this politically pluralistic society for complex readings of memory against the prevailing monolithic official history.<br>

Abstract: The article explores the social meaning of the songs written and performed during the revolutionary Democratic Kampuchea period in Cambodia (1975-1979), hoping thereby to better understand the ideology of the Khmer Rouge as it relates to aesthetic and the degree to which such an aesthetic may be related to the abuses of power associated with the period. The article summarizes what is known about how the songs were generated and used: on radio broadcasts, at political meeting, and as part of revolutionary theater. It discusses the social implications of the ways the songs were used in meetings and at work sites, and the power generated by the fact that the songs were used to the exclusion of earlier kinds of songs. Finally, the article analyzes three songs found in Khmer Rouge song books, in terms of the attitudes expressed toward nature, labor, youth, and the relationship of the sexes. It explores the idea of irony, and how the "meaning" of the songs may have been tinged with greater and greater irony in relation to the changing reality of the Cambodian revolution.<br>

Abstract: A filosofia prática de Kant, ou seja, o nuclear da sua ética, juntamente com o "primado da razão prática sobre a especulativa" e a "religião nos limites da simples razão", com seu acento no "mal radical", têm inegáveis afinidades com a - e em certos casos influxo da - tradição cristã. O próprio Kant terá em alguns momentos reconhecido isso mesmo. Segundo o autor do presente texto, subsistem, contudo, inegáveis divergências. O artigo, escrito a partir de uma declarada 'simpatia metódica, pretende precisar no possível o alcance de umas e de outras, fazendo sobre o tema um balanço positivo. O autor propõe ainda uma hipótese de leitura do Opus Postumum, reconhecendo aqui uma tentativa por parte de Kant no sentido de purificar o seu "teísmo moral" numa direcção que tão pouco é alheia a importantes intuições cristãs. /// Aim of the article is to show that the practical philosophy of Kant, or, in other terms, the core of his ethics, as is the case with the "primacy of the practical reason over the speculative one" and the "religion within the limits of pure reason", with its accent set upon the idea of "radical evil", have undeniable affinities with -and in certain cases influxes from - the Christian tradition. Kant himself seems to have recognized that much at certain moments. For the author of the article, however, there are a few divergences to be reckoned with. In fact, the article, which is clearly written from the standpoint of a declared methodic sympathy, does whatever is possible in order to determine the reach of the ones and of the others, but in the end concludes that the result is a positive one. The author also suggests a reading hypothesis for the Opus Postumum, acknowledging here an attempt on the part of Kant directed towards a purification of his "moral theism" in a direction that as such is no less close to some very important Christian intuitions.<br>

Author(s): Morujão Alexandre Fradique<br>
Abstract: O sentido da intersubjectividade em Marcel liga-se à intenção de "restituir à experiência humana o seu peso ontológico", o que obriga à recusa do racionalismo contemporaneo, caracterizado pelos principios de inerencia e de objectividade, adoptando uma epistemologia pluralista e relativista em que o universal se degrada em colectivo e o necessário em repetível. O conhecimento válido para todos reduz-se ao verificável, tudo o mais é apenas objecto de crença, da ordem do subjectivo. Esta concepção situa-se no ambito do problemático, isto é, do objectivo, do posto completamente em face de mim. O mundo actual situa-se a esse nivel, corresponde à esfera do ter e a análise desse mundo mostra que ha na experiéncia humana como tal aspectos que transcendem o problemático, pertencendo ao dominio do mistério, que diz respeito à esfera do ser. Para, alcançar o que Marcel designa por mistério ontólogico analisamse, fora do registo lógico, certos dados propriamente espirituais, como a fidelidade, o amor, a esperança, que nos conduzem a um eu, subjectividade livre, que é experimentado com referencia a um tu. O compromisso entre eu e tu traduz-se em disponibilidade e apelo e estabelece uma relagao que é o nós, um co-esse, uma intimidade espiritual. Dentro da economia do pensamento marceliano ever é conceder crédito a um tu. No limite, se o tu for absolute, o credito deverá ser também absoluto. O tu absoluto, Deus, é existente suprapessoal e nunca pode ser tratado como objecto e, portanto, demonstrado, mas está presente à invocação. Afim da crença temos a esperanga que, no significado auténtico, se situa num contexto de provação. Distingue-se do optimismo e do desejo, transcende toda a técnica, não se desenvolve sobre um saber. É própria dos seres desarmados e nisso reside, misteriosamente, a sua eficácia. Consiste num esperar em, experiéncia absoluta no piano do mistério e certeza de transcender o que se encontra em perigo na provação, e participação numa realidade absoluta que me e~<br>

Abstract: Com este texto o autor procura uma resposta para a seguinte pergunta: "Que tipo de método poderá confirmar ou infirmar a hipótese segundo a qual o acto educativo é, no seu núcleo e na sua origem entitativa, confrontação violenta entre duas consciências?". Depois de esclarecer que esta hipótese inter-pretativa da educação tem em mira, não explicar ou descrever a realidade educacional na sua positividade, mas compreender o seu eidos ou essência constitutiva, o autor decide-se, na esteira de Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Duméry, Dufrenne, Levinas e Derrida, pelo método fenomenológico. Para efectuar a exploração filosófica que essa pergunta impõe, o método instituído por Husserl faculta, ao invés dos métodos positivistas e analíticos, uma visão global do fenómeno educativo numa intuição que se atinge depois de realizada uma redução eidética. Além disso, o método fenomenológico é entendido como o mais adequado para desvelar uma realidade cuja textura é tecida por relações intersubjectivas. Todo o texto desenvolve uma sequência argumentativa tendente a mostrar e a demonstrar quer a natureza, quer as potencialidades heurísticas do método fenomenológico aplicado à educação. Só este método poderá evidenciar a estrutura universal e necessária da educação: uma relação violenta entre duas consciências. /// Dans son texte l'auteur cherche une réponse pour la question suivante: "que type de méthode pourra confirmer ou infirmer l'hypothèse selon laquelle l'acte éducatif est en son centre et en son origine confrontation violente entre deux consciences"?

Abstract: L'infini de la volonté voulante n'exclut pas la finitude de l'homme; il l'accentue plutôt dans la mesure où l'homme est incapable de saturer son désir et de s'achever par lui-même. Cette finitude apparaît comme disproportion ontologique dans l'écart du savoir, du pouvoir et du faire, comme faillite de la volonté voulue dans l'expérience de la faute meurtrière. L'ultime tentative de l'autosuffisance humaine consiste à borner le désir et à l'investir dans un fini absolutisé, comme en témoignage l'action superstitieuse. Dans le cas de l'option positive, qui est de "vouloir l'infini" , peut-on concevoir l'achèvement de l'action comme "divinisation" de l'homme? Oui, a condition de ne pas en faire un donné de nature, ni un acquis de l'homme, mais un accueil du don surnaturel qui exige l'aveu de l'insuffisance. /// O infinito da vontade profunda "voulante" não exclui a finitude do homem; antes a acentua na medida em que o homem é incapaz de saturar o seu desejo e de se completar por si mesmo. Esta finitude aparece como desproporção ontológica no distanciamento do saber, do poder e do fazer, como falência (faillite) da vontade concreta "voulue" na experiência da falta mortífera. A ùltima tentativa da autosuficiência humana consiste em limitar o desejo e em investir num finito absolutizado, como o testemunha a acção supersticiosa. No caso da opção positiva, que é de "querer o infinito", pode conceber-se o acabamento da acção como "divinizacao" do homem? Sim, se não se fizer disso urn dado da natureza, nem uma aquisição do homem, mas urn acolhimento do dom sobrenatural que exige a confissão da insuficiência. /// The infinity of the "willing will" ("volonté voulante") does not exclude man's finiteness. It rather stresses it, by the fact that man is unable to completely satisfy his desire, and to fulfil himself on his own. This finiteness appears as ontological disproportion far from both knowledge, power and acting, and as deficiency ("faillite") of the "willed will" ("volonté~<br>

Abstract: Partindo do principio de que o surgimento da ciência, vinculada desde a sua origem à filosofia, constitui um dos signos especificos do "espirito europeu", no que Gadamer se aproxima de Husserl, o artigo procura dilucidar em que medida ospressupostos da hermeneutica gadameriana – cujas categorias axiais analisa – esclarecem o pluralismo linguistico que caracteriza a Europa, o qual, por sua vez, funda, pela consciência de alteridade que implica, um expressivo e activo pluralismo cultural. Mostra ainda como "todos nós somos outros e todos nós somos nós mesmos", na medida em que viver a diferença e avaliar a resistência do que é o outro equivale a viver uma nova experiência da própria identidade. Finalmente, dado que a aspiração para a universalidade não se obtém contra o particular e o especifico, mas através destes, o artigo analisa até que ponto o "ideal europeu" de Gadamer converge para uma união, ou seja, para um estado de coisas em que o universal é justamente potenciado pelas diferenças que existem entre as culturas dos povos europeus. /// On the principle that the emergence of science constitutes one of the distinguishing signs of the "European Spirit", this article endeavors to investigate how the presuppositions of Gadamer's hermeneutics sheds light on the linguistic pluralism that characterizes Europe and her consequent sensitivity towards otherness. The article also demonstrates how we at once are ourselves and others to the degree that we experience differences, increasing thus our own sense of identity. Finally, universality is not opposed to the particular and the specific. This is shown in the fact that Gadamer's "European Ideal" points towards a universality nourished by the cultural differences that exist among the peoples of Europe.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo visa expor efundamentar a necessidade de se articular, para além das diferenças que existam entre eles, os posicionamentos da hermenêutica de Hans-Georg Gadamer em relação às perspectivas abertas pela teoria crítica de Jürgen Habermas y Karl-Otto Apel, já que so assim se poderá adequadamente justificar a dinãmica do conhecimento humano bem como a sua constituiva dimensão critica. Mostra-se também como o debate entre Gadamer e Habermas logrou pôr a claw alguns dos mais importantes pontos de conexão entre ambos, o que nos permite aceder a uma perspectiva filosófica em que se associam o carácter histórico e flnito da razão e a dimensão crítica constitutiva da mesma. Desvanece-se, deste modo, a necessidade de se estabelecer uma alternativa insuperdvel entre "consciência hermenêutica" e "consciência critica ", ao mesmo tempo que se aclara a natureza da reflexão filosófica como sendo um procedimento interpretativo (hermenêutico) crítico em que, justamente por isso, ninguém pode aceder à pretensão de possuir a última palavra. /// This article seeks to establish the need of articulating the positioning of Gadamer's hermeneutics with the critical theory represented by Habermas and Apel. It is only on the basis of such an articulation that the dynamics of knowing can be seen to possess a critical dimension. The debate between Gadamer and Habermas succeeded in rendering explicit some of the points that enable us to envisage a philosophical perspective in which both the historicity of human reason and its critical dimension can be worked together. Thus, the need to establish an unsurpassable alternative between "hermeneutic consciousness" and "critical consciousness" simply disappears. At the same time, it becomes clear that philosophical reflexion itself consists of an interpretative procedure that is also critical in nature, along with the fact that no-one can claim to have the last word in this activity.<br>

Abstract: A quebra no que se refere às certezas da fé, a ênfase da própria experiência e os horrores do século XX levaram ao surgimento de uma vaga de (anti-)teodiceias. Aos ataques por parte do ateísmo correspondem do lado dos teólogos ou um certo resentimento em relação a Deus ou a sua desculpa mediante um pôr-em-questão da sua omnipotência. Surgiram desta forma propostas de carácter ora dualistico ora monístico que fizeram com que a resposta clássica ao problema tivesse progressivamente ficado quase reduzida ao âmbito do ininteligível (veja-se o caso da incompreensão das teses ontológicas referentes ao carácter deficitário do mal). Foi sobretudo em confronto com a tonalidade afectiva desta discussão que surgiu a "free-will-defense" da racionalidade, muito embora a questão seja aqui a de saber até que ponto não têve ela por isso de pagar um preço demasiado alto. Em referência à dupla questão de Boécio na obra "Consolação da Filosofia", o autor do presente artigo defende, por um lado, a não solubilidade do problema da teodiceia: "Si Deus est, unde mala?" - Néscio! Por outro lado, no entanto, o autor constata também que a reflexão sobre a experiência de si não só justifica, como até exige, uma abertura à esperança da fé: "Si vero Deus non est, unde bona?" Seio quod nonl Facto é que desta forma, diz o autor, nos confrontamos com a realidade do bem seja isso a propósito da exigência moral que experimentamos ou do protesto que levantamos contra a realidade do mal. Ora é esta auto-revelação do poder da realidade do santo e do bem que não só nos permite, mas também de nós exige a Esperança da sua manifestação final. /// Breakdown in what concerns faith certainties, emphasis on experience of the self, and the horrors of the XX century led to a wave of (anti)-theodicies.

Article Title: The Narrative Ethics of Leopold's Sand County Almanac<br>

Abstract: Although philosophers often focus on the essays of Leopold's Sand County Almanac, especially "The Land Ethic," there is also a normative argument present in the stories that comprise most of the book. In fact the shack stories may be more persuasive, with a subtlety and complexity not available in his prose piece. This paper develops a narrative ethics methodology gleaned from rhetoric theory, and current interest in narrative ethics among literary theorists, in order to discern the normative underpinnings of the stories in Part 1. The narrative ethics approach sidesteps the need to ground the land ethic in ethical theory—which has been a reconstructive and problematic task for the philosophical interpreters of Leopold—and suggests, instead, that it emerges in Leopold's very effort to narrate his, professional, personal, and practical experience with nature. The involves examining the stories in terms of their emotional, logical and performative aspects. The result is an analysis that shows not only how these stories express normative claims, but also justify them. One conclusion of the analyses is that, in the narratives, there is less emphasis on the problematic notion of an over-arching "community" than in the prose pieces, and more emphasis on the metaphor of other living things as "fellow travelers" in the "odyssey of evolution." Second, the narratives take on an ironic attitude toward the ecological order, less discernable in the prose essays. The order itself may not be ethically admirable, but should be preserved since it makes possible any ethical relations within it. Thus, the narrative reading suggests some temperance to the usual holistic interpretation of his land ethic and its concomitant criticisms especially the charge of ecofacism. We should not take the land ethic imperative at its face value, in the sense that the good of the order itself is an intrinsic good. In the narratives, individuals are shown not merely to be means to the ecological whole,~<br>

Abstract: The article aims at a demonstration of the various problems attached to the concordist project. The study begins with a definition of concordism, precisely in order to show that it is derived from the desire of assuring the unity of the human spirit as it is confronted with the great diversity of scientific knowledge, but also that it ends up contradicting this very intention due to its lack of a true spirit of criticism. The article shows also how during the xx! h century the crucial questions to which the concordism related have to do with those pertaining to the origin of the universe, to the formation of the planet earth and to the notion of original sin. However, due to the fact that this last point is, no doubt, the most delicate and sensible one, the article insists particularly on a more detailed analysis of the notion of original sin in a theological perspective, one namely that is coherent with contemporary scientific knowledge. /// O presente artigo tem por objectivo mostrar os impasses a que conduz a atitude concordista em relação aos dados da Ciência e da Teologia. Nesse sentido, o estudo começa por definir o que se entende por concordismo. Mostra-se até que ponto a intenção do concordismo é a de assegurar a unidade do espírito humano confrontado com a diversidade dos saberes, mas também até que ponto essa mesma intenção é traída pela notável ausência de um verdadeiro espírito crítico. Mostra-se também que ao longo do século XX os pontos mais salientes do concordismo têm a ver com as questões ligadas à origem do universo, à formação da terra e ao pecado original Dado, porém, que este último ponto é, sem dúvida, o mais delicado, o autor do artigo detém-se numa análise mais detalhada e situada da noção de pecado original numa perspectiva teológica renovada por virtude dos conhecimentos derivados das ciências naturais.<br>

Abstract: No centro do presente artigo está a problemática kierkegaardiana do possível e do impossível, ou seja, a coexistência dos opostos como explicitação do paradoxo, uma das figuras matriciais do Absurdo. Para Kierkegaard, o homem singular vê-se confrontado com o Paradoxo precisamente na medida em que a sua existência não cai sob o domínio da metafísica e do estético. Por outras palavras, o paradoxo invade a existência humana no momento em que se trata do paradoxo absoluto, escândalo para o Judeu, loucura para o Grego, absurdo para a Razão. O artigo mostra, contudo, que antes de se confrontar com o Paradoxo, o existente precisa de aprender a esperar, malgrado o absurdo, na certeza de que tudo é possível a Deus. Porém, a experiência do Paradoxo implica percorrer um caminho prévio. Por outras palavras, é necessário aprender a experimentar a "condensação do possível", seja sob a forma de melancolia seja sob a forma do escrúpulo, de modo a poder desesperar da ideia do possível. Mostra-se assim a capacidade inovadora de Kierkegaard, mesmo sabendo nós que o desespero constitui um tema filosófico clássico já deste a Antiguidade. O que Kierkegaard faz, porém, é colocar em movimento uma dialéctica em que o jogo dos opostos se organiza em diversas figuras precárias, sempre incertas e fluentes e que se escalonam segundo degraus múltiplos de intensidade. Ora é precisamente graças a este jogo de oposições que no pensamento do Solitário de Copenhaga se articulam, ainda que de forma frágil, o finito e o infinito, o temporal e o eterno, a possibilidade e a necessidade. /// At the center of the present article is the kierhegaardian approach to the dialectic of the possible and the impossible, whose co-existence gives evidence to the Paradox, one of the figures of the Absurd. For Kierkegaard, the singular human being finds herself confronted with the Paradox precisely in the measure in which her existence does not fall under the dominion of metaphysics and of the aesthetical.

Abstract: O presente artigo tem por objectivo fazer uma reflexão sobre o motto, o prólogo e a introdução a O conceito de Angústia (1844) de Søren Kierkegaard. Longe de serem meros preâmbulos, estes textos constituent importantes chaves de leitura para a obra que encabeçam. Na verdade, a distinção socrática entre o que se sabe e o que não se sabe do motto de O conceito de angústia transforma-se no argumento propriamente dito da obra. A partir desta distinção, Kierkegaard desenvolve a sua crítica contra a confusão moderna das ciências, ao mesmo tempo que propõe uma nova divisão em ordem a poder situar legitimamente a questão do pecado. Em vez de conceber o pecado de maneira especulativa, a psicologia da angústia é apresentada como a única disciplina em que propriamente se pode tratar o problema do pecado e, ao mesmo tempo, ser consciente da sua incompreensibilidade. /// The objective of this article is to think about the motto, preface and introduction to Kierkegaard's The Concept of Anxiety (1844). Far from being mere preambles, these texts constitute the reading key for the book they lead. As a matter of fact, the Socratic distinction between what we understand and what we do not understand from The concept of Anxiety's motto becomes the philosophical argument of the work. From this distinction, Kierkegaard carries out a critique against the modern confusion of sciences and at the same time proposes a new arrangement in which to place legitimately the problem of sin. Instead of conceiving sin in a speculative way, the psychology of anxiety shows itself to be the only discipline able to deal properly with the question of sin and to be conscious of its mysterious dimension.<br>

Abstract: This article constitutes an exploration of Mahmud Darwish's poem, "The Hoopoe," as part of a study on the relationship of myths to culture, in general, and to literature and poetry, in particular. It starts from the hoopoe as a mythical symbol pulling the text in two directions. First, a direction that relates the poem, through time, to the realms of the universe, dream, and poetry, using the language of insinuations and allusions; second, a fictional direction that makes of the the poem-through evocation of previous quest journeys, including texts by Al-Jahiz, Avicenna, Al-Suhrawardi, Al-Hallaj, Aristophanes, and Farid Al-Din Attar-a quest into the depths of the individual and the collective self. Memory, history, and language, culminate in the discovery of the mother-land. Thus, Darwish's poem may be classified as poetry, prose, drama, and epic. It is, in fact, a mixture of all these genres, as well as a literary myth narrating the story of the search for a sacred time-the time of beginnings, and of childhood. /تمثل المقالة حفراﹰ استبطانياﹰ في قصيدة "الهدهد" لمحمود درويش - ضمن بحث في علاقة الأساطير بالثقافة عامة وبالأدب والشعر خاصة - انطلاقاﹰ من الهدهد كرمز أسطوري يتجاذب النص في اتجاهين اثنين: أ- اتجاه جدولي، يصل القصيدة - عبر الزمن - بعالم الكون وعالم المنام وعالم الشعر في لغة اللمح والإشارة٠ ب- اتجاه أفقي قصصي، يجعل من القصيدة - عبر رحلات نموذجية سابقة ومن خلال نصوص حاضرة غائبة للجاحظ، وابن سينا، والسهروردي، والحلاج، وأرسطوفان، وفريد الدين العطار، وغيرهم - رحلة في أعماق الذات الفردية، وفي أعماق الذات الجماعية ذاكرة وتاريخاﹰ٠ تجمع قصيدة درويش بين "الشعر" و"النثر" والمسرحية والملحمة، كما أنها أسطورة أدبية تقص علينا قصة بحث عن زمن مقدس هو زمن البدايات والطفولة٠‬<br>

Abstract: Cet article se propose de comprendre le sens musical d'une production de techno dite underground. Au travers de l'analyse de « Let's play » de Crystal Distortion, un artiste réputé de la mouvance free party (ou techno clandestine), on examine principalement la coexistence douloureuse des valeurs utopiques de ce mouvement, aujourd'hui considérablement affaiblies, avec le statut inévitablement commercial du disque sur lequel figure la composition. L'opposition pourrait être frontale, une de ces valeurs premières étant justement le refus de la société marchande, mais on décèle au travers de différentes analyses de nombreuses stratégies pour cacher au mieux l'aspect commercial attelé au morceau. En effet, tout ce qui met une œuvre en situation contribue à son sens, et c'est pourquoi nous consacrons du temps à exposer certains aspects du mouvement acquis par un long travail de terrain et de nombreuses observations participantes : la présentation des valeurs de la free party ; son historique ; la manière dont est considéré Crystal Distortion par les acteurs du mouvement ; ainsi que le fait qu'il vende cette production sur CD (la plupart des productions étant normalement tirées uniquement sur vinyle car destinées au mix par des DJs). Puis nous passons à l'examen des éléments composant la jaquette du CD pour en arriver enfin à l'analyse interne de la production, en relation avec les précédentes strates de l'analyse. The purpose of this paper is to understand the musical meaning of a production of so-called underground techno music. Through the analysis of "Let's play" by Crystal Distortion, a famous artist from the free party trend (or underground techno trend), one examines the painful coexistence of the Utopian values of the movement, tremendously weakened today, with the unavoidable commercial status of the record in which the composition appears. The confrontation could be frontal, as one of these essential values precisely is the refusal of consumer society; but one de~<br>

Abstract: Le sujet est la construction identitaire des lesbiennes qui se perçoivent elles-mêmes comme masculines et qui sont ainsi perçues par leur entourage: par les lesbiennes aussi bien que par les autres personnes. Le "masculin" est envisagé comme une création dans et par la hiérarchie de genre.L'au teure a mené pendant un an une enquête dans une discothèque; 19 histoires de vie apportent leur témoignage. Au terme de ses recherches, la masculinité en question apparaît: 1) comme une manière supportable d'être une femme pour celles qui ne sereconnaissent pas dans le stéréotype féminin; 2) comme un "paysage", c'est-àdire comme quelque chose dontlalesbienne trouve les traits dans le système de genres de la société et dont elle s'empare, faute de mieux ou d'autre chose, pour manifester son refus de la position genrée à quoi la société l'assigne. This article is about the construction of identity among lesbians who perceive themselves and are perceived as "masculine" by others, including other lesbians. The "masculine" is seen by the author as a construction of the gender hierarchy. The author has conducted interviews for a year in a bar and has collected 19 life-stories.Her findings show that the masculinity attributed to lesbians is: 1) a way of making tolerable the fact of being a woman for those women who do not accept the feminine stereotypes; 2) a landscape: an environment made up by lesbians with elements they find in society's gender system, for lack of alternative models, and which they use to express their refusal of the gendered position society wants to assign them.<br>

Article Title: Narrative and the re-co[r]ding of cultural memory¹ in Moses Isegawa's Abyssinian Chronicles and Snakepit<br>
Publisher: Taylor & Francis<br>
Issue: i40028027<br>
Date: 12 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Armstrong Andrew H.<br>
Abstract: The attempt to write extreme violence, or to reco[r]d[e] traumatic cultural memory - the representation of horror - tests both the representational capacity of language and the rationality of subjecthood. Much narrative endeavour is spent trying to narrativise or 'structure' horror into story. However, because traumatic memories resist the narrative framework of the novel, questions are posed not only about the reliability of the narrator's memory and his/her ability to narrate a credible story, but also about the suitability of the fictional form of the novel to represent historical events such as extreme violence. How does language in narrative, with its insistence on order and sequence, 'capture' the destructuring nature of violence? Where is the subject or the idea of rational subjectivity in these de-structuring acts of violence? I will attempt to address these issues through a critical 'reading' of Moses Isegawa's novels Abyssinian Chronicles (2000) and Snakepit (2004). In these novels, Isegawa recasts and reenacts a period of recent Ugandan history marked by violence and chaos, emanating from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. However, both novels stretch the limits of 'factual' or historical credulity, reminding the reader that they are in fact works of historical fabrication. I am of the view that the narrative endeavour in these two novels is not only to record the chaotic events experienced during the years before and after the fall of Idi Amin, but to recode, through the tropes of language (symbol, imagery, and metaphor), the devastating effects of those years on the literary landscape of Uganda.<br>

Abstract: Nous nous proposons ici de réfléchir à la question suivante : Comment expliquer le fait que les fondateurs du « programme fort », Barry Bames et David Bloor, insistent depuis quelques années pour dire qu'ils n'ont jamais nié l'influence de la « réalité » sur la formation des connaissances scientifiques et qu'en fait ils ont été mal compris de leurs lecteurs ? Alors que Bloor tente d'expliquer les malentendus en les situant complètement du côté du récepteur, en invoquant une loi psychologique dite de « conventionalisation » proposée par Frederic Charles Bartlett, nous voulons esquisser ici une explication complémentaire qui se situe du côté de l'émetteur et prend au sérieux la structure argumentaire des textes. We propose in this paper to answer the following question : How can we explain the fact that the founders of the « Strong Program », Barry Bames and David Bloor, insisted, over the last couple of years, to say that they have never denied the role played by « reality » in the construction of scientific knowledge, and thus have been misunderstood by their readers ? Whereas Bloor explains these misunderstandings by invoking a psychological law of « conventionalization » due to Frederic Charles Bartlett, thus locating the source of the problem on the receiver's (reader's) side, we suggest here a complementary explanation taking into account the argumentative structure of the text itself, hence situating the origin of the confusion on the writer's side.<br>

Abstract: Ce travail analyse l'usage du mythe bolivarien dans l'histoire du Venezuela dans la longue durée, suivant l'approche de l'histoire des idées et des sensibilités et jusqu'à prendre en compte l'imaginaire politique de la République bolivarienne. Il montre qu'au-delà de la chronologie consacrée par les historiographies de l'indépendance et patriotique surgissent des thèmes et des passions souvent oubliés par l'histoire académique, aujourd'hui récupérés par l'histoire officielle. C'est dire la nécessité de dresser une esquisse « opportune » du héros, en laissant de côté les faits pétrifiés voire sanctifiés. Desde la perspectiva de la historia de las ideas y de la historia de las representaciones, este trabajo intenta analizar el uso del mito bolivariano en la historia de Venezuela, ubicándolo en el tiempo largo hasta llegar al imaginario político de la «República Boüvariana». Muestra cómo, más allá de la consagrada cronología independentista y de la historiografía patria, asoman temas y pasiones muy a menudo olvidados de la historia académica aunque si rescatados por une nueva historia oficial. De ahí la necesidad de llegar a un boceto «oportuno» del héroe, dejando de lado hechos petrificados y hasta santificados. This essays aims to analyze the use of bolivarian myths in Venezuelan history from point of view of the history of ideas and representations. So its focuses on long term interpretation in order to emphasize the political imaginary of Bolivarian Republic. It points out to the fact that, along with Independence consecrated chronology and homeland centered historiography, come up matters and passions frequendy forgotten by academic history but recovered by the new official history.<br>

Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to outline Ricoeur's outlook on the basis of ethics and on the main elements to shape the ethical intention. Although this topic is not to the fore in his thought, Ricoeur has often raised the ethical problematic and delivered most valuable insights into it. We explain how he let a subjective, intersubjective and neutral moment precede the relationship between freedom and law. We also inquire into his vision on values and on the impact and meaning of evil for ethics. The ground of ethical existence is the fact that man basically is original affirmation of being which manifests itself in longing and striving. This dynamic facticity which is only discoverable through a reflection upon the works and creations of man, represents the starting-point for an autonomous ethics having a historical character. In this way, Ricoeur - in the main stream of J. Nabert - turns against I. Kant whose duty ethics misjudges the basic dialectic of human action. Besides, this starting-point allows ethics to meet the Christian kerygma in a more meaningful way than duty ethics is in a position to it. For the kerygma sacralizes no ethical interdiction but situates man into a history of salvation and proclaims healing and fulfilment to man's longing. A second and decisive moment in ethical existence is the appearance of the other. When the other enters into my life, he calls me up to foster mine and his freedom als well. The other becomes a centre of obligation to me, and I am called up to promote the well being of all mankind. Ricoeur also points out that the very norm of morality is man both as an individual and communitarian being. Furthermore, as human freedom is always mediated, we should fully take into account the economic, political and cultural reality which is ethically most relevant. The practice of freedom raises the question of values. Ricoeur rejects any voluntaristic and essentialistic view. Values are immanent requirements of freedom in its effort ~<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40044033<br>
Date: 5 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Barber Michael<br>
Abstract: Dorion Cairns correctly interprets the preconstituted stratum of Edmund Husserl's Fifth Cartesian Meditation to be the primordial ego and not the social world, as was thought by Alfred Schutz, who considered Husserl to be insufficiently attentive to the social world's hold upon us. Following Cairns's interpretation, which involves recovering and reconstructing strata that may never exist independently, one better understands how the transfer of sense "animate organism" involves automatic association, or somatic apprehension. This sense-transfer extends to any animate organism, not just humans, and draws on extensive unreflected-upon similarities despite the distinctive fact that the other's body is never given to oneself as is one's own. Following Cairns's interpretation, one can also understand the second epoché as an imaginative, reconstructive abstraction rather than as an example of failed ascesis. Consequently, Husserl appears as less intellectualized in his approach to empathy than often thought to be and more confident in the phenomenologist's capacity to imagine and attend selectively to experience.<br>

Article Title: Stanley Cavell on Modern Music: "Music Discomposed" and "A Matter of Meaning It" after Forty Years<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i40044259<br>
Date: 4 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Cox Franklin<br>
Abstract: Cavell's influential mid-1960s critique of the "new music" of the postwar era poses significant challenges for contemporary composers who value this music. As with postmodernist critics, he has ably identified shortcomings in justifications for recent modernist music. With the benefit of time, however, the distance between Cavell's and the postmodernists' views concerning subjectivity and the role of the arts in defining it have become increasingly clear. In Cavell's scenario, a contemporary listener or critic confronted with the new music faces a sort of existentialist crisis: he or she is unable to individually affirm the value of a music that conforms to no recognizable models for music yet accepts the fact that this music is, according to Cavell's model of modernism, the fruit of an inexorable historical development. Cavell's interest in this dilemma stems. from the wider aims of his philosophical project, particularly his focus on the perils of the nihilism he finds evident in deterministic and mechanistic theories of the arts. In this light, in both "Music Discomposed" and "A Matter of Meaning It," Cavell appears to be using new music primarily as a vehicle to articulate his concerns and to criticize formalist theories of artistic interpretation, such as that of Wimsatt and Beardsley. Unfortunately, there is little evidence of an effort on Cavell's part to engage this music with the same seriousness that is evident in his writings on modernist authors and visual artists. Toward the end of the article, attention is drawn to the ethical responsibility, given the situation Cavell has sketched, for a critic of the modern arts to make a commitment, either to an existing modern music or to a possible future music.<br>

Abstract: Le Tessin représente l'unique canton de la Suisse à grande majorité italophone. La construction de l'identité se base essentiellement sur la notion d'« italianité » et sur celle de « helvétidté ». Il s'agit en réalité d'une « double appartenance », et l'article analyse les différents modes de production sociale de l'ambivalence au plan des discours (historiques, linguistiques, folkloriques, politiques, rituels et visuels) et des pratiques sociales correspondantes. The canton Ticino is the unique Swiss canton with Italian-speaking majority. The construction of identity is based essentially on che notions of « italianity » and « swissness » which reveal in fact a « multiple belonging » to Italy and Switzerland. The article analyzes social production of ambivalence in historical, linguistic, folkloric, political, ritual and visual discourses and the corresponding social practices. Der Kanton Tessin ist der einzige Kanton mit italienisch-sprenchender Mehrheit. Die Konstruktion der nationalen Identität beruht hauptsächlich auf den Begriffen von « italianità » und « patria svizzera », was eine multiple italienische und schweizerische Angehörigkeit andeutet. Der Artikel analysiert die verschiedenen Modi von Sozialer Produktion von Ambivalenz in historischen, linguistischen politischen, ritualen und visualen Diskursen und der entsprechenden sozialen Praktiken.<br>

Abstract: Entrepris depuis un quart de siècle, le démantèlement de l'industrie lourde lorraine (mines et sidérurgie) touche à sa fin. À partir de la comparaison entre le dernier événement en date, la fermeture spectaculaire de la dernière mine de charbon, et la mise en scène, une décennie plus tôt, de la dernière coulée d'une usine de la Lorraine sidérurgique, l'auteur s'interroge sur les finalités patrimoniales de telles célébrations. Présentant quelques moments du traitement culturel — patrimonial, mémoriel... — de la crise industrielle lorraine, depuis les symptômes photographiques d'une mémoire empêchée jusqu'au musée très « contrôlé » en passant par la monumentalisation controversée de restes industriels, il met l'accent sur la lutte des représentations qui se noue autour de la construction de la « Lorraine industrielle » en objet-frontière patrimonial. Cet article souhaite ainsi contribuer à une anthropologie politique de l'institution de la mémoire. The dismantling of the heavy industry in Lorraine that is under way since a quarter of century (mines and iron and steel industry) is nearing its end. When comparing the latest event — the spectacular closure of the last coalmine — with the staging of the last casting in an iron and steel factory of Lorraine ten years earlier the author questions about the patrimonial aims of such celebrations. He shows some sequences of the cultural treatment (patrimonial, memorial) of the industrial crisis in Lorraine, from the photographic « symptoms » of a hindered memory to the highly « controlled » museum and to the industrial remains turned into historic buildings, a largely controversial fact. In this context he stresses the conflicting representations of « industrial Lorraine » as a patrimonial Boundary Object (abstract or concrete, that several actors can appropriate as they like). This article is meant to contribute to a political anthropology of memory institution. Die Zerschlagung der lothringischen Schwerindustrie (Bergwerken ~<br>

Abstract: A educaçao é vulgarmente considerada um importante instrumento impulsionador da transformacäo social. Alias, segundo a teoría liberal, a educaçao foi sempre considerada urna via para a mobilidade social e a chave do progresso individual e social. Todavía, foi nos anos 60 que a educaçao começou a atrair as atençôes dos economistas, dos políticos, dos organismos internacionais e dos movimentos revolucionarios. Com efeito, tiveram lugar certos acontecimentos que levaram a olhar mais de perto os processus e as instituiçôes educacionais. A elaboraçâo de teorías económicas da educaçao constituí um indicativo deste descente interesse pela educaçao e pelo saber. A concepçâo económica do « capital humano » contém, porém, pressupostos ideológicos que reforçam o modelo capitalista da sociedade. De qualquer modo, a educaçao, em termos de descimentó económico e mobilidade social, foi posta em evidencia em todos os países capitalistas desenvolvidos. Nos países capitalistas subdesenvolvidos, a crescente industrializaçâo também salientou o papel da educaçao na mudança social. Mas, além dos problemas do desenvolvimento capitalista nos países desenvolvidos e da industrializaçâo nos países capitalistas subdesenvolvidos, os anos 60 e os principios dos anos 70 proporcionaran! outras razöes para destacar a importancia da educaçao nas mudanças sociais. Designadamente, as reformas educacionais socialistas em Cuba, na China e, mais recentemente, em diversos países africanos constitiiem inspiraçao para novos e importantes estudos. Na revoluçâo socialista há a consciência de que a luta das classes também se manifesta nas escolas. Por outro lado, as teorías de confuto, marxistas e näo marxistas, também se aplicam à análise das reformas educacionais nas sociedades capitalistas. Estas teorías tentam estabelecer as bases para uma sociedade alternativa, baseada no valor do trabalho.

Abstract: Europe is grounded, from all sides, in traces of old inter-state and ethnic conflicts. Experience has proved that they can still be re-activated in spite of various forms of resolution in the past. History is welcome in the present, and we can observe mobilisation among agents, populations of victims, or despoiled groups, which have been forgotten or forced into silence through post-conflictual issues. Various interest groups, political parties, or states, build up memorial resources that they incorporate in their actions list of historicist strategies, with the aim of 'recycling' the representations of the symbolic pasts into contemporary political games. These mobilisations meet the reconciliation trends coming from society (for example, informal groups, NGOs, and so on), or are taken in charge by national and international institutions – which are becoming more and more routine - especially under the influence of the circulation of 'good' models of the pacification of resentments, containing a highly normative tone. The question is to know whether, in spite of the apparent heterogeneity of this phenomenon, the historicist games do constitute a common indicator of the state of political regimes, especially democracies, and also of the strength of that supranational construction called the EU. This question necessitates the revisiting of the dominant concepts in the field of the political sociology of memory. The international circulation of reconciliation grammars, and the fact that memory issues are being torn out of their national frameworks and exploited in several arenas, both internal and external, in order to increase their yield of political resources, are further evidence that the paradigms heretofore dominant in the social sciences are now at an impasse.<br>

Abstract: Multiculturalism is a term spreading in the West during the 1960s to indicate respect, tolerance and defence of cultural minorities. The idea of multiculturalism has become a collective imaginary ("all different, all equals"). It has generated a political ideology supporting an inclusive citizenship towards "different" cultures. After being adopted as official policy in many Countries, multiculturalism has generated more negative than positive effects (fragmenting the society, separating the minorities and fostering cultural relativism). As a political doctrine, it seems harder and harder to be put into practice. At its place, today we talk of interculturality. But this expression too seems quite vague and uncertain. This essay discusses on the possible alternatives to multiculturalism, asking itself whether the way of interculturality can be a solution or not. The Author's thesis is that the theory of interculturality has the advantage to stress the inter, namely what lies in between different cultures. But it does not possess yet the conceptual and effective means to understand and handle the problems of the public sphere, when the different cultures express cultural values radically conflictual between them. The troubles of interculturality result from two lacks: an insufficient reflexivity inside the single cultures, and the lack of a relational interface between the different cultures (between the carrier subjects). Modern western Reason created a societal structure (lib-lab) promoting neither the first nor the second one. In fact, it neutralizes them, because it faces the dilemmas of values inside the cultural diversities through criteria of ethical indifference. Such criteria set reflexivity to zero, preventing individuals to understand the deepest reasons of the vital experience of the others. Reason is emptied of its meaning and of its understanding capability. To go over the failures of multiculturalism and the fragilities of interculturality, a lay approa~<br>

Article Title: Smashing the Mirror of Yamato: Sakaguchi Ango, Decadence and a (Post-metaphysical) Buddhist Critique of Culture<br>
Publisher: International Research Center for Japanese Studies<br>
Issue: i40058970<br>
Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Shields James Mark<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on several key philosophical themes in the criticism of Sakaguchi Ango (1906—1955), one of postwar Japan's most influential and controversial writers. Associated with the underground kasutori culture as well as the Burai-ha of Tamura Taijirō (1911-1983), Oda Sakunosuke (1913-1947) and Dazai Osamu (1909-1948), Ango gained fame for two provocative essays on the theme of daraku or "decadence"—"Darakuron" and "Zoku darakuron"—published in 1946, in the wake of Japan's traumatic defeat and the beginnings of the Allied Occupation. Less well known is the fact that Ango spent his student years studying classical Buddhist texts in Sanskrit, Pali and Tibetan, and that at one time he aspired to the priesthood. This article analyses the concept of daraku in the two essays noted above, particularly as it relates to Ango's vision of a refashioned morality based on an interpretation of human subjectivity vis-à-vis the themes of illusion and disillusion. It argues that, despite the radical and modernist flavor of Ango's essays, his "decadence" is best understood in terms of Mahāyāna and Zen Buddhist concepts. Moreover, when the two essays on decadence are read in tandem with Ango's wartime essay on Japanese culture ("Nihon bunka shikan," 1942), they form the foundation for a "post-metaphysical Buddhist critique of culture," one that is pragmatic, humanistic, and non-reductively physicalist.<br>

Author(s): Zembrzycki Stacey<br>
Abstract: As oral historians, we devote a great deal of time to painstakingly designing our projects, cognizant of the fact that our research requires us to interact with human beings in often intimate ways. For this same reason, though, our careful methodology and meticulously designed projects are constantly being tested. This article is a reflection on some of the ethical and methodological challenges that the authors faced during their life story interviews with Holocaust survivors in Montreal, Canada. In particular, it explores three major themes: the elaborate process of learning to "share authority" and build trust with interviewees; the limitations of "deep listening" and their implications; and the struggle to deal with contentious politics, such as perceived racism, that emerged out of some interviews. Reflection on these methodological and ethical challenges not only opens up a wider and important discussion among researchers about how practice relates to theory but also teaches us about our interviewees. For example, what does an interviewee's refusal to engage deeply about his or her past tell us about how they formed their identity in the aftermath of mass violence? Challenges, such as this one, are part of the story. They shed light on questions of narrative formation, the identity politics that result from survival, and how individual memory interacts with dominant narratives about atrocity. They force us to recognize that both our interviewees—and ourselves—are human beings, and not just collections of stories.<br>

Abstract: To refer to reality in literature has often been incorrectly understood as the fact that the author designates elements of the real world of his time, term for term as it were and as if everyone would agree on what constitutes "the real world of his time"; from this point of view, an author such as Proust is cut off from reality... This is to miss the degree to which Proust's practice of language asks the relevant questions about reference as it tries to refer to reality, namely the phenomenological question of the way we dynamically construct at least the reality we perceive.<br>

Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>

Date: 12 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Hatch John B.<br>
Abstract: The book Letters Across the Divide: Two Friends Explore Racism, Friendship, and Faith embodies a dialogic rhetoric with significant potential to influence its intended audience to accept the need for racial atonement and reconciliation. It exemplifies what Aaron Gresson calls a "dance of agency" in both its interpersonal exchanges and constructed relationship with readers. Bringing white and black voices, individual and collective concerns, and (interpersonal and public discourse into dialogue, Letters demonstrates the transformative power of "voice," which mediates the "authenticity" of Buberian dialogic rhetoric and the cultural performances of Bakhtinian dialogism. The fact that the white coauthor boldly affirms commonplaces of white resistance increases the likelihood that white readers would identify with and be influenced by his profound attitudinal change in dialogue with his black friend. The coherence and credibility ofthat transformation depend upon the prefigurai power of the authors' shared religious narrative—both enabling and constraining Letters' influence on public racial reconciliation.<br>

Issue: i40100618<br>
Date: 1 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Špirit Michael<br>
Abstract: This article discusses the attitude of the Czech literary critic Václav Černý to his fellow critic and compatriot F. X. Šalda, that is to say, Černý's self-stylization, which was defined in polemical reference to Šalda, and also the way Černý 'broadcast' it or concealed it - the primary feature of his technique. Concerning the question of whether literary criticism is a science or an art, the author does not state that Šalda was correct in his Stance against Černý nor, for that matter, that Černý was correct in his against Šalda: the construct of Černý's 'Co je kritika, co není a k čemu je na světě' [What Criticism Is, What It Is Not, and Why It Exists at All] is just as valid as Šalda's claim. The article seeks to demonstrate that in particular it was in his conception of literary criticism that Černý needed to distance himself from Šalda. The fact that Černý could argue for his own method only thanks to Šalda's not having declared criticism a science is only seemingly a paradox. The article also points out parallels between Šalda’s Boje o zítřek and Černý's Osobnost, tvorba a boj, which are interesting particularly for the way the narrow correspondence between the two works then stands out and how Černý in fact barely discussed Šalda at ali. The affinity of the two critics emphasizes how important it was for Černý to stress the difference between himself and his predecessor in the very area in which he was in fact most similar to him.<br>

Abstract: This article portrays an Ungava Inuk named Caghannack who was at the service of the Hudson's Bay Company's post of Fort Chimo from 1832? to 1843 and became afterwards a central figure in an adventure story published in the XIXth century. From data sifted from the Hudson's Bay archives, this Inuk surnamed Big Man, performed valuable tasks for the Company as a homeguard and as an intermediary with his countrymen of Ungava Bay. In the adventure book Ungava: A Tale of Esquimau Land (1858[1857]) written by the Scotman R. M. Ballantyne, who surnames him Maximus and tranforms him into a true figure, this Inuk fought in addition the Indians of the Eastmain, visited the Europeans in James Bay, became a Christian and made a contribution to the development of trade and interethnic peace in the Québec-Labrador peninsula, thus acquiring prestige and leadership among his countrymen. Even if it is difficult to distinguish fact from fiction, Caghannack appears to be, both in the archives and in literature, a key figure of the trading relationships in Ungava Bay (archives) and in Québec-Labrador (literature) in the XIXth century. In this last case, this figure, characteristic of a romantic "Noble Savage", would stand as a substitute for the too acculturated Indians. Cet article reconstitue le portrait d'un Inuk de l'Ungava nommé Caghannack qui séjourna au comptoir de la Compagnie de la Baie d'Hudson de Fort Chimo de 1832? à 1843 et qui devint un personnage central d'un récit d'aventures au XIXe siècle. Selon les données fragmentaires contenues dans les sources manuscrites, cet Inuk surnommé Big Man rendit de précieux services à la Compagnie à titre de domicilié et d'intermédiaire auprès de ses congénères de la baie d'Ungava. D'après le récit d'aventures Ungava: A Tale of Esquimau Land (1858[1857]) de l'écrivain écossais Robert M. Ballantyne, qui l'affuble du surnom de Maximus et qui en fait une véritable figure, cet Inuk affronta en plus les Indiens, rendit visite aux Européens à la~<br>

Abstract: "Empathy" and "contagion" are semantically related in their common reference to the suffering of infectious disease, spiritual and physical. How exactly do they differ as interpersonal phenomena? René Girard establishes a link between mimetic behavior and the contagious transference of emotion that spreads through groups of people, resulting in victimage. Jewish philosophers Edith Stein and Simone Weil distinguish such an emotional transference from genuine empathy, which involves a different, ethical stance and a saintly imitation. Empathy for the afflicted individual, in fact, makes one immune to the contagion that too often results in scapegoating.<br>

Abstract: Primo Levi's If This Is a Man is a central work in understanding the way in which the subjective memory of a Holocaust survival receives a general meaning. This requires a context in which the duty to prevent the repetition of the tragic events endured by European Jews becomes a universal responsibility we must assume. This text examines the process of dehumanization and total degradation of a human being in the conditions of the death camp, and examines the antidote that Levi proposes for escaping the state of existential pathology. Particular emphasis is placed on the way in which Levi, who embraces secular humanist values, uses religious background and religious symbolic structures in order to provide additional understanding of the fact that in the absence of God, the world itself becomes void of humanity.<br>

Article Title: Irrationality and the Plurality of Philosophical Systems<br>
Publisher: Blackwell-Wiley Publishing<br>
Issue: i40115211<br>
Date: 1 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur Paul<br>
Abstract: Beginning with the paradoxical fact of the plurality of philosophical systems, the irrationality of this situation is examined, first, from the point of view of two solutions — the Hegelian solution and that which dissolves the paradox by denying that systems are exclusive of one another — judged to be inadequate; and then from the viewpoint of the contrast between the claims of genuine philosophy and its actual historical practice. The idea of system is examined from the perspective of Spinoza's Ethics and, finally, M. Gueroult's idéalisme intégral serves as a guide in exploring the result of subordinating the historical features of philosophical activity to its systematic features. Partant du fait paradoxal de la pluralité des systèmes philosophiques, l'auteur examine l'irrationalité de cette situation d'abord du point de vue de deux solutions — celle de Hegel et celle qui résoud le paradoxe en niant que les systèmes s'excluent mutuellement — solutions qui sont jugées inadéquates; puis du point de vue du contraste entre la véritable philosophie et sa pratique historique effective. L'idée de système est examinée dans la perspective de l'éthique de Spinoza et, enfin, l'idéalisme intégral de M. Gueroult sert de guide pour explorer les conséquences d'une subordination des aspects historiques de l'activité philosophique à ses aspects systématiques. Angesichts der paradoxen Situation der Pluralität von philosophischen Systemen wird die Irrationalität dieser Situation untersucht: zunächst vom Gesichtspunkt zweier Lösungen — nämlich der Lösung Hegels und derjenigen die darin besteht, die Unvereinbarkeit der Systeme zu leugnen —, die beide als inadäquat verworfen werden; dann von einem Standpunkt aus, der zwischen den Ansprüchen echter Philosophie und deren tatsächlicher historischer Praxis unterscheidet. Der Begriff des Systems wird aus der Perspektive von Spinozas Ethik untersucht und schliesslich wird M. Gueroults integraler Idealismus als Führer verwendet, um das Ergeb~<br>

Abstract: Le revival, qui se développa parmi les premiers disciples de Husserl, est un fait saisissant. Des documents, dont quelques uns sont encore inédits, servent à l'illustrer. Ce qui le fonde, c'est une étrange correspondance entre le projet de la première phénoménologie et les démarches subjectives de la conscience religieuse. La vraie philosophie, sainteté de la raison, n'est-elle pas aussi rectitude de la conscience jusqu'aux racines d'une expérience du sacré ou du divin ? The revival, which appeared among the first disciples of Ed. Husserl, is a well known fact. New documents are dedicated to illustrate such an event. They make clearer the existence of some mysterious bond linking the first phenomenological method and the basic disposition of natural religion. Genuine philosophy is indeed rightness of thought but also practical truth down to the very sources of a renovating feeling of the holy or the divine.<br>

Abstract: Quand Suarez aborde la question du sens du mot droit il se réclame de saint Thomas et du droit romain ; en fait l'usage des références et des citations masque un détournement : la réduction, au droit subjectif et à la loi, de l'ancien souci d'attribuer à chacun ce qui lui revient. When Suarez approaches the meaning of the word jus, he refers to Thomas Aquinas and to Roman Law ; in fact his use of references and quotations hides an embezzlement : the reduction of the old care « suum cuique tribuendi » to subjective right and to lex.<br>

Abstract: Les critiques reprochent souvent à la philosophie de James d'être trop nominaliste ou subjectiviste ou, plus spécifiquement, de ne pas soutenir le statut réel des universaux, de la « possibilité actuelle ». Nous proposons ici une réponse à ces critiques. Particulièrement une analyse attentive de ce que dit James sur Dieu (dans Pragmatism) est très révélatrice. James y progresse vers une position de possibilité réelle comme elle pourrait être exprimée en termes du conditionnel « contraire-aufait ». Cette position oblige James, procédant comme un empiriste, à conclure que le « réellement réel » est plus étendu que le logique et cela essentiellement. Critics often attack James' philosophy for being overly nominalistic or subjectivistic, or more specifically for not asserting the real status of generals, of « actual possibility. » In this paper I offer one defense against such criticisms. Specifically, a careful analysis of James' statements on God (as found in Pragmatism) is extremely revealing. In these statements, James works towards a position of actual possibility, as might be verbalized in terms of the « contrary-to-fact » conditional. Such a position forces James, acting as an empiricist, to conclude that the « really real » is broader than the logical, and essentially so.<br>

Abstract: C'est dans le tome III de Temps et récit, paru en 1985 que, dans le cadre d'un chapitre intitulé « L'aporétique de la temporalité », Paul Ricœur entre directement en débat avec l'auteur d'Être et temps. Bien qu'il souligne d'emblée l'originalité proprement phénoménologique de l'analyse heideggérienne du temps qui a le mérite de rompre avec le subjectivisme d'Augustin et de Husserl, il ne l'en soumet pas moins à une critique sévère, centrée sur deux points principaux : le privilège donné à l'être pour la mort, qu'il oppose à l'insouciance spinoziste à l'égard de la mort et au privilège donné à la natalité par Hannah Arendt, et l'aporie inhérente à la conception heideggérienne d'une finitude de la temporalité et d'un concept vulgaire du temps, qui ne permet pas, selon lui, à Heidegger de rendre compte aussi bien du temps historique que du temps de la nature. On s'efforce ici, en prenant appui sur les textes mêmes de Heidegger, de répondre point par point à cette critique. In the chapter entitled « The Aporetic of Temporality » of the third volume of Time and Narrative, published in 1985, Paul Ricœur enters directly into a debate with the author of Being and Time. In spite of the fact that he begins by emphasizing the originality of the Heideggerian time-analysis which breaks with Augustine's and Husserl's subjectivism, he nevertheless submits it to a severe critique which is centred on two main points : first, the privilege given to the being toward death, which Ricœur opposes to Spinoza's carelessness regarding death and Arendt's privilege given to natality, and secondly, the aporia involved in Heidegger's conception of a finite temporality and of a vulgar concept of time, which in his view does not allow to take into account historical time as well as natural time. This paper undertakes, on the basis of Heidegger's texts themselves, to give a detailed answer to Ricœur's critique.<br>

Abstract: Communities, whether they are "real" or virtual, are mediated by interpretation. One's place within a community is also constituted by an ongoing metaphoric "reading" through which one attempts to understand what others within the community say and do. Virtual communities are unique in making such reading explicit through further acts of writing: participants form their communities through public performances of writing, reading, and interpreting of texts. Any analysis of virtual communities must take into account both the exchange of meaning through texts and the fact of a mediating distance between participants. The hermeneutic theories of Paul Ricoeur can support an analysis of these activities, which accounts for temporal and spatial distance in the exchange of the community's texts. Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory can be used to describe the process that drives virtual communities, which makes them into forums that attempt to "connect the scattered members of an invisible republic" [1, p. 43] in an electronic world.<br>

Abstract: As a Catholic historian, this theme raises particular difficulties for me, since the notion of specific patterns of thought is one I would not use, and the term 'contemporary history' is much too vague. Of course, Catholic scholars, no less than their protestant counterparts, still recognize the need to raise questions about the nature of history and its analysis, despite the various unsuccessful attempts in the past when systematic theologians have failed to come to terms with the reality of historical events, as in the unhistorically conceived 'New Scholasticism'. The concept of 'freedom', for example, is one which requires new conceptualization in our present historical context. If we accept the current view that all rationalist theories of knowledge are in fact based on an act of 'faith', so we have to see that the belief in the primacy of 'Reason' cannot any longer be maintained. Which does not mean that we have to take flight into 'unreason', or abandon rational categories of thought. What we need to find is some manner by which 'faith' can be anchored as a final justification, over and above any transcendental basis. In our present pluralistic world this will have to be to presented in a variety of ways. But at least it calls for a new consideration of how to relate 'faith' and 'knowledge'.<br>

Abstract: Comme n'importe quel éditeur scientifique, l'économiste qui entend diffuser les écrits de ses prédécesseurs est confronté à une problématique invariable : publier quoi et comment, par delà le choix de qui. Les difficultés posées par cette problématique, dans le champ de notre discipline, ne se distinguent pas radicalement de celles qui interviennent dans d'autres domaines, y compris en littérature. Certes, le traitement de ces difficultés mobilise à de nombreux égards des compétences qui ne sont habituellement pas l'apanage de l'historien de la pensée économique, mais il requiert aussi des capacités analytiques que ce dernier a coutume de reconnaître comme les siennes propres. Il demeure que l'activité editoriale est une pratique savante à laquelle l'historien de la pensée économique n'accorde ordinairement que peu d'attention. Pourtant, puisque la littérature primaire dont s'alimente notre discipline est ici en jeu, l'affirmation institutionnelle et la diffusion de celle-ci dépendent d'une telle pratique. Like any other scientific editor, the economist who intends to spread the writings of his predecessors is faced with constant problems, beyond the question of who he will publish: what he should publish and how he should publish it. In the field of our discipline, the difficulties raised by these questions are not radically different from those which occur in other disciplines, including literature. Of course, in many respects dealing with these difficulties implies skills which are not usually the prerogative of the historian of economic thought. Nevertheless it also requires analytical abilities that the latter is in the habit of regarding as being his own. The fact remains that editing is a scholarly practice to which the historian of economic thought usually pays little attention. However, since the primary source materials that continue to be the foundation for research in our academic discipline are here at stake, its institutional recognition and spread dep~<br>

Abstract: Aristote accorde une importance telle à la prudence qu'elle est le véritable lien de la politique et de l'éthique à travers toute sa philosophie de l'action. Pourtant, et à cause de cette importance, il ne peut guère la définir. Il ne la cerne pas par approximation comme une vertu morale ni par classification comme un régime politique. La prudence est la vertu intellectuelle, le concept imposé par le fait que la politique et l'éthique ne sont jamais entièrement liées et jamais entièrement déliées. La prudence machiavélienne radicalise cet enseignement; elle ne le rompt pas : là où la prudence aristotélicienne indique que politique et éthique ne peuvent être très séparées, l'habileté machiavélienne indique qu'elles ne peuvent être très liées. Ce n'est qu'avec Hobbes qu'on est en présence de la construction systématique d'une théorie dans laquelle la politique l'emporte entièrement sur l'éthique. Kant renverse cette priorité au seul profit de l'éthique. La recherche aristotélicienne fait finalement figure de moins mauvaise solution. Elle sort l'éthique du purisme et la politique de la pure force. En tout cas, sans référence à une relation entre la politique et l'éthique, la recherche de la prudence est peu probable. La croyance récente en la toute-puissance de l'histoire l'a montré. The importance which Aristotle sets on prudence makes it the real link between politics and ethics throughout his whole philosophy of action. Nevertheless, and because of this importance, he cannot define it. He does not approach it through approximation, as a moral virtue, nor by classification, as a political regime. Prudence is the intellectual virtue, the concept imposed by the fact that politics and ethics are never either entirely linked or entirely separate. Machiavellian prudence radicalizes this teaching, but does not upset it : whereas Aristotelian prudence indicates that politics and ethics cannot be widely separate, Machiavellian cunning indicates that they cannot be very close~<br>

Abstract: Le sentiment identitaire est souvent considéré comme l'un des critères essentiels permettant d'apprécier les liens que les jeunes issus de l'immigration entretiennent avec la France et le pays de leurs parents. À partir de résultats d'études quantitatives et d'une enquête de terrain auprès de jeunes étrangers nés en France, cet article se propose de montrer que les déclarations en matière de sentiment identitaire constituent un indicateur inadéquat pour appréhender ce lien. Cet indicateur est en effet non seulement réducteur, les liens tissés avec un pays ne pouvant être cernés par quelques questions simples sur le sentiment d'identité, mais aussi inconsistant. Le sentiment identitaire est en effet faiblement investi et variable suivant les situations. Dès lors, les réponses obtenues n'ont pas grande signification. A sense of identity is often considered one of the defining aspects of immigrant children's ties to France and to their parents' native country. Based on the results of quantitative studies and a field survey of immigrant children born in France, this article endeavours to show that declarations of a sense of ethnic identity are in fact an inadequate indicator of their national ties. Indeed, not only is this indicator reductionist, as their affective attachment to a country cannot be assessed by means of a few simple questions about their feelings of identity, but it also proves inconsistent. The sense of identity turns out to be tenuous and variable according to the respondent's situation. Consequently, the responses to such questions are of no great significance.<br>

Abstract: O plural e conflituoso entendimento da legitimação da pena no Direito, tem origem nas diversas intencionalidades que lhe conferem sentido. Neste artigo são analisadas as intencionalidades mais relevantes, destacando os seus modelos justificativos: retribuição, reparação, prevenção, expiação, reabilitação e restauração (precedidas pela vingança, extrajudiríca). Para melhor análise destes são também consideradas a variável da temporalidade (passado, presente, futuro) e a variável dos sujeitos, que protagonizam a dinâmica do castigo (infractor, víctima, Estado, sociedade). Depois, num momento comparativo, destacam-se criticamente as confluencias e as oposições. Assim será possível concluir que a intencionalidade restauradora e a sua firme relativização do castigo é aquela que melhor consegue articular as variáveis de sentido-com os seus valores-, a temporalidade e os sujeitos, pelo que se mostra ser a referência mais positiva para a legitimização. Contudo, dada a sua precaridade, devido ao seu surgimento recente, impõe-se reforçá-la reflexivamente e prácticamente. The plural and conflictual understanding of the legitimacy of penalty in law stems from diverse intentionalities that constitute their respective meanings. This article analyzes the most relevant intentionalities. It seeks to highlight the models that justifies them: retribution, reparation, prevention, atonement, rehabilitation and restoration (preceded by vengeance, extrajudirical). To better analyze these models, the variable of temporality (past, present, future) and the variable of the subjects are also considered in view of the fact that they operate in the dynamics of punishment (offender, victim, State, society). Then, establishing comparisons, the confluences and oppositions are critically highlighted. In order to conclude that the restorative intentionality and its strong relativization of punishment is the one who can best articulate the variables of meaning -with their values, involving temporalit~<br>

Abstract: The text aims at considering from various points of view the presence of the value of truth in the work of art. The first step is a phenomenological analysis of epistemológical, ontological and aesthetic phenomena connected with perception of the work of art. Its conclusion is the statement that truth belongs to the characteristics of both creation (contents, structure) and reception (cognition of various aspects) of the work. The very fact that the aesthetic value of the object claiming to be beautiful can be discussed proves the presence of the object on the rational-veritable plane. The next aspect undertaken in the article is concerned with the epistemological and methodological criticism of the view (represented here by R. Ingarden) that there is a radical difference between the objective domains of science and art. An attempt is made to show that the view is rooted rather in ideologically understood scientism and neo-positivism than in a realistic conception of cognition through art. In a completely realistic attitude the borderline between 'what is rationally cognised' and 'what is beautiful' (the sphere of quasi in Ingarden's meaning) is not an absolute borderline. The domain of the work of art also contains cognitive elements, often existentially and morally essential for man's life. As it appears, a similar position can be found in G. B. Vico's texts that proclaim the unity of poetic and metaphysical perspective in ancient beginnings of anthropological thought about the human world. Nowadays a methodological tendency is observed on the philosophical plane that allows joining the veritable and aesthetic aspects, and hence exploring the objective domain of art in the cognitive aspect. This is expressed today, among others, in the increase of the significance of art in social, cultural and scientific life.<br>

Abstract: Examining the coverage in seven major Japanese and Taiwanese daily newspapers of a selection of events involving both societies in the first decade of the twenty-first century, this paper investigates the phenomenon of rhetorical instrumentalization of the past for present ideological purposes. The concerns of this study are the processes of dehistorization in Japanese and Taiwanese news and public debate, and through a critical thematic reading of the sources I argue that a motif of Taiwanese repetition and imitation of Japan runs through all the studied cases as a basic narrative formula. Analyzed cases include news presentations of Taiwanese politicians visiting Japan, controversial statements on Taiwan by a Japanese cabinet minister, infrastructure developments in present-day Taiwan and the controversy surrounding a Japanese guidebook to Taiwanese prostitution. Throughout the material, Taiwan is pictured as ideally progressing along a trajectory marked out by Japan and the two are cast in fixed roles that recall their relative positions in the half-century of Japanese colonization of Taiwan: Japan teaches Taiwan order, unity and modern development and Taiwan studies Japan's past to overcome the challenges of its own present. Or Taiwan spontaneously imitates Japanese precedence as a consequence of its own development. This paper fundamentally challenges the rationale underlying strategic instrumentalization of the past and draws critical attention to the paradoxical fact that the use of the repetition formula positions the covered news events in a thematic field of time-lag and retrospection.<br>

Abstract: La 'démonstration' présentée dans Rhet. Her. 4,68 est le point de départ pour une étude qui vise à souligner comme traits qui lui sont propres la complémentarité de ενάργεια et de ενέργεια. À ce propos on prend en considération l'une après l'autre ces deux notions et les textes des auteurs anciens où l'on peut mieux comprendre leur nature et leur fonction à l'intérieur d'un discours. Après avoir mentionné les définitions de Γένάργεια données par l'Anonyme de Seguière et par Denys d'Halicarnasse et après avoir souligné la différence entre ενάργεια et σαφήνεια on s'attache à examiner quelles sont les conditions qui permettent au locuteur de 'mettre sous les yeux' des auditeurs ce qu'il dit. À l'importance des détails mentionnée par les différents auteurs s'ajoute en fait l'effet suggestif de ce que les Grecs appelaient φαντασίαι et les Latins visiones. On se penche donc sur les textes de Quintilien et de l'auteur du Sublime qui en traitent longuement et on met en relief le rôle joué à ce propos par Γένέργεία des faits, c'est-à-dire par leur façon d'être 'en acte'. Une fois cette notion éclaircie à l'aide de la Métaphysique et de la Rhétorique d'Aristote on conclut cette brève recherche par la mention du niveau le plus haut que l'évidence rhétorique peut atteindre : l'effet émotionnel du couple ενέργεια - ενάργεια qui pousse les auditeurs à se voir, eux-mêmes, sur la scène. The "demonstration" presented in Rhet. Her. 4,68, is the starting point of a study which aims at underscoring as specific features of the demonstration the complementarity of enargeia and energeia. In order to suit our purpose, we have examined one after the other those two notions and the texts of ancient writers in which we can better apprehend their nature and function within a discourse. After mentioning the definitions of enargeia given by the Anonym of Seguière and Denys of Helicarnassus, and after having underscored the difference between enargeia and energeia. we go on to examine the conditi~<br>

Abstract: C'est d'abord s'étonner de la place qu'occupe dans l'œuvre novatrice de Freud la culture antique. Retracer l'itinéraire de la rencontre avec Œdipe, c'est faire comme un état des lieux. L'Interprétation des Rêves, Totem et Tabou, L'Homme Moïse et la religion monothéiste, mais aussi des articles moins connus, des extraits de sa correspondance, contiennent des analyses inattendues, sur l'origine de la tragédie grecque, son évolution, sa fonction, sur la catharsis, le plaisir tragique, etc... Le but n'est pas d'apprécier la pertinence des réponses, mais de dégager l'originalité d'une démarche qui lie fiction et réalité, structure et histoire, passé et présent. And our first response will be to marvel at the importance of the culture of antiquity in Freud’s innovating work. Tracing up the stages of his encounter with Œdipus is tantamount to an inventory of fixtures. The Interpretation of Dreams, Totem and Taboo, The Man Moses and monotheistic religion, but also less known articles and extracts from his correspondence contain unexpected analyses on the origin of Greek tragedy, its evolution, its function, on catharsis, tragic pleasure, etc. Our aim is not to assess the relevance of the answers but to bring out the originality of a procedure that links up fiction and fact, structure and history, past and present<br>

Abstract: L'article distingue trois périodes, dans le XXe siecle théologique français: 1893-1943 où l'on est préoccupé de la crise moderniste; 1945-1965 où toutes sortes de renouveaux preparent Vatican II; de 1965 à nos jours, où se fait la réception du Concile en même temps qu'apparaissent de nouveaux défis. Après avoir ajouté aux noms des théologiens les plus connus quelques autres qui méritent attention, il decrit ce qui permet de dire qu'il n'y a pas seulement au XXe siècle des théologiens français, mais une théologie frangaise, essentiellement soucieuse du rapport entre foi et culture. This paper distinguishes three periods of French theology in the Twentieth Century: 1893-1943, when the major concern is the crisis of Modernism; 1945-1965, when a variety of reforms are preparing for Vatican II; and from 1965 till the present day, as the reception of the Council meets new challenges. After supplementing the names of the best-known theologians with some others who deserve attention, the paper proposes that in the Twentieth Century, there are not only French theologians, but in fact a French theology, that is deeply concerned with the relationship between faith and culture.<br>

Abstract: On semble considérer d'ordinaire que, dans les Travaux et les jours d'Hésiode, les deux grands mythes successifs de Prométhée et des races sont deux vieux mythes de même nature. On peut montrer pourtant que le mythe des races est en fait une sorte de révision critique du mythe de Prométhée, tout comme, dans la Bible, le premier récit de la Genèse doit être situé par rapport au deuxième, plus archaïque. Cette démarche comparative permet de voir dans le caractère créatif et critique de la pensée mythique une donnée anthropologique assez générale, longtemps minimisée par les approches structuralistes. The two great successive myths in Hesiod's Works and Days — the myth of Prometheus and the myth of Ages — are usually seen as two old myths of the same nature. However, it is possible to show that the myth of Ages is actually a kind of critical reassessment of the myth of Prometheus, just as in the Bible, the first narrative of Genesis must be placed in relation to the second one, which is more archaic. Thanks to this comparative proceeding, the creative and critical nature of mythical thought will appear as a fairly general anthropological fact, long minimized by the structuralist approach.<br>

Abstract: One of the acute problems of the early church was the tension between the absolute promise of Jesus and the fact that worthy prayers were not answered. Two types of solution developed. The more popular, drawing on Jewish precedent in the Old Testament, took the easy option, and blamed the petitioner for various forms of inadequacy. The other recognized the incarnational character of grace, and thus saw Christians as the hands and ears of God. When they listened to the needs of others and responded God heard and acted. Un des problèmes brûlants qui préoccupaient l'Église primitive était l'extrême tension entre la promesse absolue de Jésus et le fait que des prières apparemment dignes d'être exaucées restaient sans réponse. Deux types de solution se développèrent. L'explication la plus populaire, qui s'inspirait d'un précédent juif attesté dans l'Ancien Testament, choisit la solution facile : c'est l'orant qu'il fallait blâmer : sa prière avait été insuffisante. L'autre solution reconnaissait le caractère incarné de la grâce : les chrétiens étaient les mains et les oreilles de Dieu. Quand ils étaient attentifs aux besoins des autres et y répondaient, Dieu les écoutait et agissait.<br>

Abstract: Où situer le danger ? Qui court un risque et qui le fait courir à qui ? Il s'agit de présenter deux analyses inverses de la notion de danger. Leur originalité tient au fait qu'il ne semble pas y avoir pour elles d'équité ou de réciprocité dans le danger: la menace vient exclusivement d'un côté de la relation. Pour Hegel, c'est le moi qui est l'objet de menaces. L'auteur de ces menaces est toujours l'autre, celui que je ne suis pas, et c'est précisément son altérité qui en fait une puissance dont je peux craindre la violence. C'est pourquoi la vérité – et la sécurité – se trouve toujours du côté de la réduction de la transcendance de l'autre. Pour cette raison, Levinas affirme qu'il n'y a pas d'autre dans la philosophie de Hegel, absence qu'il analyse justement comme un danger: c'est l'autre qui court un risque, et la menace vient de moi. La menace n'émane plus de l'étrangeté de l'autre, mais au contraire de la suppression de cette étrangeté. Ce qu'il est à craindre est, pour Hegel, que l'autre mette la main sur moi, et, pour Levinas, que je mette la main sur l'autre. Where is the danger? Who is at risk and who is a menace to whom? This article presents two opposite analyses of the notion of danger. Their originality lies in the fact that there seems to be no fairness or reciprocity in danger: the threat comes exclusively from one side of the relationship. For Hegel, oneself is always the object of threats. The source of these threats is always the other person, the one I am not, and it is precisely the other's alterity which is a force whose violence I should fear. That is why truth - and security – are always to be found in reducing the transcendence of the other. For this reason, Levinas claims that there is not an other in the philosophy of Hegel, an absence which he analyses as a danger; it's the other who is at risk, and the threat comes from me. The threat no longer emanates from the strangeness of the other, but, on the contrary, from the suppression of this ~<br>

Abstract: Les mathématiques, auxquelles on peut joindre la logique, et depuis 1960 une large part de l'informatique théorique, fournissent un témoignage sur une part essentielle du fonctionnement de l'esprit humain. Loin de fournir seulement des outils extérieurs, elles se sont faites mode de pensée nécessaire pour appréhender la réalité physique. Elles nous ont appris que ce que nous nommons raison, démarche rationnelle, est en réalité laborieusement construit. Un bref survol de l'histoire des mathématiques, anciennes, puis surtout depuis le XIXe s., montre en quel sens le concept ancien de « vérité scientifique » s'en trouve désormais modifié. Mathematics, to which one may add logic and, since 1960, a large section of theoretical computer technique, all furnish evidence concerning an essential part of the working of the human mind. Far from providing only external tools, they have evolved as a necessary mode of thought for the understanding of physical reality. They have taught us that what we call reason, or rational deduction, is in fact something we have ourselves laboriously constructed. A brief survey of the history of mathematics, ancient and modern but especially from and after the 19th century, shows ways in which the old concept of a 'scientific truth' must henceforth be modified.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur se propose de vérifier l'affirmation de Lavelle selon laquelle l'ouvrage de 1937, De l'Acte, se serait progressivement développé comme une synthèse complète de sa philosophie. Or il existe, à l'état dactylographié, une version antérieure de ce livre, qui permet de comprendre combien l'aisance presque trop grande des analyses de 1937 cache en fait une élaboration lente et un effort continu. La version inédite insiste sur l'intemporalité transcendantale de l'acte, et sur l'impersonnalité de l'acte fondateur de toutes les existences personnelles. Ces thèses seront abandonnées en 1937. On analyse ensuite l'article « Être et Acte » et la conférence de la société française de philosophie sur « Acte créateur et acte réflexif », où est discutée la position de Jean Nabert. Les thèses de De l'Acte montrent une progression de l'identité de l'être et de l'acte (dans l'acte d'être) jusqu'à l'acte en sa forme la plus haute, l'acte d'amour. Situer cette œuvre capitale implique qu'on ait bien compris l'interprétation du sensible comme de la donnée matérielle qui doit être spiritualisée. L'expérience extérieure du sensible s'oppose à l'expérience intérieure de l'esprit. Et l'acte est l'œuvre de l'être spirituel. L'ontologie dynamique de Lavelle est une affirmation de la liberté humaine comme participation à l'acte créateur divin. Divin ou humain, l'être est subjectif parce que libre. Ainsi Lavelle s'inscrit dans la tradition platonicienne moderne, celle d'Avicenne d'abord, celle de Hegel ensuite. The author proposes to verify Lavelle's assertion that the 1937 work, De l'Acte, would be progressively developed as a complete synthesis of his philosophy. Now there exists in typewritten state an earlier version of this book, which allows us to see the extent to which the almost excessive facility of analyses of 1937 in fact conceals a slow development and a continuous effort. The unedited version insists upon the transcendental atemporality of act, and upon the impersonality of ~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i405284<br>
Date: 10 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): On-Cho Ng Sheldon<br>
Abstract: Textures of Time is a rich and challenging book that raises a host of important and hard questions about historical narrative, form, and style; the sociology of texts; and the core problem of ascertaining historical truth. Two that pertain to the book's main claims are of special interest to nonspecialist readers: Is register or style - "texture" - necessarily and everywhere diagnostic of "history"? Does a new kind of "historical consciousness" emerge in south India beginning in the sixteenth century, indeed as a sign of an Indian early modernity? Textures is not the first book to argue that historical discourse is constitutively marked by a peculiar style, but the claim is beset by difficulties that scholars since Barthes have detailed. Rather than textures of time - accounts of what really happened in history-what these works offer us may be only pretextures of time, textualized forms of a human experience that make claims about its degrees and types of truth through representations of various states of temporality. Instead of assessing, then, whether these works are history or something else like "myth," we might ask whether they invite us to transcend this very dichotomy, to try, that is, to make sense of historical forms of consciousness rather than to identify forms of historical consciousness. As for modernity, nothing in south Indian historiography from 1500-1800 remotely compares to the conceptual revolution of Europe. But why should we expect the newness of the early modern world to have been experienced the same way everywhere? Modernity across Asia may have shown simultaneity without symmetry. Should this asymmetry turn out to reveal continuity and not rupture, however, no need to lament the fact. There is no shame in premodernity.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219705<br>
Date: 1 1, 1972<br>
Author(s): Sittler Roy<br>
Abstract: Starting with Raglan's suggestion that Falstaff may be a "holy fool" and with Auden's belief that he is a comic symbol of charity, this essay explores the medieval tradition of wise fool, and especially Falstaff's always canny use of biblical allusion. His various jests, if read in relation to the political action of the main plot, reveal him as characterizing England's time of day and parodying the unchristian behavior of Hotspur, Henry, and Hal. By the time he dies mumbling Psalm xxiii to an uncomprehending Nell Quickly, there have accumulated many hints that he is, in fact, a candle to his age, a professional Fool with the heart of a faithful Lazarus, and destined to join Mowbray in Abraham's bosom. The merriment for which readers have found him lovable amid his masquerades of vice has its mysterious basis in his covertly Christian understanding of England's neo-Roman Caesars.<br>

Date: 12 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): NeutresAbstract: En adaptant Le Parrain, le best-seller de Mario Puzo, Francis Ford Coppola est confronté à plusieurs récits-I'histoire de la Mafia américaine, son imagerie mythique, I'interrogation identitaire italo-américaine-, auxquels il mêle des souvenirs personnels et l'héritage culturel légué par sa communauté. Dépassant la simple commande commerciale, il réussit à établir à l'écran, via la fiction, sa part de vérité. Le premier film sera complété par deux suites. Le temps de constitution de cette trilogie, près de vingt ans, renvoie à deux autres durées exceptionnellement longues: la durée du métrage final des trois films (près de neufheures) et celle de la période décrite (quatre-vingt ans de l'histoire des États-Unis). Brisant la linéarité classique, la trilogie du Parrain souligne la pertinence de l'outil cinématographique dans la construction d'un récit aux temporalités multiples. Ces temporalités concernent aussi bien le spectateur que le cinéaste lui-même, comme nous l'indique l'édition DVD, outil précieux pour une analyse historienne. Face à ses propres images, Coppola transforme la «revision» en travail de mémoire: manière supplémentaire de surmonter l'apparent paradoxe entre le film hollywoodien et le récit intime. /// Whilst adapting The Godfather, Mario Puzo's bestselling novel, Francis Ford Coppola was faced with several stories-the history of the American Mafia, the mythical image associated with it, the questioning of Italian-American identity-which he managed to combine with his own life experiences and the cultural legacy inherited from his own community. Going beyond a simple commissioned film, he succeeds in transposing onto screen, through fiction, his very own truth. This first installment was complemented by two sequels. The twenty-year time-frame within which this trilogy was made is echoed by two other remarkably long periods: the full running-time of the three films when viewed consecutively (close to nine hours) and the historical period within which~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i412377<br>
Date: 6 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): Zehfuss Vincent<br>
Abstract: This article outlines a "sobjectivist" methodology that is specifically geared toward the constructivist style of reasoning. The main argument is that constructivist inquiries need to develop not only objectified (or experience-distant) but also subjective (experience-near) knowledge about social and international life. This requirement derives from the fact that constructivism is a postfoundationalist style of reasoning which emphasizes the mutually constitutive dialectics between the social construction of knowledge and the contruction of social reality. By implication, a constructivist methodology should be inductive, interpretive, and historical. The methodical practice of sobjectivism follows a three-step logic from the recovery of subjective meanings to their objectification thanks to contextualization and historicization. A brief discussion of the security-community research program illustrates what sobjectivism looks like in practice. Overall, not only does the development of a consistent methodology systematize the practice of constructivist research, it also fosters engagement and dialog with other international relations approaches. By clarifying where constructivism falls on issues of validity, falsifiability, and generalizability, this article intends to enhance mutual legibility among competing methodologies.<br>

Date: 10 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Williams Wai Chee<br>
Abstract: Does a literary text remain the same object across time? This essay answers no and bases a defense of literature on that answer. Temporal extension, a phenomenon neglected in contemporary literary studies, makes some meanings unrecoverable and others newly possible. A text endures as a nonintegral survivor, an echo of what it was and of what it might become, its resonance changing with shifts in interpretive contexts. Since this resonance cannot be addressed by synchronic historicism, I propose an alternative, diachronic historicism, inspired especially by scientific theories on background noise, by Einstein's account of the relativity of simultaneity, and by critiques of the visual bias in Western epistemology. I try to theorize the text as a temporal continuum, thick with receding and incipient nuances, exercising the ears of readers in divergent ways and yielding its words to contrary claims. Literature thus encourages a semantic democracy that honors disagreement as a crucial fact of civil society.<br>

Through an extended investigation of a stranger's arrival, I untangle processes of recognition from those guiding the determination of relatedness. Recognition establishes the continuity of experience; as such, verity is a measure of the adequacy as opposed to accuracy of observation: a fact that contributes to the possibility of misrecognition. By contrast, relatedness is contingent upon the expression and suppression of different, sometimes contradictory historical ties. [kinship, knowledge, pragmatism, Maneo, Indonesia]<br>

Abstract: An ethnographic study of a shelter in downtown Boston for people considered homeless and mentally ill documents the way in which the category of "experience," which many have taken to be universal and natural, is culturally and historically constituted. The residents of the shelter tend not to experience - defined here as an inwardly reflexive process that proceeds, coheres, and transforms through temporally integrative forms - but rather "struggle along" by way of an acutely tactile mode of perception that attends to episodic, temporally finite encounters. The fact that experience in the shelter is only a possibility, not a given, points to the need for a critical phenomenology that would help us to consider how this and other ways of being come about through specific social, cultural, political, and material forces.<br>

Abstract: Van Roermund also rejects MacCormick's distinction between normative and
narrative coherence, an sees narrative coherence as the very principle of the relation
between facts and norms (case and decision), thereby relying on philosophical argu-
ments. Two citations are too nice to be left unquoted. 'Facts are, as Strawson put it
(1964), what statements, when true, state; they are not what statements are about...
i.e., they are not things or states or events, but the objectifiable contents of state-
ments'. 'This definition of"a fact" resembles...Goodman's famous phrase: "Facts are
little theories; and true theories are big facts"' (1988, at 160)

The symbolic parallel between the present moment and the decisive battle that occurred more than half a millennium before was strengthened even more by the fact that the patriarch’s name was Sergius, the same as the famous Russian saint who blessed Dmitry Donskoi before the battle of Kulikovo. All this gave the Church a more prominent role in the victory over the Germans and perhaps also made Donskoi a more desirable alternative to Nevsky in the 1990s.<br>

Abstract: There is quite a lot more to say, in fact. As we've seen, cultural cannibalism is a practice that is deeply embedded in and responsive to problems of power. It is crucial to situate discourses of authenticity and mimesis within history to uncover the ways in which poets have worked around and against those discourses. The question of contemporary experimental poetry's response to the abundance and waste of late capitalism, and how the cannibal figures within it, bears further exploration. Twentieth- and twenty-first-century readers must stay attuned to the omnipresence of cultural mastication, as De Campos calls it:
      
               The “new barbarians” are still at it: Consume, produce, repeat.The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: There is much to admire in
      Against World Literature, but I often found myself wishing that Apter had developed her arguments further by opening out more beyond her own cultural and theoretical comfort zone. Throughout her book, “World Literature” is taken to be a unified entity, practiced largely in translation by American academics; no mention is made of the ambitious publication projects undertaken in Japan over the course of the past century, in China since the end of the Cultural Revolution, or in countries as varied as Estonia, Poland, Portugal, and South Korea in more recent years. Within English-language scholarship, Apter rarely discusses work published in the past decade, even though scholars of world literature increasingly focus on complexities of translation and on the cultural politics of transmission and reception. No mention is made, for instance, of Mads Rosendahl Thomsen'sMapping World Literature(Bloomsbury, 2008), Ursula Heise'sSense of Place and Sense of Planet: The Environmental Imagination of the Global(Oxford, 2008), Djelal Kadir'sMemos from the Besieged City: Lifelines for Cultural Sustainability(Stanford, 2010), or Jacob Edmond'sA Common Strangeness: Contemporary Poetry, Cross-cultural Encounter, Comparative Literature(Fordham, 2012). A treatment of untranslatability from a broad temporal and cultural perspective can be found in Ronit Ricci's remarkable bookIslam Translated(Chicago, 2011), which opens with a chapter on “‘Translation’ and its Untranslatability,” exploring the implications of the fact that the very term “translation” has no direct translation in Arabic, Tamil, and Javanese, the languages at the heart of her study.<br>

Abstract: These later motifs associated with “white” effectively trigger the reader's earlier reminiscences of the glorious, promising, and innocent past such as the snow in Nick's story about his youth: “When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us” (175). Another example is the description of Daisy, who is “gleaming like silver” on her veranda, “bright with the bought luxury of star-shine” (149). Likewise, the meaning of the color yellow is transformed, most obviously through Gatsby's yellow car that first transports guests to and from his dazzling parties, but in the end turns into the death car Daisy uses when she kills Myrtle (Westbrook 81). In fact, the first description of the car does not refer to it as yellow but as a “rich cream color” while it later becomes an autumnal, murky, and mundane yellow (64).<br>

Abstract: The picture painted is that of a guest asking for accommodation. But we learn that the speaker is a child, and therefore his plea is existential; he wants to live and to thrive. The speaker's clan is representative of the larger world. He pleads with the world for a chance to grow. “I am not Dekuah; let me live” (9). “I am not Dekuah” appears five times in the seven stanzas of the poem, underscoring the speaker's resolve to live. This anaphora draws attention to the precariousness of the situation that children, and, indeed everyone else, was facing at that time. People were making peace with the fact that children were not surviving childhood. As child soldiers, even some of the children had turned against their parents. It is in this context that the speaker announced that he is not Dekuah.<br>

Abstract: There have been diasporas throughout human histories. The term itself received its classical definition as a description of the removal of the Hebrew from Israel to Babylon in 587 BCE. The modern period is characterized by the intensity, number, and impact of the meaning and nature of diasporic formations. As a matter of fact, one might look upon modern Europe as a diasporic culture. I have already alluded to the dispersal of the Jews from Spain in the symbolic inaugural date of the beginning of modernity in 1492. Subsequently, European cultures established several diasporic communities throughout the world. The major ones were English-settler populations in East and South Africa and in North America and military-colonial communities in India and Africa. During their rule of India, the English dispersed thousands of Indians to the Fiji Islands of the Pacific, East Africa, South Africa, and Trinidad and Tobago. While these were in fact diasporic communities, the rhetoric accompanying these movements avoided any implication or hint of diasporic meaning. Daniel Defert has noted that
         
               Most of the diasporic communities in the modern world have come about as a result of the transcultural expanse of European culture. The kind of vulnerabilities and resources present in transcultural situations were not admitted to or expressed by the Europeans. Thus, transculturation involved for them, as Defert put it, “a collection of the world,” and in the language of Gaster, the evacuation of meaning from other cultures, or emptying, for the sake of European hegemony, or filling. Africa as a continent and Europe as a geo-ideological construct have had a special relationship over the last millennia, the intensity of this relationship intensifying over the last five hundred years. On the whole, diasporic cultures and religions have never chosen the binary option for any length of time. The binary as defining completely separate worlds has been the position of the ~<br>

Abstract: And so it began, at least for me. At the second Yale meeting, in 1968, Edie and Schrader pressed me into service as “secretary”—I believe that was the title then—and I started planning the next meeting. Such was my success that after assembling a tentative program and sending it around, Bert Dreyfus called in the middle of the night from the West Coast to tell me he wouldn't cross the street, much less the country, to attend such a boring meeting. Help arrived, for both me and SPEP, in the form of a postdoc in Europe, which allowed me to dump the planning of the 1969 meeting back in Jim Edie's lap. This may have had something to do with the fact that SPEP decided it needed two secretaries rather than one, and that's how I got teamed up with Ed Casey, starting the tandem arrangement that remains, with upgraded titles, of course, in place today.<br>

Abstract: In relation to these frustrating circumstances, however, I benefited in still another way from the early SPEP meetings. Had I been simply caught between my friends and teachers at Illinois and Northwestern, on the one hand, and the larger hostile culture of the philosophical mainstream, on the other, I might well have chosen a career of either speaking mostly to my own kind or becoming a professional critic. But in the diversity of those early meetings, I also found that it was hard to define just what “my own kind” was supposed to be. For me, an important fact about our theoretically underorganized little band is that we ourselves sometimes seemed only marginally better than the tradition at putting our passions into proper words. The difference, of course, is that many of us knew this. The fact that we continued to compromise our own efforts to be phenomenological simply encouraged us to be more phenomenological.<br>

Abstract: Is philosophy, perhaps all philosophy, ultimately founded on the absolute certainty of death, that we are all, in one way or another, sentenced to death? Derrida demonstrates philosophy's bind to death and the death penality. Yet, in his last seminar, while powerfully calling into question the meaning of death and who can die, Derrida also appeals to the fact that every living being dies as perhaps the ultimate ethical bind. Has death, then, as the absolute and only equalizer, replaced the absolute authority of God, whether Kant's rational one or Levinas's Other one? The death penalty as executed in this country makes clear that both ethics and politics demand that we think through our own death drive rather than bank on the fantasy of equality through death, the fantasy of instant death, or the fantasy of death as the final and absolute resting place. To do so covers over the differences between deaths and death penalties—to be blunt, between so many ways of dying and so many ways of being executed, assassinated, or killed.<br>

Abstract: But consider the referents when I say, “Come here, I want to show you a gorilla,” “Come here, I want to show you a human being,” “Here look at this beautiful woman,” “Look at this hunk of a man,” and so forth, all of which feature properties. Now consider a quite different display: “Come here, I want to show you a person.” What are we here looking for? How does it differ from an individual human being? Granted that we in fact use
            personas synonymous withhuman being, are we here merely displaying an individual human being or instance of the kind called “human”? Consider the resistance in saying, “Come here, I want to show you a Barak Obama.” We might, of course, have in mind a political style or character and thus refer to a constellation of properties. But we would not be referring to the person, Barak Obama, certainly not to what he refers to when he says “I,” but, for example, to a type, a certain sort of politician.

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: 1976. Heidegger's death: he joins the mighty dead and remains today as “Heidegger's ghost.” Often cited as the founder of philosophy of technology, he remains almost the only figure of a cadre of European philosophers of the early twentieth century still discussed concerning technology. I use his death date as the watershed between the “Old” and “New” technologies. Heidegger divided his technologies in various ways, most often by contrasting old, largely handcraft technologies to “Modern” or industrial technologies. Stone bridges, jugs, peasant shoes, Greek temples, and his famous hammer stand out for the first; Rhine River dams, steel bridges, the atom bomb, death chambers, and modern agriculture are examples of the modern. Modern technologies are mass-produced, gigantic, and largely mechanical—in short, “industrial” of the sort so familiar early in the twentieth century. I stick to 1976 as my watershed, in spite of the fact that most of his late work on technology was done in the mid-1950s.<br>

Abstract: This involves the rather curious presupposition that the idea of a philosophy without presuppositions is itself without presuppositions. But Marion's response takes a different direction. As he sees it, “It is an essential of phenomenology that the
            a posteriorimakes it possible and therefore that no forbiddena prioripredetermines it…. ‘It is forbidden to forbid!’ … That which shows itself justifies itself by this fact alone.”
                  One cannot forbid religious subject matter to phenomenology. But in what sense does the latter justify the former? Not as independently and objectively real. It is a matter of possibility, not actuality. Thus, for example,32
               
                  Marion does speak at times as a theologian. But given this clear criterion, it is easy enough to distinguish his theology from his phenomenology and, indeed, easy enough to read his theology (or Levinas's) as if it were phenomenology.the phenomenon of revelation remains a mere possibility. I am going to describe it without presupposing its actuality…. [I]f an actual revelation must, can, or could have been given in phenomenal apparition, it could have, can, or will be able to do so only by giving itself according to the type of the paradox par excellence—such as I will describe it. Phenomenology cannot decide if a revelation can or should ever give itself…. I am obliged
               here—in phenomenology, where possibility remains the norm and not actuality—only to describe it in its pure possibility and in the reduced immanence of givenness. I do notherehave to judge its actual manifestation or ontic status, which remain the business proper to revealed theology.

Abstract: There are two results of this discussion to which I want to draw specific attention. First, this article suggests that commentators on Janicaud's minimal phenomenology, though few, have largely misunderstood the significance of this development. They have taken it to diminish the prestige of phenomenology, to the point of turning it into a trivial enterprise that describes banal phenomena.
         
               This can be traced back to the fact that they set up the issue in terms of a contrast between an ambitious maximal phenomenology that tests the limits of the visible and a minimal phenomenology that roots itself firmly within its boundaries. But Janicaud himself already dispels that contrast: his call for a minimal phenomenology does not advocate for a less ambitious or more restrained vision of phenomenology, as if its motto were to “keep costs down, do as little as possible, take no risks.”27
            
               The alternative is not, as commentators have suggested, between either a phenomenology of the invisible or a phenomenology of the visible; instead it concerns two different possible approaches to a phenomenology of the invisible: one that pushes the limits of the visible through a maximal threshold of excess (Marion, Levinas, Henry) and another that pursues those limits through a minimal threshold of sense (Merleau-Ponty, Deleuze). That is the choice that Janicaud bequeaths to phenomenology today.28<br>

Abstract: Current theorists, as we have seen, are eager to highlight the fact that hyperbole poses an impossible exaggeration, but they do not specifically elucidate how hyperbolic impossibility drives one toward other perspectival possibilities or how it destabilizes the very impossibility/possibility binary thinking it engages. Yet in the current context of postmodern and poststructuralist thought with its predisposition for deconstructive criticism and its inclination to abandon moderation and aesthetic proportionality, this is an important function of hyperbole that should not be overlooked. Thus, the topos of impossibility and possibility is one that needs explicit development if a theoretical framework through which a hyperbolic perspective might be employed in critical analysis is to be established.<br>

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: In an 1896 review, for instance, he explicitly parallels doctors and actors in their professional practice, beginning by characterizing the former in his usual terms: “The average doctor is a walking compound of natural ignorance and acquired witchcraft, who kills your favorite child, wrecks your wife's health, and orders you into habits of nervous dram-drinking before you have the courage to send him about his business.”
      
            After similarly chastising attorneys, boot makers, and tailors, Shaw asserts that, while we “imagine that these people have professions,” we discover that “what they have is only, in the correct old word, their ‘mystery’—a humbug, like all mysteries. And yet, how we help to keep up the humbug! … Men believe in the professions as they believe in ghosts, because they want to believe in them” (423–24, 425). For Shaw, human beings had redirected their desire for faith in idols and priests toward doctors and marketing men. The commercial theater had also fed upon this need, and even the critic himself is susceptible to their hypnotic prowess. Calling himself the “most ridiculous of all dupes,” Shaw confesses in the review his mistaking of the actor as a skilled craftsman, a “civilizing agent [and] spiritual doctor,” when in fact “it is all a delusion: there is no profession, no art, no skill about the business at all” (425). Just as those who are exploited by the medical industry, Shaw's “desire and hope got the better of [his] observation[, his] imagination of [his] experience” (428). The fraud perpetuated by doctors is akin to the “mystery” of theater; if doctors are ghosts, actors and managers are similar spirits who have offended. For Shaw, then, the critic's job is to “sift the gold of fact and efficiency out of the huge rubbish-heap of professionalism” (425).6<br>

Abstract: This is very different from St. Paul's conception of original sin, which holds that through the disobedience of one man eons ago we come into life hereditarily stained—requiring a Christ to die on the cross sacrificially so that every person who ever was, is, or will be can be washed clean vicariously. For Ricoeur, contrary to Christian orthodoxy, the stain is not in us
         ab initio: we soil ourselves. Evil may be everywhere, Ricoeur stipulates, but not because sin is a fixed constituent of human being. Evil shadows us because the will is inscrutably errant, but nothing demonstrates to him decisively that this must always be the case. For Ricoeur, until proven otherwise, evil remains a contingent fact of existence, not a necessary one, which carries with it the possibility that what is ruptured can be mended. It is precisely the cleft between necessity and contingency, exactly this metaphysical fissure between what immutably is and what is mutable, that opens up enough fertile soil for faith and hope to take root. Simply stated, the posited anterior goodness of creation (the immutable) anchors Ricoeur's faith in the fecundity of life, and the correlative notion of evil's putative transience (the mutable) solidifies Ricoeur's hope that the indentured will can be set free. Together, faith and hope sustain Ricoeur in the struggle to retrieve a lapsed but not lost human species. And they do the same for Shaw, in the identical way.<br>

Abstract: The recent pragmatic-contextual theory of fiction entails the possibility of changes between fact and fiction over the course of time. It is also perhaps commonplace to state that this process can be reversed—that fictional texts may cease to be fictional. The question of generic fiction-to-fact transition, however, is rarely confronted in the theory of fiction. This essay investigates the generic expectations attached to texts that make a full-scale transition from fiction to nonfiction difficult, both culturally and psychologically. “Fiction” is understood here in a limited, pragmatic sense of a work of fiction, a text known and categorized as fiction. The discussion is structured around five interrelated reasons that contribute to the difficulty: (1) the commonness of as-if structures in everyday life; (2) the generic combinations among literature, fiction, factual representation, and narrative; (3) the relative stability of the communal values and ways of checking facts that determine the categories of fiction and fact (the fact convention); (4) the popularity, in fiction, of metalepsis and the theme of transworld travel between different ontological spheres; (5) and the fictionalization of literature in the historical perspective.<br>

Abstract: Drawing upon recent ideas from the cognitive sciences, this paper is an interdisciplinary exploration of the representation of consciousness in McEwan's novel
         Enduring Love, focussing on overlapping manifestations of Theory of Mind ranging from altruism to violent pathology. Through techniques such as intertextuality, the use of paratexts, and the juxtaposition of scientific and literary discourses, McEwan constructs this novel as a Theory of Mind creating a demanding and appealing reading experience that mirrors the doubt and uncertainty of the characters as they strive to understand each others' minds. McEwan's deep interest in science and what it can and cannot tell us about human nature is a potent theme inEnduring Love. This article argues thatEnduring Loveexposes and exploits the unique potential of literary narrative to represent our intense desire to engage with other minds, both highlighting the fact that we are designed by nature to read and to misread minds, as well as the capacity of the novel to communicate the raw feel of human experience in a way that eludes scientific discourse.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: So many twentieth-century rhetorical theories can be said to have utopian aims that just a list may be enough to persuade utopian studies scholars of the theoretical and interpretive potential available to them in this thriving discipline. Any rhetorical theorist who claims that rhetoric may be the answer to avoiding physical violence or war, or that it may be the cure for ills in society that result from ideological differences, has utopian ideas about rhetoric's function. The theories of Chaim Perelman, Richard Weaver, Stephen Toulmin, Mikhail Bakhtin, Wayne Booth, Stanley Fish, and others all seem to fit into this model to a greater or lesser degree. Twentieth-century theories of rhetoric often arose from historical circumstances involving war and what the theorists saw as the abuse of rhetoric, so understanding social processes and substituting a “good rhetoric” in order to build a better society is something they see as an antidote. Rhetoric, like utopia, is inherently an ethical concern from this point of view. The fact that several of these rhetoricians have been influenced by the Marxist utopists I just discussed is evidence of cross-pollination in the two contemporary fields—or perhaps more accurately, the lack of distinct differences between them at all. Like all areas that seem to be lumped under “cultural studies,” there is so much borrowing and generalizing that it is a struggle to speak of distinct disciplines. Nevertheless, there are creative and interpretive benefits to the mix, including a wealth of terminologies from which to choose.<br>

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>

Abstract: Coming from the Latin
         decidere, “to cut off,” “by giving the victory to one side or the other” in a choice or conflict,decidecan have no truck with “both/and.” In point of fact, ethical behavior requires that the ambivalence of extreme relativism and radical subjectivity be overcome so that something like provisional certainty can arise, such as utopian imagination requires and projects. It does not matter that such certainty may be short-lived. The value of Utopia for imagining superior conditions resides in its vocation for doing so, even if time and necessity must always defeat attempts at total application: life lived will always attempt to play itself out in the loosest conformity with the prescriptions of any plan or social project (even in the face of violence).<br>

Abstract: The article focuses on the role of the “Survey on Regional Architecture in Portugal” in 1955 and its effects on contemporary Portuguese architecture. A photographic survey organizes and indexes a group of buildings with precise criteria, allowing a general panorama. In fact these built-environment, large-scale archives play an important role in heritage preservation. In the 1930s, an interesting phenomenon gathered architects who, although committed to the modern movement and enthusiasts of industrial progress, showed a growing interest in vernacular buildings and settlements. Some of these architects became photographers, attentive to a pre-industrial world that was endangered, to record timeless architecture and expose new aesthetic values. This interest generated several movements centered on an appreciation of regional architecture. Along with nostalgia, there stood out the feeling that there were still many lessons to be drawn from these threatened vernacular structures.<br>
